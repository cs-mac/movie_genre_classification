1
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,971
Six o´clock.

2
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:51,988
-Go dark.
-Copy that.

3
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>Keep it tight. No sound.</i>

4
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,656
Get down! Get down!

5
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,099
-On your knees!
-Get down!

6
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:45,621
Jamal Al Din.

7
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:47,613
Where is Jamal Al Din?

8
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,488
Get up.

9
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,630
Mama!

10
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:35,677
Mama!

11
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,311
You wanna die?

12
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,867
No sweat off my ass.

13
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,903
Jamal Al Din.

14
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,548
You´re gonna tell me.

15
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,166
-Okay?
-Stand! Stand against the wall!

16
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,058
Against the wall!

17
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:12,123
-Get your hands behind your head!
-Come on! Over here! Don´t move!

18
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,103
-Turn around.
-Right there, right there!

19
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:19,258
Jamal Al Din, or you go:

20
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,592
Good.

21
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,408
Move.

22
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,204
Hello, hombre.

23
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,682
-l´ll call you when l get there.
-Sounds good.

24
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,116
Go to your right.

25
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,323
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

26
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:42,874
Oh, really? Why don´t we get personal
with it, right?

27
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,130
This is Jack Robideaux.

28
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,275
He´s joining us
from the Homicide Division...

29
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,419
...of the New Orleans
Police Department.

30
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,016
Looks a little crazy, doesn´t he?

31
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:01,859
Hey, buddy,
what´s the rabbit´s first trick?

32
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:07,202
Grab a seat, Mr. Dolittle.

33
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:10,300
We were just going over
an action-item list from the FBl.

34
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:15,100
There´s a new breed
of smugglers and dealers...

35
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,342
...who are operating in this region.

36
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,534
The guys we´re talking about
could be former American military:

37
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:25,759
Navy SEALs, Rangers, Delta,
some of our best.

38
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,227
Those bloody mercenaries
coming back from the war...

39
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,468
...and something snaps.

40
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,190
Now they´re looking
for the biggest available paycheck.

41
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,107
And right now that paycheck
is coming from the drug lords...

42
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,189
...just across the border.

43
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,700
There´s one common link:
They´ve all served with this man.

44
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,122
Now, we don´t know his name,
but he is making his mark.

45
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:47,522
These guys aren´t thugs.

46
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,914
They´re a well-funded mercenary army
with a sizable bankroll.

47
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,051
And if this escalates...

48
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,709
...this could turn into a real war
on American soil.

49
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,401
Any questions?

50
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:03,675
Okay, that´s all.

51
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,980
Mr. Robideaux,
can you wait a second?

52
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:18,047
Captain Ramona Garcia. Welcome.

53
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:21,213
Don´t think l´m gonna
cut you any slack because you´re new.

54
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,618
This is not New Orleans,
the rules are different...

55
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,717
...and if you can´t work with them,
you´ll be in deep shit with me.

56
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,227
-Yes.
-There are two reasons...

57
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:29,917
...for getting into border patrol.

58
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,613
Either you wanna uphold the law...

59
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:34,236
...or you wanna beat the shit
out of illegals for kicks.

60
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:37,634
-No, that´s not--
-Columbus is a very violent town.

61
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,829
Stay out of trouble with the locals.
Am l making myself clear?

62
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,307
Yes, ma´am.

63
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,837
Good. We´ll get you partnered up.

64
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,103
l work best alone.

65
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:50,274
Not in my unit you don´t.

66
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:54,652
-Your rabbit got a name?
-Yeah. Jack.

67
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:58,116
Pretty creative on your part.

68
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,876
l would rather spend time
with my aunt Flora...

69
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:05,251
...than spend another weekend
with you.

70
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,961
Motel Stepburn on Highway 31
four miles outside of town...

71
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,850
...is not a weekend getaway.

72
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,055
-Yeah, yeah, l know.
-Well, why you done that?

73
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:14,629
Forty hours in a cramped room...

74
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,670
...with stale pizza, horrible lighting
and bad sex.

75
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,456
Shut up, Lexxi!

76
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,118
Good times.

77
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,612
l wouldn´t laugh if l were you.

78
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:55,558
l might just find someone
more interesting.

79
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,346
Hey.

80
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,544
-What´ll you have, cowboy?
-A cheeseburger and a Coke, please.

81
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,583
You hear that, Jed?

82
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:10,435
He said ´´please.´´
Now, why can´t you be more like him?

83
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,221
Your Coke.

84
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,910
And for your little rabbit.

85
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:24,996
Thank you.

86
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:26,851
l´ll have your burger in a second.

87
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:31,713
And if there´s anything else you need,
sweetie, l´m Lexxi.

88
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,176
That´s quite a bunny
you have there.

89
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,598
Now, that´s not very nice,
ignoring me when l´m talking to you.

90
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,992
Especially since you´ve already shown
what a gentleman you are.

91
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,982
-Jed.
-Shut up, Lexxi.

92
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:03,749
l think Lexxi likes you,
and that means l don´t.

93
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:07,107
l´m just trying to have a meal.

94
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,332
l´m trying to figure where you get off
making me look bad with my girl.

95
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,805
-Check, please.
-Okay.

96
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:50,467
l guess not.

97
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,709
-Let´s go.
-We need to get going, hon.

98
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,665
Good evening.

99
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,042
But it wasn´t my fault.

100
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,440
She asked for my help. l helped her.
Then she comes back at me with that.

101
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,872
What could l do?
Everybody´s playing with me, man.

102
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:11,588
-Damn.
-You need to listen to me.

103
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,499
l told you yesterday
not to mix it up with the locals.

104
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,635
Then you went and kicked the shit
out of four guys at Connie´s bar.

105
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:20,739
l have enough problems
without your bullshit.

106
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,915
Don´t mistake these tits
for weakness, Jack.

107
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:25,255
l have no problem
sending you back to New Orleans.

108
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,980
Yes, ma´am.

109
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,377
This is your new partner,
Agent Pawnell.

110
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:34,599
He´s gonna keep your nose clean,
or l´ll kick both your asses.

111
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:37,928
-Crouching tiger, hidden rabbit.
-Nice to meet you.

112
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,057
lt won´t happen again.

113
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,088
Agent Pawnell
is one of our more talented officers.

114
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,607
And, Jack, all you need to do
is shut up and listen.

115
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:52,041
l understand my job, ma´am.
l´ll just observe.

116
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,572
Hey, man, she likes you.

117
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,009
That´s her way of being friendly?

118
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:07,654
Yeah. Of course she´s hot.
Hottest girl in Columbus. Crazy hot.

119
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,242
l can barely take her anyplace
without causing a scene.

120
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:13,412
Hell, l´ll even introduce you
to her sister. She´s a looker.

121
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,435
lf you don´t mind a little extra meat.

122
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,545
Earth to Jack.

123
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,027
-l´m listening.
-So tell me about you.

124
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:26,631
Nothing to tell.

125
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,611
Sure there is. For one,
what´s the deal with the rabbit?

126
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,594
Rabbits...

127
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:33,773
...don´t make a sound.

128
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:37,543
Pancho Villa himself.

129
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:40,162
The only place in America
to endure a ground invasion...

130
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,399
...and they put a statue and build
a memorial for the son of a bitch.

131
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,085
Every day we´re dodging bullets
from the Mexican side.

132
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:49,220
These coyotes seem to know
our moves before we even make them.

133
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:53,034
More guys have died this year
than the previous 1 0. lt´s crazy.

134
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,369
Either they´re listening
to our coms...

135
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,834
...or they got someone
on the inside.

136
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,878
Hey, Millie´s gonna
pick me up tomorrow.

137
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,413
Be careful with the company wheels,
man.

138
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:16,171
See you at 1 1 .
Action doesn´t start until after lunch.

139
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,879
Cool, man.

140
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:24,838
Who is your friend, Billy?

141
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,045
Hey, baby.
This is my new partner, Jack.

142
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:28,963
Nice to meet you, ma´am.

143
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,582
Come on, baby.
Jack´s gotta be heading back to work.

144
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,637
-Have a good night.
-See you later, man.

145
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,553
-Good night.
-Good night, man.

146
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,997
l have to sleep.

147
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,977
Got a job to do.

148
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,823
Jack.

149
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,446
We got a potential Code 1 9
at Highway 1 1 and Craft Road.

150
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,174
Let´s roll.

151
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:04,683
They´ll sneak in
from another direction. Let´s go.

152
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,435
Jack. What the hell are you doing?

153
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,260
Trust me.

154
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:20,394
That was a diversion.

155
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,920
l´m telling you,
they´re gonna come through here.

156
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,056
And if they do, we´re out of here.

157
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,072
We´ll come back
when they get us the right equipment.

158
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,809
What have we here?

159
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,134
What do you see?

160
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,545
About 1 0 runners and the coyote.
Right in front of us.

161
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:53,488
-All right, let´s go get them.
-l don´t think so.

162
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,690
What are we supposed to do,
let them go free?

163
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,167
Look closer.

164
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,545
My wife and kids
need me to come home alive.

165
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,078
Over there.

166
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,744
Don´t move. Pawnell?

167
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,622
On your knees! On your knees!

168
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:43,561
Do it, asshole!

169
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,264
What you have in here? Heroin?

170
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:05,645
<i>Por favor, what?</i>

171
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:19,117
Don´t move.

172
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,906
Good job, buddy.

173
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,022
Enjoy.

174
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,354
Yo, Jack, what you doing, man?

175
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,004
-Pawnell, stay there.
-Put some cuffs on the kid.

176
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,766
And call the bomb squad.

177
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:39,627
Come on. Move it. They´re near.

178
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:45,195
l need the bomb squad.

179
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:47,600
Repeat, bomb squad at Highway 1 1
and Alberta.

180
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:50,896
<i>-Copy that.
-We´re right behind you. Don´t move.</i>

181
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,003
l´m on my way.

182
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,704
They´re on their way.

183
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,721
-Okay, let´s go.
-Let´s go. Get them in.

184
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:24,907
-We´re coming.
-All right, you in?

185
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,181
-Hold on.
-Lock it in.

186
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:29,451
Let´s get four.

187
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:32,588
-You´re on standby.
-Coming through.

188
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,542
All right, he´s good to go.

189
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,050
Let´s move, people.

190
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,220
Oh, boy, l don´t believe this.

191
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,489
Okay.

192
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:01,260
Sir, you really need to get behind
the safety wall.

193
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,942
-l understand, but--
-This is not a request, sir.

194
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,777
Welcome to Columbus.
Hell of a first day.

195
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:19,349
Get back.

196
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:30,164
lt´s an optical, fiber-based seal
C-casing.

197
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,827
Get down!

198
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,237
Oh, man.

199
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:51,094
Bring the medics.

200
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,430
-No.
-Come on, come on!

201
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,998
Paramedics, man down!

202
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:57,461
Come on.

203
00:23:58,455 --> 00:23:59,981
Hold on.

204
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:02,924
Walk carefully.

205
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,248
Everything okay, sir?

206
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,438
lt was until you showed up, loco.

207
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:25,103
Has everything been arranged?

208
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:28,305
Benito´s contact just called.
Vehicles are ready.

209
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:24,337
Thank you for coming.

210
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,385
Meeting in this barn is not meant to be
a sign of disrespect.

211
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,709
No, my friend,
associate with the common folk.

212
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,081
lt keeps me grounded.

213
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:36,722
The smell of horse shit always
reminds us where we came from.

214
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:41,363
What is he, your shadow?
l don´t like the look he´s giving me.

215
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:45,647
He´s got my best interest at heart.

216
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:49,017
So do l.
l´m here to make you an offer.

217
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:52,402
We divide the border equally.

218
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,575
An interesting offer.

219
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,045
There´s plenty for both of us.

220
00:26:57,754 --> 00:27:00,176
The more we fight amongst
ourselves the less money we make.

221
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:13,009
What´s going on?

222
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:21,585
Easy, friend. Take it easy.

223
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,445
l just got a message from your boss.

224
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,348
This is highly classified information
straight from Quantico.

225
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:36,055
Benjamin Meyers currently controls
all of the smuggling in this area...

226
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:38,140
...and he´s ramping up
the shipments.

227
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:40,339
Over 50,000 illegal immigrants...

228
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,257
...are crossing this section
of the border each year.

229
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:46,104
Every one of them could be carrying
up to a kilo of heroin...

230
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,447
...like we saw yesterday.

231
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,790
lmagine the flood...

232
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:51,542
...if even only 1 0 percent
of these people are carrying.

233
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:54,589
Great. So now we´re gonna need
a goddamn bomb squad...

234
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:57,564
...to inspect everyone
who slips through the fence.

235
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,282
Exactly.

236
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:02,420
By incorporating C-4
explosive devices into the equation...

237
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:05,272
...and using illegal immigrants
in this way...

238
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:08,786
...it gives him a cheap
and deadly pipeline into the U.S.

239
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:11,929
C-4, you can shoot it...

240
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,198
...you can cut it in half,
you can step on it...

241
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,155
...and it will not detonate without
some type of remote-control device.

242
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,317
So be careful out there,
but watch for the decoys.

243
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:27,697
Officially,
Meyers was KlA in Afghanistan.

244
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:31,092
Now, we have intel
that by the end of his tour...

245
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:35,035
...Meyers was heavily involved in
the opium trade with a Sheikh Ahman.

246
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:37,913
He´s in the center.
Now, these men are heavy hitters.

247
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:42,611
Sir, we getting any new equipment?
National Guard gonna lend a hand?

248
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,683
Yeah, as you know, this is a hot topic
and it´s an election year.

249
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,181
Right now,
you men are the only ones on the line.

250
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:51,422
That´s it.

251
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:58,778
-Nice. Good choice of color, Jack.
-Matches your eyes.

252
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:02,486
Get yourself a coffee.

253
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,148
Yeah.

254
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:12,377
Listen, Jack. l thought l´d speak to you
before l speak to--

255
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,788
You okay?

256
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:39,479
What l tell you
stays between us, right?

257
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,894
The night l introduced you to my wife,
she screwed my brains out...

258
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:45,753
...like we were teenagers.

259
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,518
Eyes closed the whole time.

260
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,166
You know what that means, right?

261
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,563
lt means she was thinking about
someone else.

262
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,181
Even if it was you,
l couldn´t do anything about it.

263
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:58,968
Because you had to go
and save my life.

264
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:03,386
What the hell am l supposed to do?

265
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,621
l don´t know, man.

266
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,301
l know you got some money,
my man.

267
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,010
Pull over.

268
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:20,343
Get up.

269
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:45,111
Real smart, huh?
You want to go down like this?

270
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:48,182
Hey, don´t shoot.
l got something for you here.

271
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,873
Easy, man.

272
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:55,068
lt´s from my boss.
He said, ´´Don´t work too hard.´´

273
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,574
Yeah.

274
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,670
Jack!

275
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,993
Damn.

276
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:19,287
Shit.

277
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:27,255
Nice.

278
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:31,102
l would expect this from him,
but from you too? Asshole.

279
00:32:31,298 --> 00:32:32,606
Ma´am, we were patrolling--

280
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:35,190
lt´s on me.
lt has nothing to do with him.

281
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:39,900
l am gonna kick you all the way back
to New Orleans, to jail in New Orleans.

282
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:43,069
We don´t need this here.
ln case you haven´t noticed...

283
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:46,200
...we only have 1 841 people
in this town.

284
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,573
Eighteen hundred
and thirty-nine now.

285
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,257
-They were trying to--
-l need every man l have.

286
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,847
But l am willing to lose anyone
that makes trouble.

287
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,758
So who is this new local hero?

288
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:04,993
l´m.... l´m having a re-election gala
tomorrow night at the civic center.

289
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:07,607
-You should stop by.
-Thank you.

290
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:11,007
Hero like you can make
all the difference in an election.

291
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:14,013
Sort of story the newspapers love.

292
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:18,042
He can help me convince the voters
Columbus is getting safer.

293
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:20,763
With crime up 25 percent?

294
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:26,653
So who are they gonna believe,
the numbers or the hero?

295
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:33,377
<i>-l´m.... l´m having a re-election gala....
-And what is this?</i>

296
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,058
<i>-Got it today from our friend.
-y ou should stop by.</i>

297
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,889
<i>Thank you.</i>

298
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,417
Who is this guy?
Why isn´t he on our payroll?

299
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,188
Well, he turned us down.
Capped two of our boys.

300
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:47,648
Not a typical border-patrol agent,
if you ask me.

301
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,144
Keep an eye on him.
Tell me everything you find out.

302
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,727
<i>y ou are now connected
to the SA T-phone link.</i>

303
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,939
<i>Be advised
that we have received your report...</i>

304
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:56,633
<i>...and will be in touch with you.</i>

305
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,875
lt´s all set
to expedite the new shipments.

306
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,791
<i>-Transmission completed.
-Data received.</i>

307
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:18,719
-Hey, how you doing?
-How are you?

308
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:20,257
l...

309
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,029
...wanna offer my apologies
for the other day.

310
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,307
Please.

311
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:28,508
Accepted.

312
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,864
-Can l pet your bunny?
-No.

313
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:37,243
l´m glad to see that you boys
are getting along now.

314
00:34:37,763 --> 00:34:41,626
Mr. Jack,
l saw you on the news last night.

315
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:44,216
A hero in our bar.

316
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,736
Okay, then, sweetie, you can have
whatever you want. You just name it.

317
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,728
A cheeseburger and a Coke, please.

318
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,159
Coming right up.

319
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:01,625
That´s about right. Yeah. No.

320
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,129
Go on, drink it up.

321
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:10,561
lt´s on the house, cowboy. Enjoy.

322
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:12,317
Thank you.

323
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:23,652
l sure hope you´re not
one of those angry drunks.

324
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,722
l don´t drink,
but if l don´t get my caffeine....

325
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:42,493
So you never get trigger-happy
on Bourbon Street?

326
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,100
No, ma´am.

327
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:48,677
Spare me the ´´yes, ma´am,´´
´´no, ma´am´´ crap.

328
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,831
Yes, sir.

329
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,250
How we doing?

330
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:20,251
-Came out to just over 3 tons, sir.
-Oh, that´s good.

331
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,233
Real good.

332
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,707
Did you know...

333
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:28,770
...l was once
an illegal immigrant myself?

334
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:31,391
When l was 3...

335
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,459
...my father decided
he was done working in dusty fields...

336
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,701
...that never grew anything.

337
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,870
And when he finally came
to get me and my mother...

338
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:43,550
...he was shot and killed.

339
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:48,127
l´m sorry.

340
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,946
How did you get in?

341
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,787
l´m just fucking with you.

342
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:58,268
My father is a patent attorney
in El Paso.

343
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:00,291
He´s a yuppie.

344
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:01,952
So why the story?

345
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:08,347
l like to remember,
when we´re patrolling the border...

346
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:11,299
...that we´re all travelers
in this world.

347
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:15,515
And but for the grace of God,
we could be in their shoes.

348
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:22,948
<i>So, what about you, chilito?</i>

349
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:26,853
And what´s the deal with this rabbit?

350
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:31,422
He´s smaller than a dog
and cuter than a rat.

351
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,694
Smart-ass.

352
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:39,587
For a minute,
l thought you were going to be nice.

353
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:42,848
You sleeping all right?

354
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,253
-Yeah.
-Don´t bullshit me.

355
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,066
Okay, no.

356
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,212
What keeps you going?

357
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,325
The rabbit.

358
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:54,877
-That´s it. l am walk--
-What are you doing?

359
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,665
-l am walking you home. Come on.
-Nobody walks here.

360
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,067
-Everybody takes their truck.
-We´re walking.

361
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,848
Well, don´t get any funny ideas.

362
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,917
You´re piss-drunk
and l´m holding a rabbit.

363
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,834
So, what time you gonna be
picking me up tomorrow?

364
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,755
Around 1 1 .

365
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:16,545
Ten.

366
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:20,039
Okay, okay. Ten it is.

367
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:22,599
But what about Aunt Flora?

368
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:29,346
Exactly how much?

369
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:32,228
Six thousand
and twenty-three-point-six pounds, sir.

370
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:34,148
All triple-wrapped in carbon paper...

371
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:38,981
...and vacuum-packed in titanium
lined with plastic. Now, watch this.

372
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:44,221
-Thank you, NAFTA.
-Now, this is an airtight seal.

373
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:50,562
You could put this thing into orbit.
Not that you´d have to.

374
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,444
There is no dog on Earth
that could detect it.

375
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,510
And add to this
the customs agent we purchased...

376
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,501
...we´re not gonna have a problem.

377
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:01,086
And if the shit hits the fan?

378
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:06,755
Titanium-plated armor,
dual-enforced steel-capped tires.

379
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:08,808
lt´s a B-29 Superfortress.

380
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,489
Oh, yes.

381
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,577
My bad.

382
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:29,095
Hey, where you going, Jack?

383
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,454
Change back to my civvies.

384
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,762
Damn, it´s cold.
Even my butt is frozen.

385
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:13,952
Bet you thought New Mexico was
toasty all the time, didn´t you, Jack?

386
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,497
Yep.

387
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:37,290
Good boy. Good boy.

388
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,790
Yes.

389
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,686
May l see your lD, please?

390
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:43,786
Where are you headed, Father?

391
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:48,236
We are going to assist
at the new cathedral in Las Cruces.

392
00:42:51,276 --> 00:42:53,578
Thank you for your cooperation.

393
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:11,787
Agent Webster, possible situation,
Checkpoint 4. Copy?

394
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:13,802
He marked us.

395
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:15,142
Rally up!

396
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:19,051
Get down! Get down, everybody!
Get down! Get going!

397
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:22,694
Get down! Get down! Get down!

398
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:28,713
Get down, everybody!
Get down! Get down! Get down!

399
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,329
Tell everyone to shut up
and hold on.

400
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:58,795
Shut up and stay in your seats!

401
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,877
Shut up.

402
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,958
<i>All units, multiple automatic weapons,
several casualties reported.</i>

403
00:44:06,158 --> 00:44:09,256
<i>All units, establish blockades in
the northbound lanes of Highway 1 1...</i>

404
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,396
<i>...at the Main Street bridge.</i>

405
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:13,224
Let´s go.

406
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,592
-Give me a gun up front.
-Get a gun up front.

407
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,679
You heard him! Get up there!

408
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:53,485
We got him.

409
00:44:56,942 --> 00:44:59,015
Bridge. Let´s go for the bridge.

410
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:21,738
Hold on.

411
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,534
lt´s that same agent.

412
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:55,784
Shit.

413
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:19,087
The border.
We can´t go into Mexico.

414
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,517
Fuck the border.

415
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:14,061
This is not good.

416
00:47:55,763 --> 00:47:58,218
Check the merchandise.

417
00:48:56,596 --> 00:48:58,537
Are you ready for this?

418
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:02,410
-Jack.
-Yeah?

419
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:06,989
Let´s move.

420
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:18,542
-l am U.S. agent.
-Yes.

421
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,860
Because of him, the Federales
now have $35 million of my heroin.

422
00:50:28,054 --> 00:50:31,599
So l want him here,
l want him alive...

423
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:34,347
...and l want him now.

424
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,423
This is all we could find on him, sir.

425
00:50:42,294 --> 00:50:43,788
l have a problem.

426
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,899
Agent Jack Robideaux
and Agent Pawnell...

427
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:48,436
...disappeared in Mexico
during the chase.

428
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,663
Pawnell´s wife is gone
and his house is empty.

429
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:53,618
What a nightmare.

430
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:55,504
l need your help.

431
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,877
l´ll never understand you Americans.

432
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:26,258
<i>Can´t you fight each other
in su país?</i>

433
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:27,984
Why?

434
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,703
Why do you have to bring it here?

435
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:29,173
l can assure the people
of Columbus...

436
00:55:29,372 --> 00:55:32,470
-That´s exactly what l´m saying.
-...that l will do everything l can...

437
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:36,727
...to bring the perpetrators
of this vile crime to justice.

438
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:39,035
Will you excuse me a moment?

439
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:40,919
Captain Garcia?

440
00:55:43,388 --> 00:55:45,559
What about our boy...

441
00:55:45,757 --> 00:55:47,512
...Agent Robideaux?

442
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:50,003
He didn´t show up to my party.

443
00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:52,922
He´s in a district jail in Palomas.

444
00:55:54,844 --> 00:55:56,567
Well, we better
do everything we can...

445
00:55:56,764 --> 00:55:59,447
...to get him back here
in time for the election.

446
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:01,651
People are upset.

447
00:56:01,947 --> 00:56:04,020
l´m bleeding votes here.

448
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,209
Ladies and gentlemen, l don´t know
if l answered all your questions.

449
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:20,664
Time to leave, muchacho.

450
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:30,387
Detail, forward march.

451
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:40,018
Come right, march.

452
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,441
Detail, halt.

453
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:47,988
Right face.

454
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:49,716
Cover.

455
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:54,100
Parade rest.

456
00:56:58,077 --> 00:57:00,597
This is a day of mourning.

457
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,253
A day to honor those brave agents...

458
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:08,057
...that have made the ultimate sacrifice
to protect us.

459
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,752
l ask that you please
respect their memory.

460
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,980
God bless America.

461
00:57:20,414 --> 00:57:24,026
Detail, forward march.

462
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,838
<i>Hello? Ramona?
Ramona, is that you?</i>

Okay, just relax.
Just tell me where you are.

<i>l think l´m at a place--

Just listen to me. Stay right there.

Thanks for joining us, Jack.

470

...otherwise you wouldn´t have
gone to all this trouble.

So, what you gonna do now, hero?

474
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:24,122
No more bullshit.

475
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,843
lt´s time for the truth.

476
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:31,358
You can´t just be
a border-patrol agent.

477
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,544
Those guys are like dogs
yapping at the fence.

478
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:39,387
-l´m a border-patrol agent.
-That´s a good one, yeah.

479
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:41,494
Your partner told me that story.

480
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:44,029
New Orleans cop,
pretty convenient with the hurricane.

481
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:45,499
Who can argue with that?

482
00:58:45,695 --> 00:58:48,116
But l´m Special Forces, Jack...

483
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,490
...surrounded by the finest fighters
in the world.

484
00:58:50,688 --> 00:58:53,110
So l know
you´re no fucking beat cop.

485
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:55,451
l´m not a beat cop.

486
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:57,021
l´m just a border-patrol--

487
00:58:57,888 --> 00:59:00,605
Border-patrol agent. Right.

488
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,261
Who you working for, Jack?

489
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,225
NSA? FBl? Homeland Security?

490
00:59:07,808 --> 00:59:08,986
The State Department?

491
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:12,923
l´m a border-patrol agent.

492
00:59:19,776 --> 00:59:22,165
He´s more stubborn than l thought.

493
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,713
Did they train you
how to withstand torture?

494
00:59:27,808 --> 00:59:29,979
Because they trained me
how to administer it.

495
00:59:39,103 --> 00:59:43,195
Sorry, Jack.
But, you, you deserve this.

496
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:46,999
ls that all you got, bitch?

497
00:59:50,945 --> 00:59:53,978
Oh, l get that
you don´t care about your own life...

498
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:57,919
...but l have a feeling
you care about others.

499
00:59:58,113 --> 01:00:00,414
Don´t listen to him, Jack.

500
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:04,286
My dad always said
flowers would shut up a woman.

501
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:06,400
He was wrong.

502
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:08,054
Your father is a piece of shit.

503
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:15,514
You tell me who sent you...

504
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,949
...or l swear
l´ll blow her fucking brains out.

505
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:21,790
Three, and she´s dead.

506
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:23,769
One.

507
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,812
Two.

508
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,801
Okay. Okay, okay, l´ll tell you.

509
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:35,225
Don´t hurt her.

510
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,349
Okay, l will tell you.

511
01:01:13,058 --> 01:01:15,196
<i>l had a family.</i>

512
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:20,090
<i>And then....</i>

513
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:22,938
<i>And then...</i>

514
01:01:29,762 --> 01:01:32,348
...my daughter died
from your drugs.

515
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,668
She died because of your greed.

516
01:01:37,923 --> 01:01:41,600
Because of your disrespect
for human life.

517
01:01:45,027 --> 01:01:46,270
She was barely 1 6.

518
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,903
l buried her three months ago.

519
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:56,289
At her grave,
l swore l would kill you.

520
01:02:00,003 --> 01:02:03,102
l´m really sorry about your loss,
Jack.

521
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,306
l must ask, why me?

522
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,534
l don´t go
anywhere near New Orleans...

523
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,797
...so you shouldn´t have
a personal vendetta against me.

524
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:18,232
l´m just a little fish in a big pond
full of much bigger sharks.

525
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:22,594
-For me, it´s the same.
-Oh, yeah, l believe you. Yeah.

526
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,596
You´re a real American hero.

527
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:27,519
Just like these guys...

528
01:02:28,323 --> 01:02:30,047
...our fallen brothers
in Afghanistan...

529
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:32,382
...the soldiers there.
Jack, don´t get me started.

530
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,711
-This is my vendetta.
-The war was never about you, man.

531
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:39,421
You fuck with me, my business...

532
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:41,148
...you make it about me.

533
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,307
Now, l want you...

534
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:47,810
...to beg for her life.

535
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,427
Do it.

536
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,386
Okay.

537
01:03:04,932 --> 01:03:06,842
Please...

538
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:09,565
...shoot me.

539
01:03:11,076 --> 01:03:13,280
lt´s not her fault.

540
01:03:18,886 --> 01:03:21,668
That might be the most
suck-filled begging l´ve ever seen.

541
01:03:26,214 --> 01:03:28,963
You can save the world,
but you can´t save her.

542
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:35,971
Just like your daughter. Oh, yeah.

543
01:03:54,884 --> 01:03:56,925
Wrong detonator.

544
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:04,388
See, the Federales confiscated
$35 million of my assets.

545
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:06,207
Guess what.

546
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:08,228
lt is my lucky day.

547
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:12,862
The American government
and its people go absolutely ape-shit...

548
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:15,036
...when two Americans
cross the border.

549
01:04:15,238 --> 01:04:17,889
But when real-life heroes,
like ourselves...

550
01:04:18,598 --> 01:04:22,394
...go missing, take a bullet,
does anyone care?

551
01:04:22,822 --> 01:04:26,237
So, what does Uncle Sam see in you
that l don´t?

552
01:04:26,438 --> 01:04:28,805
Untie me and find out.

553
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,499
You know, l can take what l want...

554
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:38,466
...when l want.

555
01:04:40,326 --> 01:04:42,366
Okay, bring him in.

556
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,200
-Emile?
-Sorry, Ramona.

557
01:04:47,398 --> 01:04:49,919
He has nothing to do with this.

558
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,699
Let me show you how this works.

559
01:04:58,823 --> 01:05:02,140
No! No!

560
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,997
The Federales want you back.

561
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:10,752
There is no guarantee
as to how you´ll be returned to them.

562
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:15,075
lnjured, maimed or in body bags.
Do you want that?

563
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:24,582
They´re all yours.

564
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:30,307
Put them in the wine cellar.

565
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:37,573
<i>y ou are now connected

<i>Under control?</i>

569
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:49,569
<i>Losing a multimillion-dollar shipment
is not an example of being in control.</i>

<i>-l´ll get it back.

572
01:05:56,936 --> 01:06:00,100

with Sheikh Ahman?

573
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:03,776
<i>-And l´ll contact you in 50 minutes.

Pawnell.

576
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,506
l´m real sorry, Jack.

577
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:19,842
But don´t hate the player,
hate the game.

578
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:23,684
lt´s all about the money.
Twenty G´s to turn a blind eye.

579
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,654
You could´ve had some too.
But, no, you had to spoil my gravy.

580
01:06:28,135 --> 01:06:31,616
-l can´t have that.
-You know that wife of yours?

581
01:06:32,808 --> 01:06:34,630
She´s got a reputation.

582
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,035
She likes sex so much...

583
01:06:36,232 --> 01:06:38,208
...she´ll suck any cock
bigger than yours.

584
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:41,827
ln fact, if you kiss her...

585
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:44,128
...you can taste every man in town.

586

l need backup right away

595

l don´t care how you´re gonna do it,
just make sure they send everyone.

l need everything you have.

597

Hey, get some guns down there
now!

605

They´re emptying out
all of our accounts.

So the only assets we have left
are here.

01:10:13,197 --> 01:10:15,019
So you need to start
to load the truck.

Did you see any cars?

610

Ernesto, this is not a good time.

01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:55,075
You´re telling me.
We just got orders from the States.

616

We´re sending my soldiers

-...arrest you.
-Fuck them.

How much time do l have?

619

-Quickly.

All right, cover what you can.
Hold them off.

Go.

632
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,752
Clear.

633
01:15:13,234 --> 01:15:14,729
Go.

634
01:16:58,772 --> 01:17:00,561
You know what, Jack?

635
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:07,534
Dying ain´t such a bad thing,
you know?

636
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:13,225
l guess that´s why l´m still here.
Right?

637
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:18,707
But you should have ran
when you had the chance.

638
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:48,026
You fuck!

639
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,744
You fuck.

640
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:12,440
See, going into battle teaches you
a few things about yourself.

641
01:22:12,635 --> 01:22:15,700
You´re only truly alive
when you´re about to kill.

642
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:18,103
We both want to live.

643
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:20,600
-You know that.
-Yeah.

644
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:24,057
But l´m the one holding the gun.

645
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:37,299
Oh, you´re a sick son of a bitch.
Do you know that?

646
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,439
lt´s time to die.

647
01:22:48,154 --> 01:22:50,391
You got beat by a regular cop.

648
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:29,873
What took you so long?

649
01:23:30,076 --> 01:23:33,786
l´m sorry. l had to take a little siesta.

650
01:23:34,204 --> 01:23:38,132
Good work, my friends. l´ve been
trying to clean this town up for years.

651
01:23:38,332 --> 01:23:39,957
Thank you for your help.

652
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:43,638
A little help, but still help.

653
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,210
Jack?

654
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:08,721
We´ll find him.
This place isn´t that big.

655
01:24:16,828 --> 01:24:18,584
l´m sorry about Emile.

656
01:24:22,493 --> 01:24:23,954
Yeah.

657
01:24:25,085 --> 01:24:28,729
He was a great man.
He was my uncle.

658
01:24:33,692 --> 01:24:36,147
l got him that job
when l made captain.

659
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,744
He didn´t want anyone to know
that we were related.

660
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:48,858
-He always had--
-Had a smile on his face.

661
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:51,739
Yeah.

662
01:24:56,189 --> 01:24:59,385
So are you gonna tell me
what´s so special about this rabbit?

663
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:03,379
My daughter, Kassie...

664
01:25:05,277 --> 01:25:07,132
...it was hers.

665
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:16,854
Time to pack.

666
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:21,755
Time to pack.

667
01:25:28,061 --> 01:25:29,622
Jack?

668
01:25:38,879 --> 01:25:40,340
Jack?

669
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,219
Jack?

670
01:25:56,287 --> 01:25:57,781
Why is his name Jack...

671
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:00,213
...Jack?

672
01:26:02,463 --> 01:26:04,602
My daughter thought...

673
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,060
...it would be funny.

674
01:26:14,111 --> 01:26:18,933
You know, l think it´s time
you go back to New Orleans...

675
01:26:19,135 --> 01:26:21,502
...and put your life back together
again.

676
01:26:23,455 --> 01:26:26,903
-Yeah.
-l´m sure your wife is waiting for you.

677
01:26:30,431 --> 01:26:31,773
Yeah.
