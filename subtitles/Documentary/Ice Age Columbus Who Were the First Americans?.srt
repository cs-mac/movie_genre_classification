<i>If we start killing scientists</i>
<i>"on U.S. soil,</i>

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,437
who knows where it leads?

4
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,007
At best,
the secret war escalates.

5
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:11,762
At worst...

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,545
He got one of the scientists.

7
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:16,847
God damn it.

8
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:19,116
This is our worst failure
in 15 years.

9
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:20,918
I swear to God, they'll pay.

10
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,119
This will not stand.

11
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,021
I've been so stressed lately.

12
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,891
You know I could get anything
that Agent Gaad has.

13
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,793
Oh! What?

14
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,361
You just... you startled me.

15
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,230
Did something happen
between you and Irina?

16
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,800
Nothing happened.
There's only you.

17
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,735
I asked you not to lie to me.

18
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:40,205
I made a terrible mistake.

19
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:44,804
Can we please just...
Try and start over?

20
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,712
No. We can't.

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,950
Can I have
another piece of fried chicken?

22
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:51,951
Of course.

23
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:52,918
Me too.

24
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,186
Uh, white or dark meat?

25
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,621
- White.
- Dark.

26
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,191
- There you go.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,560
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,796
I wish we could
have fried chicken every week.

29
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,531
Twice a week. Every day.

30
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,373
Your dad and I, um...

31
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:15,343
Want to talk to you guys
about something.

32
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:18,947
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:20,382
You're too old.

34
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:22,384
I'm too old for what?

35
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,752
To have a baby.

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,789
Jen's mom is ancient,
and she's pregnant,

37
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,790
and she's
light years younger than you.

38
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,892
- You're having a baby?
- No.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,627
No. Where did you
get that idea?

40
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:34,796
- You just said...
- No, no.

41
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,268
Dad is going to be

42
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:42,237
staying somewhere else
for a little while.

43
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,640
Are you going
on a business trip?

44
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,776
No.

45
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,378
You're separating?

46
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,414
Well, no, we're not...

47
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,583
we're not separating,
not exactly.

48
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:57,019
We're... it's a little bit
more like, uh...

49
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,588
hitting the pause button.

50
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:01,925
For how long?

51
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:03,593
I don't know. We don't know.

52
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,264
You're kidding, right?

53
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:10,000
I mean, this is a joke,
isn't it?

54
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,305
Why?

55
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:18,842
Your dad and I have...

56
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,843
you know,
we've been fighting a lot.

57
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,011
You always fight a lot.

58
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,045
- Too much.
- We know.

59
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:24,013
Then stop.

60
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,782
- We can't.
- Tried.

61
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,884
When Henry and I fight,
you tell us to stop.

62
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,418
If we can, why can't you?

63
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:32,288
I don't know.

64
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:36,459
The important thing is...

65
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:40,897
Other than the fact that
we love you so very much,

66
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,833
is that dad and I
need some time

67
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,968
to figure things out.

68
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:49,038
Do you guys not
love each other anymore?

69
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,175
It's... it's complicated.

70
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,010
And when you're grown up,

71
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:55,345
you'll understand.

72
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,046
- Bullshit!
- Paige...

73
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:59,649
You don't just
stop loving someone!

74
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:03,253
Are you gonna stop loving us?

75
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,189
No. That is...
I mean, it's impossible.

76
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:07,991
That would never happen. Never.

77
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:11,327
This is so stupid.

78
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,863
This is your fault! You're
always giving dad a rough time!

79
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,897
It's not mom's fault.

80
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,766
Why are you defending her?

81
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,401
I'm not. Look, this is...

82
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,002
Our decision.

83
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,238
We... we both
made this decision.

84
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:42,859
Henry, please open up.
I just want to talk.

85
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:02,813
I love you so much.

86
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,483
More than you'll ever know.

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,608
So, I'll see you tomorrow
at the Beemans'?

88
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,145
Are we really gonna
go to a party together?

89
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,414
If Stan's work friends
are gonna be there,

90
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,982
I think we should be, too.

91
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,251
Mm.

00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,180
I got fresh meat, fresh meat.

94
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,315
- You want a dog?
- Yeah, I'll... I'll have one.

95
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:40,717
Paige, do you want a hamburger?

96
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,251
No.

97
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,189
Rough night?

98
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:49,525
No one is doing
particularly well right now.

99
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:52,028
Paige slept in Henry's room.

100
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:53,563
How is Henry?

101
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,232
Not great.

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,834
Where are you staying?

103
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,737
Motel in Peterborough.

104
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,405
That sounds depressing.

105
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:05,408
It's okay for now.

106
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,743
It's for the best.

107
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,714
Yeah, I know.

108
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,953
I suppose we should mingle.

109
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,256
<i>Watching game 7</i>
<i>of the eastern quarterfinals</i>

110

111
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,592
Hey, how you guys doing?

112
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,494
We're doing great.
That's a big old...

113
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:25,862
that's a big, old
plate of meat you got.

114
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,831
Yeah. Sit. Rest your dogs.

115
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,566
Oh! Funny man!

116
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,401
All right.

117
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,003
So, we're gonna do something.

118
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:38,575
We're gonna take one of them out
right here in D.C.

119
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:41,511
<i>They're on the boards...</i>

120
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,580
Is this approved?

121
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:46,116
If anyone should ask, no.

122
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,118
Who's the target?

123
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:50,420
The acting KGB Rezident.

124
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:51,955
Arkady?

125
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:53,456
That's a big target.

126
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:56,426
They just killed
three of our own.

127
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:57,961
If we don't hit them
hard and fast,

128
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,829
those won't be
our last casualties.

129
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,966
How's it going down?

130
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,969
Arkady likes to jog
Monday and Wednesday afternoon.

131
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,804
He's back in his office
at 5:00.

132
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:10,374
When? Tomorrow.

133
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,376
And, uh,
this is not an assignment.

134
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:15,412
Participation
is strictly voluntary.

135
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,246
I'm in.

136
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,715
Me too.

137
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:23,787
I'm sorry,
if this is extrajudicial...

138
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,022
I would rather stay away.

139
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,892
Okay.

140
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,330
Hey.

141
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:35,798
Hey.

142
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,333
What's up with your brother?

143
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,469
He looks like
he lost his best friend.

144
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:42,272
He did.

145
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,509
My parents are taking
a vacation from each other.

146
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:50,313
My dad moved out last night.

147
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:52,014
For good?

148
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:53,482
Who knows?

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,651
They say they're
hitting the pause button,

150
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,520
whatever that means.

151
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,488
Okay. All right.

152
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:02,724
Sorry.

153
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,962
Only one way
to stop a bully, Stan.

154
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,464
I can't go in on this,
Chris. I can't.

155
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,266
Your shoes squeak. I get it.

156
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,635
Me? My shoes...
they don't squeak.

157
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,237
I'm fully lubricated.

158
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,141
Who's, um...

159
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,609
Who's the babe?

160
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,311
Not your wife... the other fox?

161
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,179
That's my neighbor.

162
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,514
That's your neighbor? Mm-hmm.

163
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,716
I'd borrow some sugar
if I was you.

164
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,185
You're a putz.

165
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,889
You know, I was sitting
by the window the other night,

166
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:38,592
and I was reading,
and I saw Philip leave.

167
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,362
I mean, I wasn't spying.

168
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,031
No, no. Of course not.

169
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:45,133
Is everything
okay with you guys?

170
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,404
We are taking some time apart.

171
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,171
But I guess
that's not something

172
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,640
you can keep quiet
for very long.

173
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,709
No. Um, why would you want to?

174
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,677
Privacy, I guess.

175
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,880
There's no shame in it.

176
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,983
Do the kids know yet?

177
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,752
- We told them last night.
- Oh.

178
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,422
Well, you know,
if you need anything,

179
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:09,491
you don't hesitate
to ask me, okay?

180
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,862
Thanks. Yeah.

181
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,365
Dad, I want you to come home.

182
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,733
We both do.

183
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,035
I-I can't.

184
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:22,504
Why not? I...

185
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,841
I just can't, sweetheart.
Please?

186
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,043
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,745
See you soon.

188
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:43,626
Ooh, shoot yourself
into me, Clark!

189
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,731
Oh! Take me!

190
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,668
Oh, God, take me!

191
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:59,709
I have to go. There's
a situation with the department.

192
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,212
What's going on?

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,782
Three Agents got killed
and a scientist.

194
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,650
I know. Everyone's upset.

195
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:10,587
Yeah.

196
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:14,392
Clark...

197
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm in love with you.

198
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:21,300
I waited my whole life for you,

199
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:26,506
and I would do
anything for you.

200
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,341
Anything.

201
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,778
All you have to do is ask.

202
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:33,747
Just please...

203
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:36,082
Just tell me one thing?

204
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,221
Is this real?

205
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,991
Yes.

206
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,497
Yes.

207
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,037
Well, then, stay with me.

208
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,876
Please.

209
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,911
Just this once.

210
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,329
Where's Henry?

211
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,031
How should I know?

212
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,233
Henry!

213
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,805
What should I tell my friends?

214
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,408
Why do you have to
tell your friends anything?

215
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,176
If they ask.

216
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,846
Tell them whatever you want.

217
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,180
Tell them the truth.

218
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:43,149
Which is what?

219
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:47,854
That your parents aren't
living together right now.

220
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:50,322
Henry, get down here right now!

221
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,958
We're gonna be late!

222
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,636
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

223
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:07,741
Oh, wow.

224
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,343
Hi. Hi.

225
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,911
It's been a long time

226
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,979
since I've had a man sleep in my bed.

227
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:16,482
I think I can get used to this.

228
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,352
But I got to go to work.

229
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,255
What's the rush?

230
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,424
Well, there's a lot going on.

231
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,694
Agent Gaad got a call
from the white house

232
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,363
a couple days ago,
and since then,

233
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,065
he's been in and out,
having secret meetings

234
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,101
with his old buddies
from the C.I.A.

235
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,903
He thinks that
I don't know, but...

236
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:40,273
I'm his secretary,
not his potted plant.

237
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,075
What are they planning?

238
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:46,946
Well, I think they're gonna
kill a KGB Agent.

239
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,617
It's an eye for an eye, Clark.

240
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,485
But you

241
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:54,988
Can stay as long as you like.

242
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,292
Mm. Bye.

243
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,461
Bye.

244
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:39,530
Can I help you?

245
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,766
I don't know.

246
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,635
I'm with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

247
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:47,270
Can I ask you a few questions?

248
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:48,872
About what?

249
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:51,507
Why don't we start
with who you are?

250
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:54,978
W-who I... I'm...
I'm just a guy.

251
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,346
Yeah, you're just a guy

252
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:59,115
who spent the night
with a girl... Martha.

253
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:03,119
Oh, look, my friend, I don't...

254
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:04,554
I'm not your friend, friend.

255
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,425
What are you doing here?

256
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:11,995
You know what?
You got me dead to rights,

257
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,496
'cause me and Martha...

258
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:15,232
we've been banging each other
into ecstatic oblivion

259
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,067
for the past... wow...
10 hours.

260
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:18,968
Look, why don't we take
this conversation downtown?

261
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,406
Lock up your car.

262
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,574
Okay.

263
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,408
Holy shit.

264
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,185
No, no.

265
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:13,188
No. No!

266
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:14,723
Aah!

267
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,192
What happened?

268
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,860
He followed me
coming out of Martha's.

269
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,596
I need to go back
and move his car.

270
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:44,631
I've seen him before. Yeah.

271
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,366
At the Beeman party.

272
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:49,370
He's FBI.

273
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,839
Does he know
you're working Martha?

274
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,274
I don't know. I suppose.

275
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,975
Uh, or this just could be a...

276
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:56,944
what? What?

277
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:59,179
A total screw-up.

278
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:00,848
He might have been
seeing Martha himself.

279
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,650
A jealous suitor?

280
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:04,685
But I got something
from Martha.

281
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:06,554
The FBI
are planning retaliation.

282
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,622
They're gonna kill a KGB Agent
here in D.C.

283
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,326
- He'll know what they're planning.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:13,694
I brought morphine.

285
00:16:13,762 --> 00:16:14,895
He needs to be in a hospital.

286
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,664
We'll do what we can.

287
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,868
The wound's pretty deep.

288
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,736
We're gonna have to
pack it or cauterize it

289
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:24,271
once we take the knife out.

290
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:54,503
You seen Amador?

291
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,170
No. He was supposed to meet me
an hour ago.

292
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:57,872
He never showed.

293
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,440
It's not like him.

294
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,589
<i>You've reached Amador.</i>

295
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,091
<i>If I'm not working,</i>
<i>I'm out having a ball.</i>

296
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:17,726
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

297
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,027
Hey, it's Stan.

298
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:20,529
Where the hell are you?

299
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,430
Call me.

300
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,403
What'd you do with his car?

301
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:29,971
I wiped it down for prints

302
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,973
and parked it around the corner
from his apartment.

303
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,141
All right.

304
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,076
Now, when I pull this,

305
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,879
it's gonna gush
like a broken pipe.

306
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,617
Ready? Yeah.

307
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,264
Okay, lift him.

308
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:58,166
Oh!

309
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,506
Okay. Put him down.

310
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,181
It's all right. It's over.
The hard part's over.

311
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,537
Thank you.

312
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,343
Chris?

313
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,912
Chris!

314
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,026
<i>You've reached Amador.</i>

315
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,661
<i>If I'm not working,</i>
<i>I'm out having a ball.</i>

316
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,064
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

317
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,665
<i>Hey, it's Cheryl.</i>

318
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,400
<i>We met at the crab shack.</i>

319
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,469
<i>I thought we could</i>
<i>get together again.</i>

320
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,171
<i>You have my number, right?</i>

321
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,976
<i>Hello, Amador. This is Julie.</i>

322
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:17,644
<i>I'm in town for a few days</i>

323
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:20,247
<i>and wanted to see</i>
<i>if we could catch up.</i>

324
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,148
<i>Call me, cutie.</i>

325
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:29,389
<i>Chris, aunt Lyla's</i>
<i>coming for dinner tomorrow.</i>

326
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:33,026
<i>I told her you're busy,</i>
<i>but you know what she's like.</i>

327
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:36,429
<i>You and papa can</i>
<i>watch the game on TV, okay?</i>

328
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,731
<i>So, you'll come?</i>

329
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,600
<i>Good?</i>

330
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:41,768
<i>Come.</i>

331
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,504
<i>Hey, it's Stan.</i>

332
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,172
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

333
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:14,033
There's just no way that Amador would check
out like this, without touching base.

334
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,269
He didn't answer his phone.
He didn't show up this morning.

335
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:18,404
I went to his apartment.
He hasn't been home all morning.

336
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,306
His car was around the corner
from his apartment.

337
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,875
- I had forensics check it out.
- And?

338
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,610
No prints.

339
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:24,944
None.

340
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,579
What? He wiped his own prints
off his car?

341
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:27,780
We don't know that
the KGB has him.

342
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,248
I know it. Look, I've got

343
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:31,450
every available Agent
out looking for him.

344
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:32,818
If he spent the night
out on the town

345
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,253
and woke up
in the wrong room...

346
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,788
I'm telling you,
that's not what's happening.

347
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,823
Or if the KGB does have him,

348
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,224
we'll find him.

349
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:43,229
Let's not jump to conclusions.

350
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:45,532
Let's just do our job.

351
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,903
I have to get back. The kids
are gonna be home from school.

352
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,505
Yeah, go, go. I'll, uh...

353
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,241
I'll give him some more morphine
when he wakes.

354
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,777
There's nothing else
we can do now.

355
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,579
Okay.

356
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:30,142
A counterintelligence artiste?

357
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,844
Yeah, I'm like Picasso...

358
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:34,147
Only with a gun
and not a brush.

359
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:37,717
My work is my life,
and my life is my art.

360
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:41,822
I have no wife, no kids,
no pets, no hobbies,

361
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,824
no distractions...

362
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:46,193
except for pussy.

363
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,295
I got no attachments.

364
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:53,167
I'm as unencumbered
as bedbugs in a flophouse,

365
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,835
and I like it.

366
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,637
It works for me.

367
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,072
El Lobo.

368
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,142
Sí. Yo soy El Lobo.

369
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,146
Yeah. I am a lone wolf.

370
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,848
That's good, Stan.

371
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:42,277
Anybody home?

372
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:45,914
Could use some help.

373
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:47,616
Hey.

374
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:50,519
I got Mac and cheese and
those pretzels that you love,

375
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,188
the ones that are
as hard as rock candy.

376
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,457
And I bought a wok.

377
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:57,559
What for?

378
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,695
To make Chinese food.

379
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,730
You've never made Chinese food.

380
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,467
First time for everything.

381
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,335
Is that what this is about?

382
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,973
You and dad split,
and you start...

383
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,109
Cooking Chinese food?

384
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:15,980
So we'll have
spaghetti and meat sauce, then.

385
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:17,948
I don't care what we eat,

386
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,151
and I don't want to pretend
that your life is a do-over,

387
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:21,886
because mine isn't.

388
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:25,289
So that's what you don't want.
What <i>do</i> you want?

389
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:33,897
I want things to be
the way they were.

390
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,070
I know.

391
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:45,842
Paige, I know
things are hard right now.

392
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,911
But it's for the best.

393
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,780
For who?

394
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:00,090
Hello, Mrs. Jennings.

395
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:01,658
This is Mrs. Costa,
Henry's teacher.

396
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:02,993
Mrs. Costa? No.

397
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,295
Is this a bad time?
Uh... This is...

398
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:07,831
no, this is not a bad time.

399
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,477
Henry, you okay?

400
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,846
Yeah.

401
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,681
Tired?

402
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:38,597
I just got a call
from Mrs. Costa.

403
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,701
You have something
you want to tell me?

404
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,102
No.

405
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:47,372
Henry...

406
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,310
I know this is...

407
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:53,912
A terrible thing
to do to you right now.

408
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:59,585
My parents... wouldn't have
even considered it.

409
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:03,423
It would have been unthinkable.

410
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:08,095
But times have changed,
and your dad and I...

411
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:19,374
Mrs. Costa said

412
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,576
you didn't do
your social-studies project.

413
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,078
I did.

414
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:25,680
Are you saying
she's not telling the truth?

415
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:33,921
Show it to me, please.

416
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,715
Is this it?

417
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,951
Yeah.

418
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,120
But you only wrote
one sentence.

419
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,959
I didn't have
anything else to say.

420
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,186
The KGB wants to know
what your next move is.

421
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,921
They don't think you're
just going to sit back

422
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:42,359
after losing your scientist
and three of your Agents.

423
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:47,498
Has something happened?

424
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,533
Who put the finger on Amador?

425
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:52,102
Who?

426
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,637
My partner.

427
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:55,305
I don't know
what you're talking about.

428
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,773
Don't lie to me, Nina.

429
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,342
- Do not lie to me.
- You're hurting me!

430
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,611
- Do not lie to me.
- I don't know! I swear! Let go.

431
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:03,680
I don't know.
I swear I don't know.

432
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,215
You find out who took Amador.

433
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:08,685
You find out where he is.

434
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:09,753
Now.

435
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:41,920
Water.

436
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:04,979
More?

437
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:12,453
Cold.

438
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:32,906
What do you want?

439
00:28:32,974 --> 00:28:36,376
Information.

440
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:40,480
Who are the FBI
planning to take out?

441
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,219
I don't know.

442
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:51,492
I think you do.

443
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:01,802
Several of my friends
from the C.I.A.

444
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,238
Will be working with us
on this.

445
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,573
This is Ms. Kendall.

446
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:14,281
Arkady will be leaving
the Rezidentura in one hour.

447
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:16,650
In approximately
1 hour and 14 minutes,

448
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,819
Arkady will be
running his usual path

449
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,187
through Danbury Park.

450
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:22,423
Agent Samuels
will be sitting on a bench

451
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:23,858
30 meters up the path

452
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,360
from your post
at the interception point.

453
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:29,831
If he raises his newspaper,
that will be your signal

454
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,499
that the target
is in the field.

455
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,836
But if Agent Samuels
drops his paper at any point,

456
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,604
we will abort the mission.

457
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,873
Because of
the high value of the target,

458
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,608
any decision to take action

459
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,645
will be verified by us
through the signal.

460
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,947
Any questions?

461
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:58,993
Stan...

462
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:01,462
I'm glad you're with us.

463
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,864
Any word on Amador?

464
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:05,866
We're still working on it.

465
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:08,202
If we'd hit the KGB earlier,
they wouldn't have him.

466
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:09,937
Maybe. Who knows?

467
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:15,476
Listen, if we kill Arkady,

468
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:17,878
we're signing
Amador's death certificate.

469
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,413
We have to take him alive.

470
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,182
There's something else
we have to consider.

471
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,385
Amador knows the name of
your mole in the Rezidentura.

472
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:28,855
If the KGB has him
and he talks,

473
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:31,224
she's finished.

474
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,163
Henry's teacher called.

475
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:38,664
Why?

476
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:41,267
He was staring
out the window all day,

477
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:44,670
was not participating,
not talking in class.

478
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:48,841
How's Paige? She hates my guts

479
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:51,745
and isn't shy about
letting it be known.

480
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:54,414
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,283
How's Amador?

482
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:57,717
He's weak, but he's awake.

483
00:30:57,785 --> 00:30:59,085
Says he doesn't know anything.

484
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,188
He's lying. I know.

485
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:02,889
They're gonna be looking for him
all over town.

486
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:04,257
We have to get
the hell out of here.

487
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:05,759
No. He's too weak to move.

488
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,026
We can't wait for him
to come around.

489
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,429
We need information,
and we need it now.

490
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:12,265
It's my turn to try.

491
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:19,138
Da.

492
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,765
We've met before.

493
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,667
I don't think so.

494
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:50,503
I would have remembered.

495
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,640
In a bar.

496
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:56,775
We both had too much to drink.

497
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:58,644
And we screwed our brains out.

498
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,615
You couldn't get enough of me.

499
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:05,117
And you?

500
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:07,886
I came and went.

501
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,996
I don't know anything
about a hit.

502
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:20,699
If I did, I'd tell you, baby.

503
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,267
Scout's honor.

504
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:25,839
We both know that's not true.

505
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:32,345
You're gonna lose this war.

506
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:37,117
You know that, right?

507
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:41,154
You can torture me...

508
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:43,924
And you can kill me...

509
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:49,896
but we're gonna kick
your motherland's marbled ass,

510
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:54,701
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

511
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,975
He's en route.

512
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay. We're good to go.

513
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:07,748
Stand by.

514
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,694
Where's Arkady?

515
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:22,829
Abort.

516
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,731
Abort!

517
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,865
Grab him.

518
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,701
Our orders are to stand down.

519
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,269
To hell with that.
Grab him now.

520
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:34,574
What?!

521
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:37,978
Just keep your mouth shut.
Move, move.

522
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:50,839
God damn it, Beeman.

523
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,241
What the hell
did you think you were doing?

524
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:53,709
They got my partner.

525
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:55,111
What would you have done?

526
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,989
Go on.
We'll get into this later.

527
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:12,262
Uncuff him.

528
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:19,003
And his mouth.

529
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:34,253
Do you Hunt?

530
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,088
I don't understand.

531
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,524
Do you Hunt...

532
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:43,195
you know, shoot.
Kill things... animals.

533
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:45,330
No.

534
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:52,872
When you shoot a bird...
duck or pheasant, say...

535
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,940
your dog, your retriever,

536
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,243
picks it up in its mouth...
its soft mouth.

537
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,878
Soft mouth is key...

538
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:02,548
otherwise, the dog sinks his
teeth into the bird's flesh.

539
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:06,385
Anyway
your dog brings it to you

540
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:09,488
and lays it at your feet.

541
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,757
But sometimes,
when you shoot the bird,

542
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,826
it's not dead.

543
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:16,262
It's just wounded.

544
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,930
Strange thing is,

545
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:19,632
whether the bird
is dead or just wounded,

546
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,403
once the dog
gets it in its mouth,

547
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,804
the bird goes limp.

548
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,940
Like a rag... doesn't move.

549
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,443
It acts like it's dead.

550
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,244
Doesn't struggle or scream.

551
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:35,215
It just... Goes limp.

552
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,019
Don't you think that's strange?

553
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:47,693
You know what I think it is?

554
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:50,329
Fear.

555
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:52,632
The bird's scared
out of its goddamn mind.

556
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,903
Who wouldn't be? I know <i>I</i> would.

557
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,808
Then again,
maybe the bird is faking.

558
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:02,510
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:08,316
Maybe it wants you...
talking about the bird now...

560
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:11,119
to think it's dead

561
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,721
so when the dog
drops it out of its soft mouth

562
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,823
at its master's feet,

563
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:17,959
it can take off.

564
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,032
It works sometimes.

565
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,069
You wouldn't think it does,
but it does.

566
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:30,371
Not a lot.

567
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,240
Once in a blue moon.

568
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:36,576
Please, I swear...

569
00:36:36,644 --> 00:36:39,712
I'm not KGB.

570
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,015
I don't know anything.

571
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:46,485
Please... I swear.

572
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:51,190
You're scared. I know.

573
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:53,325
I would be, too,

574
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:56,529
because I've got you
in my soft mouth,

575
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:59,832
and you're not dead... not yet.

576
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,701
Maybe you think you can run

577
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,037
when I drop you
at my master's feet.

578
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:07,107
Maybe you can. Maybe you will.

579
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:11,577
But the thing is,
you have my partner.

580
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,847
If you don't
tell me where he is,

581
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:16,783
you will never get dropped
at my master's feet.

582
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,852
My bite will go hard,

583
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,255
and you will know you are dead

584
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,057
before
your heart stops beating.

585
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,726
Please, please,

586
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:30,129
I swear, I'm a diplomat.

587
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:33,032
I don't know.

588
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,601
Please.

589
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:38,271
Please.

590
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:44,244
I need morphine.

591
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,645
You'll get morphine

592
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:47,814
when you tell me
what I need to know.

593
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:54,988
What time is it?

594
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,293
It's after 5:00.

595
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,932
Arkady.

596
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,201
What?

597
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:11,238
Arkady.

598
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:12,973
The Rezident is the target.

599
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,142
Too late.

600
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,544
He's already dead.

601
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:29,256
Soviet embassy. May I help you?

602
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:32,760
I need to talk to
the head of cultural affairs.

603
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,195
What is this in reference to?

604
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:39,634
I have information
about Vladimir Kosygin.

605
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,337
One minute, please.

606
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,007
Hello?

607
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,375
To whom am I speaking?

608
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:49,377
I have him.

609
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:51,546
Your man. Vlad.

610
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:59,253
He's nobody.
He has nothing for you.

611
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:03,124
Well, that's probably true.

612
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:06,027
So, then, let him go.

613
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,995
Well,
it doesn't work like that.

614
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:10,131
Tell me, how does it work?

615
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:14,269
Amador... release him.

616
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:17,516
This man...

617
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:20,041
I do not know.

618
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:24,147
Listen to me.
Listen very carefully.

619
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:25,297
I'm listening.

620
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:29,851
If anything happens to amador,
vlad is dead.

621
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:33,076
I will personally
send you his balls

622
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:36,592
To wear around your neck
at your next may day parade.

623
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:52,452
_

624
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,130
_

625
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:55,727
_

626
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,259
_

627
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:01,524
_

628
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:03,860
_

629
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:08,358
_

630
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,214
_

631
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,266
_

632
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:21,002
Hello.

633
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:23,600
Hello!

634
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,390
- Arkady?
- Yes.

635
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,438
Arkady is alive and well.

636
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:38,269
- How do you know?
- I called the Rezidentura, I spoke to him.

637
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,447
- So we need to contact Grannie.
- I did.

638
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,045
She said there was a different target.

639
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,275
Vladimir Kosygin,
a first-tour officer.

640
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,975
Went out for a run,
never came back.

641
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,292
What I don't understand is why.

642
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,968
Why would amador lie
about Arkady being the target?

643
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,062
He fingers
the head of directorate "s"

644
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:55,702
To protect
a first-tour officer?

645
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:57,641
It doesn't make any sense.
He's playing us.

646
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,707
He's hiding something else.

647
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:03,857
What are you gonna do?

648
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,573
Whatever it takes to get him to talk.

649
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:08,395
I'll do it.

650
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,100
I'll <i>do</i> it.

651
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:14,994
I didn't want this to happen,
but it happened.

652
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:18,365
Things just got a little crazy,
you know?

653
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:19,388
Yeah.

654
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:24,133
I wouldn't let a dog suffer like this.

655
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:25,555
Would you?

656
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:28,209
No.

657
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:30,892
After he talks

658
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:32,586
give him the morphine.

659
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:34,088
Just let him drift off.

660
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:39,488
All right, Chris. No more time.

661
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:43,012
We need to know what you're holding back,
and we need to know n...

662
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,449
Goddamn it.

663
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,691
I'm gonna pull every Agent.

664
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,382
This will be the top priority.

665
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:00,683
It's family.

666
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,093
How did he die?

667
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:09,215
Slowly... he was stabbed.

668
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,507
He was dead before they
dumped him here.

669
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,902
What's strange is, that whoever did it

670
00:43:18,164 --> 00:43:20,226
then took the trouble
to try and save him.

671
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,885
It's probably to late

672
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,479
to exfiltrate your girl
in the Rezidentura.

673
00:43:28,407 --> 00:43:29,766
Amador didn't give her up.

674
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,237
Everybody talks, it's biology.

675
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,614
He didn't give her up.

676
00:43:38,347 --> 00:43:39,721
Gonna risk her life on that?

677
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,125
And mine.

678
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:16,082
Vietnam

679
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:17,951
turn you into a skirt chaser?

680
00:44:18,076 --> 00:44:20,172
I was straight as an arrow
when I signed up.

681
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:22,840
Was an altar boy `til I was seventeen.

682
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:23,911
- Really?
- Yeah.

683
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,653
`Nam changed things.

684
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,641
It was crazy shit over there.

685
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:31,964
You never knew when your number
was gonna be called.

686
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:34,457
I learned two things,

687
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:38,036
One, Tempus Fugit...
"time flies."

688
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,676
One way or the other,
you snatch it,

689
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:42,961
or it's gonna snatch you.

690
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,390
There's no pause button.

691
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:47,727
And, two...

692
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:50,838
there are worse things than dying.

693
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:53,954
- Like?
- Shame.

694
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,418
Shame is not an option for me.

695
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:03,574
I don't understand

696
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:06,662
How that has anything to do
with you chasing pussy.

697
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,787
[ Laughs )

698
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,620
Pussy is a thing,
and it's not a thing Stan.

699
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:13,161
It's real and it's not.

700
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,982
It's a metaphor.

701
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,932
For what?

702
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:19,121
The whole enchilada.

703
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,334
- Thank you.
- Mhmm.

704
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,765
What are you going to do?

705
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:09,562
Eat.

706
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,449
Enjoy.

707
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,607
So you're KGB right?

708
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,928
Come on we both know it's true,
I just wanna hear it.

709
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,713
Yes.

710
00:46:53,918 --> 00:46:55,132
But I don't know anything.

711
00:46:58,967 --> 00:46:59,782
I believe you.

712
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:04,752
That's good huh?

713
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:08,379
Mm, nothing beats American fast food.

714
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,550
It's probably filled with all kinds
of nasty shit that'll kill you, but man...

715
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,241
it sure taste good.

716
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:19,795
*** a drink?

717
00:47:21,913 --> 00:47:22,824
Yes please.

718
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:26,886
Think I have a Cola here.

719
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:54,040
