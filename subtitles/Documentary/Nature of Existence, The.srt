He came to us

He had lost the will
to sustain his existence.

With the raccoon.

It was terrible
for him,

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,980
But the life force
once again smiled upon him.

with danger.

Funny. It didn't

Just how good
are you?

You're an extreme

You recently returned
from a short trip to gotan.

Upon your return,

The urine stain

Quite nicely
with the native cultures

For the past
200 years.

They're almost
like family.

Are they?

282
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,130
It is imperative

That we recover
the sacred animal.

If not, the

The wachootoos
are bloodthirsty.

They consider
its disappearance

Both an insult
and a curse.

Mr. Ventura,

I'd like you
to meet hitu,

At this point,

We don't have
any leads,

But we've had
similar problems

In the past.

Mr. Mccane makes

Mr. Ventura!

In four days.

Before you go,
mr. Ventura,

There's something
I'd like to show you--

Something
you might enjoy--

As one animal lover

Of course not.

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,430
This is a lovely
room of death.

401
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Take care, now.

Aah!

406
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,050
Mr. Ventura,
how could you?

407
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,090
Oh!

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,570
Ch-ch. Pick. Pow!

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,070
Now, mr. Ventura,
I think the village

about a mile ahead.

Don't you?

416
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,020
Certainly.

417
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,520
I prostrate
myself before you

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,020
And beg
your forgiveness.

419
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,460
Don't get me wrong.

Of course you do.

The wachatis believe

They draw

From these caves,

But they now
live in fear

Mr. Ventura.

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,660
You didn't say anything
about a bat.

What's
the difference?

What's the difference?

Have you ever seen a bat?
They're hideous.

Yes. Quite.
I see your point.

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,580
But are you saying that
you won't take the case?

457
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,380
No. As a being
of light,

458
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,890
I must
show compassion

For all the living

Tell him I'm happy
to meet him

The chief really
seems to like you.

That is a great sign
of affection

In the wachati tribe.

The missionaries

That the sacred hut
is over there.

But only the wachati
are allowed to step there.

Some clue I've overlooked,
