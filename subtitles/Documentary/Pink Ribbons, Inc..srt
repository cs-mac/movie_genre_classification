1
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,471
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,471
Sleep tight, kiddo.

3
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,391
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

4
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,155
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

5
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,279
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

6
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,316
All right, Mr. Bile, is it?

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,868
Uh, my friends call me Phlegm.

8
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,191
Uh-huh. Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

9
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,909
- I fell down?
- No, no, before that.

10
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,675
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

11
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,716
Anyone?

12
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,353
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.

13
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,193
Uh, right...
buh, buh, buh, buh... Ah, there.

14
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,430
See? The door.
You left it wide open.

15
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,633
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake...

16
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,473
any employee can make because...

17
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,438
Um, it could let in a draught?

18
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,909
It could let in a child!

19
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,911
Oh, Mr. Waternoose!

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,596
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.

21
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,750
A single touch could kill you.

22
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,509
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory...

23
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,511
right into the monster world.

24
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,795
I won't go in a kid's room!
You can't make me!

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,714
You're going in there
because we need this.

26
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,278
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,352
Without scream, we have no power.

28
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,672
Yes, it's dangerous work, and that's why
I need you to be at your best.

29
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,596
I need scarers who are confident,
tenacious, tough, intimidating.

30
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,558
I need scarers like... like...

31
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,756
James P. Sullivan.

32
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,397
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's
now five after the hour of 6:00 A.M...

33
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,436
in the big monster city.

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,069
Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees,
which is good news for you reptiles...

35
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,039
and it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in...

36
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,432
or simply work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

37
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,954
Get up, Sulley!

38
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,713
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

39
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,519
Hey, less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy.

40
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,558
Feel the burn!
You call yourself a monster?

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,710
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Oh, the kid's awake!

42
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,519
Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary
feet, scary feet, scary... Kid's asleep!

43
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,075
Twins and a bunk bed!

44
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,153
Ooh, I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,676
You ready? Follow it.
Oh, it's over here. Oh, look over there.

46
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,990
Don't let the kid touch you!
Don't let it touch you!

47
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,356
<i>I don't know, but it's been said</i>
<i>I love scarin' kids in bed</i>

48
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,637
Come on, fight that plaque.
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,679
118. Do you have 119?
Do I see 120?

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,228
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- I'm not even breaking a sweat.

51
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,437
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on!

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,592
<i>The future is bright</i>
<i>at Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

53
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,069

- Hey, look! Betty!

56
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,430
<i>Carefully matching every child</i>

<i>Every time you turn something on,</i>
<i>Monsters, Incorporated is there.</i>

60
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,236
- <i>I'm Monsters, Incorporated.</i>
- <i>We know the challenge.</i>

61
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,438
<i>The window of innocence is shrinking.</i>
<i>Human kids are harder to scare.</i>

62
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,034
<i>Of course, MI is prepared</i>

<i>We're Monsters, Incorporated!</i>

67
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,078
<i>We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,628
<i>We scare because we care.</i>

69
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,190
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, Mike.

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,589
I was on TV!

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,353
Ah, did you see me?
I'm a natural!

72
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,353
Hello? I know! Hey, wasn't I great?
Did the whole family see it?

73
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,591
It's your mom.
What can I say? The camera loves me.

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,476
I'm telling you, big daddy,
you're gonna be seeing this face
on TV a lot more often.

75
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,996
Yeah?
Like on <i>Monstropolis's Most Wanted?</i>

76
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,992
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade, pal.

77
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,277
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- You too, hon.

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,238
- Ooh, okay, Sulley, hop on in.
- Nope. Uh-uh.

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,232
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? What are you doing?
- Mikey, there's a scream shortage.

80
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,231
- We're walking.
- Walking?
- Yup.

81
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,551
- No. Hey, no, no. Come on.
- Come on.
- My baby, look... She needs to be driven.

82
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,870
Bye, baby! I... I'll call you!

83
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,275
Hey, genius, y-you wanna know
why I bought the car, huh?

84
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,432
- Not really.
- To drive it. You know,
like on the street...

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,795
with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom
and no walking involved.

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,475
Give it a rest, will you, butterball?
Come on. You could use the exercise.

87
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,030
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
You-You-You have your own climate.

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,588
<i>How many tentacles jump the rope</i>

89
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,274
- Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley!
- <i>One and two and three</i>
- Hey, morning, kids!

90
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,399
- Hey, kids.
- How you doin'?
- Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!

91
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,277
Hey!

92
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,318
Aw, nuts.

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,239
- Hey, hey, hey, fellas!
- Hey, Tony!
- Tony!

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,834
- Hey, hey! Tony!
- Tony!

95
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,117
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,954
Ah, just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.

97
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,474
- Hey, on the house!
- Hey, thanks!

98
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,150
Oh, great.

99
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,357
Hey, Ted! Good morning!

100
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,030
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.

101
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,032
Big deal. Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,877
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

103
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,871
- Morning, Sulley.
- Morning, Ricky.

104
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,428
- Hey, it's the Sullster.
- See you on the scare floor, buddy.

105
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,956
- Hey, Marge. Hey, how was jury duty?
- Morning, Sulley!
- Hey!

106
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,072
- Hey, it's still leaning to the left.
- It is not!

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,675
- Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr. Sullivan!

108
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,638
Guys, I told ya...
call me Sulley.

109
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,871
- I don't think so.
- We just wanted to
wish you good luck today.

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,191
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

111
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,475
- Oh. Sorry.
- See you later, fellas.

112
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,676
- Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.
- Quiet!

113
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,276
- You're making him lose his focus.
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- Shut up!

114
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,989
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.

115
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,913
Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice mail?

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,275
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo!

117
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,112
Googley Bear!

118
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,034
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Googley-woogley, you remembered!

119
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,193
- Hey, Sulley-wulley.
- Oh, hey, Celia-weelia.

120
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,396
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

121
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,392
So, uh, are we going
anywhere special tonight?

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,110
I-I just got us into a little place
called, um, Harryhausen's.

123
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,079
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.

124
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,233
Not for Googley Bear. I will see you
at quittin' time and not a minute later.

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,153
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Think romantical thoughts.

126
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,151
<i>You and me</i>

127
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,835
<i>Me and you</i>
<i>Both of us together</i>

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,471
- You know, pal, she's the one.
That's it. She is the one.
- I'm happy for you.

129
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,074
Oh, and, uh, thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.

130
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,799
Oh, no problem.
They're under the name "Googley Bear."

131
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,952
Oh, good ide...
You know, that wasn't very funny.

132
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,396
- What the...
- Wazowski!

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,513
What do you know? It scares
little kids and little monsters.

134
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,391
- I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
- Uh-huh, sure.
- Hey, Randall.

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,836
- Save it for the scare floor, will you?
- I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,674
Gonna be doing some serious scaring,
putting up some big numbers.

137
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,117
Wow, Randall. That's great. That
should make it even more humiliating
when we break the record first.

138
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,279
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.

139
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,557
"You hear it? You hear
the winds of ch..." What a creep.

140
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,316
One of these days I am really
gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.

141
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,110
Chalooby baby.

142
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,672
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent little garden snail.

143
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,991
- And who would we be scaring today?
- Wazowski.

144
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,514
You didn't file
your paperwork last night.

145
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,594
Oh, that darn paperwork. Wouldn't
it be easier if it all just blew away?

146
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,478
Don't let it happen again.

147
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,836
Yes, well, I'll, uh,
I'll try to be less careless.

148
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,150
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

149
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,151
Always watching.

150
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,152
- Ooh, she's nuts.
- Always!

151
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,879
<i>All scare floors are now active.</i>

152
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,872
<i>Assistants,</i>
<i>please report to your stations.</i>

153
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,631
Okay, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming on-line.

154
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,551
We got scarers coming out!

155
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,713
Ooh, they're so awesome!

156
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,359
Hey, may the best monster win.

157
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,351
I plan to.

158
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,750
We are on in seven, six...

159
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,992
five, four, three, two...

160
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,710
You're the boss. You're the boss.
You're the big, hairy boss.

161
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,194
Oh, I'm feelin' good today, Mikey!
Yeah!

162
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,398
Oh! That-a-boy, that-a-boy.
Another door comin' right up.

163
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,236
You're still behind, Randall.
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve...

164
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,436
- Just get me another door!
- A door! Yes! Door!

165
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,555
Well, Jerry,
what's the damage so far?

166
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,029
We may actually make
our quota today, sir.

167
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,554
Hmm. First time in a month.

168
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,870
- What happened?
- The kid almost touched me.

169
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,953
- She got this close to me.
- She wasn't scared of you?
She was only six!

170
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,476
I could have been dead!
I could have died!

171
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,869
Keep it together, man.

172
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,394
Hey, we got a dead door over here!

173
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,835
- We're coming! Look out!
- Coming! Back away!

174
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,831
Excuse us!

175
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,709
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.

176
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,555
Oh, kids these days. They just
don't get scared like they used to.

177
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,551
Let 'er rip!

178
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,236
- Sir?
- What?

179
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,834
Look.

180
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,277
<i>Attention. We have a new scare leader...</i>
<i>Randall Boggs.</i>

181
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,516
Look at those numbers!

182
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,433
Slumber party.

183
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,311
- <i>Never mind.</i>
- Hey, watch it!

184
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,832
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.

185
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,195
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr. Waternoose.

186
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,192
Of course, I did learn
from the best.

187
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,953
If I don't see a new door
at my station in five seconds...

188
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,555
I will personally
put you through the shredder!

189
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,834
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

190
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,480
Are they? You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

191
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,120
- And, uh, how is Georgie doin'?
- He's doing great.

192
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,350
I love working
with that big guy.

193
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,510
Keep the doors comin', Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.

194
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,114
George and I are like brothers...

195
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,919
23-19! We have a 23-19!

196
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,033
<i>Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!</i>
<i>Red alert! Red alert!</i>

197
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,317
<i>George Sanderson,</i>
<i>please remain motionless.</i>

198
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,709
- <i>Prepare for decontamination.</i>
- Get it off! Get it off!

199
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,950
Duck and cover, people!

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,356
Oh, not the CD A!

201
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,674
- Move! Move! Move!
- Coming through, please. Step aside.

202
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,910
Clear the contaminated area.

203
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,754
- We have a 23-19 in progress.
- Keep the area clear.
- Coming through. Watch your step.

204
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,069
Stand back. Careful.

205
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,356
All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.

206
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,635
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.

207
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,631
Okay.

208
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,955
Okay, people, take a break.

209
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,395
We gotta shut down for a half hour
and reset the system.

210
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,951
An entire scare floor out of commission.
What else can go wrong?

211
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,556
Oh, what a day.

212
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,474
We're just going through
a rough time, sir. Everyone knows
you're gonna get us through it.

213
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,870
Tell that
to the board of directors.

214
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,272
James, this company has been
in my family for three generations.

215
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,432
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

216
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,829
- Well, so would I, sir.
- Well...

217
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,674
- Say, I could use
your help with something.
- Anything, sir.

218
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,675
You see, we've hired some new
scare recruits, and, frankly,
they're... they're, um, uh...

219
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,672
- Inexperienced?
- Oh, they stink!
- Uh-huh.

220
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,912
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow and,
uh, give them a demonstration...

221
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,912
show them what it takes
to be our top scarer, huh?

222
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,629
I'll start out with
the old Waternoose jump-and-growl.

223
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,033
Oh, yes, now, that's my boy!

224
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,031
Let's go, everybody. All doors
must be returned. No exceptions!

225
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,195
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.
- I've never seen anything
like you today.

226
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,398
- You were on a roll, my man.
- Another day like this,
and that scare record's in the bag.

227
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,756
- That's right, baby.
- Uh-huh!

228
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,396
So get this. As if dinner
wasn't enough, I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.

229
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,391
- Nice.
- What's on your agenda?

230
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,391
- I'm gonna head home
and work out some more.
- Again?

231
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,789
You know, there's more to life
than scaring.

232
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,791
Ooh.
Hey, can I borrow your odorant?

233
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,078
Yeah, I got, uh, Smelly Garbage
or Old Dumpster.

234
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,549
- You got, uh, Low Tide?
- No.
- How about Wet Dog?

235
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,551
Yep. Stink it up.

236
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,632
You know, I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should just marry myself.

237
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,678
- Give me a break, Mike.
- What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

238
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,230
Tonight is about me and Celia.

239
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,074
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

240
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,914
'Cause I gotta tell you,
buddy, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

241
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,911
Hello, Wazowski.

242
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,310
- Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
- Well, as a matter of fact...

243
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,190
Then I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly for once.

244
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,557
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

245
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,949
Oh, no, my scare reports.
I left them on my desk.

246
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,589
And if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes, they're gonna give
our table away. What am I gonna tell...

247
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,399
- Schmoopsie-poo.
- Hey, Googley Bear. Want to get going?

248
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,630
- Uh, do I ever. It's just that...
- What?

249
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,029
- You know, it... There's a small...
- I don't understand.

250
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,918
- It's just that...
- I-It's just that I forgot about
some paperwork I was supposed to file.

251
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,958
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.

252
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,996
I was? I mean, I was.
Yeah. I was.

253
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,275
- Oh. Okay. Let's go, then.
- We're going.

254
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,477
On my desk, Sulley.
The pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing...

255
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,915
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.

256
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,116
Leave the puce.

257
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,758
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

258
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,913
No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing,
the goldenrod ones go to Roz...

259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,389
Man, I have no idea what puce is.

260
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,231
Oh, that's puce.

261
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,711
Hmm?

262
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,635
Uh, hello! Anyone?

263
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,951
There's a door here. Hmm.

264
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,671
Hello. Hey.

265
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,877
Psst. Anybody scaring in here?

266
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,269
Hello. Yo.

267
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,395
Kitty!

268
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,119
No, no, stay back!

269
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,031
Hold it, hold it.

270
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,793
Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthda...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.

271
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,190
But this is the best birthday ever.

272
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,316
What are you looking at?

273
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,393
Oh, I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,
how pretty you looked.

274
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,994
- Stop it.
- Your hair was shorter then.
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,392
- I'm thinking about getting it cut.
- No, no, I-I like it this length.

276
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,391
I like everything about you.

277
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,189
Just the other day, someone asked me
who I thought the most beautiful
monster was in all of Monstropolis.

278
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,431
- Do you know what I said?
- What did you say?
- I said...

279
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,875
- Sulley?
- Sulley?
- No! No, no.

280
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,190
- That's not what I
was gonna say! I mean...
- Mike, you're not making sense.

281
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,350
- Sure, he's handsome,
I mean, for like a big, rugged...
- Hi, guys.

282
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,556
What a coincidence
running into you here. Uh...

283
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,870
- I'm just gonna order something to go.
- Michael.
- Sulley.

284
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,679
- Uh, I wonder what's good here. Hmm.
- Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

285
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,877
- I went back to get your paperwork,
and there was a door.
- What?

286
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,791
- A door?
- Randall was in it.

287
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,952
Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.

288
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,951
- There's something else.
- What?

289
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,679
- What?
- Look in the bag.

290
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,830
What bag?

291
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,199
- They don't have anything I like here!
So take care, Celia!
- Excuse me, sir.

292
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,239
- Michael, what's going on?
- Celia, please try to understand.

293
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,788
- I have to do something!
- Michael!

294
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,509
- Oh, that's good.
- On three. One, two...

295
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,431
- A kid!
- Boo!

296
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,951
A kid!

297
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,350
There's a kid here!
A human kid!

298
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,631
Googley Bear!

299
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,199
Come on!

300
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,471
Let's get outta here!

301
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,994
<i>Please remain calm.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

302
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
78-35 in progress.
Please advise.

303
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,870
- Michael? Michael!
- Celia!
- Please come with me.

304
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,554
- Stop pushing.
- Hey, get your hands
off my Schmoopsie-poo!

305
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,552
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

306
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,552
Well, I don't think that date
could've gone any worse.

307
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,189
<i>If witnesses are to be believed, there</i>
<i>has been a child security breach...</i>

308
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,191
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in monster history.</i>

309
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,829
<i>We can neither confirm nor deny the</i>
<i>presence of a human child here tonight.</i>

310
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,879
<i>Well, a kid flew right over me</i>
<i>and blasted a car with its laser vision.</i>

311
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,272
<i>I tried to run from it,</i>
<i>but it picked me up with its mind</i>
<i>powers and shook me like a doll.</i>

312
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,476
<i>It's true!</i>
<i>I saw the whole thing!</i>

313
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,869
<i>It is my professional opinion...</i>

314
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,191
<i>that now is the time to panic.</i>

315
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,236
Uh-oh.

316
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,751
Oh, it's coming! It's coming!

317
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,791
Boo!

318
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,191
Come here, kid!

319
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,469
No, don't touch those,
you little... Oh!

320
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,279
Now, those were alphabetized.
It's okay. It's all right.

321
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,352
As long as it doesn't come near us,
we're gonna be okay.

322
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,278
Oh, y-you like this? Fetch!

323
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,872
Hey, hey, that's it!
No one touches little Mikey.

324
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,957
Mike, give her the bear.

325
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,319
Oh, no.

326
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,791
Make it stop, Sulley!
Make it stop!

327
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,111
Here, look. Here, see the bear?
Here. Ooh, nice bear.

328
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,350
Sulley!

329
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,193
Ooh, bear! Ooh!
Ooh, he's a happy bear!

330
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,239
And he's not crying, and neither
should you, or we'll be in trouble
'cause they're gonna find us.

331
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
So please stop crying right now.

332
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,635
- Good. Good, Sulley.
Keep it up. You're doing great.
- I'm a happy bear, yeah.

333
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,999
- Oh, she touched me! It touched me!
- Sulley, the bear!

334
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,071
The bear! Give me the...

335
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,196
What was that?

336
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,115
I have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.

337
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,479
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?

338
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,075
- This could destroy the company.
- The company?
Who cares about the company?

339
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,913
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine!

340
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,711
I bet it's just waiting for us
to fall asleep, and then wham!

341
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,679
Oh, we're easy prey, my friend.
Easy prey. We're sitting targets.

342
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,796
Okay, look,
I think I have a plan here.

343
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,917
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city...

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,389
and release it into the wild.

345
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,391
Spoons.

346
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,948
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
We're closed.

347
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,270
Hot air balloon? Too expensive.
Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous.

348
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,954
Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek.

349
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,319
No plan. I can't think.
Can't think. Flatlining.

350
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,949
- Flatlining.
- Uh, Mike, I think she's getting tired.

351
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,669
Well, then why don't you find
someplace for it to sleep...

352
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,877
while I think of a plan!

353
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,635
Are you sleepy? You want to sleep?
Is that what you want?

354
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,188
Huh?

355
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,552
Okay. All right. I'm making
a nice little area for you to...

356
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,712
No. Hey, hey. That's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.

357
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,069
Fine. My chair's
more comfortable anyway.

358
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,710
What?

359
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,391
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?

360
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,594
Hey, that looks like Randall.

361
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,989
Randall's your monster.

362
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,594
You think he's gonna come
through the closet and scare you.

363
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,150
Oh, boy. How do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.

364
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,277
See?
No monster in here.

365
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,719
Well, now there is, but, uh,
I-I'm not gonna scare you.

366
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,916
I'm off duty.

367
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,318
Okay. How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?

368
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,835
Go ahead. Uh, go to sleep. Now.

369
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,115
Now. Go.

370
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,431
Uh, you go...

371
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,431
to sleep.

372
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,035
Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

373
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,953
Really?
Well, in that case let's keep it.

374
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,554
- I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!
- Now, look.

375
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,790
- What if we just
put her back in her door?
- What?

376
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,792
Mike, think about it. If we send her
back, it's like it never happened.

377
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,396
- Everything goes back to normal.
- Is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.

378
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,596
Sulley, I'd like to think
that given the circumstances...

379
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,911
I've been extremely forgiving up to now,
but that is a horrible idea.

380
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,390
What are we gonna do, march
right out into public with that thing?

381
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,869
Then we just waltz right up
to the factory, right?

382
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,510
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

383
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,639
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric
are not gonna fool anyone.

384
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,235
Just think about a few names,
will ya? Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman.

385
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,834
They all got one thing
in common, pal: banishment.

386
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,480
- We could be next!
- Don't panic. We can do this.

387
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,596
- Hey, how you doin', Frank?
- Hey, guys.

388
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,717
Everything's going to be okay.

389
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,512
- Number One wants
this place dusted for prints.
- Careful with that.

390
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,990
- I got a good view from here.
- A little lower.

391
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,036
This was recovered at the scene.

392
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,031
- Don't panic. Don't panic.
- Don't tell me not to panic.

393
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,918
- Just keep it together. Stay cool.
- Everything is not okay. It's not okay.
- Boo!

394
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,197
- Could be contaminated.
- Gentlemen, safety is
our number-one concern.

395
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,158
- Now, if there's anything that...
- Boo.
- No, not now, not now, and...

396
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,391
Oh, hello, little one.
Where did you come from?

397
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,948
- Mr. Waternoose!
- Ah, James, is this one yours?

398
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,794
Uh, actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's, uh, daughter, sir.

399
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,589
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh,
Bring An Obscure Relative To Work Day.

400
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,591
Hmm. Must've missed the memo.

401
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,309
Well, listen, James, why don't you stop
by the simulator after lunch today...

402
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,312
and give us that scare demonstration
we talked about, huh?

403
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,755
- Yeah...
Oh! Oh, sir, uh, today might be...
- Excuse me, Mr. Waternoose.

404
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,594
Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then.
I'll see you this afternoon, James.

405
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,592
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

406
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,150
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, a scare demo. Well, that is great.
Why am I the last to know?

407
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,358
We can bring your cousin's sister's
daughter along. She'll be a big hit.

408
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,034
Halt! Stop him!

409
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,076
Hold him down.

410
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,399
Come on. The coast is clear. Okay, all
we have to do is get rid of that thing.

411
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,391
So wait here while
I get its card key.

412
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,836
But she can't stay here.
This is the men's room.

413
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,878
That is the weirdest thing you have
ever said. It's fine. It's okay.

414
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,509
Look, it loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.

415
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,511
I'll be right back
with its door key.

416
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,954
That's a cute little dance you've got.
That almost looks like you gotta...

417
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,431
Oh!

418
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,517
Uh, are you done in there?

419
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,951
Sorry. Sorry.

420
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,271
Okay, you finished now, right?
Hello.

421
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,999
Boo!

422
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,200
Where did she go?

423
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,191
Did she disappear?

424
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,271
Did she turn invisible?

425
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,476
I just have no idea.

426
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,678
- Gotcha!
- Boo!

427
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,037
Hey, you're good.

428
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,872
Be relaxed, be relaxed,
be relaxed.

429
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,270
Roz, my tender, oozing blossom,
you're looking fabulous today.

430
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,591
Is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me.
It's a new haircut, isn't it?

431
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,990
It's got to be a new haircut.
New make-up. You've had a lift, you've
had a tuck, you've had something.

432
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,038
Something has been inserted
in your skin that makes you look like...

433
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,468
Listen, I need a favor.
Randall was working late last night
out on the scare floor.

434
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,915
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

435
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,151
Well, isn't that nice?

436
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,949
But guess what. You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

437
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,828
- He didn't... I... No p-paperwork?
- This office is now closed.

438
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,314
Ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer. Any second now.

439
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,834
Fee, fi, fo...

440
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,071
- What are you doing?
- I-I'm-I'm looking for the kid.

441
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,993
- You lost it?
- No, no. She was just, uh...

442
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,635
Here she is...
Hey, what's the matter?

443
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,748
- Look, I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.
- All right. Carry on.

444
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,993
Randall, thank goodness!
What are we gonna do about the child?

445
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,389
Will you... shh!

446
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,110
The front page! It's on the front page.
The child, the one you were after!

447
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,192
Will you be quiet? Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?

448
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,396
I was up all night trying to find it.

449
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,998
I-I did a simple calculation, factoring
in the size of the sushi restaurant.
The child may have escaped!

450
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,436
Yeah, well, until we know
for sure, we're gonna act like
nothing happened, understand?

451
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,432
You just get the machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.

452
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,035
And when I find whoever let it out,
they're dead!

453
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,279
- Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!
- Oh. Yes, go, go, go!

454
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,715
Now, now, now, now!
I'm not here!

455
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,711
They're gone.

456
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,591
This is bad.
This is so very bad.

457
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,274
- What were they
talking about, a machine?
- Who cares?

458
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,591
Look, don't panic.
All we have to do is call
her door down and send her home.

459
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,992
You're right. You're right.
We're just two regular Joes on our way
to work. We will blend right in.

460
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,799
- Top of the mornin', fellas.
- Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

461
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,996
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?

462
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,755
- You have her card key, right?
- Of course I have her card key.
I told you I'd get her card key.

463
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,150
I went and got her card key,
and now I have her card key.

464
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,276
Okay, here we go.

465
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,797
Take care of yourself.
Try not to run through any more closets.

466
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,192
- Mike, that's not her door.
- What are you talking about?
Of course it's her door. It's her door.

467
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,589
- No, her door was white.
- No.
- And it had flowers on it.

468
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,798
No. It must have been dark last night,
because this is its door.

469
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,839
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun
in there. Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

470
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,358
That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 "Mike
Wazowski, You Got Your Life Back" Lane.

471
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,477
Very good. Now, bon voyage.
Bye-bye! Come on!

472
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,155
Look at the stick. See the stick?
Go get the stick. Go fetch.

473
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,391
- Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
- Boo? What's Boo?

474
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,438
That's what I decided to call her.
Is there a problem?

475
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,431
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

476
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,988
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.

477
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,312
Now, put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me...

478
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,755
Oh, hey, we're rehearsing a-a scene for
the upcoming company play called, uh...

479
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,195
<i>Put That Thing Back Where It Came From,</i>
<i>Or So Help Me.</i>

480
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,068
It's a musical. Yeah.
<i>Put that thing back where it came from</i>
<i>or so help me</i>

481
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>So help me, so help me</i>
And cut!

482
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,469
We're still working on it. It's a work
in progress, but, hey, we need ushers.

483
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,994
Sulley, I've had enough.
Now say goodbye to...

484
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,355
- Where'd it go? What'd you do with it?
- Where is she?

485
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,351
- I don't believe it.
She got away from you again?
- Boo!

486
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,795
Well, that is just... Wait a minute.

487
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,590
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect. She's gone!

488
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,796
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? Sulley, please.

489
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,189
Don't blow this, not when we're
so close to breaking the record!

490
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,748
Come on,
somebody else will find the kid.
It'll be their problem, not ours.

491
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,559
She's out of our hair!

492
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,598
- What are you two doing?
- They're rehearsing a play.

493
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,878
- <i>She's out of our hair</i>
- Can it, Wazowski.

494
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,713
So what do you think of that kid getting
out, Sullivan? Pretty crazy, huh?

495
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,552
Oh, yeah. Crazy.

496
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,949
Word on the street is the kid's
been traced back to this factory.

497
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,474
- You haven't seen anything, have you?
- Uh, well, uh...

498
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,471
No. No way.

499
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,314
But if it was an inside job,
uh, I-I'd put my money on Waxford.

500
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,756
- Waxford?
- Yeah, the one on station six.
You know, he's got them shifty eyes.

501
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,354
- Hey, Waxford!
- Sulley!

502
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,432
Michael Wazowski!

503
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,599
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none.

504
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,393
- I thought you cared about me.
- Honey, please, Schmoopsie.

505
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,711
- I thought you liked sushi.
- Sushi? Sushi?

506
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,236
- You think this is about sushi?
- Schmoopsie!

507
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,759
- Wazowski!
- Michael! Mi... Men!

508
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,998
Breathe. Keep breathing.

509
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,758
- Where's the kid?
- Kid? What kid?

510
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,037
- It's here in the factory, isn't it?
- You're not pinning this on me.

511
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,588
It never would've gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.

512
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,591
Cheating?

513
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,910
Cheating. Right.

514
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,390
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

515
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,109
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?

516
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,910
- Uh, I get a timeout?
- Everyone goes to lunch.

517
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,549
Which means
the scare floor will be...

518
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,991
- Painted?
- Empty!

519
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,595
It'll be empty, you idiot!
You see that clock?

520
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,798
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up...

521
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,314
the kid's door
will be in my station.

522
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,472
But when the big hand points down...

523
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,551
the door will be gone.

524
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,679
You have until then to put the kid back.
Get the picture?

525
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,389
Boo! No!

526
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,597
- Hey, you! Halt! He's the one.
- Uh...

527
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,069
- The one from the commercial.
- Affirmative. That's him.

528
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,197
- Can we get an autograph?
- Ohh! Oh, sure. No problem.

529
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,953
If you could make that out
to Stephanie, my daughter.

530
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,591
Yes. Let's see.
From your scary friend, best wishes.

531
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,753
So I said, "If you talk to me
like that again, we're through!"

532
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,753
- What'd she say?
- You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.

533
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,594
- See you guys later. Take it easy.
- Thanks a lot.
- Bottoms up.

534
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,991
Boo!

535
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,195
Hey.

536
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,477
Oh! Well, hello there.
What's your name?

537
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,278
Mike Wazowski!

538
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,956
Sulley! Oh! Sulley.

539
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,600
Okay, Sulley, come on, come on.

540
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,399
- Hey, you guys seen Sulley anywhere?
- Nope. Sorry.

541
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,109
- Oh, Sulley!
- Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

542
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,599
- 23-19! We have a 23-19!
- Halt!

543
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,558
- Oh, dear.
- Get him!

544
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,393
Sulley! Sulley!

545
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,395
Sulley! Oh! Great news, pal!

546
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,598
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry. Where is it?

547
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,512
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.
Uh-oh.

548
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,672
I-I can still hear her little voice.

549
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,115
- Mike Wazowski!
- Hey, I can hear her too.

550
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,714
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!
- How many kids you got in there?

551
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,712
- Mike Wazowski!
- Mike Wazowski!

552
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,711
- Kitty!
- Boo!

553
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,948
Boo, are you all right?
I was so worried! I was...

554
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,191
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady.

555
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,840
Oh, but I'm so glad you're safe.

556
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,549
Oh, my, what an affectionate father.

557
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,870
Uh, actually, she's my, uh,
my cousin's sister's...

558
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,918
- Okay, Sulley, that's enough. Let's go.
- Mike Wazowski!

559
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Step aside, kid. We're in a...

560
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,278
- Will you stop making Boo laugh!
- I didn't! Come on!

561
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,271
- I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?
- I'll explain later. Run.

562
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,035
Okay, let's move, let's move, let's
move. Come on. Oh, please be there,
please be there, please be there.

563
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,319
- There it is, just like Randall said.
- Randall? Wait a minute. Whoa. Hey.

564
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,311
1-2-3-4, get the kid
back through the door.

565
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,119
- Hey. Hey.
- We're gonna get our lives back.
The nightmare is over!

566
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,510
- Hey, it's okay, Boo.
- Hey, what's the matter?
Come on, it's time to move!

567
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,433
Mike, what are you thinking?
We can't trust Randall. He's after Boo.

568
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,354
- Who cares? Let's go.
This is a limited-time offer.
- No, no. I don't like this.

569
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,750
Look, Sulley, you wanted her door,
and there it is. Now let's move.

570
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,877
- No, Mike.
- You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up? Fine.

571
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,916
- He wants the door, I get the door.
He don't want the door.
- Mike, wait.

572
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,070
He's a paranoid, delusional fur ball.

573
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,151
Mike!

574
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,239
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

575
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,231
Sulley? Sulley?

576
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,514
Huh? Mike.

577
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,591
Mike.

578
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,797
Where are you?
Are you in there?

579
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,916
Where are you, buddy?

580
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,309
Mike, where are you?

581
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,274
Boo, way to go!

582
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,389
It's okay.

583
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,990
Oh, Randall, did you take care
of that situation?

584
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,311
Yeah, of course I did. Let's get going.
We gotta make up for lost time.

585
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,470
- You got the extra scream cans?
- Uh, right.

586
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,553
- So to confirm, then, you did find the...
- Yes, I got the kid!

587
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,108
Oh, huzzah! That's great news!

588
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,317
- Not that I was concerned,
of course. I knew that...
- Just get over here and help me.

589
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,995
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
While we're young here, Fungus.

590
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,635
Kid needs to
take off a few pounds.

591
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,357
Wazowski! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

592
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,432
Okay, first of all, it's cretin.
If you're gonna threaten me,
do it properly.

593
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,354
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me is gonna
help you cheat your way to the top.

594
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,952
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

595
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,874
Well, I did, right up until
you chuckled like that.

596
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,077
And, uh, now I'm thinkin'
I should just get out of here.

597
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,869
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry, and when I do...

598
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,714
even the great James P. Sullivan
is gonna be working for me.

599
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,792
Well, somebody's
certainly been a busy bee.

600
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,952
First I need to know where the kid is,
and you're gonna tell me.

601
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,951
- Yeah, I don't know anything.
- Uh-huh. Sure.

602
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,554
I-I don't. I mean, I don't.

603
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,757
Uh-oh. What's that? Wait.

604
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,434
Come on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh, come on.

605
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,556
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

606
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,995
This thing is moving.

607
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,470
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.

608
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,358
No, come on. Hey! Randall!

609
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,199
Say hello
to the Scream Extractor.

610
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,998
Hello.

611
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,799
Come on. Where you going? We-We'll talk.
Come on, we'll have a latte.

612
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,553
- Come on! We can talk about this.
- Whoa!

613
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,474
What's that thing? What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!

614
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,710
Oh! No, come on, guys!

615
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,919
Help! Help! Help! Help!

616
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,708
Oh, for...
What did you do wrong this time?

617
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,236
- I-I don't know.
I calibrated the drive...
- Go check the machine!

618
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,788
Th-There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

619
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,678
- Yeah, th-that's the problem
with these 32-50 units, boss.
- Huh?

620
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,354
See, the old intake valve
is always the first thing to go.

621
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,557
I-I told them this.

622
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,111
Psst. Fungus. Fungus.

623
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,715
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.

624
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,998
You let me go,
I'll give you a ride in the car.

625
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,275
- Please, Fungus?
- I'm sorry, Wazowski.

626
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,239
But Randall said
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

627
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,430
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?

628
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,955
Where is he?

629
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,634
- Come on.
- This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

630
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,269
- Careful with that.
Could be contaminated.
- We gotta get out of here now!

631
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,476
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

632
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,597
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.

633
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,240
- No, Mike. Wait.
- Hey, what are you doin'?

634
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,472
- Follow me. I have an idea.
- No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,791
- <i>Simulation terminated.</i>
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

636
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,634
What was that? You're trying to
scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

637
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,794
I was going for a snake-slash-ninja
approach with a little hissing.

638
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,075
Oh, how many times
do I have to tell you?

639
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,312
It's all about presence,
about how you enter the room.

640
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,278
- Mr. Waternoose!
- James. Perfect timing.

641
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,434
- No, no, no, sir, you don't understand.
- Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.
- What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir!

642
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,476
- You have to listen to me.
- Pay attention, everyone.

643
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,835
- You're about to see
the best in the business.
- Sir, I c...

644
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,593
- Reset the simulator.
- But, but, sir...

645
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,591
- <i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>
- <i>Good night, Mom.</i>

646
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,033
- <i>Sleep tight, kiddo.</i>
- Kitty!
- No, Boo. No, no!

647
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,079
- Now, give us a big, loud roar.
- Mr. Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

648
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,720
- Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for? Roar!
- B-B-But, sir...

649
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,711
- Roar!
- Ohh.

650
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,314
- Well done. Well done, James.
- Boo?

651
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,030
- All right, gentlemen.
- Right this way, everyone.
- I hope you've learned
a valuable lesson in scaring today.

652
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,630
Boo?

653
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,630
Boo?

654
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,796
Boo, it's me.

655
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,279
- The child!
- Sir, she isn't toxic.
- What?
- I know it sounds crazy, but trust me.

656
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,318
- Sulley...
- Boo? No, no, no, no, it's okay.

657
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,595
I was just...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

658
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,595
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real. It's just a...

659
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,796
I was just...

660
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,839
- Boo.
- And he was gonna test it out
on that sweet little girl.

661
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,388
- Boo?
- Now that we have her,
he is trying to kill us.

662
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,391
- This whole thing is Randall's fault.
- Randall?

663
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,552
Yes, and we can take you
to his secret lab which is
right here in this factory.

664
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,350
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

665
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,432
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No, sir.

666
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,069
Good. This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

667
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,349
Now, before we do anything else...

668
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,477
let's take care of the child.

669
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,912
Oh, I never thought things would
come to this. Not in my factory.

670
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,596
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up
in this, especially you, James.

671
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,708
But now we can set everything straight
again for the good of the company.

672
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,158
- Uh, sir, that's not her door.
- I know, I know.

673
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,758
It's yours.

674
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,473
No!

675
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,669
Boo!

676
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,593
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!

677
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,431
It's too late! We're banished, genius.
We're in the human world!

678
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,751
Oh, what a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.

679
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,876
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

680
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,555
All you had to do was listen to me,
just once!

681
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,359
But you didn't, did you?

682
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,000
You're still not listening!

683
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,431
Take that!

684
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,349
Welcome to the Himalayas!

685
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,390
Abominable! Can you believe that?
Do I look abominable to you?

686
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,918
Why can't they call me the Adorable
Snowman or, or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

687
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,594
I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?

688
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,189
No, no, no, don't worry.
It's lemon.

689
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,193
Uh, how 'bout you, big fella?
Snow cone?

690
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,110
Did you see the way
she looked at me?

691
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,792
Ah, poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.

692
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,591
Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot.
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

693
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,150
Wore it on his head like a tiara.
Called himself King Itchy.

694
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,710
It won't be so hard for you guys though,
you know. I mean, how lucky can you get?

695
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,997
- Banished with your best friend.
- He is not my friend.

696
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,755
Oh. I-I just assumed you were buddies,
you know, when I saw you out there
in the snow hugging and all, I...

697
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,958
Look at that big jerk. Ruined my life,
and for what? A stupid kid!

698
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,476
Because of you, I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland!

699
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,870
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.

700
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,155
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

701
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,313
Oh, and wait till you see the local
village. Cutest thing in the world.

702
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,595
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

703
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,069
- Wait. What did you say?
- Uh, yak's milk.

704
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,196
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic...

705
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,555
but, you know, once you pick
the hairs out, it's very nutritious.

706
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,870
No, no, something about a village.
Where? Are there kids in it?

707
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,430
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

708
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,590
- Where is it?
- Ah, hey, hey!
It's at the bottom of the mountain.

709
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,478
- Around a three-day hike.
- Oh! Three days?

710
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,757
We need to get there now!

711
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,239
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one out here.

712
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,675
Always... No.

713
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,671
Never go out in a blizzard.

714
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,797
We need to get to Boo.

715
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,793
Boo? What about us?

716
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,758
Ever since that kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said.

717
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,149
And now look where we are!

718
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,913
Oh, we were about to break
the record, Sulley.

719
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,389
- We would have had it made.
- None of that matters now.

720
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,275
None of it matters?
W-W-Wait a second.

721
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,316
None of it matters?

722
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,597
Okay, that's, uh... No. Good. Great.

723
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,875
So now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

724
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,193
Oh, would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.

725
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,750
Uh, let me just go outside
and make some more.

726
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,789
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

727
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,235
Does that matter, huh?

728
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,276
What about Celia?

729
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,480
I am never... never gonna see her again.
Doesn't that matter?

730
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,229
And what about me?

731
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,551
I'm your pal.
I'm-I'm-I'm your best friend.

732
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,995
Don't I matter?

733
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,073
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

734
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,472
I didn't mean for this to happen.
But Boo's in trouble.

735
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,438
I think there might be a way to save her
if we can just get down to that...

736
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,159
We? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We?

737
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,949
No, there's no "we" this time, pal.

738
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,635
I-If-If-If you want to go out there
and freeze to death...

739
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,075
you be my guest...

740
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,879
because you're on your own.

741
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,148
Hey, I got more snow cones!

742
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,073
Oh, come on now, George.
I know you can do this.

743
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,436
I picked out an easy door for you
in Nepal.

744
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,431
Nice, quiet Nepal.

745
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,273
You know, you're right.
Here, take this.

746
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,636
- Go get 'em, Georgie!
- Gangway! Look out! Comin' through!

747
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,235
- Sorry, George.
- What the...
- Hey, you can't just...

748
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,629
Twenty-three-nine...

749
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,508
- Out of the way!
- Hey!

750
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,273
Help!

751
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,593
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.

752
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,240
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.

753
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,754
Ah, with this machine,
we won't need scarers.

754
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,796
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

755
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,713
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.

756
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,315
Kitty!

757
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,919
- Kitty!
- Sullivan?

758
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,995
- Kitty!
- Sorry, Boo.

759
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,514
Stop him!

760
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,909
Let's get you home.

761
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,830
Finish him off!

762
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,868
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan!

763
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,228
- Mike?
- Look, it's not that I don't
care about the kid.

764
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,357
- Mike, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all.

765
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,637
I needed some time to think. But
you shouldn't have left me out there.

766
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,477
- I'm being attacked.
- No, I'm not attacking you.
I-I-I'm trying to be honest.

767
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,028
Just hear me out.
Look, you and I are a team.

768
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,350
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

769
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,351
I-I-I know, kid.
He-He's too sensitive.

770
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,709
Come on, pal,
if you start crying I'm gonna cry
and I'll never get through this.

771
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,997
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.

772
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,959
Hey, Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you could do is pay attention.

773
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,628
Hey, look at that.
It's Randall. It's...

774
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,393
- Oh.
- Come on!

775
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,393
- Get up! There can't be any witnesses.
- There won't be.

776
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,311
- I'm glad you came back, Mike.
- Somebody's gotta take care you,
you big hair ball.

777
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,910
- Schmoopsie-poo, I really can't talk.
- Come on!

778
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,470
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through!

779
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,676
- Do you hear me? Through!
- Okay, here's the truth.

780
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,671
You know the kid that they're
looking for? Sulley let her in.

781
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,990
We tried to send her back,
but Waternoose had this secret plot...

782
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,355
and now Randall's right behind us,
and he's trying to kill us.

783
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,557
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?

784
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,868
Mike Wazowski!

785
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,352
- I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
- Will you move it? Hey! Look out.

786
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,158
Idiot!

787
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,913
- Look out.
Coming through here. Coming through.
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Make way. Move it!

788
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,753
Hurry up. Hurry up.

789
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,434
- There they are!
- <i>Attention, employees.</i>

790
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,115
<i>Randall Boggs has just broken</i>
<i>the all-time scare record.</i>

791
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,795
Huh? No, I didn't.
Get out of my way! Let me go!

792
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,872
Go get 'em, Googley Bear.

793
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,555
- There it is!
- Get off my tail. Let me go!

794
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,711
- Sulley, what are you doing?
- Grab on, Mike.
- Are you out of your mind?

795
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,271
- Sulley, what are we doing?
- We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

796
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,716
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane!

797
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,072
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold on!

798
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,798
- Wow!
- Don't look down!

799
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,918
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

800
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,749
Oh, no!

801
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,795
No!

802
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,155
- Boo's door!
- There it is!

803
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,674
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

804
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,553
Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley.
There he is.

805
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,835
- Make her laugh!
- What? Sulley!
- Just do it!

806
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,632
Ow!

807
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,556
- Get it open!
- Here he comes.

808
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,631
Give me that kid!

809
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,635
- Why couldn't we get banished here?
- Come on. We gotta find another door.

810
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,752
Look! Boo's door!

811
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,550
- There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Give me your hand.

812
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,674
- Come on. It slides, it slides.
- Ooh, right, right, right.

813
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,154
Jump! I'm right behind you.

814
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,718
Come on!

815
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,959
- Hurry up! Keep moving!
- Get inside!

816
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,470
That was weird.

817
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,596
Mike? Ooh, sorry, buddy.

818
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,991
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.

819
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,480
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.

820
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,278
Boo!

821
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,312
Nice workin' with ya!

822
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,439
- Get it open!
- I'm trying!
- Open the door!
- Come on! Get in here!

823
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,235
Boo!

824
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,430
There they are!

825
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,279
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!

826
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,878
- Looks like we caught the express, pal!
- Do you see 'em?

827
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,678
Straight ahead!

828
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,912
- Kitty!
- Boo!

829
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,277
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now!

830
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,636
You stupid, pathetic waste!

831
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:01,150
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up!

832
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,597
And don't worry,
I'll take good care of the kid.

833
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,148
No!

834
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,832
She's not scared of you any more.

835
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,230
Looks like you're out of a job.

836
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,108
All right. Come on. Over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff here, pal. Come
on, now. Chuck 'im. Chuck 'im, baby.

837
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,509
- Hey, please, don't! Don't!
- Hum, baby, hum, baby. Here's the pitch.

838
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,751
And he is out of here!

839
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,990
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

840
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,470
Another gator?
Give me that shovel! Come here!

841
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,233
Get it, Ma!
Get that gator!

842
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,278
- Care to do the honors, Mikey?
- With pleasure.

843
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,594
That's right, Boo.
You did it! You beat him.

844
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,033
Come on.

845
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:19,158
Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, okay?

846
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,038
- Oh, no!
- The power's out. Make her laugh again.

847
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,078
All right. I got a move here.
It'll bring down the house.

848
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,999
- Oh, sorry. She didn't see that.
- What? What'd you do, forget to check
if her stupid hood was up? You big dope!

849
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,072
Uncle Mike,
try not to yell in front of her.

850
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,720
- You know we still need her to laugh.
- Right.

851
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,439
Hey, Boo! Just kidding. Look!

852
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,832
Funny, right, huh? See, with the...
These are the jokes, kid.

853
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,151
- What's happening?
- Hold on!

854
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,155
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.

855
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:58,633
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.

856
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,315
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?

857
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,277
This is the CD A. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.

858
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,558
Okay. Okay. You got us.
Here we are. Here's the kid.

859
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,679
I'm cooperating. But before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.

860
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,197
- Catch!
- 23-19!
- 23-19!

861
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,477
- We have a toxic projectile.
Isolate the contaminate.
- Halt!

862
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,677
- After the suspect!
- Clear the area!
- Stop him!

863
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,909
- Come on.
- Don't let them get away.

864
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,278
What? Wait, wait! Come back!
He has the child!

865
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,150
Sullivan? Sullivan!
Give me the child!

866
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,396
Give her to me!

867
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,952
Open this door! Open this door!

868
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,319
Sullivan! Don't do it.

869
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,075
- Come on.
- Don't go in that room!

870
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,478
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.

871
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,472
You be a good girl, okay?

872
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,755
This has gone far enough, James.

873
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,354
- She's home now.
Just leave her alone.
- I can't do that!

874
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,034
She's seen too much.
You both have.

875
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,873
- It doesn't have to be this way.
- I have no choice!

876
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,112
- Times have changed.
Scaring isn't enough any more.
- But kidnapping children?

877
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,158
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die!

878
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,631
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!

879
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,314
- No!
- <i>Good night, Mom.</i>
- <i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

880
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,960
- What? What? Wh-Wh-What is this?
- <i>Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom.</i>

881
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,350
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

882
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,432
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys...

883
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,317
but I spotted several
big mistakes.

884
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,914
- But... But...
But h-how did... h-how did...
- You know what?

885
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,673
Let's watch my favorite part
again, shall we?

886
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,752
<i>I'll kidnap a thousand children</i>
<i>before I let this company die!</i>

887
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,594
- What? What?
- <i>I'll kidnap a thousand children</i>
<i>before I let this company die!</i>

888
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,877
<i>I'll kidnap a thousand children</i>
<i>before I let this company die!</i>

889
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,190
- I'll get him.
All right, come with us.
- Wh-What are you doing?

890
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,193
Take your hands off me. You can't arrest
me. I hope you're happy, Sullivan.

891
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,636
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

892
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,234
Where will everyone
get their scream now?

893
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,348
The energy crisis will only
get worse because of you!

894
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,638
Stay where you are.
Number One wants to talk to you.

895
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,438
Attention!

896
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,479
- Hello, boys.
- Roz?

897
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,158
Two and a half years of undercover work
were almost wasted...

898
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,676
when you intercepted
that child, Mr. Sullivan.

899
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,070
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known...

900
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,879
that this went
all the way up to Waternoose.

901
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,672
Now, about the girl.

902
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,752
I just want to send her home.

903
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,196
Very good.
Bring me a door shredder.

904
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,192
What? You mean...
You mean I can't see her again?

905
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,475
That's the way it has to be.

906
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,479
I'll give you five minutes.

907
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,672
- Well, so long, kid.
- Mike Wazowski!

908
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,878
Yeah. Aw, Boo.
It's been fun.

909
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,074
Go ahead. Go grow up.

910
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,877
Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo?

911
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,236
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, you know...

912
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,709
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

913
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,837
Uh, Boo, um...

914
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,832
- Well, that's very nice.
- Kitty.

915
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,990
Come here, you.

916
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,958
<i>Oh, he's a happy bear</i>

917
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,199
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you any more, right?

918
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,238
Yeah.

919
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,709
Goodbye, Boo.

920
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,075
Kitty.

921
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,469
Kitty has to go.

922
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,312
Boo!

923
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,554
Kitty?

924
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,953
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.

925
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,953
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

926
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,159
Take him away.

927
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,435
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

928
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,273
You idiot! They're gonna
shut down the factory!

929
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,228
I'm tellin' you, pal, when that wall
went up, you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

930
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,995
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?

931
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,277
Come on, pal. Cheer up.
We did it. We got Boo home.

932
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,070
Oh, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and, gee, hundreds
of people will be out of work now.

933
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,833
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us
when there's no more power.

934
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,469
But hey, at least we had
some laughs, right?

935
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,397
Laughs.

936
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,038
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello! Hello! Testing! Testing!

937
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,873
Hey, good evening. How are you?
How are you? Nice to see you.

938
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,032
I tell ya, it's great to be here
in your room. Where you from?

939
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,559
Never mind. You're in kindergarten,
right? Oh, I love kindergarten.

940
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,077
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.

941
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,628
But I love sports.
Dodge ball was the best. Oh, yeah.

942
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:48,430
I was the fastest one out there.
Of course, I was the ball. But I...

943
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,431
I was the ball, see?

944
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,238
All right.

945
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,710
Huh?

946
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,759
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.

947
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,232
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.

948
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,232
Not bad, huh? You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing...

949
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,550
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

950
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,760
Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream
had nothing to do with it.

951
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,389
Oh, Googley Bear.
Come here, you.

952
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,074
- Schmoopsie-poo!
- Googley.

953
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,869
Girls. Girls. Quit.
Stop, stop, stop.

954
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,190
Michael, you're such a charmer.

955
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,589
- Hey, did you bring the magazine?
- They just delivered a whole box.

956
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,434
Let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

957
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,679
- I don't believe it.
- Googley Bear.

958
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,958
I'm on the cover of a magazine!
Oww!

959
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,869
Oh, this is great!

960
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,595
- Hey, Sulley!
- Hey, uh, Mike. I was, uh, just...

961
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,240
- Listen, if you got a minute, there's
something I wanna show you. Okay?
- B-B-But...

962
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,791
- Close your eyes. Follow me.
- I-I-I...
- Come on. No peeking.

963
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,872
- Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
Come on. Keep coming, keep coming.
- Mike!

964
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,758
And follow the sultry sound
of my voice.

965
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,276
Okay, stop. Open 'em.

966
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,670
- Ta-da!
- Mike!

967
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,354
- Is that...
- Sorry it took so long, pal.

968
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,715
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

969
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,156
You know, it only works
if you have every piece.

970
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,556
Boo?

971
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,358
Kitty!

972
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,752
Speed. Marker.
And action.

973
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,991
<i>If I were a rich man</i>

974
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,196
<i>With a million or two</i>

975
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,639
<i>I'd live in a penthouse</i>

976
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,439
<i>In a room with a view</i>

977
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,274
- <i>And if I were handsome</i>
- No way!
- It could happen.

978
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,476
<i>'Cause dreams do come true.</i>

979
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,198
Roll slate.

980
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,034
<i>I wouldn't have nothin'</i>
<i>if I didn't have you</i>

981
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,749
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'</i>
<i>if I didn't have</i>

982
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,549
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'</i>
<i>if I didn't have</i>

983
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,393
<i>Wouldn't have nothin'</i>

984
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,551
Okay, cut.

985
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,079
Okay, you're finished now, right?

986
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,071
- Hello.
- Hello.

987
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,834
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

988
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,911
- Oh, sorry.
- See you later, fellas.

989
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,709
- Go get 'em, Mr. Solomon.
- You idiot! It's Sullivan, not Solomon.

990
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,711
- What?
- You're messing up the scene.

991
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,756
- Sorry.
- We're never gonna work
in Hollywood again.

992
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,353
- Let me do it over.
- Shut up!

993
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,749
- Keep rolling!
- You're making it worse!

994
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,593
Duck and cover, people!

995
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,035
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.

996
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,791
Ta-da!

997
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,955
Aw, Boo, it's been fun.

998
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,268
Go ahead. Go throw up.

999
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,910
- What? Wh-Wh...
What did I say? What? What?
- Cut.

1000
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,351
Hey, Ted, good morning!

1001
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,753
- Cut.
- Hey, how was that? Was I scary?

1002
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,956
- Do I get the part?
- Thank you.
- Can I do it again?

1003
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,951
- I can be taller.
- Next.

1004
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,156
And action.

1005
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,073
Okay, let's move, let's move,
let's move. Come on!

1006
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,558
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?

1007
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,074
Wait a minute.
Randall? That cheater.

1008
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,549
- He's trying to boost his numbers.
- There's something else.

1009
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,757
- What?
- Look-lay in the bag-bay.

1010
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,991
- I think you mean
