How to sync subtitles in KMPlayer.

You have two options to sync your subtitles. 
One is to edit the subtitle file or to sync the subtitle using the subtitle resync option.
We''ll consider the second one since its much easier to do.

1. Make sure that the subtitle file has the same file name 
as the video file and put them in the same folder. 

2. Play the video file. Carefully watch how the subtitle is misaligned 
with the video sequence if it leads or lags.

3. Now right click on the video and select Subtitles > Subtitle resync > Resync Subtitle

In the small box, enter the time in milliseconds that should be adjusted to play 
the subtitle in correct sync. Try different values until you get the best one. 
Click OK. Now you should be getting your subtitles playing in synchronization with 
the video file.

OR

You can resync it using hot key '{[' for -0.500 sec. backward adjustment 
and '}]' for +0.500 sec. forward adjustment
