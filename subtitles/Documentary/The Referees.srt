1
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,690
Karagounis, Karagounis !

2
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:47,060
Don't make signal!
Don't make signal!

3
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,150
Excuse me.

4
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,826
"Sorry" you say.

5
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:55,690
Stop it, Karagounis.
Don't make signal!

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,900
'Cause I'll show a yellow card.
Stop it already.

7
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,690
Yellow, yellow.

8
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,240
Mathias, before a yellow card,
are you sure 200%?

9
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,180
At 100%.

10
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,420
Bravo.

11
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,799
Karagounis, Karagounis !

12
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,690
Let's continue to play.
Play, play, play, play on...

13
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,718
- Change or not?
- Yes!

14
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:28,330
Shit!

15
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,150
It's a big storm in the city.

16
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,330
Patrick told me.
It's a big storm in the city.

17
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,880
So maybe
it will come here.

18
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,510
I do not understand,
what the fuck you are talking ...

19
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,500
It's raining in the city, a big rain,
so maybe could come here.

20
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,510
In a few moments,
because now it is ...

21
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,907
It's not my problem.
Shut up!

22
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:03,303
OK, but just to be prepared.
Because of your ...

23
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:05,330
Concentrate, concentrate,
Ivan, please, please.

24
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,970
Do not talk for nothing.

25
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,240
This is not the time
for fucked end.

26
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,618
Ivan, tell me!

27
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,609
Come on!

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,020
- 10 ...
- Yes, talk, talk!

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:35,718
... 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1.
End.

30
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,456
We are not Gods.
We make mistakes.

31
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,690
- How are we.
- Yes, we make mistakes, I know, yeah.

32
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,204
Yeah, sure,
we make also mistakes.

33
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:59,690
I'm sorry.
I'm not God.

34
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,510
We make also mistakes.

35
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,618
Yeah, sure, I'm sorry,
I'm very sorry.

36
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:11,330
Uff, finished!
Finished!

37
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,519
That's was good!
That's was good, or?

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,060
Yes, well done.

39
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,718
You aren't singing?

40
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:52,510
Ah, no. I am whistling.
I am just whistling.

41
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,510
A new blue jersey was good?

42
00:04:55,528 --> 00:05:00,060
Have we to prepare a little
theatre for you, or?

43
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,141
Good evening everyone.

44
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,970
It was very important to takes
the best referees of Europe.

45
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,510
I don't interfere
into the refereeing, never!

46
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,690
I trust the committee,
I trust the comission.

47
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,600
I trust the people
were a charged as referees.

48
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:29,790
I interfere in the refereeing,
but not the referees. Never!

49
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:32,510
It's clear message of UEFA:

50
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,330
We need you.

51
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,690
We want you,
you make your best job.

52
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,060
Thank you. Good luck to everybody.
It was a pleasure to speak to you.

53
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:47,330
It is my first time I speak to
in front of so many of the referees.

54
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,600
I never had a red card.
And not tonight. Cheers !!!

55
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,600
Mr. President!

56
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:57,060
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

57
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,420
- And how are you?
- Very good, thank you.

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,330
On the field, when you played, you have
never remonstrated with the referee.

59
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,690
It was something ...

60
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,690
Once I insulted one in Tokyo,
when he disallowed my goal.

61
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,600
You wouldn't believe how I insulted him.
You couldn't imagine.

62
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:22,150
These insults, the worst ones
I know, are in German.

63
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,150
He disallowed
the best goal of my life!

64
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,880
For an offside.
What a goal!

65
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,150
He was ...

66
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,285
My neck was bulging.

67
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,420
There were two referees.
One was Wurtz and second was Konrath.

68
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:43,690
Wurtz, you could talk to him for 45 minutes,
and he wouldn't say anything!

69
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:47,880
And Konrath, you would say:
"Mr. Konrath!" he would give immediately yellow card!

70
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,889
I was 18 and I couldn't
ever say a word to Konrath.

71
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,690
But I could always say to Wurtz:
"What are you doing?"

72
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,880
"Are you stupid or what?
you so and ..."

73
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,880
Make them respect you!

74
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,690
If a young player
flies to you: yellow card!

75
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,690
He will not to do it again.
He will not to do.

76
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,690
You have to do everything
to gain respect.

77
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,690
I raise my hand.
You see me?

78
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,690
Howard, you haven't seen
Mum and Dad for 9 days.

79
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,690
They had to change
from the last time.

80
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,690
They became Elton John.

81
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,690
Yes, nice try.

82
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,709
Hey, Mum.

83
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:29,690
Are you okay?

84
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,330
A beautiful day,
isn't it?

85
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:36,564
- How are you son?
- Yes, good to see you.

86
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:39,060
Good to see you,
all right son?

87
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,636
- I'm fine. You are looking well!
- Yeah.

88
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,799
Hey, guess what this says. Tell us this evening begins
the Euro 2008 for Howard Webb, the policeman.

89
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,690
I'm the working man.

90
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,690
And when I walk
the street with Howard.

91
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,690
And when people come up
and ask him to sign autographs.

92
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,690
And I think to myself, my son!

93
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,690
They ask my son
for the autographs.

94
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,060
And I find it's
a very emotionally.

95
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,690
At the beginning you
dreamed about it.

96
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,690
When I first started,
he was in the tribune,

98
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,330
anybody would said anything,
he announced:

99
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,690
"It's my boy!
You cannot say this!"

100
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,690
I'm very fortunate, because
since I was a young boy of 20

101
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,690
I've been involved in
football refereeing.

102
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,690
That's my life.

103
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,690
And that's my hobby.

104
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,600
And too my son takes on the same hobby
as father is for me fantastic!

105
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,150
Fantastic!

106
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,880
And yes, I'll love it to death.

107
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,690
I'll love it to death.

108
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,709
I just hope that
everything will be OK.

109
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:21,690
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm hoping ...

110
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,690
I've every confidence in them,
I really have, you know.

111
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,799
Yeah ...

112
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,880
They do it
so well in England.

113
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,150
So I've, you know,
every confidence.

114
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,150
Yeah, I hope so ...

115
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,420
It's here.

116
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:41,880
It's unusual,
but the shirt is different.

117
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,690
Come on, boy.
Go, go, go.

118
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,060
Damn, look at this!

119
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,799
- Corner. - Free kick.
- Corner.

120
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,880
Thanks, guys.

121
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,510
No problem.

122
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,690
- This is not to punish?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,510
- I've shouted from here for it.
- Yeah.

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,330
Great, well played boys.

125
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,880
Damn!

126
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm not sure
that is a valid goal.

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,420
Aufhauser, the goal was from offside, I've seen.
He was on the same line with the goalkeeper.

128
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,510
My son Sean, my oldest son,

129
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,690
has just sent Joanne
one SMS from England,

130
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,690
and he said that goal
should been disallowed.

131
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,690
That is a offside.

132
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,060
But, I haven't seen on the TV, but ...

133
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,060
That will be interesting.

134
00:11:56,718 --> 00:12:00,330
- Everything OK, son?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,150
- Man, that was offside.
- What?

136
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,600
- I guess it was offside.
- Did you?

137
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,970
He stood
before the goalkeeper.

138
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,690
From my position
it didn't look as.

139
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,510
But I have seen on the large screen
and got it noticed.

140
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,510
It was close, it was close.

141
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,690
Unfortunately I did not raise a flag.
I prefer to avoid it, you see.

142
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,690
- Offside?
- I don't know.

143
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,970
- Sure?
- I don't know.

144
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:39,880
- It was repeated.
- To me, it's impossible.

145
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,510
I don't know.

146
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,736
As you know, tell me.

147
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,420
Do you think that yellow?
He dive or not?

148
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,150
Not.

149
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,880
It's not my fault
if he let himself fall.

150
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,880
- This didn't result in a touch
of fall, correct? - Yeah.

151
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,330
I think he was looking for
the penalty, right?

152
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,690
Yeah.

153
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,690
- We don't give them,
like in England. - No.

154
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,060
- But why didn't give them for diving?
I don't know. - Yeah.

155
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,970
Foul!

156
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,772
Two minutes left.
Come on, boys.

157
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,141
Howard, Howard.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

158
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:38,051
- OK, which two were?
- 18 and 6, a yellow card. 18 and 6.

159
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,231
For me just a reprimand.
They have only spoken, or?

160
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,880
Take care with all the linger.
Stop with linger.

161
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't drag on for shirts.

162
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,940
OK, I stay tuned. Since's go again.

163
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,690
- Penalty.
- Penalty.

164
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,510
Stand clear.

165
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,330
Everything is clear.

166
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Stand clear.

167
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,690
If you don't stop,
I'll give you a yellow card.

168
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,690
Please.

169
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,970
Oh, no?

170
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,690
Which number please?

171
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,510
White 6th.

172
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,690
The phone call
from England.

173
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,690
- Yes, there was a penalty.
- Brilliant. Yes!

174
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,690
Good news.

175
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,150
No one is pulling any shirt!

176
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,420
There was nothing! Nothing!

177
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Fucking disgrace!

178
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,700
English referee!

179
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,060
Fucking disgrace!

180
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,330
- You see our problem?
- "English referee!"

181
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,880
This is only
their frustration.

182
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,240
When they see on TV that
there was a clear penalty...

183
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,700
"English referee!"

184
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,510
I have to be honest, Howard.

185
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,790
Your performance tonight
was OK.

186
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,420
The match was full under control.

187
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,600
And it's always a pity ...

188
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:46,690
And I know, I know it's always a pity
that you can't do anything for it, but...

189
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,690
The most important situation
of the match was the first goal.

190
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,510
That's terrible for the tournament.

191
00:16:55,772 --> 00:17:00,772
And I cannot ignore
the pictures shown by television,

192
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:03,880
to everybody all over
the whole world saw.

193
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,690
Overall, it was OK.
There were no major problems.

194
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,060
The match was full under control
during 90 minutes, no problems at all.

195
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,060
It's only a pity
that these things happens.

196
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,510
But that's our life,
guys, that's our life.

197
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,690
Sometimes we are the winners,
sometimes we are the losers.

198
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,690
We're not losers today,
but ...

199
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,690
I cannot ignore it.

200
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,510
And the second point:
The penalty was very, very ...

201
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,510
There will be a lot of
discussions about it.

202
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,970
Tomorrow afternoon in 13:30.

203
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:41,690
I think we'll have six or seven clips.
So then we will see, yeah, OK ?

204
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,690
So cheers again!

205
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:46,150
Cheers for being in the team.

206
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,690
Thank you guys.
Thanks for your help.

207
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,889
Rejoice the evening, because ...

208
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,510
Enjoy the evening, because
the nobody can change it.

209
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,772
It happens and OK you can...

210
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,880
You have to enjoy the evening. Yes?

211
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,970
A worse things are everywhere,
every day in the world.

212
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,510
You take
so much decision?

213
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,060
- Of course.
- I've never know.

214
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:08,790
Month for month,
week for week,

215
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,690
we're under lots of pressures
we perform a top level and...

216
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,060
in the biggest stadiums,
without problems.

217
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,420
You know, so ...

218
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,420
- Well done, well done buddy.
- Well, not sure ...

219
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,330
- Well done. Why not?
- Offside.

220
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,330
Hi, son.

221
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:35,240
- You are OK?
- How you can see.

222
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,654
You were a tremendous, tremendous.
Good game.

223
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:40,105
Like a singing.

224
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:42,510
From the beginning till the end.

225
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,420
- It was a wonderful playgame.
- Open to the end.

226
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,330
One of the best in the tournament.

227
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,690
Super son, you are happy?

228
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,510
Yes, I got a message
from home as well so.

229
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,880
That's so much easier. Good.

230
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,240
Is colleague OK?

231
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,690
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

232
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,690
You are a little worried, buddy?

233
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,690
We know there come so...

234
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,690
There is offside, so...

235
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,150
- What's the result?
- It's offside.

236
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,330
It's OK? It's OK?

237
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,970
No, come here. It's not OK.

238
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,510
Come here.
Them both out.

239
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,907
- Both?
- Both out.

240
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,330
Out, both out, both!

241
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:07,150
Come on, you and you - out! Come on!

242
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,330
It's OK.
Come on.

243
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,330
Please.

244
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,060
Out!

245
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,060
- Wait, wait. - Out, out!

246
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,880
The most important is the match,
not the coaches, OK?

247
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:13,060
It's not the right
for a professional, OK?

248
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:16,330
It's not the professional
this way to behave you.

249
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,060
It's not professional, OK?

250
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,690
So, please. I have to work.
For me it's not important.

251
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,330
The most important is the pitch,
not a coaches, OK?

252
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,060
Thank you.

253
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,690
Mejuto could have run up closer
to the incident,

254
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,690
to speak to them, because he took
a decision from a distance.

255
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,510
And I think, if we say that we are
working together - coaches and referees,

256
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:05,880
he could have to go to both
of them

257
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:11,330
and maybe at that time they would have
already shaked hand to each other

258
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,690
and then Mejuto could have said:

259
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:18,600
"OK, now I don't want to see you
for the next 10 minutes,

260
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:23,060
and at half-time I would like
regain to discuss with you."

261
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:26,880
He took
a straight decision and ...

262
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,880
Do you ready?

263
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:42,330
For a long, two-hours briefing? No?

264
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:44,510
It will be coffee?

265
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,790
If you've been on a correct position,
you will all got the decision right,

266
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:01,970
that you realized during a halftime
that this happened.

267
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:06,690
Did you realized? Because, I didn't see,
but it was on a big screen.

268
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,420
- I didn't see on a big screen.
- Howard, you did?

269
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,150
Did you know
that was on big screen?

270
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,510
I saw on a big screen
twice.

271
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,510
If I may give you any advice:
"Don't look at the big screen".

272
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,060
Because, you can't change it.

273
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,006
All you can do is a faith of mind,
by looking at a big screen.

274
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:26,510
- That's right.
- Before the replay, Mike...

275
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,970
That's the first time you've seen it?

276
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:30,510
A first time I've seen it.

277
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,690
Is there anything
you immediately noticed?

278
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,060
Yes, I stayed rooted to the corner flag.
I have no idea why.

279
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:36,880
You are completely planted at corner,

280
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:39,880
you moved to corner flag,
followed the movements of players.

281
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,690
No, there were not.
There were not a movement players.

282
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:43,880
That's just a...

283
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,060
- That's just a blackout.
- The blackout you've had.

284
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,600
I just ...

285
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:52,240
Without a seen, I'm amazed
what I see. In terms of...

286
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:55,150
This player is
the second last defender.

287
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,060
Goalkeeper is
on the goal line. OK?

288
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,330
So he is
the second last defender.

289
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,826
Here.

290
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:04,186
- But you're on the goal line.
- Yeah.

291
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,690
And no time you make reback.

292
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,240
We'll go to minute 91th boys.

293
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:12,060
That's the penalty situation.
And then we...

294
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:25,510
Thank you for giving this decision.

295
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,420
It's very important for the tournament.
Very important message.

296
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,510
The message went across
before the tournament.

297
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,060
We showed these situations to
all the teams.

298
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:39,510
And it's their problem,
if they didn't learn.

299
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,690
It's a good coffee?

300
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,690
- Better than mine?
- No comparison.

301
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,690
Like the one, I was telling you about.

302
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,150
Like the machine
that you wanted?

303
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:52,690
Exactly.
The only thing is ...

304
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:56,690
It has really good taste.
The only thing is ...

305
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,420
- It is a bit weak?
- No, it is perfect.

306
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,718
It's better than coffee
served in bars.

307
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:05,690
Only,
it is not boiling hot.

308
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:09,880
It is hot, but
I like my coffee boiling hot.

309
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,690
- We will need ...
- To adjust.

310
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,600
Yes. To adjust.

311
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,718
Come here, come here!

312
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,690
Come to see Daddy.

313
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,880
Look, honey, look - Daddy!
Look!

314
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,880
Send him a kiss.

315
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,690
Cutie.

316
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,060
Did you see?

317
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,690
Can we eat here?

318
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,970
Yes, yes.

319
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,690
Rosetti, white, white,
white, white ...

320
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,690
White, Roberto,
Roberto, white!

321
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,690
It's OK. We did
what we had to do.

322
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,240
Okay. Okay. Okay.

323
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,690
Delicious.

324
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,690
- The blue shirts are good?
- Better than before.

325
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,880
The ones before were blue also.

326
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,690
- Foul, foul!
- Yellow, yellow ...

327
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,690
Bravo, bravo.

328
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,690
He's showing a card.

329
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:36,880
- Bravo!
- Bravo Daddy!

330
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,510
- What is Paolo doing?
- He is the linesman.

331
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,060
What does it mean?

332
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:47,510
He's doing the same as Griselli.
He controls the line.

333
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,510
He controls offsides.

334
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,690
When the ball goes
out of playground,

335
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:54,510
and corners.

336
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,060
He helps your dad,
who cannot see everything.

337
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:01,420
He needs two linesmen
to help him.

338
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:04,690
To catch infractions
he cannot see.

339
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,880
- He is already exhausted.
- What a face he is making!

340
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:11,880
- That's something!
- What concentration!

341
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:14,880
He was like this ...

342
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,880
Did you see this? And after that,
he gave an evil eye.

343
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:25,330
I've never seen him like this.
Their faces look strange on TV.

344
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,690
Look at him.
Must they act this way?

345
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,690
You pushed.
You are the champion...

346
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:37,060
No, no.

347
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,871
Let's go, Let's go.
There is no time.

348
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,510
- Yeah?
- Yes.

349
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,060
Not 22!

350
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,510
Who made the foul?

351
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,880
A defenseman, on the other side.

352
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,871
Who made the foul?

353
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,060
I didn't see it.
I lost sight of it.

354
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:03,330
Who did that?

355
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,330
Who did that?

356
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:11,880
Who, Paolo? What number?

357
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:16,060
I didn't see it, damn it.
I lost sight of it.

358
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,150
Offside!

359
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,330
Are you sure?

360
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,880
Except if it was a back-pass.

361
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,690
I don't understand.

362
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,690
From here, it looked
as a offside.

363
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,880
What are they saying?
I don't understand anything.

364
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,690
There is always something, must have
happened in the last minutes.

365
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,690
We'll see.

366
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,690
What's happening there?

367
00:28:56,699 --> 00:29:00,690
Foul, foul, foul, foul, foul!

368
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,880
It's clear.

369
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,060
Absolutely clear.

370
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,510
Five seconds.

371
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Whistle, whistle!

372
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,799
Good luck in the match.

373
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,880
What?

374
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,060
I didn't understand.

375
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,690
You wanted to say "Good luck!"?

376
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,690
But the game is already over.

377
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,330
Let's go.

378
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,690
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

379
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,330
You were a great
fourth official.

380
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:57,330
Thanks.

381
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,330
If my wife see this a scene,
it's a problem.

382
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:17,934
Let's go back to the good
italian refereeing.

383
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,483
Especially Calcagno,

384
00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:23,880
the second assistant Rosetti
was good.

385
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:30,880
Let's comment on the pictures and we'll start
with the famous Mario who is so nice.

386
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,699
Here we go ... the disallowed
goal from Charisteas.

387
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,790
The move starts far back.
Here we see the connection with Gekas.

388
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:40,060
It was border-line.

389
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:43,860
Really border-line.
A few millimeters.

390
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,690
- He is Superman.
- Yes.

391
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,690
His has lynx eyes.

392
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,240
Lynx eyes!

393
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,060
Watch him put on his deodorant.

394
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,330
Who knows...

395
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,150
this evening...

396
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,540
It's inhumane.

397
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,690
The offside?

398
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,690
This is normal that an assistant
makes a mistake.

399
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,690
At 6 or 7 a difficult decisions,
one mistake is the norm.

400
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,240
I agree.

401
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:37,330
If an assistant saw all,
he would be number 10.

402
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,411
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

403
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,871
Then he would be not
an assistant, but champion.

404
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,420
He would see, but
he would never feel offended.

405
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,150
It's difficult,
but I know all that.

406
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,690
It was easier
when you played.

407
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,690
It's a question of age:
it is easier when one is 25.

408
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,510
At 52, it is the policy
that is easier.

409
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,609
Goodbye. Thank you.

410
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:00,880
Hold on.
And forget about it.

411
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,231
Did you see?

412
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,060
Did you hear about death threats
sent to Howard Webb?

413
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,690
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

414
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,294
By Polish supporters.

415
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,690
Yes, yes.
On the Internet.

416
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,510
By Polish supporters.

417
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,051
Yes, yes.

418
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,654
And the photos?

419
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:27,690
Yes, yes.

420
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,690
Photos of Hitler and Webb.

421
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,690
We live in this world.

422
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,180
That's no matter how,
that's no matter what I say.

423
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,690
- Not him.
- And so, never.

424
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,880
That what we see, doesn't matter.

425
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:48,330
What's important are
the allegations they make.

426
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,330
Where are we going, Mr. Cornu?

427
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:02,600
Yeah, they are crazy.

428
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:05,330
More and more and more crazy.

429
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,330
This is terrible.

430
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:24,240
It's terrible really. Yeah, it's terrible.

431
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,600
That's it.

432
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,220
My God!

433
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,150
Yellow, yellow.

434
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,060
It is OK?

435
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,540
- Yes it's a goal. - I'm ready.

436
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
Stop, stop, stop.

437
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,510
- Hey, come on.
- Excellent, yellow, yellow.

438
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,772
This is OK.

439
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm ready!

440
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,150
Wait, we have a problem.

441
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:36,690
My flag is broken.

442
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,690
Is it OK?

443
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,690
Yes, wait a second.

444
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,330
Not good, that is broken, OK?

445
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Put you there.

446
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,420
Thank you.

447
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,330
Gregory, what do you think?
Three or four?

448
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:02,880
Four minutes, four minutes.

449
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,240
OK, perfect.

450
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:08,709
But wait, wait, wait.
Don't tell them.

451
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,420
Goal!

452
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,880
Goal!

453
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,880
Not withdraw, Peter.
Don't be withdrawn.

454
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,420
Fuck it!
What are you doing man?

455
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,420
Free kick, free kick,
free kick, free kick!

456
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,540
They are throwing bottles here Peter.

457
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,420
- Okay. - Come here.

458
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,540
Peter, come here, come here.

459
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,240
You sit down!

460
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,690
Dude in the
white shirt is back.

461
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,790
He keeps his shirt
in his right hand.

462
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,510
That's him.

463
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,180
Come, come.

464
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,880
- Warning for Baros?
- Yellow card.

465
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:49,060
Ten.

466
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,020
No bottles nor outpouring on the field,
we will do that later.

467
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,690
Wau, what a game!

468
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,772
Come.

469
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,772
Good job.

470
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:54,880
You probably know
that Howard

471
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:58,690
after the match Austria - Poland ...

472
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,600
And considered the decision.

473
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,690
The correct penalty decision
in the very last minute.

474
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,690
After this match, it's created
a reaction in Poland.

475
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,060
Reaction from supporters,

476
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:15,240
and even reactions from a politicians.

477
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:20,690
I heard from a Prime Minister
who said crazy things that a ...

478
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,690
If he knew a referee ...

479
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,690
he would be ready to...

480
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,690
even eventually to kill him, I think.

481
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,540
So for your information,
we will have special security in Salzburg.

482
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,150
Howard is a policeman.

483
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:44,060
So he knows that had
some security measures at home,

484
00:38:44,078 --> 00:38:46,510
for his family.

485
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,540
So, the situation is critical.

486
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,880
- Yes, please.
- I am from Poland.

487
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,690
So well, I will be a bit offenced.

488
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,690
So how do you feel to be
a public enemy number 1, right now?

489
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,690
Because our Prime Minister said, I mean,

490
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm sure he was a kind of joking,

491
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:06,690
but... he said
that he wanted to kill you.

492
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,690
I know things are said
in heat of the moment,

493
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,690
people don't necessarily mean.

494
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,690
Football, of course, is a passioned.

495
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,690
I'm sure that ...

496
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,690
this was just said in that way.

497
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,736
These things, as you said,
are developed to be symboled.

498
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:29,060
How does it affect your family?

499
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:32,880
They are fine, fully supported,
they'll be at home.

500
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:35,880
You gave the penalty, because
you saw him.

501
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:38,240
But, if it
would be just totally clear penalty,

502
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:42,141
it wouldn't be talking about it
right now, it wouldn't be talking about...

503
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,420
You are the only one that is talking about it
and say it was not clear, ha?

504
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:50,880
Because, I'm the only one from Poland,
so maybe I'll finish my question and...

505
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,690
So, if it was that clear,
it wouldn't be talking about this,

506
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,330
to support from UEFA, from FA, etc.

507
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,150
So this is how I see it.

508
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,564
Support is not referenced by
that decision. No, it's not.

509
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:05,510
UEFA do not consider that it
seems to be controversial.

510
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,790
So it is not.

511
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,871
It is in relation to the
tournament as a whole.

512
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,330
And you know ... the time
go off this decision,

513
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,844
created disappointment
in Polish peoples eyes.

514
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:20,411
Of course, we understand that.

515
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Thank you very much.

516
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,330
We started to see who are
a referees who will go home.

517
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,709
We are also thinking of the
appointment for the quarterfinals.

518
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:41,690
But we prefer to wait
the results of tonight.

519
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,690
So, a referees will be
informed tomorrow morning.

520
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,690
I'll call you as well for
the first two quarter-finals.

521
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,690
And then, on the 19th,

522
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,690
We will appoint a referees for
a next two quarter-finals,

523
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,880
and inform the four trios,

524
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,880
who will go home.

525
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,600
Yeah, but ... Yeah.

526
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,790
We were disappointed of the standard of some
assistant referees, honestly speaking.

527
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,540
Can I have look down on the playground?

528
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,330
They checked the dressing room
to make sure it's OK.

529
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,420
It's a joke, yeah.

530
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:02,330
Not so funny, but yeah ...
is it possible to take ...

531
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,546
commit check of the pitch and leave
our bags there, is that OK?

532
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:08,690
- OK, perfect.
- To ensure safety?

533
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,105
Tell Marcus that we're going
to check the pitch. OK?

534
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:14,510
We will leave
our bags on the corridor, if it's OK.

535
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:16,249
It's OK.

536
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,681
- We all belive now, it's ...
- It's all clear?

537
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,060
- It's all clear.
- They removed the bombs?

538
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:31,510
And cyanide, anthrax?

539
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,880
We'll start then, OK?

540
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,808
We're not on the sheet.

541
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:05,600
Michael will be absolutely
terrified tonight.

542
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:08,709
And so it will be
a very, very mistake.

543
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:12,540
And the last thing, you wanna do,
it's make another mistake.

544
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,510
And he will absolutely ...

545
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:18,060
His heart will beat in his chest.

546
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,240
Ready. Okay, okay.

547
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,330
Well done, well done ...
successful refereeing.

548
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:32,300
Get the ball, Mike. Take it.
Thank you.

549
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,150
- It is fault, my friend ...
- No.

550
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,060
Free kick, Howard?
Oh, no! No yellow card.

551
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:48,880
- For you, my friend.
- No, mate.

552
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:52,330
- Billy, how we are?
- How are you, Ian?

553
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:55,690
- All right, mate?
- All right, buddy.

554
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,150
"Go away!", he says, "Go away!"

555
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,060
Now!

556
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:05,772
Yeah!

557
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:15,330
"Get it in!",
look he says ...

558
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:18,609
What is it? Watch his head.

559
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,880
Look at that.
That's, huh!

560
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,970
It's Xabi Alonso, OK?
Get move them.

561
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:33,411
You, hey, hey, hey. Come here.

562
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,970
No, seriously, relax. Calm down!

563
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:38,790
It's nothing personal.
Nothing personal.

564
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,510
I will call the doctor
as needed.

565
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,330
Calm down, please. Relax.

566
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:49,060
It was an accident Xabi.
So, tell him.

567
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:53,150
It was an accident. Good luck
to you, my friend.

568
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,690
Bravo, Xabi. Bravo, Xabi.

569
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,609
Wait, please, wait.

570
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,330
It is a minute yet.
Just one more minute.

571
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:05,709
Come on, my friend.
I'll talk with you.

572
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:08,772
I speak to you.
It's an accident.

573
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:11,330
He did not see you.
Calm down, OK?

574
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,420
It was not intended.

575
00:45:14,663 --> 00:45:17,636
Two minutes, but still keep
fingers crossed.

576
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:20,240
Last time we had a penalty
at the 92nd minute.

577
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:22,871
- Don't say that.
- I'am not only breathe.

578
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,510
Come on, Howard, blow the whistle.

579
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,510
Two minutes yet.

580
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,330
Please, two minutes. After now
or two minutes from 90th?

581
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:32,970
Two minutes from now.

582
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:35,510
- Two minutes from now?
- Three minutes extend.

583
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:36,690
Oh, God!

584
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,240
Continue playing.

585
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:40,690
- For pulling the shirt?
- Yeah.

586
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,060
Okay.

587
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,772
Six meters.

588
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:49,150
As soon as the after this kick
ball there flies, will be end.

589
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,690
Open your eyes boys!

590
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,690
And enjoy!

591
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,709
This is the fucking EURO 2008!

592
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:56,150
We were at the fucking EURO 2008.

593
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,330
Already. Howard, already.

594
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,690
So done Mr. Webb, well done.
Did well ...

595
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,420
May God bless him.

596
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,690
See what's a commentators say.

597
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:20,690
Did he right did, Dad?

598
00:46:20,718 --> 00:46:25,420
- We're all relieved?
- We're relieved, yeah.

599
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,339
We are all deep relieved.
We are all deep relieved.

600
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,880
Bravo, bravo.

601
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:41,690
- Thank you.
- Thanks again.

602
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,980
Well done, Mike, well done!

603
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,330
Enjoy the moments tonight.
Well done, pal, well done.

604
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,060
I'm really delighted.

605
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:52,690
Good luck, then.

606
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,781
- I wish you the best.
- Yes, cheers.

607
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,006
- Have a good season.
- Thank you.

608
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,510
The same.

609
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:02,690
Your son, my only son is gone
to European Championship,

610
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,690
to represent England!

611
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,690
It's terrible
to be so treated.

612
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,690
I am a tough guy.
I am 1.80 meters and 110 pounds.

613
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,690
And the tears coming down my eyes,

614
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,690
because I'm worried for Silvia.

615
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,330
She was hysterical on the phone,
absolutely hysterical.

616
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,690
I was out
when my wife...

617
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,690
A Polish people knockin' on
my door.

618
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,690
My wife was upstairs,
knockin' on the window,

619
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,690
a chap accross home came.
She was terrified!

620
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,420
And the guys didn't go away, did they?

621
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:42,420
They came
around and around ...

622
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:46,690
We've a police going arround,
a there hours. Every hour.

623
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,970
You think then,
because what's happened, Billy,

624
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:52,060
Howard will hate refeering?

625
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,240
- No. No. - I hope not.

626
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,781
Because, he has a bottle in neck.

627
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,510
He is a police sergeant.

628
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:01,690
This is the most surrender
thing that's happened.

629
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,420
- Not really.
- Of course it is.

630
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:08,150
Not for Howard,
just for his family.

631
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,690
And for Howard.

632
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,690
Yes, but if somebody stood
a knife to thee throat?

633
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,907
Yeah, but this is the worst thing ...

634
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:19,709
I think this is the worst thing
that happened for him.

635
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:22,330
- Do you?
- Aha, definitely.

636
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,420
Back home again.

637
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,690
Courage ...

638
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,339
So main import ...
Courage.

639
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:18,519
And expect the unexpected.

640
00:49:19,772 --> 00:49:24,420
That's important.
Everything can happens.

641
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:27,799
And we will be focused at 100%.

642
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:31,690
But one of the main point is: Have fun.

643
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,799
It's just a football match:
11 against 11.

644
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:38,060
We don't care
about EURO already.

645
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:40,060
It is a football match.

646
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:42,150
We will have a beer after the game.

647
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,339
- And beer should taste ...
- So good.

648
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,880
Ready for success.

649
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,510
- Offside.
- Look, look, look.

650
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,690
Behind the goal. Behind the goal.

651
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,690
Look, look, look.
There is.

652
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,880
- Buffon.
- There is.

653
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:28,880
No offside from Holland.

654
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:33,420
Two minutes in the offside,
my friend said.

655
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,690
No, asshole ...

656
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,690
10,10,10,10,10,10,10...

657
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,069
- Mamma mia!
- Go sleeping?

658
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,069
Good night, Roberto,
good night.

659
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:23,772
Good sleep Roberto.

660
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,180
Today is not my day, it is
not my day.

661
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:48,690
We are having a referees trios,
who are leaving a tournament.

662
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,240
I'm asking the trio to come
all together.

663
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:57,970
From the Netherlands: Peter Vink,
Adriaan Inia and Hans Ten Hoove.

664
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:12,420
From Norway: Tom Henning Ovrebo,
Geir Age Holen and Erik Raestad.

665
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:27,420
Howard Webb, Darren Cann and
Mike Mullarkey.

666
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,690
Howard, it's a big
experience for you.

667
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,510
- Yeah, fantastic.
- See you soon.

668
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,240
Thanks for your support.

669
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:41,690
Thank you very much.
See you again.

670
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,060
So, you're definitely
coming home?

671
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:49,880
I'd like just say how proud we are
of you, son.

672
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:53,060
And chill out. Have a few beers.

673
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:57,240
And take it you all in and stick it
chest out.

674
00:52:57,249 --> 00:53:00,880
Yeah,
we are chill out now, relax ...

675
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:05,384
Did you see? One error
and you're out. Those that left ...

676
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,880
It is a little bit of, something ...

677
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:11,150
But it's not just for errors.

678
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:14,240
At the end they have to
take a decision.

679
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:19,240
Take also into consideration
the participating teams, matches ...

680
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:22,060
There is some of that also.

681
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:26,690
This is a bit ugly
situation, because ...

682
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,330
And we all deserve to reach
the final.

683
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:33,690
In a tournament like this,

684
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,159
we should all be able
to reach the final.

685
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,699
Quique, Quique, Quique!

686
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,690
Let's share. Thanks.

687
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,690
Come on.

688
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,069
I have to go.

689
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,330
It depends, you know,
what will make my national team.

690
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,240
Spain is here, and we have
important match against Italy.

691
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:50,330
So I have to wait until ...
what's happened with my country.

692
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:53,330
Depending of what they
will do. I have to ...

693
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:55,799
I will have more or less possibilities.

694
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:58,772
He should have a flag.
He needs one.

695
00:54:58,781 --> 00:55:00,510
Why do you say:
"Forza Italia"?

696
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:04,150
Forza Italia! I hope
they will reach the final.

697
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,970
So that Quique can win, of course.

698
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:10,510
- And what, Quique will not do it?
- Oh no, Quique should not be there!

699
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:15,060
And why should Quique referee?
For people to say: "You have sold out!"

700
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:18,690
I'd liked that Spain wins. I'am not
interested into anything else.

701
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:22,060
I don't care.
I only want that Spain wins.

702
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,690
- Why?
- Therefore.

703
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,970
Because, I don't care whether
it Quique referees or the other.

704
00:55:26,979 --> 00:55:29,150
I hope he will referee well.

705
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,006
Nuts to you.
You are not a Spaniard!

706
00:55:32,015 --> 00:55:34,880
You want Quique to referee.

707
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:37,060
That's OK.

708
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:41,690
But don't tell me that you want
Spain to lose.

709
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,880
In that case, everything is OK.

710
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,060
Should be at the time now.

711
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:58,060
That depends of the privileged
cleareance with the baggage like ...

712
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:59,690
You know what I mean?

713
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,690
And they may will do ...
you know what I mean?

714
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:06,880
'Cause he's a celebrity at all.
You know what I mean?

715
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,690
- I don't know, but a ...
- But I do.

716
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,690
- I can't say that. I cannot!
- Of course you can.

717
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,772
I cannot, you know?
I can't say that.

718
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,880
- Hello, father.
- You're all right, son?

719
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,510
Good to see you.

720
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,690
- Hello, mate. How are you doing?
- Hello, David.

721
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,330
- You are OK?
- Yeah, brilliant.

722
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:32,690
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

723
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,799
I thought there were no more
Howard Webb in England.

724
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:38,020
Another, but in Rotherham.

725
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,540
Yeah, crazy.

726
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,690
"Rotherham Borough Engineering
Council lighting engineer,

727
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,690
Mr. Webb, who is preparing
to retire,

728
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,690
has paid the penalty, but a having
the same name,

729
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,690
as a controversial
EURO 2008 referee".

730
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,690
"He suffered abuse from
Polish fans".

731
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,690
"Received so many messages
at his work,

732
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,060
that the authority was forced
to suspend his E-mail account".

733
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:11,690
He said:
"I've never been a referee."

734
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,880
"And I have no lazity become one."

735
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:20,510
"Especially, this is the sort
of abuse they have received."

736
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,609
I hold as a treasure that.

737
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,690
They can bury me in this when...

738
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,690
They can bury me in this.

739
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,799
It's only about 50 those existances.
Only about 50.

740
00:57:33,808 --> 00:57:36,330
- Only about 50 those.
- It is signed as well.

741
00:57:36,339 --> 00:57:40,880
- Fifty?
- Yes. - Isn't it fantastic?

742
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,069
Thank you.

743
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:48,060
Signed by the three judges.

744
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:52,880
- There will be a crying in a minute.
- You've tears there? - Yeah.

745
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:55,330
Oh, that's fantastic.

746
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,150
Good reference.

747
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:03,240
Yes, but the match is a bit boring.

748
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:06,970
- Yeah, awful. - As the World Cup 2002?

749
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,880
Looks like.

750
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:13,060
- Ooh, Casillas.
- Yeah.

751
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:15,420
What a good safe.

752
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,880
- That's good for Rosetti.
- Yeah.

753
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,880
Mr. Roth, they'll win in that.

754
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,249
No more pressure now.

755
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,799
We are a neutral.

756
00:58:37,808 --> 00:58:40,690
- Yeah.
- Totally.

757
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:42,772
Absolute.

758
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,330
Yeah, it is score.

759
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,564
- That's it.
- It is OK.

760
00:58:49,573 --> 00:58:53,060
- Yes, it's clear.
- A the best team wins.

761
00:58:53,069 --> 00:58:57,880
And the those, the best team for
90 minutes in a whole.

762
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:02,970
The game was not so good.
So result for us was good.

763
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:05,510
In the sense of refereeing.

764
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,510
- That would clear.
- Yeah.

765
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,970
So for the Spanish referees,
that's clear.

766
00:59:10,979 --> 00:59:12,510
They have to go home.

767
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:15,690
- So Italian ones, we keep them?
- Yeah.

768
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

769
00:59:18,249 --> 00:59:20,330
Everything is OK?

770
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,690
- More or less.
- No, no, no.

771
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:26,060
- Everything? No.
- Everything no...

772
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,420
Everything for you, yes.

773
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,690
Fuck, fuck, fuck Spain.

774
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,060
- Housekeeping?
- Housekeeping. Yeah.

775
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,060
My last task
for this tournament,

776
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:18,510
because I am leaving,
so no one can kill me.

777
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,060
The Referee Committee
of UEFA decided,

778
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:24,420
in this meeting...

779
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:29,420
Let me, it's a final of
this tournament on Sunday...

780
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:32,186
The teams are ...

781
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,690
Oh, we don't know.
I don't see ...

782
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:39,330
Roberto Rosetti as a referee,
with his team,

783
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:43,600
Peter Frojdfeldt as fourth official,
with his first assistant referee.

784
01:00:43,609 --> 01:00:46,060
That's it.

785
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,880
What a massacre.

786
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,060
You're going to break me!

787
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,970
Well, well. Now it's
easy, it's cool.

788
01:01:03,979 --> 01:01:06,240
You have a conference
at 16.00 o'clock?

789
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:09,060
Maybe we'll talk
a little before.

790
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:12,690
Next tournament, you are the referee,
and maybe Roberto fourth official.

791
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,150
Not for the EURO. That was
my last opportunity.

792
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,690
I finish a career.

793
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:22,690
So, this is a hard, because
it's my last moment.

794
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,772
And when I didn't make the
semifinal in Champions final,

795
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:31,540
I thought: OK. In the EURO
I will have my opportunity.

796
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,690
Because, perhaps, they don't
give me an appointment,

797
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:38,880
to not create the problems with
the teams that have to go home.

798
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:39,880
And I thought:

799
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:42,880
OK. They didn't give me the
appointments for quarter-finals,

800
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:45,420
because they trust
in my work and..

801
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:50,330
- I understand it's not very clear
in your mind, dearest. - Yeah.

802
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,510
Be positive.

803
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,736
Of course, we wanted to continue,
but it's already an another story.

804
01:02:03,745 --> 01:02:06,510
Eller. Don't be stubborn.

805
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:08,880
One more week.

806
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:11,790
We will be there for the
semi-finals and final.

807
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:15,600
We will not referee, but
we will still be involved.

808
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:18,690
Let me tell you
a little anecdote

809
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:20,970
about our stay in Finland.

810
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:24,690
When we were training
for the semi-finals,

811
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,690
tempting was the possibility
to tackle one of the referees.

812
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:32,690
Then they would have to
designate another fourth official

813
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,970
or even a new referee for the final.

814
01:02:35,979 --> 01:02:38,330
Mejuto!

815
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:42,690
Do you remember me, you
sent me... a present for me.

816
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,690
Some present.

817
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,690
The first match
is on Wednesday?

818
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,240
And now match they minutes...

819
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:52,240
- 3 000 minutes.
- 3 000 minutes?

820
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:55,690
- Relax.
- But this is the money, yeah?

821
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:58,330
I would change the money
to be in your situation.

822
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:02,150
At this moment, you don't ever think
about the money that you received.

823
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,150
- You think only the...
- Yes, right now.

824
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,240
- You work for this?
- Of course.

825
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,330
- We're happy because we are in the final.
- Of course.

826
01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:11,690
But on the sidelines.

827
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,060
Bye, bye.

828
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,970
Hello, are you well?

829
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:29,690
Everything is fine.

830
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,880
Father, are you OK?

831
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:34,690
Hi, everybody.
Where are you?

832
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:37,330
I'm fantastic.
Nice to see you.

833
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:39,519
Yeah, you too.

834
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,690
/ In a few minutes we will
come back to the tournament. /

835
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:48,690
- Although to be fair, father, I don't know
him that well. - You don't know them well?

836
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,330
We spent some time with them,
and they are nice guys.

837
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:56,330
And I wish them all the best
and successful game tonight.

838
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,060
- Is there a foul?
- I don't know.

839
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,772
Iker Casillas is here.

840
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:11,970
Yellow card for
Casillas and Ballack.

841
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:14,240
Ballack, Ballack, Ballack!

842
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:15,880
You, go away!

843
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,970
Ballack! Come here.

844
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:20,690
- Yellow card or not?
- Yes, yes!

845
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,510
- Who?
- Ballack and Iker Casillas.

846
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,600
It should show
the card in both.

847
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:28,600
Good job. Well done. Perfect.

848
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,060
- Rightly cards?
- Absolutely right.

849
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:33,690
- What do you say, Howard?
- Absolutely right.

850
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:39,060
The first two yellow cards of the game have gone
for two teams, and one for each team of them.

851
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:41,150
Why is Casillas protesting?

852
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:43,330
That doesn't make sense.

853
01:06:43,339 --> 01:06:45,672
The goalkeepers were warned:

854
01:06:45,681 --> 01:06:50,690
Any running to the referee and
protesting, will result in a card.

855
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:55,690
If the goalkeeper goes out of his box
to protest, he gets a card.

856
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:00,690
He ran 30 meters
to protest. And why?

857
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,510
Offside! Offside!
He touched it!

858
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,600
And the head hit at the end?

859
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:41,240
I'm telling you that he touched
him, Roberto. I'm telling you.

860
01:07:41,249 --> 01:07:44,060
But he didn't really strike him.

861
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:47,690
He made a move with his head
and touched him, but ...

862
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,330
That's enough.

863
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,060
Stay in the box!
Enough!

864
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:57,880
There are too many of them.
I don't understand.

865
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:01,880
I don't see anything.
It's too chaotic.

866
01:08:01,889 --> 01:08:06,330
Damn, how many are there?
7 and 8 are in the offside.

867
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:19,772
Bravo. OK. Perfect.
Bravo Paolo.

868
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,330
Foul, foul!

869
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:34,060
Bravo, Robby, bravo!
Bravo, bravo.

870
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,772
Roberto, resume the game
immediately. Calm them.

871
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:44,880
Restart the game right away.

872
01:08:44,889 --> 01:08:47,330
The ball! The ball!

873
01:09:01,772 --> 01:09:04,330
What a good game, well done!

874
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:06,510
Brilliant game.

875
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:11,510
Very good game and very few
is lacked to be fantastical.

876
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,690
I see you are,
because I see you.

877
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,510
Come on Tuesday. I'll look
at the postcards.

878
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:11,060
Shall we sing to him
"Howard Webb"?

879
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:14,690
/ Howard Webb's got a big
bald head in the country /

880
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,150
All together again!

881
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:21,330
/ Howard Webb's got a big
bald head in the country /

882
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,420
See you soon.

883
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,970
See you later.

884
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,330
Cool.

885
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,690
- We can play football
tomorrow, if you want. - OK.

886
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,330
- Or on Tuesday. We will play
on Tuesday, yeah? - Yeah.

887
01:10:41,339 --> 01:10:43,690
- On the field, yeah?
- Yeah.

888
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,330
Is it hunger?

889
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:12,060
Congratulations, my friends!

890
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:14,690
Great. Super.
Very good. Great.

891
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,880
Congratulations! OK.

892
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:19,880
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

893
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,150
Jaap, OK? Yes?

894
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:33,510
Of course, OK.
Of course, OK.

895
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:37,690
Everybody is OK, because Hugh
Dallas sent me a SMS,

896
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,150
Bo Karlsson, everybody,
Joseph Marko, everything's OK!

897
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,186
- No talk about refereeing.
- No?

898
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:44,600
No.

899
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:46,880
Great.

900
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,060
Ten days later

901
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:14,330
Howard, as we know,
had two excellent games

902
01:12:14,339 --> 01:12:18,690
and won the love and affection
of the Polish nations.

903
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,540
Video refereeing should not
have a place in a game,

904
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,690
in my view.

905
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,690
If only for one
philosophical reason.

906
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:36,240
The players have no technological assistance
when they go out play the game.

907
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:39,330
And we accept,
we don't like,

908
01:12:39,339 --> 01:12:42,690
but we accept that
they will make mistakes.

909
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,690
Referees and assistant referees
should also go out,

910
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,790
with no technological assistance,
and make mistakes.

911
01:12:50,808 --> 01:12:54,330
And we must to
educate football

912
01:12:54,339 --> 01:12:57,510
to accept that referees
will make mistakes.

913
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,220
Thank you.

914
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:09,006
Representing all
England referees

915
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:11,420
so magnificently,

916
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:15,690
in the Euro 2008 tournament:

917
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,060
assistant referee Darren Cann

918
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:23,690
and referee Howard Webb.

919
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,880
Thank you, David.
Thank you very much.

920
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:34,510
Mr. Collina from the
UEFA Referees Committee.

921
01:13:34,519 --> 01:13:36,690
It is my honour.

922
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:44,060
You have a lovely cravat.
It's fantastic!

923
01:13:44,069 --> 01:13:46,880
Yes, I will throw it
right now after this.

924
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,060
How very embarrassing!

925
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,330
All you need to hold,
is this little stick,

926
01:13:52,339 --> 01:13:55,510
because you are all
in control of this stick.

927
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:58,150
Come a little bit closer.
Come a little closer.

928
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,330
He will not bite.
That's it.

929
01:14:00,339 --> 01:14:03,510
Now, we'll sing like
we have never sung before.

930
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,150
Here we go:
"You'll Never Walk Alone".

931
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,690
With all strength!

932
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:10,690
/ When you walk /

933
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,330
/ through the storm /

934
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:17,690
/ hold your head /

935
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,690
/ high above. /

936
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:26,709
/ And don't be afraid /

937
01:14:26,718 --> 01:14:30,690
/ of the dark. /

938
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,690
/ At the end /

939
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,690
/ of the storm /

940
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:45,690
/ it's a golden sky. /

941
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:51,690
/ And the sweet silver song /

942
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,690
/ of the lark. /

943
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,330
/ Walk /

944
01:15:01,339 --> 01:15:04,690
/ through the wind /

945
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,510
/ walk /

946
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:10,690
/ through the rain. /

947
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,690
/ Though your dreams /

948
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,690
/ will be tossed /

949
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:22,690
/ and blown. /
