1
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,635
<i>A morning like any other in Munich...</i>

2
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:32,774
<i>a city where tradition and modernity
exist happily side by side.</i>

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,706
<i>This summer our beautiful city
plays host...</i>

4
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>to the 20th Olympic Games.</i>

5
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,481
<i>There, in the center of the future
Olympic site, is the Olympic tower.</i>

6
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:49,753
<i>Next to it,
the Olympic arena.</i>

7
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:59,965
<i>For many visitors,
Munich is a kind of German paradise.</i>

8
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:02,594
<i>We're sure that you'll agree.</i>

9
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:11,736
<i>Well, nobody could foresee
what later on happened.</i>

10
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:14,510
<i>From the wires
of the APand UPI.</i>

11
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:17,917
<i>Good afternoon.
This is Paul Mandel reporting.</i>

12
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>Another deadline
has come and gone-</i>

13
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,853
<i>They had their hands tied in front of
them, their hands were tied like that.</i>

14
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,986
<i>Quite a frightening experience.</i>

15
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,325
<i>It wasn't any James Bond,;
it was the real thing.</i>

16
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:31,299
<i>- I just want to know what happened.
- The Games must go on.</i>

17
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,531
<i>The deadline appears, to us,
to be less than one minute away.</i>

18
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:36,834
<i>- Unbelievable.
- Spitz is a Jew, and it was feared...</i>

19
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:38,897
<i>an attempt might be made
to seize him.</i>

20
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:42,444
<i>Behind them was an Arab guerilla
with some kind of weapon in his hand.</i>

21
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:44,446
<i>All seems to be-</i>

22
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:13,532
<i>It was only a year and three months
that I was married to Andre Spitzer...</i>

23
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,578
<i>but it made such
an enormous impression on me...</i>

24
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,841
<i>sometimes it looks
like a lifetime.</i>

25
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:26,080
<i>I went fencing, and he happened
to be my fencing master.</i>

26
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,817
<i>I didn't know
he was from Israel at all.</i>

27
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,382
<i>He spoke Dutch,
but with a slight accent...</i>

28
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,862
<i>so I thought he maybe is from
Eastern Europe or something.</i>

29
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,228
Ankie Spitzer

30
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,230
He had something about him
which really appealed to me.

31
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:43,394
<i>He was very much
at peace with himself...</i>

32
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,464
<i>and also with
the people around him.</i>

33
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>It was very attractive
to me because...</i>

34
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:50,440
<i>I was not so at peace
with everyone and everybody...</i>

35
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,913
<i>and certainly not with myself.</i>

36
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,282
<i>Being the person that he was, it was
hard not to fall in love with him.</i>

37
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:20,171
<i>I am a member
of a Palestinian family...</i>

38
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:28,582
<i>which fled our village in Galilee
from Zionist gangs in 1948.</i>

39
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,519
As refugees, my family moved from
camp to camp...

40
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:34,546
before finally ending up
at the Chatila camp in Beirut.

41
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:42,128
<i>When I was growing up, I thought
there was no future for us...</i>

42
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:45,225
<i>unless we returned to Palestine.</i>

43
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:49,431
<i>If we didn't return,
I would spend my whole life...</i>

44
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:53,498
<i>as a refugee deprived of
any kind of human rights.</i>

45
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:58,272
<i>So I joined
the liberation movement...</i>

46
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,714
<i>and was given a gun
and trained to use it.</i>

47
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:04,810
For the first time in my life I felt
inspired, I felt truly Palestinian...

48
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:09,984
<i>that I wasn't
just a wretched refugee...</i>

49
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:14,223
<i>but a revolutionary
fighting for a cause.</i>

50
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:27,372
I joined the revolution
since 1967.

51
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:31,504
- Which revolution?
- The Palestinian revolution.

52
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:35,347
<i>It has affected the course
of the rest of my life.</i>

53
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:39,184
You have only to look at the way
I have to do this interview...

54
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,188
so many years later,
still in hiding.

55
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,598
<i>We lived in the northern border
between Lebanon and Israel...</i>

56
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:57,002
<i>and it was way out in nowhere.</i>

57
00:04:57,106 --> 00:05:00,906
<i>They decided to have
their fencing academy there.</i>

58
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:07,210
<i>He was going from town to town,
from village to village...</i>

59
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,250
<i>to try to teach the youngsters...</i>

60
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:12,481
through the art of fencing,
to have respect for each other...

61
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:15,183
because fencing
is an aggressive sport.

62
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,386
You have a weapon in your hand.
You're going to attack somebody.

63
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,794
<i>If you attack him right,
then you score a point.</i>

64
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,264
<i>But he tried
to teach the youngsters...</i>

65
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,597
<i>how to channel that aggression...</i>

66
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,502
<i>into respect for your opponent.</i>

67
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:39,004
<i>It was very tough living there, but I
remember that year we lived there...</i>

68
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:42,949
<i>as the most beautiful
and most wonderful year of my life.</i>

69
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:12,937
<i>I did a few tours of duty
in training camps in Lebanon...</i>

70
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:18,711
<i>and then the leadership sent us
to Libya for special training.</i>

71
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,364
<i>The training was hard and advanced.</i>

72
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:36,428
<i>We were there for about one month.</i>

73
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:48,406
<i>It seemed to me we were
getting special training.</i>

74
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:57,620
<i>We began to get a feeling that
something big was underway.</i>

75
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,426
<i>He dreamt always to be once
at the Olympics.</i>

76
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,592
<i>Years before,
before I knew him...</i>

77
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:09,160
<i>he said that he was thinking
about to get to the Olympics once...</i>

78
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,671
1972 Israeli Olympic Squad

79
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,937
<i>because, I think, for every athlete,
that's the climax of your career.</i>

80
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,705
<i>For Andre and the rest
of the Israeli team...</i>

81
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:22,376
<i>the 1972 Olympics held
a particular significance...</i>

82
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:26,854
<i>because they were held in Munich,
Germany, the birthplace of Nazism.</i>

83
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,890
<i>There was a feeling that this was
a huge event for the Israeli team...</i>

84
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:35,897
<i>to be coming and attending...</i>

85
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,365
<i>and therefore their presence
in the Olympic village...</i>

86
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,958
<i>certainly their presence
in the opening ceremony...</i>

87
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,561
<i>when their team marched under the flag
of the Star of David...</i>

88
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,800
<i>were very emotional moments.</i>

89
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:09,196
<i>The Germans saw the games
as an opportunity to erase...</i>

90
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:13,190
<i>the negative memories many still had
of the 1936 Berlin Olympics...</i>

91
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:17,602
<i>which had been misused by the Nazis
for propaganda purposes.</i>

92
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:32,448
<i>Twenty-seven years
after the end of the war...</i>

93
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,820
<i>Munich was the ideal opportunity
to show the world...</i>

94
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:39,190
<i>the new democratic face
of Germany.</i>

95
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,226
<i>The friendliness was in overdrive.</i>

96
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:19,756
<i>It was a massive attempt,
and it hit you straightaway...</i>

97
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,769
Gerald Seymour
ITN News Reporter

98
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,998
to appear open and modern
and shorn of their past.

99
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:32,079
<i>To help promote this new
non-militaristic image of Germany...</i>

100
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:34,581
<i>security was kept deliberately lax.</i>

101
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,618
<i>Police were banned
from the Olympic sites...</i>

102
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:41,089
<i>and in their place were
2,000 unarmed security officers...</i>

103
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,718
<i>clad in specially designed outfits.</i>

104
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:45,674
Jacov Springer
Israeli Weightlifting Coach

105
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,554
Jacov Springer
Israeli Weightlifting Coach

106
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,156
<i>But for some of the Israeli team,
it was not so easy to erase the past.</i>

107
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:56,798
<i>My father, he was five times
in the Olympic Games.</i>

108
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:59,670
<i>Five times is a special thing.</i>

109
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:07,014
He was born in Poland in 1921.

110
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:10,552
<i>His father was from Germany
originally...</i>

111
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:14,715
<i>and thought that because he's speaking
German, nothing would happen to them.</i>

112
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,189
Alex Springer

113
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,819
So all the family stayed in Poland
during the war...

114
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,090
but my father ran to Russia.

115
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:27,033
<i>He didn't want to stay because he was
afraid something will happen to them.</i>

116
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,333
<i>And all the family...</i>

117
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:32,737
his brothers, sisters
and his parents...

118
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,742
were killed in Poland.

119
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,744
He was the only one who survived.

120
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,085
<i>Thirty-six years
after the Nazi Olympics...</i>

121
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:55,289
<i>Dachau, the first of the concentration
camps, was chosen as the site...</i>

122
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,924
<i>for an Olympic memorial service.</i>

123
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,997
<i>The Israeli team
came to the service...</i>

124
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:07,702
<i>along with competitors
from most European countries.</i>

125
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:11,713
<i>Dachau is just six miles
from the Munich stadium.</i>

126
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,347
<i>I think it was very difficult
for him with the memories...</i>

127
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:24,722
of his family
and what the Germans did to them.

128
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,058
I think he felt this.

129
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:32,590
But maybe it was also
for him to-

130
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,931
to show something to the Germans...

131
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,838
that " Here I am, coming back
to the Olympic Games...

132
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,341
and you-

133
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:43,812
you couldn't really destroy me. "

134
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,290
<i>Spitz is still holding them off.
He's got a half a meter lead.</i>

135
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:33,761
<i>Down on the near side is- But Spitz is
gonna go in. Spitz wins the gold medal!</i>

136
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,426
<i>Mark Spitz, USA.</i>

137
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,789
<i>And that is the whistle anyway,
and the United States...</i>

138
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,690
<i>have kept their unbeaten record
unless-</i>

139
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:07,591
<i>The referee says there's
three more seconds to play.</i>

140
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:11,996
<i>The only way they're going to score
is by going for a long shot.</i>

141
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,764
<i>And they got it!
My goodness, I don't believe it.</i>

142
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,001
<i>I do not believe it.
The Russians have got the gold.</i>

143
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,441
<i>Victory for the USSR
for the first time ever.</i>

144
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:32,576
<i>Absolutely fantastic.
She loves every moment of it!</i>

145
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:02,606
<i>Myself and two others traveled
from Libya to Germany...</i>

146
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,676
<i>two days before the operation.</i>

147
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:17,764
<i>We went to a hotel which the
leadership had given us the address of.</i>

148
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,998
<i>There we met up with
the rest of the team-</i>

149
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>another group of three and two leaders
who had been in Munich for some time.</i>

150
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,874
<i>The following day my friend and I...</i>

151
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,652
<i>went to a couple of volleyball games
at the Olympic Park.</i>

152
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>We still had not been told what
the target of our operation was to be.</i>

153
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,837
<i>After one of the competitions he said,
"Hey, there is the Lebanese team.</i>

154
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,348
<i>I'm going over
to say hello to them. "</i>

155
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,352
<i>I, coming from Holland, said,
'Are you out of your mind?"</i>

156
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,513
<i>They are from Lebanon.</i>

157
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,920
<i>Israel was in a state of war
with Lebanon.</i>

158
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,425
<i>He said, 'Ankie, that's exactly what
the Olympics are all about.</i>

159
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,055
<i>Here I can go to them and talk to them.
That's what the Olympics are about. "</i>

160
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,965
<i>So he went over and he asked
how were your results...</i>

161
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:29,698
<i>and I'm from Israel,
and how did it go?</i>

162
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:33,299
<i>To my big amazement, I saw
that the people responded...</i>

163
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,776
<i>and they shook hands with him
and they talked to him...</i>

164
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:37,834
Ankie Spitzer

165
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,311
and they asked him about his results.

166
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:43,647
I'll never forget when he turned
around and came back towards me...

167
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,414
with this huge smile
on his face and said...

168
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,956
"You see? This is what
I was dreaming about. "

169
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:57,591
<i>After ten days, Andre's fencers
finished their competitions...</i>

170
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,500
<i>and he and Ankie traveled to Holland
to spend time with their baby Anouk...</i>

171
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,334
<i>whom they had left
in the care of Ankie's parents.</i>

172
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,581
<i>The next morning at 10:00,
he had to take the train to Munich.</i>

173
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,983
<i>He woke up a little bit late.</i>

174
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:21,716
We got to the train station,
and the train had left.

175
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,452
I was desperate because I thought
he's going to get in trouble...

176
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,485
when he gets back to Munich because
they're waiting for him there.

177
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,998
He said,
"Well, another day with you. "

178
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:35,732
I said, " No, let's try the other
train station about 30 miles onwards. "

179
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:39,137
<i>So we raced to the next station...</i>

180
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,507
<i>and in Eindhoven in Holland,
that's where he jumped on the train.</i>

181
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:45,409
Without a ticket.
The train was already in the station.

182
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,915
I still remember me
running next to the train...

183
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,612
<i>and he left.</i>

184
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,381
<i>And that was the last time
I saw him.</i>

185
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,390
<i>On the night of September 4,
as Andre arrived back at the village...</i>

186
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:08,095
<i>the Israeli delegation was enjoying
a night out at the theater...</i>

187
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,138
<i>watching Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

188
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,831
<i>They returned to the village
at midnight.</i>

189
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:29,116
<i>The night of the operation...</i>

190
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:33,594
we went to the restaurant
in the railway station for dinner.

191
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,025
There we met with the chief
of the organization...

192
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,571
who for the first time told us
what the target of our operation was.

193
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:51,104
<i>I felt very proud...</i>

194
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,173
<i>that for the first time I was able
to confront the Israelis.</i>

195
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:09,697
<i>Our passports and belongings
were taken from us...</i>

196
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:15,101
<i>so there wouldn't be any clue
as to who we were.</i>

197
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,105
<i>Then we all went to the village.</i>

198
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,638
<i>As we were climbing
over the fence...</i>

199
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,502
we ran into a group
of American athletes...

200
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:56,066
who were sneaking in
after a night out.

201
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:59,602
I remember they were drunk.

202
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:04,550
<i>The funny thing is that we actually
helped each other to climb over.</i>

203
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,746
<i>I held my hand out...</i>

204
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:13,488
and we lifted one
of them into the village.

205
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:18,022
We said thank you and good-bye.

206
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:25,005
<i>With the help of members
of the East German team...</i>

207
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:28,099
<i>the terrorist leaders had entered
and studied the Olympic village...</i>

208
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:31,168
<i>in the days prior
to the attack.</i>

209
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:35,309
<i>Now they headed straight
for the Israeli men's quarters.</i>

210
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,978
<i>We headed towards the building.</i>

211
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,487
<i>Each of us
was carrying a sports bag...</i>

212
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,855
<i>filled with weapons,
hidden under clothes.</i>

213
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:48,555
<i>Each of us was given
a specific task.</i>

214
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:55,126
<i>My job was to guard the outside of
the building while the others went in.</i>

215
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,646
<i>The Israelis were
in five apartments.</i>

216
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:10,651
<i>Apartment one
housed the team coaches.</i>

217
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:13,244
<i>The terrorists went there first.</i>

218
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:20,424
<i>As they broke in, wrestling coach Moshe
Weinberger attempted to stop them...</i>

219
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,521
<i>but he was shot and wounded.</i>

220
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:27,124
<i>The leader went
into the first room...</i>

221
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:33,936
but didn't realize there was
an Israeli behind him.

222
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:38,674
He was attacked full force
and his weapon was taken.

223
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:44,310
Another member of our group panicked
and shot the Israeli.

224
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:50,587
<i>The terrorists demanded that
Weinberger, already heavily wounded...</i>

225
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,651
<i>show them where the rest
of the Israelis were.</i>

226
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,960
<i>At gunpoint, he led them
past apartment two...</i>

227
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:58,965
<i>which housed
the field athletes...</i>

228
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:03,265
<i>to apartment three, which contained
the weight lifters and wrestlers.</i>

229
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:06,273
<i>Weinberger calculated that
they might stand some chance...</i>

230
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,799
<i>of overpowering the terrorists.</i>

231
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:14,739
I got out of bed and went outside...

232
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:19,185
only to find myself
standing in front of a terrorist...

233
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:22,679
wearing a balaclava hood
and a yellow sweater.

234
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:29,855
<i>The terrorists were already holding
all five of Gad Zabari's roommates.</i>

235
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:33,924
<i>Now, weight lifter David Berger,
suggests they attack the terrorists...</i>

236
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,766
<i>saying,
"We have nothing to lose. "</i>

237
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:41,207
<i>But a gunman understands and jabs
a machine gun into Zabari's waist...</i>

238
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:45,441
<i>ordering him towards the exit
and back to apartment number one.</i>

239
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:53,848
<i>And that's how
I came to be the first in line.</i>

240
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:00,123
My friends are behind me
with their heads bowed.

241
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:03,686
I feel in a bit of a daze
when suddenly I see...

242
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:08,429
another terrorist ahead of me,
wearing a balaclava hood.

243
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:12,439
Suddenly the reality
of what's happening hits me.

244
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:18,242
As I get closer,
he orders me in this direction.

245
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:21,315
But as he's giving me the order...

246
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,546
I push his Kalashnikov aside
and run.

247
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:33,654
<i>He shoots two or three rounds at me.</i>

248
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,788
<i>But I don't think
about the shots, I just run.</i>

249
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,993
<i>I run for about 70 meters...</i>

250
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:44,061
<i>and then jump over the village fence
and into the first building I see.</i>

251
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,402
<i>As Gad Zabari ran away...</i>

252
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:51,378
<i>the already wounded Moshe Weinberger
heroically jumped on the terrorists.</i>

253
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,607
<i>He was shot and killed.</i>

254
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:57,709
We had no orders to kill.

255
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:01,449
We were forced to
only when things went wrong.

256
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:08,854
<i>I heard some shots,
so I walked up to the window...</i>

257
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,592
<i>and then I realized
Moshe Weinberger...</i>

258
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,897
<i>has been thrown out
of the door...</i>

259
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,664
<i>to the pavement.</i>

260
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:21,004
<i>He was naked,
without anything on him.</i>

261
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,474
Shmuel Lalkin
Head Israeli Team

262
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:25,570
<i>And I saw that he was dead
because blood was pooling around him.</i>

263
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:29,708
This was when I thought
that we were attacked by somebody.

264
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,278
<i>This is ABC.</i>

265
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,948
I'm Jim McKay speaking to you live,
at this moment...

266
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,821
from ABC headquarters,
Munich, West Germany.

267
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:14,953
<i>The Olympics of serenity
have become the one thing...</i>

268
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>the Germans didn't want them to be:
the Olympics of terror.</i>

269
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:23,193
<i>I had the first telephone call
from the head of the team...</i>

270
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,296
Dan Shilon
Israeli Television

271
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:29,309
this morning at 6:00,
and he told me that the Arabs are there...

272
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:31,368
<i>and one of the Israelis
was killed.</i>

273
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:34,004
<i>His name is Moshe Weinberger...</i>

274
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,014
Israeli Journalist

275
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,643
and I saw his body carried out
after one hour into an ambulance.

276
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,858
That body was smashed...

277
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:46,758
which means he was killed
by a machine gun...

278
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:49,228
<i>not by a regular gun.</i>

279
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,430
<i>I was sleeping.</i>

280
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,698
<i>My parents came to wake me up,
and they said...</i>

281
00:24:57,806 --> 00:25:00,070
<i>"We just heard on the radio
that there was an attack...</i>

282
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,609
<i>at the Israeli quarters
of the Olympic village.</i>

283
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,943
<i>They killed one of the Israelis,
and they say it was the boxing coach. "</i>

284
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:10,416
I know there was no boxing coach,
so I jumped out of my bed.

285
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:13,910
I thought, if it is not the
boxing coach, then what coach is it?

286
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,923
Maybe it's Andre.

287
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:18,517
How many Israelis are they
holding as hostage in the block?

288
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:21,027
Around 16, 17.

289
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:24,587
Thirteen members of the Israeli team
as hostages.

290
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:28,898
There are nine hostages.

291
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,963
Nobody could tell me
if Andre was a part of this...

292
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,238
<i>if he was one of the hostages,
if he escaped.</i>

293
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,244
<i>Nobody could tell me.</i>

294
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:45,513
<i>When I arrived on the scene,
I met a young female police officer...</i>

295
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:49,956
<i>who was talking to a man
dressed in a white suit.</i>

296
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,093
<i>He was Issa,
the terrorists' spokesman.</i>

297
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,593
Issa expressed his demands
in a staccato manner.

298
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:04,969
He was very cool
and very determined...

299
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:10,704
<i>clearly fanatical
in his convictions.</i>

300
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:18,046
<i>The terrorists handed
a communique to the police.</i>

301
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,385
<i>In it they demanded the release of
more than 200 revolutionary prisoners...</i>

302
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,085
<i>from jails in Israel,
Germany and elsewhere.</i>

303
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,159
<i>If this was not done
by 12:00 noon...</i>

304
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,960
<i>the hostages would be executed.</i>

305
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:40,904
And you have until 12:00?

306
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:43,443
They said that at 12:00
they will shoot.

307
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:48,913
<i>I certainly took it seriously because
I was standing there on gunpoint...</i>

308
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:52,509
<i>where always two or three
machine guns pointed on me...</i>

309
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,612
<i>and the leader of the terrorists
had a hand grenade in his hands.</i>

310
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,191
Walther Tröger
Mayor of Olympic Village

311
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,589
So I had to take it seriously.

312
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,686
When he was discussing with me,
he always had that hand grenade.

313
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:10,536
<i>Somebody's going inside.</i>

314
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,570
<i>The negotiators knew nothing
about the terrorists...</i>

315
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,576
<i>except what they saw.</i>

316
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,942
<i>Three were visible
at any one time.</i>

317
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,777
<i>Issa, the leader, his face blackened
with shoe polish.</i>

318
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,616
<i>Tony, second in command, usually at the
first floor window wearing a cowboy hat.</i>

319
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,656
<i>And another man
guarding the balcony door.</i>

320
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,784
<i>Issa told the negotiators...</i>

321
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,557
<i>that a second Israeli
had been shot and killed...</i>

322
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,063
<i>while trying to overpower
his captors.</i>

323
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,398
<i>The terrorist leader refused
to identify the dead man...</i>

324
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:43,528
<i>or allow his body
to be removed...</i>

325
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:48,269
<i>until all the political prisoners
on the communique had been released.</i>

326
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:53,241
<i>My camera crew and I ended up,
for all of that long day...</i>

327
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:55,908
<i>looking down
into this little walkway...</i>

328
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:57,918
<i>very quiet.</i>

329
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:00,586
Gerald Seymour
ITN News Reporter

330
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:04,215
And in a sense, you were looking down
into the cockpit of world events.

331
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:12,425
<i>We opened up all the radios
and television stations...</i>

332
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,491
<i>to get some information.</i>

333
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:19,098
<i>Then at 9:00 in the morning, I found out
that Andre is one of the hostages.</i>

334
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,786
<i>The men in the room:
Josef Romano is 31 years old...</i>

335
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:22,366
<i>The men in the room:
Josef Romano is 31 years old...</i>

336
00:28:22,443 --> 00:28:24,638
<i>an Israeli weight lifter
in the middleweight class...</i>

337
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:28,944
<i>David Berger, 26 years old,
in the light heavyweight class...</i>

338
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:33,545
<i>Ziev Friedman, another 26-year-old
weight lifter in the bantamweight class.</i>

339
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,955
These strong men sitting helpless
there at the point of submachine guns.

340
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:42,520
<i>Eliezer Halfin, 24 years old,
a freestyle wrestler, is in that room.</i>

341
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,929
<i>Mark Slavin is 18 years old,
a Greco-Roman wrestler.</i>

342
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,026
<i>The others are officials,
Joseph Gotfriend, Jacob Springer...</i>

343
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:53,233
<i>Andre Spitzer, Kehat Shorr
and Amitzur Shapiro.</i>

344
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,309
<i>We have a situation.</i>

345
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:05,682
<i>In Israel, the population awoke
to the shocking news.</i>

346
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:09,211
<i>Demand the release of some 200 Arabs
now being held in Israel.</i>

347
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,952
<i>The Israeli government
immediately made it clear...</i>

348
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,054
<i>that in line with their policy, no deals
would be struck with the terrorists.</i>

349
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,065
Golda Meir
Prime Minister of Israel 1969-1974

350
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:23,194
If we should give in,
then no Israeli anywhere in the world...

351
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:25,796
can feel that his life is safe.

352
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,676
It's blackmail of the worst kind.

353
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:45,819
<i>At this time I was the aide-de-camp
of Minister Genscher.</i>

354
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:50,330
<i>And the minister
was shocked, of course.</i>

355
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:51,592
General Ulrich K. Wegener

356
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,257
He wanted to see the Minister
of Interior of Bavaria...

357
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,302
because he was responsible.

358
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,031
We are a federal state.

359
00:29:57,105 --> 00:30:01,804
<i>So they talked to each other and they
decided to go to the Olympic village.</i>

360
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:07,211
<i>In terms of the politicians
and the VIPs who came...</i>

361
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:10,648
they looked to me as if
they held none of the cards...

362
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:15,519
<i>as if they basically did not understand,
one, how to respond...</i>

363
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:18,548
<i>and two, the mind-set of the people
they were dealing with.</i>

364
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:26,532
<i>The Palestinians that one saw,
there was that feeling...</i>

365
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:29,569
<i>that they were in charge
and that they were dictating.</i>

366
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:40,303
When it became clear to me
that negotiation was fruitless...

367
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,008
I said to the leader:

368
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,075
<i>"You know our recent history...</i>

369
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:50,318
<i>what was done to the Jews
by the Germans.</i>

370
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:55,419
<i>You must understand, this makes the
situation here particularly difficult. "</i>

371
00:30:55,496 --> 00:31:03,494
<i>I said "Why don't you let them go
and take me instead?"</i>

372
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:08,204
<i>But he refused.</i>

373
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:19,877
<i>Acting on behalf of both the Federal
and Bavarian governments...</i>

374
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:24,288
I offered the terrorists
an unlimited sum of money...

375
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:26,519
in exchange for the hostages.

376
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,289
This offer was rejected.

377
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:31,365
They said, "It is not a question of
either money or substitute hostages...

378
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:34,833
but only of the 200 prisoners. "

379
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:37,928
<i>Peter Jennings is inside
the village...</i>

380
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:40,702
<i>and is observing this
with the naked eye.</i>

381
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:43,208
<i>Jim, I am almost directly...</i>

382
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:45,712
<i>over the Israeli building.</i>

383
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:48,614
<i>It will be a famous number before long.
It's building 31.</i>

384
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:51,776
<i>It's on Connollystrasse.</i>

385
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:53,821
<i>It does appear to be confirmed-</i>

386
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:57,484
<i>though anything confirmed today
is difficult-</i>

387
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,119
<i>that these guerrillas are from one
of the very extreme left-wing groups...</i>

388
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,629
<i>a group called Black September.</i>

389
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:12,362
<i>Continuous delegations go forward.</i>

390
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,238
<i>People here are waiting,
but unquestionably...</i>

391
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:18,073
<i>the mood becoming more tense.</i>

392
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,137
<i>They had set a deadline of noon...</i>

393
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,580
which is just an hour
and 15 minutes away...

394
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,279
<i>saying that they were going to kill
all of their hostages at that time.</i>

395
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:34,762
<i>There were other people involved.</i>

396
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:39,256
<i>A friend of mine was a member
of the Arab Council...</i>

397
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,767
and he also came to negotiate.

398
00:32:44,372 --> 00:32:49,002
<i>My overall impression was that
they really believed...</i>

399
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:53,605
in the possibility
of their demands being met.

400
00:32:53,681 --> 00:33:01,486
<i>In my opinion, from a political
point of view, this was 99.9% unlikely.</i>

401
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:07,518
<i>I thought and still think that
the Israelis would rather have let...</i>

402
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:11,122
<i>their whole athletic team be killed
than let this happen.</i>

403
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:15,363
<i>I tried to explain these things
to Issa...</i>

404
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:19,634
<i>but he was very skeptical
and dismissive of me.</i>

405
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,840
<i>Israel remained adamant that no deal
could be struck with the terrorists...</i>

406
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:30,247
<i>but to buy time,
the negotiators lied to Issa...</i>

407
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:33,981
<i>saying they were still awaiting
a definitive answer from Jerusalem.</i>

408
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:38,082
<i>They begged the terrorist leader
to postpone his noon deadline.</i>

409
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,923
<i>Issa responded only
with a new threat-</i>

410
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,020
<i>one Israeli would be shot
publicly every hour...</i>

411
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:46,532
<i>that their demands remained unmet.</i>

412
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:52,366
We were, I think, a little bit naive.
Also the minister.

413
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,268
<i>The German government
at this time thought...</i>

414
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,871
<i>they could negotiate with terrorists.</i>

415
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:03,883
<i>They were thinking
that they could talk to them...</i>

416
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,977
<i>and convince them
to let the Israelis go.</i>

417
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:09,817
But there was no way.

418
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,533
<i>So the time to get close
to noon and to think that...</i>

419
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:31,305
"It's almost noon.
Are they going to kill him now?"

420
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,371
It was like dying
a little bit.

421
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:40,285
<i>A matter of seconds before
the deadly ultimatum was reached...</i>

422
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:44,815
<i>the negotiators persuaded Issa
to agree to an extension.</i>

423
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:49,295
<i>The deadline now is 5:00
Munich time, noon in New York.</i>

424
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,298
<i>It is now 1:25 here in Munich.</i>

425
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:54,028
<i>It's about three and a half hours
to the next deadline.</i>

426
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:05,209
Israeli Olympic Committee in Jerusalem
has now named the second dead man...

427
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:09,374
as being Josef Romano, a 31-year-old
middleweight weight lifter.

428
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:25,526
I can't believe it for one second
that my husband has gone.

429
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,562
<i>Yesterday I received a cassette...</i>

430
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:33,596
where he said, " Happy Jewish
New Year" to everyone...

431
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,733
<i>his brothers, the children-</i>

432
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:39,939
<i>A lot of people I meet
in the street or at work...</i>

433
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,605
Schlomit Romano

434
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,582
when they hear about me
being the daughter...

435
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:46,381
of Josef Romano from München...

436
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:52,990
<i>they say, "Oh, you know,
when I was little...</i>

437
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,257
<i>I admired your father,
and he was like this and that. "</i>

438
00:35:56,364 --> 00:36:01,324
<i>All the time I hear new stories
and new things...</i>

439
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,267
about my father.

440
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,772
That's how I know him.

441
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:08,933
<i>Of course, not enough.</i>

442
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:13,140
<i>Like, I can't imagine his voice.</i>

443
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:20,884
I can't imagine him
calling my name.

444
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:54,249
<i>They let Josef Romano die, bleeding to
death, lying between all his friends...</i>

445
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:59,419
<i>as a warning if anybody tried to grab
a weapon from one of the Palestinians...</i>

446
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,222
<i>this would be their lot.</i>

447
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:03,729
<i>Nobody has the right to do that.</i>

448
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:15,537
<i>In a way, I didn't like Issa
because of what he was doing...</i>

449
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:19,545
<i>but I could have liked him
when I met him elsewhere.</i>

450
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,543
<i>He was not violent. I would have
even trusted him in his word.</i>

451
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,884
<i>Not his compatriots and partners.</i>

452
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,150
Walther Tröger
Mayor of Olympic Village

453
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,724
They were like-
What do we say in German?

454
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,760
<i>Galgenvogel.
Gallow birds.</i>

455
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,490
<i>But Issa was different from them.</i>

456
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:44,128
<i>We were not only negotiating
on how to handle this.</i>

457
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:47,174
<i>We also were-
I wouldn't call it philosophical...</i>

458
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:50,439
<i>but we were also going into the grounds
of the whole thing.</i>

459
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,479
<i>I said,
"Why are you doing it?"</i>

460
00:37:52,513 --> 00:37:55,812
He said, "We are sorry for you.
You made good Olympic Games.

461
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:58,511
But you offered us a showcase...

462
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:02,852
and we have to use this showcase
in order to show our possibility...

463
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:07,326
<i>to so many millions or even billions
of people in the world...</i>

464
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,386
<i>who are watching
your Olympic Games. "</i>

465
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:12,125
<i>Mark Spitz,
the American swimming star...</i>

466
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,599
<i>who won seven gold medals
at this Olympiad...</i>

467
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:18,502
<i>was placed under heavy guard
shortly after the drama unfurled.</i>

468
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,407
<i>Within hours, Spitz was hustled out
of Germany on a plane bound for home.</i>

469
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:26,311
<i>Spitz is a Jew, and it was feared
an attempt might be made to seize him.</i>

470
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:32,546
<i>Spontaneous demonstrations condemning
the attack sprung up around the world.</i>

471
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,716
<i>There was outrage that the Olympic ideal
of peace and brotherhood...</i>

472
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,315
<i>had been so shamelessly destroyed.</i>

473
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:45,231
<i>But as the day progressed, there was
also a growing sense of anger...</i>

474
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:47,960
<i>directed at the International
Olympic Committee...</i>

475
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,436
<i>for refusing to halt the Games
in the light of what had happened.</i>

476
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:55,567
<i>The Olympic Committee
at that time was very arrogant.</i>

477
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:57,702
<i>Very arrogant.</i>

478
00:38:57,778 --> 00:39:02,511
<i>They felt something terrible happened,
but they have nothing to do with it.</i>

479
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,074
Willi Daume, head of
the Olympic Organizing Committee...

480
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:07,086
has announced that the Olympics
will go on.

481
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:11,488
As of this hour, the Olympics, the Games
of the 20th Olympiad, will continue.

482
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:06,637
<i>This is a live shot
you're looking at right now.</i>

483
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,904
<i>And we're moving in now
on the windows...</i>

484
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:14,505
<i>behind which, at this moment, eight or
nine terrified living human beings...</i>

485
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,516
<i>are being held prisoner.</i>

486
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:20,816
<i>The demands have been many.
There's someone right now.</i>

487
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:23,379
<i>And this has happened
time and time and time again.</i>

488
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,085
<i>The door opening, the head coming out
to see what is going on.</i>

489
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:30,755
<i>Within 200 yards of where that
building is, there's a manmade pond.</i>

490
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,800
<i>Not a formal swimming pool, but
a very lovely pond with a little dock...</i>

491
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,927
where the athletes lie out
and take sun.

492
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:38,301
That's what they're doing
right now, sunning themselves.

493
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:41,431
<i>They're swimming, talking of technique
with athletes of other countries.</i>

494
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:45,774
<i>And yet this grim, terrible thing
is taking place inside the village.</i>

495
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:49,643
<i>There were people running
around the training track.</i>

496
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,948
<i>I thought, yeah, you've trained
for this for four years...</i>

497
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,215
<i>but it seemed wrong.</i>

498
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:57,449
<i>There was something selfish,
slightly obscene...</i>

499
00:41:57,524 --> 00:42:00,425
<i>about the atmosphere
in the rest of the village.</i>

500
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:08,561
<i>I didn't hear much
of the negotiations.</i>

501
00:42:08,636 --> 00:42:12,732
<i>I spent my time
standing guard outside.</i>

502
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,967
But after some time I was relieved
and I went into the room...

503
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:17,203
where the Israelis
were being held.

504
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:20,872
I found one of our guys sitting with
the Israelis, his gun by his side.

505
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,419
<i>We began to chat
with the Israelis...</i>

506
00:42:26,487 --> 00:42:29,149
and told each other
stories and jokes.

507
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:34,216
But then our leader suddenly came in
and ordered us to stop messing about.

508
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:39,193
<i>He didn't want us
to talk to them too much...</i>

509
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:43,498
<i>in case they tried
to emotionally exploit us...</i>

510
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,099
and tried to escape.

511
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:13,394
<i>The Germans decided
that the time had come...</i>

512
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,435
<i>for them to take the initiative.</i>

513
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:17,902
<i>Food was brought in...</i>

514
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,735
<i>not only with the hope
that the hostages would be fed...</i>

515
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:24,835
<i>but in such large quantities
that no one man could carry it alone.</i>

516
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:28,177
<i>The police hoped more than one guerrilla
would come out for the five boxes...</i>

517
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:30,546
<i>could be rushed and overpowered.</i>

518
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:35,077
<i>A second hope was the chefs could gain
access and count the Arabs inside.</i>

519
00:43:35,122 --> 00:43:37,920
<i>There were no chefs.
It was the police commissioner...</i>

520
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,583
<i>Mr. Schreiber, and myself...</i>

521
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,823
with two policemen
clad as chefs, as cooks.

522
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,830
The idea was not
to poison the food.

523
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:47,332
The idea was that someone of us...

524
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:49,267
<i>could enter the room...</i>

525
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:53,397
<i>because at that time nobody knew
about the number of the terrorists.</i>

526
00:43:53,474 --> 00:43:55,942
<i>The deception had no effect.</i>

527
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:58,944
<i>The negotiators reported
to the waiting Israeli ambassador...</i>

528
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,207
<i>that their plan had failed.</i>

529
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:04,876
<i>The ambassador repeated again
that no deal would be made.</i>

530
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:10,655
<i>The Israeli ambassador
was watching, together with me...</i>

531
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,819
<i>what was going on, and he
was not very happy about this.</i>

532
00:44:13,894 --> 00:44:15,885
<i>He got out
and asked for a phone...</i>

533
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:18,989
<i>and he called
the prime minister in Israel.</i>

534
00:44:19,066 --> 00:44:20,556
General Ulrich K. Wegener

535
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,729
The Israelis, they wanted
to send a team...

536
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:28,366
which was rejected
by the German government, of course.

537
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:35,879
<i>The prime minister had a long talk
with Chancellor Brandt.</i>

538
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:38,918
<i>And I remember her report saying...</i>

539
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:43,650
<i>that he refused
that any Israeli team...</i>

540
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:47,182
<i>will come to Germany
to do the action.</i>

541
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:50,195
Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad
(Israel Secret Service) 1968-74

542
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,599
And the general feeling was that
if the German defense- army, whoever-

543
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:58,000
will take it upon itself...

544
00:44:58,105 --> 00:45:02,508
<i>they are capable
of doing it well in Germany...</i>

545
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:07,412
<i>and there is no necessity
to send an Israeli team.</i>

546
00:45:07,514 --> 00:45:10,483
At the time,
I was the head of the Mossad.

547
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:15,716
<i>And Moshe Dayan spoke
with the prime minister...</i>

548
00:45:15,823 --> 00:45:19,452
<i>and they insisted that I
should go to be present...</i>

549
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:23,292
<i>to see how the Germans
do this operation.</i>

550
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,464
<i>Zvi Zamir immediately
flew to Munich...</i>

551
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:30,128
<i>arriving early that same evening.</i>

552
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:40,904
<i>Almost 11 hours
after the start of the crisis...</i>

553
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:44,473
<i>the Olympic Committee finally bowed
to intense international pressure...</i>

554
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:46,485
<i>and suspended the Games.</i>

555
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:49,454
<i>Some competitions are continuing.
They will be allowed to finish.</i>

556
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:51,956
<i>But at that time
the Games will be suspended.</i>

557
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:55,086
<i>At 10:00 tomorrow morning,
in the huge Olympic stadium...</i>

558
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:59,064
<i>there will be a memorial service
for the two men dead.</i>

559
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:35,630
<i>The Olympic Games are reduced
to utter silence...</i>

560
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:39,433
<i>and one tantalizing head
poking out a door.</i>

561
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:42,507
<i>Something has to happen.</i>

562
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:07,627
<i>It was a kind of...</i>

563
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,167
Dan Shilon
Israeli Television

564
00:47:09,236 --> 00:47:11,136
a bizarre,
surrealistic situation...

565
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:13,706
in which we journalists
surrounded the event...

566
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:16,470
with every possible camera.

567
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:19,603
<i>Endless cameras
around the Olympic village.</i>

568
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,250
<i>It was a great story to many television
stations and media around the world.</i>

569
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:32,257
<i>I mean, the climax
of the Olympic Games, such an event.</i>

570
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,386
<i>And perhaps even some
of the stations...</i>

571
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,794
<i>took a very cynical approach to it...</i>

572
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:41,027
saying, "Wow!
What an audience we'll get now. "

573
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:46,469
<i>On a lovely late summer afternoon,
the tense vigil continues.</i>

574
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:50,737
<i>In just a half an hour,
the deadline will have expired.</i>

575
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:05,414
He definitely had
his hands tied. I saw it.

576
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:09,189
<i>Late in the afternoon,
I saw that the window was opened...</i>

577
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:11,787
<i>of the apartment
where they were kept hostage...</i>

578
00:48:11,898 --> 00:48:14,423
<i>and I saw Andre
in front of the window.</i>

579
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,968
<i>They asked him,
"Is everybody okay there...</i>

580
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:21,201
<i>and what is the situation
with all the other hostages?"</i>

581
00:48:21,308 --> 00:48:24,436
<i>Andre said,
"Everybody is okay except for one. "</i>

582
00:48:24,511 --> 00:48:29,312
<i>When the Germans asked, "Who is
the one and what happened to him?"</i>

583
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,874
<i>I saw that he was not allowed
to say that.</i>

584
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:35,945
<i>So he got hit with the butt of the rifle
of one of the Palestinians...</i>

585
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:39,925
and pushed away,
and they closed the curtains.

586
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:43,224
<i>That was the last time, really,
that I saw him.</i>

587
00:48:49,336 --> 00:48:52,066
<i>After that, Mr. Genscher said...</i>

588
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:57,600
<i>he wished to have a direct discussion
with the Israeli hostages.</i>

589
00:48:57,677 --> 00:49:00,737
<i>Then Mr. Schreiber said
he wished to accompany him.</i>

590
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:03,509
<i>They said, "No,you are policemen.
You are not allowed to enter. "</i>

591
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:08,043
<i>I said, 'All right. Then it's me. "
So we went up there...</i>

592
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:12,457
and it was a terrible impression,
I must say.

593
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,857
<i>One was bound to one chair...</i>

594
00:49:17,964 --> 00:49:22,128
<i>and the others were on
the two sides tied together.</i>

595
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:24,670
<i>And then the one
who was killed...</i>

596
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:26,671
<i>was lying there.</i>

597
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:29,901
<i>The wall was full of blood.</i>

598
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:37,580
<i>I will never be able
to forget those faces...</i>

599
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:41,211
full of fear, but also hope.

600
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,023
<i>Then we had a discussion...</i>

601
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:47,652
<i>and the discussion was...</i>

602
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:50,491
absolutely covered by the...

603
00:49:56,403 --> 00:50:00,931
very depressed mood
of the hostages.

604
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,346
<i>They wished...</i>

605
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:13,318
to come to a conclusion
which might save their lives...

606
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,083
but they were not very hopeful
in that respect.

607
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:44,231
There's been one report attributed to
Wilf Brimsley of the Associated Press...

608
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:46,180
There's been one report attributed to
Wilf Brimsley of the Associated Press...

609
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:49,154
who said a police lieutenant
told him that at 5:00...

610
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:51,487
about 29 minutes from now,
Munich time...

611
00:50:51,558 --> 00:50:54,118
<i>a volunteer squad of policemen
dressed as athletes...</i>

612
00:50:54,194 --> 00:50:57,755
<i>would storm the Israeli
Olympic team headquarters...</i>

613
00:50:57,864 --> 00:51:00,628
<i>and would come in shooting.</i>

614
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,660
<i>These are the volunteer squad of
38 police or West German border guards.</i>

615
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:08,401
<i>Because of very complicated laws...</i>

616
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:11,035
<i>the German army would not
be allowed to participate.</i>

617
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,978
<i>There you see an athlete
holding a canvas bag...</i>

618
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,072
<i>in which is obviously
a machine gun.</i>

619
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:19,914
<i>The commissioner of the police,
Mr. Schreiber...</i>

620
00:51:19,986 --> 00:51:22,477
<i>selected some policemen,
you know...</i>

621
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:24,149
and asked them...

622
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:28,854
have you ever shot a gun
or whatever?

623
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:31,454
That was it.
They had no training, nothing.

624
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:43,870
<i>Jim, there are now a great many
of those security men...</i>

625
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:46,811
<i>in athletic uniforms...</i>

626
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:49,313
<i>moving off
in various directions.</i>

627
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:52,182
<i>I don't want to instigate
any false drama here...</i>

628
00:51:52,252 --> 00:51:57,155
<i>but it looks, at this point, like the
beginnings of some kind of deployment.</i>

629
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,456
<i>The plan was for us
to climb up on the roof...</i>

630
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:08,524
<i>of the Connollystrasse building...</i>

631
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:11,103
<i>and go down the ventilation shafts.</i>

632
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:14,265
Once in position we were to
await the code word 'sunshine'...

633
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:18,437
from the Chief Inspector
before attacking.

634
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:25,246
<i>That's how we would
free the hostages.</i>

635
00:52:39,165 --> 00:52:41,326
<i>Walking cautiously on the roof...</i>

636
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:44,370
<i>hopefully not being heard
in the rooms below.</i>

637
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:04,389
<i>You see how close these two men are.
Couldn't be 20 feet.</i>

638
00:53:10,196 --> 00:53:13,632
<i>You see he comes out and
gets down on his hands and knees.</i>

639
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,965
<i>That's for him
to get a better look up.</i>

640
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:29,314
<i>Outside our studio here
and around the Olympic village...</i>

641
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,977
<i>a crowd estimated
at 75,000 to 80,000 people...</i>

642
00:53:33,053 --> 00:53:36,022
<i>has gathered,
awaiting the outcome of this.</i>

643
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:43,962
<i>This building now swarming
with Germans...</i>

644
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,021
<i>trying to rescue the Israelis.</i>

645
00:53:47,634 --> 00:53:52,435
<i>The deadline appears, to us,
to be less than one minute away.</i>

646
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:54,439
<i>Anything to report at all, Peter?</i>

647
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:57,635
<i>The commando looks very much
more nervous than he did a while ago...</i>

648
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:02,204
<i>and he certainly has an apprehensive
darting-about look from here...</i>

649
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:06,184
<i>almost as if they do sense
that something is very imminent.</i>

650
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,060
<i>Once again there is a delegation
directly under the building...</i>

651
00:54:16,096 --> 00:54:18,894
<i>and the Arab guard,
not on the balcony...</i>

652
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:22,901
<i>but in the window slightly down
below him, is negotiating with him.</i>

653
00:54:30,677 --> 00:54:32,736
<i>Now we've gotten
an official time check.</i>

654
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:36,475
<i>It is 5:00.
This is the deadline.</i>

655
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:39,984
<i>The storming, if it is going to happen,
could happen at any moment.</i>

656
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:49,585
<i>We waited and waited, but the
code word "sunshine"never came...</i>

657
00:54:49,629 --> 00:54:52,120
<i>because there was a film crew...</i>

658
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:55,861
<i>on the East German building
opposite us...</i>

659
00:54:55,935 --> 00:55:00,395
which broadcast live everything
that was happening on the roof.

660
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:07,504
<i>Later we discovered that there
was a TV in every athlete's room...</i>

661
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:11,448
<i>and the terrorists had been able...</i>

662
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:14,612
<i>to watch us preparing
live on screen.</i>

663
00:55:14,721 --> 00:55:19,124
<i>Thank God we called it off.</i>

664
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:25,357
<i>It surely would have been
a suicide mission if we had attacked.</i>

665
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:34,438
<i>If you had told me then that the Germans
did not have available in Munich...</i>

666
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:36,101
Gerald Seymour
ITN News Service

667
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:38,167
a trained storm squad,
I think I would have disbelieved you...

668
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:42,738
<i>because everybody in 1972
was totally transfixed...</i>

669
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:46,910
<i>by a myth of utter
German ruthless efficiency.</i>

670
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:02,198
<i>Fourteen minutes to 6:00,
Munich time, in the evening.</i>

671
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:07,663
We were told not to let the situation
go on for more than 24 hours...

672
00:56:07,774 --> 00:56:11,505
because psychologically that was
the most we could take.

673
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:18,074
If the Israeli government still
refused to release the prisoners...

674
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:20,584
we had been told
to demand an airplane...

675
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,488
to take us, with the hostages,
to any Arab country we could.

676
00:56:28,228 --> 00:56:32,028
<i>At 6:00 p. m., the Palestinians
issued a new demand.</i>

677
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,532
<i>They wanted a long-distance jet...</i>

678
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:39,129
<i>to fly them and their hostages
to an unspecified Arab country.</i>

679
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:41,901
<i>But the German government
and the organizing committee...</i>

680
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:44,636
<i>decided that we were not
allowed at all...</i>

681
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,646
<i>to let foreigners bring out
guests of our country...</i>

682
00:56:47,714 --> 00:56:50,080
<i>who came as guests
to the Olympic Games.</i>

683
00:56:50,149 --> 00:56:54,916
<i>That led to the final conclusion that we
give the impression to the terrorists...</i>

684
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:56,921
<i>that we'll let them fly out...</i>

685
00:56:57,023 --> 00:57:00,652
but try everything
to then kill them...

686
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:03,628
or bring them into prison...

687
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:06,131
<i>before they could leave the country.</i>

688
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:11,565
<i>Our aim was to
drag out the proceedings...</i>

689
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:14,801
<i>to wear down the terrorists...</i>

690
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:20,403
and try to establish the best time
for freeing the hostages.

691
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,573
That was our objective.

692
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:25,914
<i>The organizers of the Games
naturally wanted the Games...</i>

693
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:29,853
<i>to resume as soon as possible.</i>

694
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:34,986
<i>We had to find a resolution
one way or another.</i>

695
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:50,336
<i>To move the thing
from the Olympic compound...</i>

696
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,310
Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad
(Israel Secret Service) 1968-74

697
00:57:52,378 --> 00:57:54,175
in order to let
the Olympic Games to carry on...

698
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,475
this was their main objective.

699
00:57:57,383 --> 00:58:00,011
<i>The Israeli team...</i>

700
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:03,715
and its rescue
were secondary to that.

701
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:14,262
<i>The staff group decided
to bring them...</i>

702
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:17,633
<i>to the public airport of Munich
in order to try something.</i>

703
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,968
<i>I said, "Listen, that's crazy.
We have another airport...</i>

704
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,564
<i>which is not a public airport. "</i>

705
00:58:22,642 --> 00:58:25,634
<i>So I proposed to make
Furstenfeldbruck the target.</i>

706
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:42,986
<i>The police plan revolved around
a decoy Boeing 727...</i>

707
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:46,225
<i>which was to be left on the runway
with its engine idling.</i>

708
00:58:46,332 --> 00:58:49,096
<i>On board would be a voluntary squad
of policemen...</i>

709
00:58:49,168 --> 00:58:51,329
<i>disguised as flight crew.</i>

710
00:58:51,437 --> 00:58:54,964
<i>The Palestinians and Israelis
would be flown in by helicopter.</i>

711
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:57,532
<i>When Issa and his deputy
went to inspect the plane...</i>

712
00:58:57,644 --> 00:58:59,475
<i>the fake crew would overcome them.</i>

713
00:58:59,545 --> 00:59:03,948
<i>Meanwhile, five snipers positioned
on the tower and around the airfield...</i>

714
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,712
<i>would open fire
on the remaining terrorists...</i>

715
00:59:06,786 --> 00:59:10,483
<i>and assault vehicles would rush in
to rescue the hostages.</i>

716
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:14,322
<i>There were only five snipers
because the police still believed...</i>

717
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:17,090
<i>there would be a total
of four to five terrorists.</i>

718
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:05,577
<i>This is Peter Jennings
in the Olympic village.</i>

719
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:08,239
<i>The Olympic village
is built on various levels...</i>

720
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,977
<i>and underneath building 31, and
underneath all of the buildings here...</i>

721
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:14,246
<i>there is a network of roads.</i>

722
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,754
<i>Those alleyways
now have been used to bring in...</i>

723
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:20,224
<i>a fairly massive security force,
including armored cars...</i>

724
01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:23,228
<i>and just a short while ago,
Howard Cosell...</i>

725
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:26,754
<i>noticed that there was
considerable activity there.</i>

726
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,858
<i>Over the recent 25 to 30 minutes...</i>

727
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:32,200
<i>there was a flurry of activity,
cars were speeding off...</i>

728
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:35,729
<i>and we now have a corridor
or avenue of departure...</i>

729
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:38,073
<i>available to the Arabs...</i>

730
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:40,772
<i>should a deal have been made
and should they be coming out...</i>

731
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,213
<i>as now seems likely.</i>

732
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:46,809
<i>So there is a quiet now
and an expectancy.</i>

733
01:00:47,987 --> 01:00:50,148
I didn't feel fear as such.

734
01:00:50,256 --> 01:00:52,986
I felt apprehensive,
as any person would.

735
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:58,160
<i>I was afraid of failing.</i>

736
01:01:08,574 --> 01:01:11,634
<i>The Palestinians and Israelis
were to be flown by helicopter...</i>

737
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:14,111
<i>to Furstenfeldbruck Airport.</i>

738
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,478
<i>But how would they get themselves
and their hostages...</i>

739
01:01:16,582 --> 01:01:20,211
<i>to the helicopters,
which were on the edge of the village.</i>

740
01:01:20,286 --> 01:01:23,346
<i>They decided to walk
via the underground car park.</i>

741
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:28,852
<i>The police saw
another ambush opportunity...</i>

742
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:31,089
<i>and placed marksmen here...</i>

743
01:01:31,197 --> 01:01:34,223
<i>but Issa insisted
on checking the route first.</i>

744
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,767
<i>So we walked there with one of...</i>

745
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:40,931
the terrorists behind me
with a machine gun in my back...

746
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:45,205
<i>and at that time, some of the gunmen
of the German police...</i>

747
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:48,508
<i>were lying in the side streets...</i>

748
01:01:48,614 --> 01:01:51,606
<i>and when we approached,
they were crawling away.</i>

749
01:01:55,454 --> 01:01:59,914
<i>So the terrorists immediately
found out that there was danger...</i>

750
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:03,451
<i>and they decided to use a bus
and not to walk.</i>

751
01:02:14,874 --> 01:02:16,967
<i>The terrorists brought the Israelis
down a passage...</i>

752
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:20,570
<i>into an underground car park
and to a bus.</i>

753
01:02:20,646 --> 01:02:23,410
<i>Robert Thompson, a 24-year-old
Canadian water polo player...</i>

754
01:02:23,482 --> 01:02:24,471
<i>saw them leave.</i>

755
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,711
<i>So then they brought
seven of them out...</i>

756
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:30,654
<i>and they put seven of the Israelis
on the bus...</i>

757
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,523
<i>and then he went back inside,
and then they brought out more.</i>

758
01:02:33,593 --> 01:02:36,061
<i>During this, there was one fellow
standing in front of the bus...</i>

759
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:39,292
<i>with a machine gun,
watching all of it.</i>

760
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:42,266
<i>The terrorists had all the guns.
What were the Israelis doing?</i>

761
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,201
They were tied.

762
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,602
They had their hands
tied in front of them...

763
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:49,607
and plus their hands
were tied like that.

764
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:53,076
Then around the back they had ropes,
and they were tied together like that.

765
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:52,895
<i>The first man that got out was
the man with the white pith helmet.</i>

766
01:03:52,972 --> 01:03:55,031
<i>He got out, went over
to the first helicopter...</i>

767
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,803
<i>and made a complete check
with a flashlight.</i>

768
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:02,371
<i>He checked in and out, both back,
front and middle of the helicopter...</i>

769
01:04:02,448 --> 01:04:05,383
<i>and when he saw that everything
looked like it was all right...</i>

770
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:09,512
<i>he signaled, and four hostages
started to march out...</i>

771
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:11,556
<i>with their hands
tied in front of them...</i>

772
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,581
<i>and behind them
was an Arab guerilla...</i>

773
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:15,786
<i>with some kind of weapon
in his hand.</i>

774
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:17,954
<i>It was quite
a frightening experience.</i>

775
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:21,192
<i>It wasn't any James Bond.
It was the real thing.</i>

776
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:27,402
<i>It has taken less than five minutes
to reach the waiting helicopters...</i>

777
01:04:27,473 --> 01:04:29,964
<i>but in that five minutes
a critical piece of information...</i>

778
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,044
<i>has suddenly been revealed.</i>

779
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:35,342
<i>There are not four guerillas
nor even five, as the police believed.</i>

780
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:38,383
<i>There are eight, and there are
only five police marksmen...</i>

781
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,783
<i>waiting at Furstenfeldbruck Airport.</i>

782
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:53,732
<i>We were standing
at a window directly above...</i>

783
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:59,260
<i>as our friends were led handcuffed
from the bus to the helicopters.</i>

784
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:01,705
<i>The terrorists stood there
with rifles.</i>

785
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:05,436
They looked as if they felt like heroes
dominating the world.

786
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:09,811
<i>All around,
flashbulbs were going off.</i>

787
01:05:09,915 --> 01:05:12,543
I felt bitter.

788
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:15,451
It's not a movie.

789
01:05:15,521 --> 01:05:22,484
It's our people we're talking about!

790
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:27,726
Two were already murdered, and
they were making a show out of it.

791
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:34,066
<i>One of the helicopters now proceeds
out over the Olympic site...</i>

792
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,041
<i>out over the main stadium
where half the lights are on.</i>

793
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:40,068
<i>The second helicopter
is now following it...</i>

794
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:42,944
<i>and moving out around
this tremendously high...</i>

795
01:05:43,049 --> 01:05:45,745
<i>major Olympic tower
as they depart...</i>

796
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:49,810
<i>to a destination we, of course,
as yet do not know.</i>

797
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:56,323
<i>And we, with the German team...</i>

798
01:05:56,395 --> 01:05:58,863
<i>we moved to the third helicopter.</i>

799
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:03,494
<i>The third helicopter
now moving right by us...</i>

800
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:05,560
<i>right over the Olympic village...</i>

801
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:07,571
<i>passing now
over the main stadium.</i>

802
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,868
<i>All the lights on
in this Olympic site-</i>

803
01:06:09,975 --> 01:06:11,772
<i>an Olympic site
which for more than a week now...</i>

804
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:14,539
<i>has been a place of serenity
and comradeship-</i>

805
01:06:14,613 --> 01:06:18,174
<i>an Olympic village which, in spite of
some political crisis, has been happy...</i>

806
01:06:18,284 --> 01:06:20,844
<i>and now today has been
absolutely shattered...</i>

807
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,615
<i>by this tragedy.</i>

808
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:08,159
<i>As we were flying...</i>

809
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:11,362
we began to get the feeling
that a trap was waiting for us...

810
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:14,338
so we began to prepare ourselves.

811
01:07:27,453 --> 01:07:31,981
In the event of an ambush,
we had been told to fight...

812
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:34,821
with all our strength,
as though in battle.

813
01:07:34,894 --> 01:07:39,763
<i>We were to do
everything necessary...</i>

814
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:44,758
<i>to defend ourselves
and our operation.</i>

815
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:18,031
<i>The marksmen,
who had no radio links...</i>

816
01:08:18,103 --> 01:08:21,561
<i>were still only expecting
a total of five terrorists.</i>

817
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,438
<i>Nobody from the village
thought to inform them...</i>

818
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:26,842
<i>that there were now known
to be eight.</i>

819
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,312
<i>We rushed quickly
into the main building...</i>

820
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:32,884
<i>we moved to the second floor.</i>

821
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:35,352
It was dark-
dark in the place.

822
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:39,824
There were very many people in
the corridors and around the building-

823
01:08:39,858 --> 01:08:41,723
<i>behind the building.</i>

824
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:46,423
<i>From the window we could watch
and see the two helicopters...</i>

825
01:08:46,532 --> 01:08:48,557
<i>landing in front of us.</i>

826
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:58,640
<i>Just as the helicopters...</i>

827
01:08:58,744 --> 01:09:01,542
<i>bearing the Palestinians
and Israelis were landing...</i>

828
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:04,172
<i>the police squad
assigned to the decoy plane...</i>

829
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,445
<i>fearing that
they were under-trained...</i>

830
01:09:06,552 --> 01:09:08,611
<i>took a vote
to abandon their mission.</i>

831
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:13,647
It was quite simply
a suicide mission...

832
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:16,286
and we unanimously voted
to abandon it.

833
01:09:16,362 --> 01:09:20,458
<i>And this was seconds before-
not even minutes-</i>

834
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:22,864
<i>seconds before
the helicopters landed.</i>

835
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:28,262
<i>I told the minister,
I said, "I'm sure...</i>

836
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,399
this will blow the whole affair. "

837
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:36,536
<i>The Germans had marksmen
on the roof of the control tower...</i>

838
01:09:36,615 --> 01:09:38,583
<i>and marksmen at ground level...</i>

839
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:41,085
<i>but they had no communications
between each other.</i>

840
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,281
<i>They were just briefed to shoot.</i>

841
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:46,153
<i>When the first marksmen opened fire,
they would all open fire...</i>

842
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:48,352
<i>but there was
no coordination of targets.</i>

843
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:54,892
<i>Some of us got out of
the helicopters...</i>

844
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,061
but others waited inside it with
the hostages, who were now very scared.

845
01:09:59,138 --> 01:10:03,302
We told them that it was in everybody's
interests for them to remain quiet.

846
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:11,839
<i>Now, the leader of the team,
he and another one...</i>

847
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:15,910
<i>went to check the aircraft.</i>

848
01:10:16,021 --> 01:10:18,353
<i>The Palestinians
were obviously missing...</i>

849
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,756
<i>the whole crew,
because they came back...</i>

850
01:10:20,826 --> 01:10:22,088
and were yelling.

851
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:24,629
They were, of course, excited.

852
01:10:29,134 --> 01:10:32,695
<i>As the leader returned
from the airplane...</i>

853
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,831
the whole area suddenly lit up...

854
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:39,069
and an enormous
amount of firing started.

855
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:49,050
<i>So we all opened fire in the direction
the shooting was coming from.</i>

856
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:02,431
<i>And a key marksman was moving
from one position...</i>

857
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:04,492
to another, blocked by a pillar...

858
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,730
Gerald Seymour
ITN News Reporter

859
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:08,136
to get into another shooting position
when the shooting started...

860
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:12,507
and therefore missed the crucial shot
against the Black September commander.

861
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:16,981
<i>Issa managed to get back to the cover
of the helicopters unscathed.</i>

862
01:11:17,015 --> 01:11:20,746
<i>Sniper Two was more successful,
seriously wounding Issa's deputy.</i>

863
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:26,222
<i>Snipers Three and Four opened fire
on the six terrorists...</i>

864
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:28,156
<i>guarding the helicopters...</i>

865
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:31,355
<i>but inexplicably
managed to kill only one.</i>

866
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:34,888
<i>Sniper Five did not fire
a single shot.</i>

867
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:38,198
<i>Because the helicopters had been
landed in the wrong place...</i>

868
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:40,498
<i>he found himself
in the direct line of fire...</i>

869
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:43,074
<i>of his fellow marksmen
on the tower.</i>

870
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:46,111
<i>Like the others, he had not been
supplied with a bulletproof vest...</i>

871
01:11:46,145 --> 01:11:50,741
<i>or steel helmet and found himself
hopelessly exposed.</i>

872
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:54,217
<i>Meanwhile, a policeman standing
by a window inside the tower...</i>

873
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:58,050
<i>was killed when a stray bullet
struck him in the head.</i>

874
01:11:58,123 --> 01:12:00,114
<i>They weren't capable.</i>

875
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,887
I can tell you that I doubt
whether the snipers...

876
01:12:02,961 --> 01:12:06,624
were really snipers
according to what I listened to.

877
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:09,132
One was lying on the roof...

878
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:10,565
<i>not far away from us.</i>

879
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:13,571
<i>He wasn't firing
with a sniper's rifle.</i>

880
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:17,166
But they didn't see it.
They didn't see the targets.

881
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:19,407
Unbelievable.

882
01:12:21,547 --> 01:12:23,538
The latest word
we get from the airport...

883
01:12:23,649 --> 01:12:26,447
is that, quote, "All hell
has broken loose out there"...

884
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:28,452
that there is still shooting going on-

885
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,613
<i>but all seems to be confusion.</i>

886
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:32,179
<i>Nothing is nailed down.</i>

887
01:12:32,257 --> 01:12:34,589
<i>We have no idea what has happened
to the hostages.</i>

888
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:39,230
<i>The leader was now
on his feet again and shooting...</i>

889
01:12:39,298 --> 01:12:42,699
but his deputy
was seriously wounded.

890
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:49,833
<i>I crawled over to him
and was hit in the hand.</i>

891
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:52,968
<i>My gun flew from my hand.</i>

892
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:58,209
<i>I tried to grab his gun
so I could head for cover...</i>

893
01:12:58,283 --> 01:13:00,274
<i>but I just couldn't do it.</i>

894
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:02,376
<i>And I only hope that our people...</i>

895
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:05,480
and the Israelis, that they could
get out of the helicopter...

896
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:07,525
but they had tied them together
or whatever...

897
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:10,994
<i>and so they couldn't leave
the helicopters.</i>

898
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:24,532
<i>The entire area
is ringed off by troops-</i>

899
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,807
heavily armed troops with dogs,
keeping everybody away.

900
01:13:27,913 --> 01:13:31,440
We tried to approach, were stopped by
one of the guards with a machine gun...

901
01:13:31,517 --> 01:13:33,246
and he said, " Do not come closer.

902
01:13:33,318 --> 01:13:35,309
They're heavily armed.
You're going to get hurt. "

903
01:13:38,757 --> 01:13:41,123
<i>But it's total confusion out there.</i>

904
01:13:41,226 --> 01:13:43,990
<i>Just about everybody
and his brother and his sister...</i>

905
01:13:44,062 --> 01:13:46,690
<i>got into their cars
and they've driven to the area.</i>

906
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:47,754
<i>They've clogged the roads.</i>

907
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,097
<i>Police reinforcements
had a bad time getting there...</i>

908
01:13:50,168 --> 01:13:53,365
<i>because all of these people
are curious, flocking to the area...</i>

909
01:13:53,438 --> 01:13:54,496
clogging up the roads.

910
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:55,835
Just absolute confusion.

911
01:14:01,346 --> 01:14:04,611
<i>Then I decided to try and find
the commander of the police...</i>

912
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:06,241
<i>and then we said...</i>

913
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:08,444
Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad
(Israel Secret Service) 1968-74

914
01:14:08,554 --> 01:14:10,078
"What else?
What are you doing?"

915
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:13,716
Then he said
that he is waiting...

916
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,817
for armored cars to arrive...

917
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:18,886
from somewhere near Munich.

918
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:23,366
<i>The police had forgotten
to order the armored cars...</i>

919
01:14:23,468 --> 01:14:25,868
<i>to come to the airport earlier...</i>

920
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:28,964
<i>and it was only now,
20 minutes after the shooting began...</i>

921
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:31,201
<i>that they radioed to Munich
for them to be sent.</i>

922
01:14:31,276 --> 01:14:34,211
<i>But because the roads
were congested with onlookers...</i>

923
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:37,305
<i>they did not arrive at the scene
for another hour...</i>

924
01:14:37,382 --> 01:14:39,543
<i>by which time
most of the fighting was over.</i>

925
01:14:40,886 --> 01:14:42,285
<i>Still no word...</i>

926
01:14:42,387 --> 01:14:44,446
the word we really want,
from the hostages.

927
01:14:51,897 --> 01:14:54,957
<i>We asked them to let us
go on top of the roof...</i>

928
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:59,129
and try to negotiate
with the terrorists.

929
01:15:00,138 --> 01:15:01,799
They refused at the beginning...

930
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:05,707
<i>but then they said,
'All right, on certain conditions. "</i>

931
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:07,642
<i>We went up on top of the roof...</i>

932
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:12,309
<i>and we started to speak Arabic
to the terrorists.</i>

933
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:15,648
<i>Their reply was clear,
very clear.</i>

934
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:18,383
They opened fire on the building.

935
01:15:18,457 --> 01:15:19,788
General Ulrich K. Wegener

936
01:15:19,858 --> 01:15:23,658
They fired at the tower,
and I told the minister he should lie down...

937
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:28,462
and he touched down
under the desk of the commander.

938
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:31,434
Very funny,
from our view today.

939
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:37,171
<i>One of the surviving terrorists
now made a dash for it...</i>

940
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,767
<i>heading straight for Sniper Five.</i>

941
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:43,144
<i>As the terrorist ran towards him,
Sniper Number Five...</i>

942
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:45,307
<i>fired his only shots of the night...</i>

943
01:15:45,384 --> 01:15:48,251
<i>point-blank
into the fleeing man's face.</i>

944
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:49,581
<i>Seeing these shots...</i>

945
01:15:49,655 --> 01:15:52,215
<i>police reinforcements
arriving at the scene...</i>

946
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:56,158
<i>with no knowledge of the precise
location of their own snipers...</i>

947
01:15:56,261 --> 01:16:00,220
<i>mistakenly identified Sniper Five
and the helicopter pilot...</i>

948
01:16:00,298 --> 01:16:02,960
<i>who had fled for cover beside him
as terrorists...</i>

949
01:16:03,068 --> 01:16:05,036
<i>and opened fire on them.</i>

950
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:07,162
<i>Both were seriously wounded.</i>

951
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:15,142
<i>At midnight
came the official announcement...</i>

952
01:16:15,213 --> 01:16:17,613
<i>of the spokesman
of the German government...</i>

953
01:16:17,683 --> 01:16:20,948
<i>who said all the Israelis are saved...</i>

954
01:16:21,019 --> 01:16:23,351
and all the terrorists are dead.

955
01:16:23,422 --> 01:16:24,980
Conrad Ahlers
German Government Spokesman

956
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:29,220
I'm very glad that, as far as we can see now,
this police action was successful.

957
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:32,695
Of course,
it's an unfortunate interruption...

958
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:34,925
of the Olympic Games...

959
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,333
but, I mean, if all that comes out...

960
01:16:38,403 --> 01:16:41,395
as we hope it will come out
or has come out...

961
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:44,407
I think it will be forgotten
after a few weeks.

962
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:57,113
Ankie Spitzer

963
01:16:57,222 --> 01:16:59,747
People all over Holland were calling me-
all my friends, my family.

964
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:02,555
<i>A neighbor came to us
with this bottle of champagne...</i>

965
01:17:02,627 --> 01:17:04,117
Alex Springer

966
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,652
and we all...

967
01:17:05,731 --> 01:17:07,426
was very glad and happy...

968
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:10,365
<i>and I think that I went to sleep.</i>

969
01:17:10,435 --> 01:17:14,064
<i>Then the Israeli ambassador
in The Hague, he called me and said...</i>

970
01:17:14,139 --> 01:17:16,539
"Ankie, I just heard the news.

971
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:18,973
Congratulations,
and everybody is saved...

972
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:20,602
and everything is okay. "

973
01:17:24,249 --> 01:17:27,309
Originally they said
that the hostages were safe.

974
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:29,444
Now that has been changed...

975
01:17:29,554 --> 01:17:31,681
and an Olympic spokesman said...

976
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:35,158
"We are afraid the information
given so far is too optimistic. "

977
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:36,660
That's where we seem to stand.

978
01:17:39,464 --> 01:17:41,432
<i>So I called the Olympic village.</i>

979
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,800
<i>I called every half-hour, and every
time the news got worse and worse...</i>

980
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,862
<i>and at 3:00 in the morning I said...</i>

981
01:17:47,973 --> 01:17:50,669
"If you know that something happened,
then you tell me now...

982
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:52,437
because I'm not Hercules.

983
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,706
I have been waiting
from 7:00 in the morning...

984
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,873
and now it's 3:00 the next morning.

985
01:17:56,982 --> 01:17:59,382
I just want to know
what happened to Andre. "

986
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,885
We keep hearing
that the indications are not good...

987
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:06,287
that Johnny Klein
may have very bad news.

988
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:12,528
<i>After almost two hours of fighting...</i>

989
01:18:12,597 --> 01:18:15,498
<i>one of the surviving Palestinians
threw a hand grenade...</i>

990
01:18:15,534 --> 01:18:17,195
<i>into the eastern helicopter.</i>

991
01:18:17,302 --> 01:18:19,327
<i>The helicopter was refueled...</i>

992
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:21,599
and within minutes...

993
01:18:21,706 --> 01:18:26,143
the helicopter
and the area around it...

994
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:28,236
was in fire.

995
01:18:28,313 --> 01:18:30,804
<i>Simultaneously,
one of his comrades...</i>

996
01:18:30,849 --> 01:18:34,307
<i>sprayed a full clip of bullets
into the other helicopter.</i>

997
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,387
<i>Then there was silence.</i>

998
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:38,980
And I told the minister...

999
01:18:39,057 --> 01:18:41,548
"I think I have to go to look
for what the police is doing. "

1000
01:18:41,626 --> 01:18:46,222
<i>And then I went to the captain
of the police company there...</i>

1001
01:18:46,331 --> 01:18:49,027
and said,
"Are you going to do something?

1002
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:51,864
You have to move your people there.

1003
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:55,395
You pull out the hostages
or whatever, you know...

1004
01:18:55,473 --> 01:18:57,464
and do something. "

1005
01:18:57,542 --> 01:18:59,874
They didn't do anything.
"I have no orders," he said.

1006
01:19:02,547 --> 01:19:03,844
It was-

1007
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:07,350
It was a really tragic story...

1008
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:10,752
and so we could only look,
you know.

1009
01:19:10,856 --> 01:19:13,154
And when after-

1010
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:15,283
You could hear them yelling,
you know.

1011
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:18,486
We've just gotten the final word.

1012
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:20,497
When I was a kid,
my father used to say...

1013
01:19:20,565 --> 01:19:22,726
"Our greatest hopes and our
worst fears are seldom realized. "

1014
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:25,201
Our worst fears
have been realized tonight.

1015
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:28,034
They have now said
that there were 11 hostages.

1016
01:19:28,106 --> 01:19:30,370
Two were killed in their rooms...

1017
01:19:31,676 --> 01:19:33,576
yesterday morning.

1018
01:19:33,678 --> 01:19:37,978
Nine were killed
at the airport tonight.

1019
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,516
They're all gone.

1020
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:40,451
<i>That afternoon,
the Games continued.</i>

1021
01:23:41,926 --> 01:23:43,894
<i>The surviving members
of the Israeli team...</i>

1022
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:45,953
<i>flew home with their dead.</i>

1023
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:50,057
<i>The bodies of the five
dead Palestinians...</i>

1024
01:23:50,135 --> 01:23:53,969
<i>were handed over to Libya,
where they received a hero's funeral.</i>

1025
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:21,725
Mohammed Safady, Aged 19

1026
01:24:21,799 --> 01:24:23,926
<i>The three surviving terrorists
were never to stand trial.</i>

1027
01:24:24,002 --> 01:24:24,969
Adnan Al Gashey, Aged 27

1028
01:24:25,069 --> 01:24:27,470
Jamal Al Gashey, Aged 18

1029
01:24:27,505 --> 01:24:30,065
<i>Seven weeks later,
a Lufthansa jet...</i>

1030
01:24:30,175 --> 01:24:33,576
<i>en route from Beirut to Frankfurt
was hijacked.</i>

1031
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:37,843
<i>The hijackers demanded the release
of the three Munich terrorists.</i>

1032
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:42,512
<i>Acting with indecent haste and without
consulting the Israeli government...</i>

1033
01:24:42,587 --> 01:24:45,215
<i>the Germans
handed over the three prisoners.</i>

1034
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:50,125
<i>The circumstances
surrounding the hijacking...</i>

1035
01:24:50,195 --> 01:24:52,493
<i>have long been thought suspicious.</i>

1036
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:56,897
<i>Why were only 12 passengers
on board such a large plane?</i>

1037
01:24:56,935 --> 01:24:58,664
<i>Why no women or children?</i>

1038
01:24:58,736 --> 01:25:02,638
<i>Why such haste in agreeing
to the hijackers' demands?</i>

1039
01:25:02,707 --> 01:25:05,073
<i>For the first time, one of
the Palestinians involved...</i>

1040
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:08,476
<i>has revealed
that the entire affair was a setup...</i>

1041
01:25:08,546 --> 01:25:12,949
<i>organized by the German government
in collusion with the terrorists.</i>

1042
01:25:13,017 --> 01:25:14,951
<i>The Germans thought
that in this way...</i>

1043
01:25:15,019 --> 01:25:17,920
<i>they would prevent future
terror attacks on their country...</i>

1044
01:25:17,956 --> 01:25:23,553
<i>and dispose the embarrassing evidence
of their failure that day in September.</i>

1045
01:25:23,628 --> 01:25:24,959
I think-

1046
01:25:25,029 --> 01:25:28,430
I think it's probably true, yes.

1047
01:25:30,435 --> 01:25:33,768
At this time,
the mentality was so, you know.

1048
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:34,827
Really.

1049
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:36,930
Hans Jochen Vogel
Mayor of Munich 1960-1972

1050
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,703
On such questions, Willy Brandt,
as I remember very well...

1051
01:25:39,777 --> 01:25:41,870
always made this gesture.

1052
01:25:44,549 --> 01:25:46,312
I can't say and do more.

1053
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,183
29th October 1972
Terrorists arrive in Libya

1054
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:59,458
Did you shoot
any of the Israeli hostages?

1055
01:25:59,564 --> 01:26:04,592
It's not important to say
if I killed Israeli or not.

1056
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,237
What do you think you achieved?

1057
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:17,972
One would have-
We have made our voice heard...

1058
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:20,050
by the world-

1059
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:21,415
Are those your words?

1060
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:26,520
- Of course.
- The same thing.

1061
01:26:26,591 --> 01:26:30,527
They have made their voice heard
by the universe or the world...

1062
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:32,654
who has not been hearing before.

1063
01:26:39,604 --> 01:26:42,573
I'm proud of what I did at Munich...

1064
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,973
because it helped
the Palestinian cause enormously.

1065
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:49,411
Before Munich the world had no idea
about our struggle...

1066
01:26:49,514 --> 01:26:53,917
but on that day the name of" Palestine"
was repeated all over the world.

1067
01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:05,785
<i>It was only a year and three months
that I was married to Andre Spitzer.</i>

1068
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:11,732
<i>But I remember that year
as the most beautiful...</i>

1069
01:27:11,836 --> 01:27:13,895
<i>and most wonderful year of my life.</i>

1070
01:27:24,048 --> 01:27:26,516
This is the grave
of Amitzur Shapiro.

1071
01:27:26,584 --> 01:27:28,677
He was the athletics coach.

1072
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:32,553
He had four little children,
one my age.

1073
01:27:33,858 --> 01:27:36,656
And here is Kehat Shorr.

1074
01:27:36,761 --> 01:27:38,991
He was the shooting coach.

1075
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:44,928
Eliezer Halfin was a wrestler...

1076
01:27:45,002 --> 01:27:49,962
and so was Mark Slavin,
who I think was only 18 years old.

1077
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:54,167
And here's my father's grave.

1078
01:27:56,381 --> 01:27:57,575
Anouk Spitzer

1079
01:27:57,682 --> 01:28:00,446
And it says on it his name: Andre Spitzer.

1080
01:28:00,518 --> 01:28:03,578
It says, "Son of Tibor,
fencing coach...

1081
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:07,950
murdered by- killed by murderers...

1082
01:28:08,025 --> 01:28:10,016
in the Olympic Games in Munich...

1083
01:28:10,094 --> 01:28:13,086
as a representative
of the Israeli sport. "

1084
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:17,329
Then it says his date of birth
and the date that he was murdered.

1085
01:28:18,302 --> 01:28:22,636
<i>And I always bring him sunflowers
because that's his favorite flower.</i>
