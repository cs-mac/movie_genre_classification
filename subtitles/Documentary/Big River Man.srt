1
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:09,054
When I see a swimmer,
I paint a drowned man.
Jacques Prevert

2
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:13,402
Is that OK?

3
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:16,146
I am going to do,

4
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:18,020
no man has ever done,

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:19,731
 swim at the Amazon.

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:23,024
I'm Martin Strel.
I'm going to do...

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,020
FEBRUARY 2, 2006

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,021
...what...

9
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:29,962
what no one has never do.

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,594
...what no one has ever done.

11
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:33,481
...what no man has never do.

12
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,881
...what no one has ever done.

13
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,598
swim at the Amazon.

14
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,036
I'm Martin Strel.
I'm going to do, what...

15
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:43,452
no man has never...

16
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:45,929
It's Ok.
It's Ok.

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,134
...no man has ever done.

18
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,638
I'm Martin Strel.
I'm going to do,

19
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:54,452
what no man has never do,
swim at the Amazon.

20
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:42,732
This is Martin Strel,

21
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:45,483
the most famous endurance
swimmer in the world.

22
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:47,754
He's the only person
to swim the Mississippi

23
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,398
and the Yangtze rivers.

24
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:51,350
Now in 2007,

25
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:53,155
he will be attempt to
be the first person,

26
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,773
to swim at the Amazon.

27
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,149
My father is not an average
world famous athlete.

28
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:03,991
First of all,

29
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,030
he's little bit over weight,

30
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,032
maybe even
very over weight.

31
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,104
Second, he's a big drinker.

32
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,567
Even while he's swimming,

33
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,448
he drinks two bottles
of wine a day.

34
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:20,063
Thirdly,

35
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:24,966
he's accomplished most of his
fits over the age of 45.

36
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,779
When he swims at the Amazon,
he'll be 53 years old.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,809
How long does he
swim without stopping?

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,288
That's a good question.

39
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,741
How long does you
swim without stopping?

40
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:35,096
Average. Every day.

41
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,462
Average, every day?

42
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,418
50, 60 miles.

43
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,333
50, 60 miles?
-50, 60 miles.

44
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,260
Without stopping?
-Yeah, non-stop.

45
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,261
What he say?

46
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:50,954
50, 60 miles without stopping.
-Without stopping per a day.

47
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,169
Yeah, per a day.
-Yes.

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,415
What's your name?

49
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,795
I'm worried for my
father's safety

50
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,998
but more I worried for
my father's health.

51
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,313
When he's swimming
in the Yangtze,

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,455
the world's most
polluted river,

53
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,165
he became so ill
I didn't know

54
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,837
if he would survive.

55
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:08,693
I wanted to make him stop
but I couldn't.

56
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:11,015
Swimming in the world's
most polluted rivers

57
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,464
is the family business.

58
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,132
BORUT STREL

59
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,363
My name is Borut Strel,

60
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,978
I am Martin Strel's son

61
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,709
but I am also his
main assistant.

62
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,418
My main job is

63
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,129
helping my father at his
swimming adventures.

64
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,805
I am the head of logistic.

65
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:34,103
I coordinate
the whole team.

66
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:36,376
YANGTZE SWIM 2004
I help incurred him

67
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:40,207
all the time and we trust
each other the most.

68
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,678
He swims through
this dirty waters

69
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,045
hoping to race the illness

70
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,474
and the disappearance of clean
waters around the world.

71
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:51,581
But the Amazon is
a special problem.

72
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:52,917
In the river
has crocodiles,

73
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,391
deadly fish and snakes,

74
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,494
parasites and insects,

75
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,870
many of which is be
hard to avoid.

76
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,892
The deadly can the Candirue fish
can swim up your penis

77
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,893
and if it does

78
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,817
no more penis.

79
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,607
Martin understands
this dangerous

80
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,944
but he consider this dangerous to
the Amazon more serious.

81
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:13,149
If the global attention is
not pay immediately

82
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,119
to the rapid destruction
of the rain forest

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,888
then will all be in
very serious trouble.

84
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:22,144
Martin hopes that his swim
will inspire people

85
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:25,304
to wake up and care
about saving this lands.

86
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,511
I don't know how I
feel about this swim.

87
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:35,782
When he was finishing
the Yangtze swim 2004

88
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:39,770
he was saying, I am not gonna
do anything more swims.

89
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:42,612
It's too hard,
too hot,

90
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:45,681
too much infections,
too much troubles

91
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,979
but then after a 
couple of months

92
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,442
when he recovered,

93
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:52,926
he just came up with
another idea over night,

94
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,446
I am going to the Amazon.

95
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,401
SLOVENIA,
February 2006

96
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:06,155
TRAINING FOR
AMAZON BEGINS

97
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,979
My father Martin
is very famous in Slovenia

98
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,667
but even when he's
going abroad

99
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,875
he's very famous too.

100
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:35,271
Some people say that he's
like an Slovenian ambassador.

101
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:39,077
Slovenia's shape
is like a chicken.

102
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,248
Slovenia's shape
is like a chicken.

103
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:45,007
Head...you can see.

104
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,481
Some people say
it's no big deal

105
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:07,022
to swim downstream with 
current. I say to them

106
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:08,023
trying by self’s.

107
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:11,806
When Martin swims 60 miles
per a day downstream

108
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,715
means the same as swimming

109
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:16,921
15-18 miles per a day
on a still water.

110
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:20,203
Try doing that every
day for 75 days

111
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,414
when you are
53 years old

112
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,730
and you weight
over 200 pounds.

113
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,806
Amazon swim publicity
campaign Hollywood, California

114
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:43,285
Where you swimming to?
Acapulco?

115
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,847
It's actually
kind of funny.

116
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:46,943
He's actually gonna swim
entire Amazon river.

117
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,491
I don't think he's
gonna make it

118
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,500
with all that piranha.

119
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:53,380
Mokronog, Slovenia
Martin's home town

120
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,264
Martin got a free car
from his sponsor

121
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,733
for the rest of his life.

122
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,998
Mazda was
car of the year...

123
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:05,764
...in 2004. Mazda was
car of the year.

124
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,438
Many Slovenians are
drunk and drivers.

125
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,840
We are at the top in
Europe by statistics

126
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:22,988
and my father
Martin is one of them.

127
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,564
But he does
when he drives

128
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:26,745
he eat a lot, drink a lot

129
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,961
and we are at the
phone all the time.

130
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,055
But he is very
good in driving.

131
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,848
He's very good driver
and he can make it

132
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,668
even if he's drunk.

133
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,332
He has a really good
connections with policeman.

134
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,922
They stop him, hey Martin,
you're drunk.

135
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:41,124
You are over dozed.

136
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,857
Ok, just come
safe to the home.

137
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,273
We will not give
you a ticket.

138
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:46,569
You are very
famous people.

139
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,919
Be safe.
Goodbye.

140
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,963
Martin parks this Mazda 626
where ever he wants

141
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,236
and nobody could
stop him.

142
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:59,890
If I park by myself
I get a ticket right away.

143
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,691
What you want to order?

144
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:12,500
Horse burger.
-Horse burger, yes.

145
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,277
Many Slovenians
eat horse burgers.

146
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:20,996
Horse burger is one of the most
popular food in our country.

147
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:23,620
Me and Martin
love them too.

148
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,612
The horse burger is
like a chicken burger.

149
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:32,239
The only different is
that is made from horse meat.

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,315
Horse burger, yeah.

151
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,725
Horse burger.

152
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:43,310
He will make it all the
way through on Amazon? -No.

153
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,575
VENICE BEACH, CALIFORNIA
But how far?

154
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:47,665
I don't know. About is far
he made it on Mississippi river.

155
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,874
You mean all
the way? -No.

156
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,076
You not believe it?
-Nobody's ever done that.

157
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,127
Number seven
on the countdown.

158
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:54,948
First is swim.

159
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,243
The mighty Mississippi river

160
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,429
it measures over
2000 miles.

161
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,921
In 2002 endurance swimmer
Martin Strel took it on.

162
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,016
He swam the entire length

163
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:08,308
from the Minnesota
to the gulf of Mexico.

164
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,486
A long the way,
Strel battle strong currents

165
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:14,224
deadly whirlpools
and wishes storms.

166
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,410
68 exhausting days after
starting his record swim

167
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:20,775
Strel reach the
gulf of Mexico.

168
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,350
Besides be an swimmer
my father has a day job

169
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,880
is a flamenco guitar teacher.

170
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:37,651
Before that he was a
professional gambler

171
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:40,950
but that was
before I was born.

172
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,222
KONGO CASINO,
LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA

173
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,641
Martin likes to say something
over and over again.

174
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,053
One of this is

175
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,566
if you work you got money

176
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,330
if you not work no money.

177
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,753
I have been professional
gambler, yes

178
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,647
but for that you must
stay here over the night.

179
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,925
6,7 or more hours.

180
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:05,494
I put here 1000 dollars.

181
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,401
If it will be black
1000 dollars for me.

182
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,953
It's very simple.

183
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,746
Before I was a swimmer

184
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,640
I was a gambler.

185
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:20,192
Now I gamble with my life.

186
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,433
Martin was bitten
very badly as a child.

187
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,572
He says that's way
he is able to endure

188
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,841
such an extreme pain.

189
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,062
He promised him self

190
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:41,235
he would never treat
me at same.

191
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,419
Instead he battle
demons at the rivers.

192
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:57,334
DANUBE 2000,
58 days

194
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:17,563
YANGTZE 2004,
59 days, 4003 km

195
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,114
To swim the Amazon
is almost 1000 miles

196
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:28,225
further then the Yangtze.

197
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:29,548
It will be the longest,

198
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:32,255
most dangerous
swimming in history.

199
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,339
My father always told me

200
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,222
that someday he's
going to be somebody.

201
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:56,372
But he never knew
what to call him self

202
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:59,076
that people would
remember his name.

203
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,477
I told him

204
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,068
you are Martin Strel.

205
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,625
You are the big river man.

206
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,640
Self pictures presents

207
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,462

MARTIN STREL

209
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:05,467
BIG RIVER MAN

Lipizzaner horse demonstration

212
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:31,140
7 MONTH UNTIL
AMAZON SWIM

213
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:41,991
ATLANTIS, WATER PARK
SLOVENIA, LJUBLJANA

214
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,056
This is Atlantis

215
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:01,567
where Martin has a free
membership here

216
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,001
for the rest of his life.

217
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:06,826
He's the only
person in Slovenia

218
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,824
with this and the
really in the whole world.

219
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,457
He's like a mascot for them

220
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,334
because of his extreme
achievements

221
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:16,116
go with the
fact that Atlantis

222
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:18,138
is the largest
indoor water park

223
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,353
in the whole Europe.

224
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,291
This is where you
can find Martin always

225
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,616
5 hours every day.

226
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:41,479
Martin trains every days in
a swimming pool for 5 hours.

227
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,220
He swims 4 km
one hour in the pool

228
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:48,141
so he's training
20 km a day.

229
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,403
At the end of the day

230
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,378
he spends time
some tanning

231
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,684
and tubing at the Atlantis
water slides.

232
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,458
Martin's physical training
is very important.

233
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,772
but his mental training
is maybe even more

234
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,970
important than that.

235
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,945
POSTOJNA CAVE,
SLOVENIA

236
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:22,397
This is way Martin has
been spending

237
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:25,223
the whole summer
underground.

238
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:27,796
He has a special
password

239
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:28,797
from the Slovenian
government

240
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:31,962
to enter into a giant cave.

241
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,805
He just typed on his PDA

242
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:36,882
and the door just open.

243
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,707
Martin does this
it get closer

244
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,009
to the underground
animals.

245
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,343
And I think he's
looking kind of

246
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,274
for a passion how

247
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,042
how all the animals
sleep underground.

248
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:58,099
that's he's gonna understand in
the Amazon all this animals.

249
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,364
Martin believes that if he
thinks like an animal

250
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,987
while he'll swimming the Amazon

251
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,702
he will not be eaten.

252
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:16,253
Slovenians likes to do many
things at the same time.

253
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:17,683
When the Martin is drunk

254
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,330
driving while go in
100 miles an hour

255
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:23,521
but also doing
two tabs of training.

256
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,682
He's power breathing

257
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,548
which is good
for his lungs

258
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:30,587
and he's also
learning English.

259
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,570
"You look young."

260
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,077
"Oh, Mary. I am your
husband Henry."

261
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,410
"I am good looking
in about forty

262
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,384
and I wear glasses."

263
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:41,565
"Oh, I don't like glasses."

264
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:42,873
"And you Jessica?"

265
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:44,363
"What do you do?"

266
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:47,796
"I am a drug dealer.
-What?"

267
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:55,862
3 MONTH UNTIL
AMAZON SWIM

268
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,706
Slovenia is one of
the cleanest

269
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,976
countries on the earth

270
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,759
and Martin grows
up swimming

271
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,179
in only pure waters

272
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,760
like a 1000 years ago.

273
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,369
That time was
also communism

274
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,064
and every one was
very depressed.

275
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,830
He was always poor
and lived in the tiny house

276
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,710
from the government.

277
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,474
So Martin would
drink and drink

278
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,859
and then shout
and say: "Goodbye."

279
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,425
I am going away
for a few days.

280
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,632
When I ask him where
he went he would say:

281
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,234
"I just went
to Italy to relax."

282
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,554
U.S. EMBASSY
LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA

283
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,041
Martin always says,

284
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,428
to be a winner you must
be a friend of winner.

285
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,755
He knows a lot of them.

286
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,808
One of Martin's
favorite winners

287
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,108
is American ambassador
in Slovenia.

288
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:58,010
They likes each other
because Martin likes America

289
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:01,775
and America like him too.

290
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:05,230
People think Martin is rich
and powerful like them

291
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,910
but it's really
me and Martin

292
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,355
try to save money
for Amazon swim.

293
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,815
"I come and you follow
me with the basket."

294
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,642
"Then bring on
that table."

295
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:16,634
"OK? Go there."

296
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,873
Mr. ambassador.
Thank you very much.

297
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:24,207
Good representation.
Bye bye and hope... -Martin.

298
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,660
We will meet each
other again, right?

299
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:30,040
Bye bye.
-On the web.

300
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:33,555
He see there all friends
in the same fields.

301
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,517
That's helps
get better votes

302
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:39,254
and at the end you
become a winner.

303
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,921
Besides a guitar teaching

304
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,111
Martin has to make money

305
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:46,668
by playing in
Slovenian movies

306
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,207
TV promotions

307
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,836
promoting
his personal wine

308
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,563
doing TV commercials

309
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,308
"When I drink Monster

310
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:04,521
it makes me feel
totally agrow."

311
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,110
Judging beauty contest

312
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:13,962
promoting American food chains

313
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:17,200
"Martin Strel. Give him
an applause here."

314
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,790
and speaking
at conventions.

315
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,866
You said you sell product?
-We sell water.

316
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,203
A what?
-Water. -Water.

317
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,857
Based vacuum cleaners.

318
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:33,555
Everything about
vacuum cleaners, guys.

319
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,615
Uh, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

320
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,037
Mick.

321
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,856
3 WEEKS UNTIL AMAZON SWIM
I'm ready.

322
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,142
You know the project
is ready by itself.

323
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:06,072
We have boats ready.
We have equipment ready.

324
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,776
Of course, we are
advertise Martin's projects

325
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:12,287
every time he goes.
To make his big projects

326
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:15,751
we advertise his pictures
his web side

327
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:17,586
and in a couple of days
in a few days

328
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:19,578
you will see Ljubljana
actually the whole Slovenia

329
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,337
covered with the billboards

330
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,872
huge jumbo banners
we call them here

331
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,481
and it's gonna to
be Martin's pictures.

332
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,920
I made a design
an art work

333
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,329
with the Amazon
background.

334
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,921
It's like this.

335
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,077
Hey, his picture
look like he's

336
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:38,977
vibing to the
whole country.

337
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,327
He's kind of putting
vibes on everybody

338
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,698
taking the control
to the whole country

339
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:46,094
and I'm very proud
I designed that.

340
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,016
Martin is very excited
about this banners.

341
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,809
because he gets
very famous.

342
00:20:55,804 --> 00:21:00,916
NEW YEARS EVE
GOING AWAY PARTY

343
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:06,979
Martin Strel.
Welcome to Slovenia.

344
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:26,106
Martin didn't seems
scare at all to leave

345
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,093
but my mom said

346
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:30,489
he was have nightmares
every night

347
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,579
and wake in
up screaming.

348
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37,657
He said he felt like
the whole world

349
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:39,056
was waiting for him

350
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,501
to jump in the
river and die.

351
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:06,056
SOUTHWESTERN
PERUVIAN AMAZON

352
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,374
Martin Strel is
attempting to defeat

353
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,583
what is no other
human been done yet.

354
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,539
... but he swears

355
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,191
by the Slovenian
red wine dealing by.

356
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:18,123
He's already swam
the Danube,

357
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,954
Mississippi
and the Yangtze.

358
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:22,001
We have an alligators

359
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,042
can be fatalness

360
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:25,127
then very deadly snakes

361
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:26,896
including anacondas.

362
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,439
We have the Candirue

363
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,764
which is much fear fish
very small fish

364
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:35,682
but it's end up in your rigram.

365
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:49,124
ATALAYA, PERU

366
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,321
We are in
Atalaya, Peru.

367
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:54,196
This is just
below Machu Picchu

368
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:56,541
and I'm started
swimming tomorrow

369
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,689
at 8 o'clock in
the Amazon river.

370
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,264
People think that because

371
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,349
we have big
media for swims

372
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,594
that also we
have big publicists

373
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,554
but I'm main
Martin's publicist

374
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:08,417
and also perform
Martin's voice

375
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:10,326
for all worldwide interviews

376
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:11,485
because I understand

377
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,892
what's media likes
and appreciates.

378
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,609
FEBRUARY 1st,2007

379
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,382
3 AM

380
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:31,484
Yes, we have
a protection

381
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:32,475
we have a machetes,

382
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,058
we have guns,
we have knives.

383
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:36,560
We have all kind,
you know, weapons

384
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,527
on the boat. Well,
for example

385
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:39,922
is somebody badgering you

386
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:41,974
and if you need
to kill an animal

387
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:44,750
you use a gun.

388
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,195
... and I never urinate.

389
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:56,377
I never urinate
straight into the water.

390
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:59,062
I always urinate
into my wet suit.

391
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,880
Blood.

392
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,993
Blood, hm?

393
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,511
If piranha for example
start attacking

394
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,833
or something like that

395
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,503
we will through
a bucket of blood

396
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,205
over there on the other 
side and you know,

397
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,309
the piranhas
will just redirect there.

398
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,054
You must clean
have to go.

399
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:21,927
Mosquitoes.

400
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,504
Mosquitoes.

401
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:34,999
FEBRUARY 1st, 2007
AMAZON SWIM, DAY 1

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,299
The chances
of Martin die

403
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,564
on the first day of the swim
were pretty high.

404
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,233
It had been raining
for a weeks

405
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,870
and the river was
in the flood stages

406
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,498
and since then
had been no one

407
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:48,609
that have ever
gone in the Amazon

408
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,134
in tvoz like this.

409
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:52,840
No one knew
what to expect.

410
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:24,868
Martin! Martin!
Martin! Martin!

411
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:12,944
After 1100 days
of preparations and training

412
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,396
the Martin finally begin

413
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:16,593
the first swimming
expedition in history

414
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:19,177
down the river Amazonas.

415
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:22,302
And even though
we were scared,

416
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,957
exhausted and totally alone

417
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,241
the day ended perfectly.

418
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:29,880
Seventy days
that would follow

419
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:32,715
would be the
strangest of my life

420
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,074
and also the worst.

421
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:45,797
DAY 2

422
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:39,153
6 AM

423
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,305
MATT MOHLKE
NAVIGATOR

424
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:24,790
Martin is pissed
we forget the machetes.

425
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:27,309
This is Mathew Mohlke

426
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,994
Martin's head
river navigator.

427
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:34,154
It is Matt job to make
sure Martin doesn't die

428
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,191
or get lost in one
of the thousand

429
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,463
of channels on Amazon.

430
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,742
He has been with Martin
on expeditions for years.

431
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:45,430
He lived in Fountain
city, Wisconsin.

432
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:51,840
Matt is a professional
poker player by night

433
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:55,237
and at day works for 
Sam Welten's family.

434
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:57,161
He quit his job with them

435
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:00,129
to come on the
Amazon expedition.

436
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,738
Martin trusts him more
then anyone on the world

437
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,200
except for me

438
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:07,428
even thought his not a
professional river navigator.

439
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,056
Matt, you know
where we are? -Yes.

440
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,634
It's difficult
to see ahead.

441
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:13,449
You know?
-Yes. -OK.

442
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,179
Martin is afraid we lost

443
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,190
because he can't
see shit an far.

444
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:21,171
The problem is
if the river turns quickly

445
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,333
we can't see a coming

446
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,606
and if there a bad water

447
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:24,607
we are fucked.

448
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:27,111
We are top on it.
It's too late.

449
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,059
So, it's gonna be a
really dangerous day.

450
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,212
The river was extremely
high and moving fast.

451
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,208
This creates
deadly whirlpools.

452
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,424
This fortacess
can suck down

453
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:39,655
entire boats full of people

454
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:42,026
much less a swimmer.

455
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,984
Dangerous, Martin.
More this way.

456
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:02,985
More this way.

457
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,321
Dangerous.

458
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,560
Sound like fucking
death trip today or something.

459
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:13,713
I am telling him
it's dangerous

460
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:16,695
but he swim right into it.

461
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:22,263
Motherfucker.

462
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:28,526
50 KM DOWNSTREAM
STREL'S CREW BOAT

463
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:34,974
This is the Cielito Linda

464
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:39,162
the boat we will be living on
for the next three weeks.

465
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,617
People told us

466
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,765
it was the
worst boat in Peru

467
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:44,912
and they were right.

468
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,876
It was a very bad boat.

469
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,234
ALFREDO CHAVEZ
BOAT CAPTAIN

470
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,648
This is Alfredo Chavez

471
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:07,380
captain of the Cielito Linda.

472
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:13,874
I was concern
that our boat

473
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,487
will crushing the banks
like a pink pound

474
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,209
after only two days

475
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,104
but Alfredo said
things like this

476
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,312
happen a lot in Peru.

477
00:34:25,703 --> 00:34:27,071
No need to worried about.

478
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,987
Alfredo is a very special
taboo Amazon to the guy.

479
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,141
Alfred said

480
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,379
there are three
rules in Peru.

481
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,957
The first is to through
away your plan A

482
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:42,453
the second is to through
away your plan B

483
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:46,365
and the third is to relax.

484
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:50,969
Peruvians accept
they can not control nature

485
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,850
and especially not
the Amazon river.

486
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,754
We would have
to do the same

487
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:58,485
or the river would break
us by the end.

488
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,249
He ask me where
we were this morning.

489
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,075
I'm natural guy. I don't
know how to use GPS.

490
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,311
I'm learning.
I just have...

491
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:12,058
first training yesterday.
Borut teach me how.

492
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,456
So, when we have fog
like that Martin ask me:

493
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,302
"Do you know
where we are?"

494
00:35:16,303 --> 00:35:17,553
Look, I don't
know where we are.

495
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:18,992
We are lost in
Amazon somewhere but

496
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,850
I just try to find
the best curve

497
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,209
and keep him not to hit 

498
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,922
by a damn log or 
something.

499
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:31,638
You know, he cuts
right through.

500
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,794
I mean, that tree gonna stick
right through his stomach.

501
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:37,551
There had been
so much rain

502
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,197
that whole
pieces of forest

503
00:35:39,198 --> 00:35:41,861
was floating down
stream with Martin.

504
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,456
They were as heavy
as straight trains

505
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:45,815
and if they hit him

506
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,600
he would be dead.

507
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,875
I'm pretty good
in the river

508
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:50,747
but I'm just a fisherman
from Wisconsin.

509
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,748
I'm doing this for free.

510
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,952
I'm doing this for adventure.

511
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:54,609
If Martin wants
to give a big money

512
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:56,375
he can get the experienced
Amazon river guy.

513
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:57,705
I'll do the best I can.

514
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,225
I learning the GPS,

515
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,226
I learning the maps.

516
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,391
When he ask
where we are

517
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,511
just tell him like I
know where we are.

518
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:10,299
The doctor said
Martin's blood pressure

519
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,669
was already
dangerously high.

520
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:15,218
RIFAT LATIFI
PHYSICIAN

521
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:16,644
I examined Martin Strel briefly

522
00:36:16,645 --> 00:36:18,035
and measured
the blood pressure.

523
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:20,673
It was 150\95.

524
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,877
Anybody else with

525
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,522
elevated blood pressure

526
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:27,914
probably should be
evaluate and not start

527
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,975
swim in the Amazon.

528
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:32,396
He said that Martin
needed to stop swimming

529
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:34,931
if he wanted
to avoid the stroke

530
00:36:36,014 --> 00:36:38,589
but Martin wouldn't stop.

531
00:36:49,722 --> 00:36:54,277
PERUVIAN AMAZON
4931 KM TO OCEAN

532
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,066
On expeditions
Martin usually sleep

533
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:09,653
only 4 hours at night.

534
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:11,786
2.30 AM

535
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:13,865
The currents had die down

536
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:17,480
but know he was getting
more and more sun burn.

537
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:19,574
He has second
degree burns

538
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:21,337
all over his face.

539
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,307
And he thought
that cure for this

540
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,405
was more beer.

541
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,141
But doctors told him

542
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:29,769
it only makes him
more dehydrating.

543
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,505
I try to convince him

544
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:34,806
to stop drinking
so much at night

545
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:36,687
but I couldn't.

546
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:50,953
DAY 6, SOMEWHERE
IN PERUVIAN AMAZON

547
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:59,187
Incredible.

548
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,703
What a freak.

549
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:06,577
Martin expect rain

550
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,410
more of the heavy rain
in the Amazon.

551
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:12,266
We haven't much rain

552
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:14,874
in the last of few weeks.

553
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,117
So, it is crazy

554
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:21,185
how the weather
is happening.

555
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:24,253
Will be worm or
something is happening

556
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:26,023
down here?

557
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:28,823
Completely unusual.

558
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:31,724
And he has some kind of

559
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,920
terrible sun burn.

560
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:35,774
In this part of the earth

561
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:39,934
the sun can give you
a cancer disease

562
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:41,868
on the skin

563
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,418
is from the pleasure
somebody doing this

564
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:48,199
crazy shit.

565
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,406
In 2005 the
Peruvian Amazon

566
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:02,924
experience the worst
drought in 40 years.

567
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,759
This was a crises for
an indigence people

568
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,475
on a massive scale.

569
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,688
People had to be
air lifted out

570
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:11,407
and food had to be air
lifted in by helicopters

571
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,491
just like in New
Orleans the same year.

572
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,738
The scientists has
blamed for draught

573
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,588
a higher ocean temperatures

574
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,668
caused by global warming.

575
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,163
Rising air in the Atlantic

576
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,583
pushing Amazon clouds away

577
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:27,188
which stops rainfall
and kills the forest.

578
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,368
The scientists say
the global worming

579
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,588
is the biggest single threat
to the rain forest

580
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:33,378
because lowest rainfall

581
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:36,447
can easily turn the rain
forest into a desert.

582
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:49,564
Even though it was a
middle of rainy season

583
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:51,418
and had rain at the end

584
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:54,019
but hadn't rain for
at weeks on a river.

585
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,525
Without a rain

586
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:01,647
sunburn would
fry a Martin's skin

587
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,246
like a piece of bacon

588
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,826
until it melted
off his face.

589
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:07,371
And he was
already looking

590
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,666
piece of beef jerky.

591
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,235
Finally I couldn't
take any more

592
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:16,596
and came up with
genius original idea

593
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:19,678
that would change the
Amazon swim forever.

594
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:30,450
The wait mask style

595
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:31,926
which was
actually my idea

596
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:35,395
allowed Martin to swim in
global worming conditions

597
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:38,020
and created an unique
style an Amazon swimming

598
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,380
that made headlines
around the world.

599
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,100
IQUITOS, PERU

600
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:02,015
The wait mask
got the sun off

601
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:04,160
and got him
back to normal

602
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:06,406
but he was coming down

603
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:08,734
with another worsen
 problem.

604
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:48,631
Martin's wetsuit swim
smells like a shit.

605
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:52,402
Probably because
he shit inside

606
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:55,523
and all that dirty water

607
00:41:55,524 --> 00:41:58,315
all that dust and garbage

608
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,211
that flows down the Amazon.

609
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:02,403
Of course,
get inside of his body

610
00:42:02,404 --> 00:42:05,052
and that's way is
smells really bad.

611
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:08,999
Bad day for me today.

612
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,241
YANGTZE SWIM

613
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:32,406
On the Yangtze

614
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,710
Martin swimming in the most
dangerous rapids

615
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:36,964
that human
ever swimming.

616
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:38,525
In the great gorè

617
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:40,509
with no support services

618
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,586
on either side of the river.

619
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:43,857
Martin swam alone

620
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:45,226
through class 6 rapids

621
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:46,530
on one of
the most polluted

622
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:49,161
and dangerous rivers
on the world.

623
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,381
The river was so toxic

624
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:55,802
that's Martin's blood
had to be washed

625
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:58,250
every day by doctors.

626
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:00,472
Martin was even
swimming pass

627
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:03,656
dead bodies in the water.

628
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:26,726
DR. MATEJA DE
LEONNI STANONIK
PHYSICIAN

629
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,171
This is dr. Mateja.

630
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,600
Martin's biggest fan
and personal doctor.

631
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:33,057
She is a brain surgeon here

632
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:35,152
to make sure nothing
happened to Martin's brain.

633
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:40,329
She's also looking into
his heart and lungs

634
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,076
but she wouldn’t
have a microscope

635
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:45,442
to see all that parasites
in the Amazon

636
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:48,736
that entering into
Martin's body every day.

637
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:00,181
4362 KM TO GO

638
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,219
I was so used

639
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,601
to watching Martin's
battle polluted rivers

640
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:06,550
that I expected that Amazon
would be the same.

641
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:07,551
But that was shocked

642
00:44:07,552 --> 00:44:10,365
to find that Amazon
was a clean river

643
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:12,564
with virgin forest
along the banks

644
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,038
and not a single
piece of trash

645
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:16,878
for a hundreds of miles.

646
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:19,722
It was like a river
at the beginning of time

647
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,618
before man's kind.

648
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,805
Martin said it was
clean enough to drink

649
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:27,052
but I told him
to stop drinking it

650
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:29,446
because it will
make him sick.

651
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:36,155
DAY 9

652
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:18,156
I don't know
what we can do to...

653
00:45:18,326 --> 00:45:19,999
Well, I think,
you know, Martin

654
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,861
he's always

655
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,420
like you know,
very tired

656
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:26,170
but still have some...
still has some

657
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:27,833
extra power.
-Yeah.

658
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:29,505
You remember him
on the Mississippi.

659
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:32,083
He came out from the
water and couldn't walk.

660
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,567
We brought him in
the car, in the van

661
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,027
you know and
he didn't even eat.

662
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:40,643
You remember some...?
-That was 60. day.

663
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:43,083
Yeah, it was at the end.
-Yeah.

664
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:45,294
Toda is 9.day.

665
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:46,605
And he is,

666
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:49,463
I hate to say but is like
his fallen apart.

667
00:45:49,464 --> 00:45:51,392
He's fucking feather.

668
00:45:51,866 --> 00:45:53,169
He shouldn't have

669
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,917
a shoulder problems
 quite yet.

670
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,781
It's too early for that man.

671
00:45:56,782 --> 00:45:58,688
He needs to be absorb
this destiruations

672
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,619
through curse in
this expedition

673
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:04,204
but in 9.days
he lost 11 or 12 pounds.

674
00:46:04,205 --> 00:46:06,451
How much is he lost?
-Yeah, something like that.

675
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:07,819
Yeah, that's nine days.

676
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:09,594
I mean,

677
00:46:09,595 --> 00:46:11,387
he's gonna fall
through own

678
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:13,979
bang hole by the
end of this trip.

679
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,235
PEBAS, PERU

680
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:23,634
If you ask Martin

681
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:24,922
what is the most
dangerous thing

682
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:26,084
on the Amazon was

683
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:27,725
he would says people.

684
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:31,238
Martin only believes and
trust completely

685
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,767
animals, rivers and Indians.

686
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:37,342
These are the only
living beings I think

687
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:39,999
that truly understands
Martin also.

688
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,052
In the town of Pebas

689
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:47,136
Martin swam up to an
ancient Indian tribe.

690
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:50,008
They were called
the Yagua tribe.

691
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:51,517
I'm afraid must sad

692
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,948
that they are
one of the last

693
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:55,282
original tribes on Amazon.

694
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:06,847
When I was kayaking

695
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:08,326
in escorting him in
down the Danube

696
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,226
he was telling me
the personal stories

697
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,024
that I could never
hear from him

698
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:14,577
standing on two legs.

699
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:16,319
One of this was
that his father was

700
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,157
so unsatisfied
with his life

701
00:47:18,158 --> 00:47:21,664
that he would take out
all his rage on Martin.

702
00:47:24,793 --> 00:47:26,490
When the father
had been drinking

703
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:28,924
Martin was so scared to
come home in the house

704
00:47:28,925 --> 00:47:31,962
that he ended up
sleeping in the barn.

705
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,491
His mother would
set him out

706
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,654
the clothes and
food each night.

707
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:40,948
My grandmother said

708
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:42,033
Martin actually
spend the most

709
00:47:42,034 --> 00:47:45,001
of his childhood
in that barn.

710
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:49,587
When in one occasion
Martin was been chased

711
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,182
and jump in an freezing
creek to escape

712
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,734
the father waiting for
him on the banks

713
00:47:54,735 --> 00:47:56,446
so Martin
swam downstream.

714
00:47:56,447 --> 00:47:58,667
The father walked
alongside him

715
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,511
for a long time
but Martin swam so far

716
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,952
that father gave up
and went home.

717
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:08,109
This was Martin's
first endurance swim.

718
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:11,776
I think he
repeat something

719
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:15,247
of this same feeling
on every expedition.

720
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:54,669
There are many myths in
creatures lives in Amazon.

721
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,098
One of the myths
is about wild man

722
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,057
who lives in the
underground world

723
00:48:59,058 --> 00:49:00,826
beneath the river.

724
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:02,836
He's call the Pishtakos

725
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:04,616
and if you see him

726
00:49:04,617 --> 00:49:06,847
his bringing
the apocalypse.

727
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:11,150
That's way Indians never
swim in the main channel.

728
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:43,889
They were afraid of us

729
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,808
because they thought
we are demons.

730
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:50,181
Face peelers.

731
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:54,111
They use this...
They skin it the face

732
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:56,914
take the fatness
from the humans

733
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:57,915
after they are killed

734
00:49:57,916 --> 00:50:00,171
and things like
that can actually

735
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:04,964
they call it these
people, Pishtakos.

736
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:06,758
Pishtakos.

737
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:10,659
And he said in front of us

738
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,043
that the captain
and myself...

739
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:16,513
No, they got to be Pishtakos.

740
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,080
I'm sorry. Look for
another village

741
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,652
but we don't want you
stay here tonight.

742
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,891
Alfred of said they
could just decide

743
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,112
to kill us in the night.

744
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:29,516
So, we slept
with machetes

745
00:50:31,148 --> 00:50:34,879
but mostly we
didn't sleep at all.

746
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:46,912
The Amazon is almost
as largest the 48 united states.

747
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:49,662
People don't realize
that the Amazon

748
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:52,263
the last frontier on earth.

749
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:55,442
It is still
80% unexplored.

750
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:58,434
There were rivers
that go for 1000 km

751
00:50:58,435 --> 00:51:01,476
that are totally uninhabited.

752
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,940
But people who lived here

753
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:06,722
are some of the poorest
in the world.

754
00:51:06,723 --> 00:51:09,930
This is the main problem
of Amazon destruction.

755
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:12,596
For example,
one single mahogany tree

756
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:16,111
in the Amazon
can be worth up to 20.000$

757
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:18,586
in Europe or America.

758
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:23,123
People will cut in entire
road into the forest

759
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:25,142
just to reach one tree.

760
00:51:25,258 --> 00:51:27,948
This mahogany
tree is are made into

761
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:30,158
expensive boats
and furniture

762
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,291
but mostly
musical instruments

763
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,826
especially electric guitars.

764
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:40,208
As of 2006 20% of the
Amazon forest 

765
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:42,050
has been cut down.

766
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:44,186
At the current
rate of cutting

767
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:47,596
half of the  forest will be
gone in twenty years.

768
00:52:00,043 --> 00:52:03,121
DAY 23

769
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,474
Monkeys around.

770
00:52:33,475 --> 00:52:36,331
In the morning...
In the morning is very...

771
00:52:36,332 --> 00:52:38,816
very exciting.
Talking.

772
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,320
So much crying.

773
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,618
Very famous must be
in the morning.

774
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,312
Early in the morning.

775
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:47,624
Now it's...

776
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:51,607
more peace.
More quiet.

777
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:58,610
Nobody crying,
nobody talking.

778
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:03,608
Peace... ha, peace.

779
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:06,016
That's not big town,
Los Angeles.

780
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,362
24 hours a day...

781
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:10,533
Many cars.

782
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:12,715
No cars here.

783
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:15,664
People need this

784
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:18,669
but people don't
know what is Amazon

785
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,170
what is jungle.

786
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:22,585
I can look around

787
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:25,998
to see some animals.

788
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,969
Must be careful,
ok, but...

789
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,252
I think is not
so dangerous.

790
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:33,750
It's dangerous
in the bank.

791
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,603
It's dangerous, yeah
but in the water, no.

792
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:40,407
Every year
it's good to stay

793
00:53:40,408 --> 00:53:43,636
in the jungle
2-3 weeks.

794
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:49,156
Be big difference
for all the people.

795
00:53:56,136 --> 00:54:00,074
DAY 25,
PERU/BRAZIL BORDER

796
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:05,777
"Martin Strel,
example for the kids."

797
00:54:05,778 --> 00:54:08,343
When Martin cross
the border to Brazil

798
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,386
there was a huge
party with dancing girls

799
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:12,495
and marching bands
all saying

800
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:14,296
how Martin was an
example to children

801
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:16,028
and all human race.

802
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:17,892
My father was
the first person

803
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:19,332
that anyone
had ever seen

804
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,924
that swam to
Brazil from Peru.

805
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,828
2777 km in 22 days.

806
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:28,126
All of this people
wanted to hear

807
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:30,462
what this
man had to say

808
00:54:30,463 --> 00:54:31,857
but instead of speaking

809
00:54:32,357 --> 00:54:33,859
Martin swam away
from the reception

810
00:54:33,894 --> 00:54:36,418
with only the Brazilian
chase boat driver

811
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:37,647
and left us at the port

812
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:41,314
not have even a clue
how to find him.

813
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:47,971
This was for expedition

814
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:50,606
into the dangerous
night time search.

815
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:57,330
When we finally picked
up the boat signal at 3.AM

816
00:54:57,331 --> 00:55:00,149
and found him about
100 km away

817
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,481
he had no explanation.

818
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:05,807
I had seen this irrational
behavior before

819
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:08,406
and he never had
an explanation.

820
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:12,880
The news that there was
a man swimming the Amazon

821
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:15,066
was spreading fast
through out the Brazil.

822
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,901
We were told that crowds
in the thousands

823
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:19,268
will be waiting for
Martin downstream.

824
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,240
We did not yet realize

825
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:24,036
how big this thing
was going to get.

826
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:54,706
SAN PABLO DE
OLIVENCIA, BRAZIL

827
00:57:06,797 --> 00:57:09,546
2881 KM TO OCEAN

828
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:11,458
His blood pressure
has gone up tremendously

829
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,548
and that's quite worried.

830
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:16,632
I've been monitoring
this very closely

831
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,800
because diastolic heart failure

832
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:20,520
is very serious problem

833
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,570
and it could be
a stroke for example

834
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,629
which could kill him.

835
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:26,757
Martin confessed to me

836
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:28,332
that he had
been hallucinating

837
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,242
and hearing
a voices in his mind.

838
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:32,422
He hadn't told
anyone else

839
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:33,499
because he thought

840
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,044
they would put him
immediately in the hospital

841
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:39,110
and still he
kept swimming

842
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:40,111
and drinking.

843
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,949
Must be a little
different sometimes.

844
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:49,385
Matt!

845
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,086
I'm tired, Matt.

846
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:52,087
Ha?

847
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,287
Maybe you have
something to drink?

848
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,453
Yeah, I have some drinks.

849
00:57:59,649 --> 00:58:02,279
You have maybe
some whisky? -Whisky?

850
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,495
Whisky.

851
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:05,887
The doctor said you should
be drink more fluid

852
00:58:05,888 --> 00:58:07,229
because you
are dehydrated.

853
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,333
This is for doctor
not for me.

854
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,970
This guy

855
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,813
is not understood by

856
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:32,584
anybody.

857
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,806
Who's that guy in mediaeval
and mythological stuff that

858
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:42,017
they changed him a
rock or something

859
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,671
and the birds
pecked on his head until...

860
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:46,163
Is that Hercules
or some athletes’ lady?

861
00:58:46,198 --> 00:58:48,916
Piece like...
He's like this except.

862
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,892
He's got to swim
all those rivers

863
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,788
What's he
doing here is

864
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:55,341
almost self sacrificial
for the world.

865
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:58,834
It's almost Christ
like in a way

866
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,134
if I can say that.
It's almost Christ like.

867
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:03,012
It's bigger then
I can comprehend.

868
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:04,542
and I'm just darting
the essence

869
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:06,382
after been in all
that expeditions

870
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,959
how great is thing is.

871
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:11,682
Yeah, he might
be a little fat

872
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:14,063
he might be
a little drunk

873
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:17,065
but OK, he can...

874
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:19,196
sometimes yell on
us a little but

875
00:59:20,107 --> 00:59:23,638
he's the last super
hero in the world.

876
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:25,668
Look, what's
he doing here.

877
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:27,758
He's connecting all

878
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:30,682
of the greatest
rivers on the world

879
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:31,976
by swimming them

880
00:59:31,977 --> 00:59:33,928
giving hope to people
all over the world.

881
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:35,932
Everyone in the
world is on there

882
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:37,998
edgeter fiv right now

883
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:40,465
hoping, praying some
of them probably

884
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:43,871
morbidlier kind of just
waiting for him to get killed

885
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:47,735
in actuality because,
yeah, this is dangerous.

886
00:59:47,736 --> 00:59:49,413
He's 52 years old.

887
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:50,923
He swimming in the
most dangerous

888
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,113
place in the world.

889
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,227
He's the last
American super hero.

890
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:59,087
He's the last super
hero on the world.

891
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:01,926
He's the world's
last super hero.

892
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:03,869
Here's the world's
last super hero.

893
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,666
That's it.

894
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,180
This is the last five
minutes to midnight

895
01:00:07,181 --> 01:00:09,315
and we got one
super hero left

896
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:10,703
to save us all

897
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:14,335
bring us all down
into the eternity.

898
01:00:33,187 --> 01:00:35,583
SAN ANTONIO DE
ICA, BRAZIL

899
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:38,166
5000 people came
out to see Martin

900
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,014
in the small town of
San Antonio de Ica.

901
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,817
There was a near map scene

902
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:47,600
as people try to get
near to the "homem peixe"

903
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,114
in English, the fish man.

904
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:19,894
The crowd got so big

905
01:01:19,895 --> 01:01:21,922
that it held like the
Martin was going to be

906
01:01:21,923 --> 01:01:23,596
the most famous
man in the world

907
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,274
if he made it somehow.

908
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:28,546
The TV talk shows
were calling non-stop.

909
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:30,463
They all wanted
to speak with Martin

910
01:01:31,114 --> 01:01:33,591
but no one
could rich him

911
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,957
not even me.

912
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:02,319
The media kept asking

913
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:04,135
why Martin doing this.

914
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:05,842
Martin only said

915
01:02:05,843 --> 01:02:08,117
it was protect
the rain forest

916
01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:10,134
but no one knew exactly

917
01:02:10,135 --> 01:02:12,241
what the hell
he meant by that.

918
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:16,437
TWO WEEKS LATER

919
01:02:17,921 --> 01:02:24,278
MANAUS, BRAZIL

920
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:27,111
This is first city we
seen it in two months.

921
01:02:28,554 --> 01:02:30,416
I don't
wanna go, man.

922
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,188
I just stay in the boat.

923
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:33,509
Matt was starting to get

924
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,283
very affected
after so many hours

925
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,794
and days besides Martin.

926
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,618
He was talking about God,

927
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:40,597
the rain forest,
the river

928
01:02:40,598 --> 01:02:42,934
and Martin's as they
were all the same thing.

929
01:02:42,935 --> 01:02:44,189
You see this river?

930
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,477
That river is between
heaven and hell, man.

931
01:02:46,478 --> 01:02:47,971
This is river purgatory.

932
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,283
And Martin...

933
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,729
All of us.
We are all here.

934
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,730
We are all
stuck right here.

935
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:54,040
We are on
the river, man.

936
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,029
There's a heaven.

937
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,968
We can almost reach
it. You see that.

938
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:58,166
We can almost
reach it.

939
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:00,393
And there's a hell.
There's were we live, man.

940
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:01,394
We lived there in hell

941
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:03,620
but now we are
somewhere in the middle.

942
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:05,817
You can see that.
That's heaven.

943
01:03:05,818 --> 01:03:07,634
That's so close it is.
It's right there.

944
01:03:07,635 --> 01:03:09,530
It's right there, man.

945
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:11,750
I can grab it.
I can grab heaven.

946
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:15,659
I can grab it.
I can grab it.

947
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:18,169
But then I go there.

948
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,498
I go there.
I go to hell.

949
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:21,499
I go to hell.

950
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:31,327
It's five seconds to
midnight right there.

951
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,348
Manau was a the city
the size of New York

952
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:46,565
but in the heart of Amazon.

953
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:48,752
It felt like just
in United States.

954
01:03:48,753 --> 01:03:50,678
They had a 
Mc Donald's there

955
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:51,979
they had a Burger's King

956
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,498
they had a shopping malls

957
01:03:53,499 --> 01:03:55,574
and lot of money.

958
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,718
Our boat even duck
at the high five star hotel

959
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:02,922
and the managers booked
us all three rooms.

960
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:05,826
But Martin and Matt
has gone at 5. AM

961
01:04:05,827 --> 01:04:08,646
before we woke and swam
away without telling us.

962
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,392
Slovenian's endurance 
swimmer

963
01:04:10,393 --> 01:04:12,036
Martin Strel has gone missing

964
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:13,852
well attempting to
brake the world record

965
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:15,502
the longest
swim in history.

966
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:18,400
I still don't understand
why Martin did this.

967
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:20,338
He put not
only himself but

968
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,844
but entire expedition
at failure

969
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:23,522
because our Brazilian boat

970
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:26,175
was not equipped to navigate
the river at night

971
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:28,743
and could easily
have sun.

972
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:35,757
At the midnight they
were still lost.

973
01:04:36,075 --> 01:04:39,162
Matt had left his GPS
and radio behind

974
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:41,292
so we have no idea
how to find them

975
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,395
and we were force to do
another dangerous

976
01:04:43,396 --> 01:04:44,396
night time search

977
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:47,172
scanning the banks
with flood lights.

978
01:05:05,672 --> 01:05:07,956
We finally found
Martin and Matt

979
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:09,634
on the stretch of
sandy bank

980
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:11,020
in a very white channel.

981
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:14,106
Martin was totally naked
and unresponsive.

982
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,831
Matt was also in a
strange state of mind.

983
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:20,100
It was as if they hade
seen or a heard

984
01:05:20,101 --> 01:05:23,670
experience something
that had transform them.

985
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:26,791
At this point

986
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:29,444
Martin had exceeded his
previous world record

987
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:30,445
but this no longer seems

988
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:33,643
like a world record
expedition at all.

989
01:05:34,133 --> 01:05:35,977
I was very scared

990
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:39,574
because he had over
1000 miles to swim

991
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:42,418
and he was obviously
going insane.

992
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:14,890
PARINTINS, BRAZIL
1093 TO GO

993
01:06:44,855 --> 01:06:49,452
DAY 47

994
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:56,532
At the 47. day

995
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:57,653
Matt stays up
for three days

996
01:06:57,654 --> 01:06:59,428
and he was scribbling poems

997
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:02,093
about Martin and Jesus.

998
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:06,170
That shoe's jacked, man.

999
01:07:06,171 --> 01:07:08,729
Mad had been ranting
and raving for days

1000
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,426
and he was getting
on everyone nerves.

1001
01:07:12,114 --> 01:07:13,661
It was like Matt
was infected

1002
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,150
by how Martin felt

1003
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:17,090
and was that
enough comprehend

1004
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:18,708
how crazy he was going.

1005
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,031
...as like third
dog in the slay.

1006
01:07:22,632 --> 01:07:24,774
I was by
now use to this

1007
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:27,299
seeing my father
goes crazy.

1008
01:07:27,954 --> 01:07:30,088
I had spent
half of my life

1009
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,035
watching him
go to this point.

1010
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:36,488
But only he knew

1011
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:38,608
what is was about.

1012
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:58,766
The areas east and
south of Amazonas

1013
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:02,436
are the worst example of
forest station in the Amazon.

1014
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:04,855
The state of Rondonia
is big like England

1015
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:07,741
has been
70% deforested

1016
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:11,150
and in the state of Para
and Mato Grosso

1017
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:13,803
and the area of jungle
the size of small country

1018
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:16,056
disappears each year.

1019
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:19,016
Most of this is do
the cattle ranches.

1020
01:08:19,017 --> 01:08:21,112
Each year the
sky turns black

1021
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:22,420
which smokes for months

1022
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:24,354
as priest in forest
is burn to make

1023
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:26,161
way for a new
car fits.

1024
01:08:26,162 --> 01:08:28,865
Countless species
of animals and plants

1025
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,333
become extinguish
each burn season.

1026
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:32,921
This is all simply

1027
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:35,697
because of the world
demands to eat beef.

1028
01:08:36,722 --> 01:08:39,632
Even though the UN
relist a reports saying

1029
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:42,800
that cattle production has
more humfer environment impact

1030
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:45,034
then all the
cars in the planet.

1031
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:46,798
The fast
food companies

1032
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,195
are spending millions
to promote even more

1033
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:51,854
cosumshen and
bigger burgers.

1034
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:54,099
At the current rate

1035
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,522
half of Amazon
will be cattle funds

1036
01:08:56,523 --> 01:08:59,136
by the year 2030

1037
01:08:59,137 --> 01:09:00,668
and by the end of
the century

1038
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:03,908
not only the Amazon
but all the world's rainforest

1039
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:05,834
will have to be
cut down to accommodate

1040
01:09:05,835 --> 01:09:09,489
the needs of planet
with 14 billion people.

1041
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:15,411
ILHA DO PATACHO
852 KM TO GO

1042
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:14,042
DAY 52

1043
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:37,278
At the day 52.

1044
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:39,682
Martin scowlen was
flame dought by Amazon

1045
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:42,283
and the doctor said
the swim was over

1046
01:11:42,284 --> 01:11:45,028
but Martin said, no.

1047
01:11:45,029 --> 01:11:48,506
I will find another
way to swim.

1048
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:55,534
DAY 55

1049
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,294
Now I cross...

1050
01:12:07,796 --> 01:12:11,543
fourth dimension.

1051
01:12:50,377 --> 01:12:54,135
DAY 60

1052
01:12:59,952 --> 01:13:01,629
On April 1.

1053
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:03,198
we found out
from the doctor

1054
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,516
that Martin has
been haven

1055
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:07,012
subcontineus larva
infection in his brain

1056
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:08,173
for nearly two weeks.

1057
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:11,430
She hid this fact from
us on Martin's request

1058
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:13,195
that we not stop the swim.

1059
01:13:13,196 --> 01:13:14,922
But her official diagnoses

1060
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,229
was that Martin's problems

1061
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,555
were the mostly mental.

1062
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:26,515
What's happening?

1063
01:13:26,516 --> 01:13:27,677
What do you think
what's happening?

1064
01:13:27,678 --> 01:13:29,692
I think he's
at the low, low,

1065
01:13:29,693 --> 01:13:32,890
lowest level, lowest
level with the energy.

1066
01:13:32,891 --> 01:13:35,293
Probably his head
wants to like explode.

1067
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:40,517
So, it's a really
weird reaction

1068
01:13:40,552 --> 01:13:41,434
I didn't expect that.

1069
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:44,389
Clocking batteries, wires...

1070
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,836
You guys just
get let him swim?

1071
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:47,512
What else we
suppose to do?

1072
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:49,295
What can I do?
What we can do?

1073
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:51,119
I mean, what can
I tell Martin Strel?

1074
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,264
Martin, I think you have
fucking mental problems.

1075
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:56,063
Do you think... Think
you can please stop

1076
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,420
yours world
record expeditions for

1077
01:13:57,421 --> 01:14:00,524
so maybe you can go to
see the fucking shrink.

1078
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:13,048
DAY 63

1079
01:14:32,615 --> 01:14:34,393
Martin had
become so insane

1080
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:36,043
by this point in the swim

1081
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:37,453
that we even
didn't look on him

1082
01:14:37,454 --> 01:14:39,525
like a person anymore.

1083
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:45,454
It was like he had
taken on the stado

1084
01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:48,051
of an animal
or a monster.

1085
01:14:49,628 --> 01:14:52,916
He was like Frankenstein
or The elephant man

1086
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,167
but in the Amazon.

1087
01:14:54,168 --> 01:14:57,361
DAY 64

1088
01:15:03,784 --> 01:15:05,473
By the 64. day

1089
01:15:05,474 --> 01:15:07,318
Martin didn't want
to spent energy

1090
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,187
on anything that
wasn't swimming.

1091
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:13,134
He stops feeding himself.

1092
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:14,633
He only want to spent

1093
01:15:14,774 --> 01:15:15,928
the physical
energy on swimming

1094
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:18,373
and he wanted to
swim day and night.

1095
01:15:18,374 --> 01:15:20,375
This was also
nothing new to me.

1096
01:15:20,376 --> 01:15:21,864
I fed him
the same way

1097
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:23,892
on the Yangtze and
Mississippi.

1098
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:26,780
It was like keeping
a baby alive

1099
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:30,619
but one that your father
swimming the Amazon.

1100
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:34,074
The doctor advise

1101
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:36,476
that Martin stand down
for at least a week

1102
01:15:36,477 --> 01:15:38,623
to avoid a heart attack

1103
01:15:39,237 --> 01:15:41,650
but he wouldn't listen.

1104
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:45,170
I not allowed you.
-I must swim tonight.

1105
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:48,275
At this point if you
are going to the water

1106
01:15:48,276 --> 01:15:49,591
I would recommend
against it

1107
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,298
because he's too weak

1108
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,577
he has some
experiences in delirium

1109
01:15:55,578 --> 01:15:58,022
and we can't have
him swimming like that.

1110
01:16:01,577 --> 01:16:03,781
The doctor made Martin
sign a paper

1111
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:05,601
saying that she
was not responsible

1112
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,538
for anything that
happen to him

1113
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:08,489
if he swam at night.

1114
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,379
There were also
a big concerns about

1115
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,596
firevits at night.

1116
01:16:11,597 --> 01:16:13,017
Not even crazy Matt

1117
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:14,218
want it to take the risk

1118
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:16,430
and try to talk to
Martin out of it.

1119
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:19,589
Finally I decided
to lead him myself.

1120
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,117
I had been
in this situation

1121
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,216
of swimming
with him at night

1122
01:16:22,217 --> 01:16:25,450
before in the Danube and we
are run over by a barge

1123
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:26,375
and we are almost die.

1124
01:16:26,376 --> 01:16:28,958
All of us felt like
we are doing something

1125
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,489
incredibly pointless
and stupid

1126
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,663
but I knew it if
we didn't go with him

1127
01:16:32,664 --> 01:16:35,665
he would swim out
at night alone.

1128
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:36,983
We get one life jacket.

1129
01:16:36,984 --> 01:16:38,814
One life jacket
on the boat

1130
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,656
for six men and one gun.

1131
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,751
One gun,
one life jacket

1132
01:16:42,752 --> 01:16:45,290
and the swimmer that
can barely stand up.

1133
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:10,602
A little bit to the end.

1134
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:12,524
Go.

1135
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:16,119
Go.

1136
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,947
A little bit.

1137
01:17:33,018 --> 01:17:36,197
Martin all of the sudden
jump out of the river.

1138
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:38,665
We thought that
might he seen the shark.

1139
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:40,811
But he said that
he saw a little

1140
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:43,157
girl under the water

1141
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,908
and it hororfright him.

1142
01:17:44,909 --> 01:17:48,106
We got you. We got you.
You just need to lay down.

1143
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:53,968
Give him a bucket
or something.

1144
01:18:02,806 --> 01:18:08,475
DAY 66, EASTER SUNDAY
APRIL 7, 2007

1145
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:31,031
Martin got to with in
3 miles to the finish line.

1146
01:18:31,293 --> 01:18:33,707
His body was in such
state of shock

1147
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:37,057
that he could have an heart
attack every second.

1148
01:18:37,058 --> 01:18:38,900
Even though he
had already bitten

1149
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:41,934
his previous world record
by nearly 1000 miles

1150
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:45,366
he swam the last three

1151
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:47,250
which was still water

1152
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:49,949
just like a lake.

1153
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,979
BELEM, BRAZIL

1154
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,176
There was media
from 20 countries

1155
01:18:56,177 --> 01:18:58,445
waiting for us
at the finish line.

1156
01:18:58,841 --> 01:19:00,671
It was the
hugest moment

1157
01:19:00,672 --> 01:19:02,384
in Martin's life
and I felt

1158
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:04,361
like I should write a
statement for him

1159
01:19:04,362 --> 01:19:05,669
to read to the world

1160
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,663
explaining why he did it.

1161
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:08,664
"I like it to drink...

1162
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,494
and I'm a simple man."

1163
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,090
"There are
many people like me."

1164
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:17,834
But the things
was so chaotic

1165
01:19:17,835 --> 01:19:20,554
that I lost my original
and I had to rewrite it

1166
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,825
on the boat
we us approached.

1167
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:30,316
Please. Please,
give as some room.

1168
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:04,927
What's your name?

1169
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:05,928
What's your name?

1170
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:08,993
We'll write a fish man.

1171
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:13,183
You are OK, fish man.

1172
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,542
Fish man.

1173
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:02,619
No, no, no!

1174
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,620
No, no.

1175
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:08,234
Do you remember
what we must tell?

1176
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:10,404
How many can...
-Excuse me, no.

1177
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:14,171
They are many
people like me?

1178
01:22:14,172 --> 01:22:16,997
...they realized that
 even impossible...

1179
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:19,104
...to save the world.

1180
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:20,883
I hope the people
will remember me...

1181
01:22:20,884 --> 01:22:22,416
...I am very tired...

1182
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:23,905
I just want that...

1183
01:23:59,524 --> 01:24:01,727
A,B,C, D, E, F, N...

1184
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,745
Martin was visited

1185
01:24:09,746 --> 01:24:11,796
by many people
in the next days

1186
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,797
who try to helped
him out from

1187
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,197
of his fourth
dimensional state.

1188
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,609
One of this was
the hotel preacher

1189
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:20,722
who prayed for him and
even practice English.

1190
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,526
Another was
a Brazilian band.

1191
01:24:41,865 --> 01:24:44,663
Finally, Martin refuse
to see anyone

1192
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,759
and only allowed
the Brazilian preacher

1193
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,845
to stay with him
who's also been a papito.

1194
01:24:53,116 --> 01:24:56,288
He was in there
with Martin for days.

1195
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:00,303
A person,

1196
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:01,563
who apparently
took his own life.

1197
01:26:01,564 --> 01:26:03,404
That would be
the shooter.

1198
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,855
That's right. Now to
rezavnig question

1199
01:26:05,856 --> 01:26:08,339
why wasn't
the alarm sound it

1200
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,347
in between
those two shootings.

1201
01:26:10,348 --> 01:26:12,283
Why was that first
shooting see in the morning.

1202
01:26:16,193 --> 01:26:19,745
APRIL 7, 2007
BELEM, BRAZIL

1203
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:12,809
FIVE MONTHS LATER

1204
01:27:20,497 --> 01:27:23,338
In a few months
Martin gambled away

1205
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:25,052
all over
sponsorship money

1206
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:27,507
and had to return
to his day job.

1207
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,515
I waited for the
talk show to call back.

1208
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:36,516
Leather man, Conor o'Brain
and Jai Lenno

1209
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,941
had all promise
to help him on

1210
01:27:38,942 --> 01:27:40,784
but they never called.

1211
01:27:40,849 --> 01:27:42,580
Martin Strel.

1212
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:44,477
Who is this guy?

1213
01:27:44,478 --> 01:27:46,151
Some people describe
him like a dare devil.

1214
01:27:46,152 --> 01:27:48,422
Fish man, human fish

1215
01:27:48,423 --> 01:27:52,250
even craziest
man on the world.

1216
01:27:57,150 --> 01:28:00,019
Take a long time to
writing that statement.

1217
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:03,864
Are you sad that didn't
get read to the world?

1218
01:28:03,865 --> 01:28:05,885
Yeah, it took
a lot of time,

1219
01:28:05,886 --> 01:28:08,574
energy and creativity.

1220
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:11,234
Well, we would
try to present it

1221
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:14,457
to the world by internet,
over the book.

1222
01:28:14,672 --> 01:28:17,453
It was really bad that
he couldn't make it

1223
01:28:17,454 --> 01:28:19,871
but what
we could do.

1224
01:28:19,872 --> 01:28:22,143
Nothing else. You know,
is only a human

1225
01:28:22,144 --> 01:28:24,645
and was not
able to do it.

1226
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:30,648
Do you have the
statement here still?

1227
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:37,635
I have.

1228
01:28:37,944 --> 01:28:40,620
I think I have.

1229
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:47,007
You had it right there.

1230
01:28:48,308 --> 01:28:51,284
Should I read?
-Yeah.

1231
01:28:54,932 --> 01:28:56,458
My name is Martin.

1232
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:59,912
You can see I'm not
Lance Armstrong.

1233
01:28:59,913 --> 01:29:02,252
I'm a little fat
and a little old.

1234
01:29:02,253 --> 01:29:04,931
I like to drink a little.

1235
01:29:04,932 --> 01:29:06,599
I'm a simple man.

1236
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,146
There are many
people like me.

1237
01:29:08,147 --> 01:29:10,630
I hope they
see this swim

1238
01:29:10,631 --> 01:29:13,618
and realize they can
do impossibly things

1239
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:15,349
even save the world.

1240
01:29:15,566 --> 01:29:19,415
I hope people remember
this rainforest is our friend

1241
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:21,457
and stop destroying it.

1242
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:23,360
Now I am very tired.

1243
01:29:23,361 --> 01:29:27,381
Please, excuse me.
I just swam the Amazon.

1244
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:31,397
But he couldn't do it.

1245
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:34,036
Now, I finally read it

1246
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:38,801
and I hope you realized

1247
01:29:38,802 --> 01:29:41,825
it's worth now than never.

1248
01:29:44,868 --> 01:29:46,538
I set down with Martin

1249
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:48,782
and told him ours
finished helping with him

1250
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,498
ultra American swimming.

1251
01:29:50,499 --> 01:29:52,522
I going to college.

1252
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:55,641
From the looking his eye

1253
01:29:55,642 --> 01:29:57,586
I realize that meant

1254
01:29:57,587 --> 01:29:59,656
he was finished too.

1255
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:04,760
This is one horizontal.

1256
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,387
And have more.

1257
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:02,294
Very special picture.
Borut!

1258
01:31:02,295 --> 01:31:04,892
You have another one?

1259
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,593
After Amazon,

1260
01:31:50,594 --> 01:31:54,789
Martin had the same
dream over and over.

1261
01:31:59,062 --> 01:32:01,862
He was swimming
the Amazon again.

1262
01:32:02,945 --> 01:32:06,927
He had to start over
from the beginning.

1263
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,817
When he
started swimming

1264
01:32:14,147 --> 01:32:15,216
the Amazon picked him up

1265
01:32:15,217 --> 01:32:17,765
and let him fly over it.

1266
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:26,301
And show him
the way it was

1267
01:32:26,302 --> 01:32:29,953
in the beginning
before man kinds.

1268
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:33,484
And the Amazon said

1269
01:32:33,485 --> 01:32:37,062
this is the
way is was, Martin

1270
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:41,673
and will be again for you.

1271
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:45,604
No more distraction

1272
01:32:45,605 --> 01:32:47,072
no more suffering

1273
01:32:47,073 --> 01:32:50,435
and no one will ever die.

1274
01:32:50,435 --> 01:33:00,397
END
