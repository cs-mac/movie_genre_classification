my eyes was not all there was...</i>

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,587
<i>It felt like an epiphany, very unfamiliar,</i>

8
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:51,208
<i>but it also strangely made me
feel relaxed, and gave me peace.</i>

So this is the person you've been
seeing in your visions, all this time?

28
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:33,707
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,998
My name is Park Soon Taek.

30
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:44,598
It's all... true.

31
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:54,077
It's possible to see the future, but it
doesn't mean it happens exactly that way.

32
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:59,117
It can be similar to the vision,
or it can be completely different.

33
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:02,548
In the middle, if something changes,
the future is bound to change.

34
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,737
Are you still seeing visions?

35
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,528
No, I see nothing at all now.

36
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:13,627
Then, it's all over, right?

37
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:18,727
We should consider nothing to be completely
over, as long as we live, right?

38
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:23,337
- Don't say it so vaguely, please.
- What am I saying that sounds vague?

39
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,408
So...

40
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:29,487
we don't have to worry about
death, or such things anymore?

41
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:34,138
Well, everyone's going to die at some
point. It's not as if we are phoenixes.

42
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:39,308
Did I say something wrong?

43
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,587
Let's live together. I
can't leave you alone.

44
00:03:56,588 --> 00:04:00,918
Thinking about how you couldn't tell anyone and
just trembled alone, it makes me feel so bad.

45
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:05,657
- Let's live together.
- I've never trembled, once.

46
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,658
And I've never been afraid.

47
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:12,978
I'm grateful that you liked me first,
but don't say such things first.

48
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,458
I'll be the one to propose to you.

49
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:33,448
- Hold on, just a moment.
- We're almost done. - Hey, Park Hoon.

50
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,527
Help us carry this. Come on.

51
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,427
Help us. Hold this, it's heavy.

52
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:45,467
Where are you going? Aish! Really!

53
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,617
Go, go, go.

54
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:49,718
Yeah, we're all done.

55
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,348
I got it.

56
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,877
Hand it to me too. Here, here.

57
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,527
The seizure order has been cleared.

58
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,848
Really? Is that true?

59
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,178
Hey!

60
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,974
Move everything back out.

61
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:28,133
I wish he'd told us earlier. Now you tell
us, after we've moved everything in?

62
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:32,093
Look at my hand trembling. My hands have never
trembled in my whole life from being tired.

63
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:36,383
Park Do Kyung, this guy. I know
he's hiding somewhere watching us.

64
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:40,264
He knew we just moved everything in, and
that is why he's calling right now.

65
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:46,273
Is he looking at us through binoculars?
I'm 100% sure. That pervert.

66
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:47,783
Should we start moving it back, then?

67
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:51,054
No! Call movers!

- Just move!
- You can't!

78
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:25,893
- If you do this, it's troubling.
- You stupid humans. Out of my way!

Ah! That hurts!

So I heard about it. You played
around with my Do Kyung.

Why do you live this way, you sad human?

Hey!

84
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:51,203
Move! Let go!

85
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:56,663
Hey! What is the use having a lot of money?
You can't even go outside.

86

Hey! Don't mess with a bitch
who has nothing to lose.

89
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:16,553
You, if you ever even look like you're
going to do anything to my Do Kyung...

90
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:20,173
Then! Just!

91
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:25,524
I will set my body on fire

Let go!

spirit! This is why I like you, Ji Yah.

You know what day that will be, right?

98
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:58,423
Don't make me come here again! You got it?

99

Yes, ma'am.

00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:08,543
but this bumpkin went on
his first trip abroad.

300
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,883
To commemorate his trip, he bought an Eiffel Tower-shaped
bottle opener, the kind you stick on your fridge.

301
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:19,513
And he gave that as a gift to his woman.
But one day,

he goes crazy.

306
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,463
He was exploding with betrayal and fury. But the truth
is, he wanted most to get his bottle opener back...

313
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,843
Nobleman, geez. Who knows?

314
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,064
Maybe you will become the
nobleman of my life.

315
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:32,193
I am humbled.

316
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:33,704
I know.

317
00:32:34,674 --> 00:32:36,274
I'm off.

318
00:32:43,614 --> 00:32:45,914
Bye!

319
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:00,873
We decided to meet his mom tomorrow.
Do you have time?

320
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:05,463
I threw you away. Why concern
myself with a girl I threw away?

321
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:08,924
- You told him to live well.
- You told me to say that.

322
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,713
Can't you be more tender?

323
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:13,123
Have you and I ever spoken
tenderly to each other?

324
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,483
Be tender from now on.

325
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:20,043
From now on, if we fight on the phone, it's not
as if we'll both return home to face each other.

326
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:22,854
So if you speak to me
like that, it bothers me.

327
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,533
Did that guy give you a
ride to work this morning?

328
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:29,883
Of course, he gave me a ride.

329
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,393
But why do you keep calling him
"that guy?" Stop calling him that.

330
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,224
Then what should I call him?

331
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:37,884
Son-in-law Park.

332
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,824
Ridiculous.

333
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:55,383
Delete the first and the second one,
and then try to re sync the first one.

334
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:56,994
Alright.

335
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,704
- Yes?
- It's me.

336
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:11,714
I'm now... your father-in-law.

337
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,694
Oh yes.

338
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:18,894
Write this down.

339
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:27,903
Yes, please speak.

340
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:30,573
Um... milk vetch root.

341
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,364
Milk vetch root.

342
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,674
White...

343
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,113
balloon flower.

344
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:42,234
Jerusalem artichoke.

345
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:46,774
Boil and eat them. They say
it's great for your health.

346
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:06,354
<i>Milk vetch root - calms body down / White balloon flower -
regulates breathing / Jerusalem artichoke - prevents diabetes</i>

347
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:14,103
As soon as Oh Man Seok (actor) came in, I
thought, "Okay, I will work on him for a week."

348
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:19,213
Flirt with him every day, just enough
so he's refreshed, but not burdened.

349
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:24,514
Then say, "My oppa has
a killer screenplay."

350
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:29,634
You really have yourself a
good girlfriend, there.

351
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:32,524
Aiyoo.

352
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:50,523
I... uh... little bit...

353
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,493
I'm going to say something
that makes me blush.

354
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:56,324
It's really making me blush.

355
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:02,024
I... I love you.

Cheers!

365
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:01,034
We decided to get married.

366
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,753
We decided to meet with
our mothers tomorrow.

367
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:07,913
Congratulations. Congrats.

368
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,113
Thank you.

369
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:12,164
And, isn't there anything else?

370
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:20,614
Before we get married, we're
going to live together.

371
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:22,803
Starting from today?

372
00:37:22,804 --> 00:37:24,823
Don't over do it. I will make you scream.

373
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:29,404
I'm your elder brother-in-law. Should you
treat your elder brother-in-law that way?

374
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:33,174
The two of us... are dating.

375
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:35,494
Dating is all you're doing?

376
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:38,894
Control your little brother, please.

377
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:42,433
I...

378
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,784
am pregnant.

379
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,033
It's okay.

380
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:55,894
We're going to be one family soon,
so she's going to find out anyway.

381
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:05,014
That's why you couldn't come inside
and lingered outside, every day.

382
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:09,923
Did you get permission to live
together before you get married?

383
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,404
Yes.

384
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,453
How nice.

385
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:15,954
You two live together already.

386
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:22,064
Uh... We... We haven't got
our own place... Yet...

387
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:29,403
You two. As difficult as it
was for you to get together,

388
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,663
be just as happy.

389
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,934
Bonne sante!

390
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:40,703
We've reached the love level!

391
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,653
What are you saying?

392
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,883
Oppa said he loves me. Since we reached the
love level, when we reach the fart level

393
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:49,953
we become a real couple!

394
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:51,683
I can already fart in front of her.

395
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:56,573
Do things in order. Love
level, then fart level.

396
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:59,224
You two still haven't said
"I love you" to each other?

397
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:05,463
- Have you said it?
- Of course. Would we be living together if we haven't?

398
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,173
I thought you couldn't say
that your whole life.

399
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,793
Why haven't you said it yet?

400
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:11,113
Well, it's not that hard. I
can just say it right now.

401
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:16,163
You should say "I love you"
when you really mean it.

402
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:20,614
You can't just spit it out at any time.
If you do, you're dead.

403
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:25,594
You still have many levels left.
The speaking level, too.

404
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:28,593
They are going to live together.

405
00:39:28,594 --> 00:39:30,824
- What?
- Huh?

406
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:34,294
We're getting married.

407
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:37,554
They started living together yesterday.

408
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:43,563
Let's go upstairs.

409
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,543
We'll be going up first.

410
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:47,324
Bonne nuit.

411
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:52,133
That guy, he's become bolder lately.

412
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:54,624
Are they really living together?

413
00:39:56,254 --> 00:40:00,033
AHHH!

414
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:03,904
Oh, so cool. You're so cool, Honey.

415
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:07,734
Did you see those veins?

416
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,253
What is this?

417
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,724
It was at the front door.

418
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:28,034
<i>To Son-in-law Park</i>

419
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:44,323
<i>We need to eat together a few more times for me to know what
side dishes you like, to know what I could make for you.</i>

420
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:49,554
<i>But we've only eaten together twice, so I didn't
know what you like. So I made some guesses.</i>

421
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:27,123
<i>I think of marriage as something you
do with loyalty rather than love.</i>

422
00:41:27,124 --> 00:41:31,963
<i>Marriage is what you do when you are prepared
to cut off a finger when you break up.</i>

423
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:35,274
<i>So please live together for a long time.</i>

424
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:57,053
Did you know that your daughter

425
00:41:57,054 --> 00:42:01,203
is living in my Do Kyung's house?

426
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:03,994
I brought her there.

427
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:10,753
Surprisingly, it seems as if
you have American-style mind.

428
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:13,624
How different from the way you look.

429
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:22,053
The two of them love each other so much, it
seems that they can't live without each other.

430
00:42:22,054 --> 00:42:26,593
In our lives, how many days do we have, when we
feel like we could jump up and down for love?

431
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:32,364
Also, how many people can fulfill
that desire as they live?

432
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,783
"Don't be concerned with
the judgments of others,

433
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:39,713
and be as happy as you can,
to your hearts' content."

434
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:42,423
That is why I brought her to his house.

435
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:46,753
But still, that's a bit... You know?

436
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:50,083
Everyone who is concerned already knows
all about the messy circumstances

437
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:54,363
around how these two met, so
they should observe all decorum

438
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:58,283
and get married carefully. Even then,
they may barely escape scrutiny.

439
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,903
I'm the one who asked to live together.`

440
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:05,463
But still, a woman shouldn't
just say yes to that right away.

441
00:43:05,464 --> 00:43:06,993
It's not sitting right with me.

442
00:43:06,994 --> 00:43:10,863
That my child is living with
someone else before marriage

443
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:14,733
is something I didn't even dream of.
There's an order to everything...

444
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:16,764
Noona is pregnant.

445
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:22,503
Say something that actually makes sense.

446
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:25,624
She's not even married, how
could she be pregnant?

447
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,124
It's true.

448
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:40,914
Congratulations.

449
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,394
Then...

450
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,304
Yes.

451
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:04,663
Your mother-in-law is prickly on the
outside, but you don't need to be scared.

452
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:09,804
She's like bland soup on the inside.
Women like that are easier to handle.

453
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,263
Go.

454
00:44:14,264 --> 00:44:16,254
I'll call you.

455
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:34,193
How can you say that, then?
How does that make me look?

456
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:35,794
I'm sorry.

457
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,353
Is it really true?

458
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:41,673
Soo Kyung is really pregnant?

459
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:43,493
She really is.

460
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,634
Who's the father?

461
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:48,354
Jin Sang.

462
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,214
She did something good, my Soo Kyung.

463
00:45:03,574 --> 00:45:04,994
What?

464
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,524
Is the toilet clogged?

465
00:45:09,654 --> 00:45:11,334
Is it big?

466
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:16,093
Then unclog it!

467
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:19,873
- I can't do it.
- I can't do it, either! Call someone!

468
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:21,293
Don't do it.

469
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:23,223
Then are we just going
to leave it like that?

470
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:26,364
Let's move! No one can touch this!

471
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,103
You should just do it, punk.

472
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:39,853
Are you crazy? Unclogging someone else'e poop,
when I can't even do it with my own poop?

473
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:42,404
Ah, really. Sheesh.

474
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:04,234
I'm telling you it's okay. I'll do it.

475
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:08,064
Then are we really going to move?

476
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:39,733
I can do this.

477
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,624
I can do this neatly!

478
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:19,603
Are you done?

479
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,904
Clean the toilet, too.

480
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:50,584
It's okay now. I'm done.

481
00:47:53,714 --> 00:47:56,334
You don't even know how
cool I was when I did it.

482
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,144
You should have seen it.

483
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:08,834
It's really okay. We are having a baby together.
Could I not even unclog a toilet for you?

484
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:18,123
Isn't that true?

485
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:20,343
No, that's not what I'm saying!

486
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:21,653
You came?

487
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:23,933
Thank you for coming. This
is our Sound Director.

488
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,173
Nice to meet you.

489
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:27,333
Sit down.

490
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:29,943
- Okay.
- Please sit.

491
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:32,443
- Our movie barely has any dialogue.
- That's right.

492
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:34,873
So the sounds needs to tell the story,

493
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:37,513
and the audience must really feel it.

494
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,823
My friend over there did the sound effects.

495
00:48:38,824 --> 00:48:41,814
- Is that right?
- Wow, great job.

496
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:46,583
- Right?
- Yeah.

497
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:50,754
<i>I'm craving pork belly. Let's
eat that for dinner, okay?</i>

498
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:54,123
<i>Oh, right. You said you
had dinner plans, right?</i>

499
00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:58,143
<i>Then let's eat pork belly another time.
It's no fun to eat it alone.</i>

500
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,054
<i>Eat a lot of delicious
things and come home.</i>

501
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:08,493
Hey, it's been a long time.

502
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:09,833
Good to see you.

503
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,233
Ah, say your greetings.
This is the sound director.

504
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:14,983
Wow, his sound effects were really good.

505
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:17,624
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

506
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:36,473
Director, I'll be heading back.

507
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,393
- Already?
- Yes.

508
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:40,613
- I'm sorry.
- Going already?

509
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:42,983
I'm sorry.

510
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:46,084
Go home safely.

511
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,113
You said you'd be late.

512
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,114
It ended early.

513
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:59,704
Pork belly. I'll go change clothes.

514
00:50:14,754 --> 00:50:18,494
As expected, eating pork belly
when you crave it tastes the best.

515
00:50:20,154 --> 00:50:23,103
Next.

516
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:27,373
Again, something that
I've never done before,

517
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:29,474
I will do it now.

518
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,893
- Just let me feed you once.
- No, thanks.

519
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:41,974
Eat it! It's not hard.

520
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:48,164
Just accept this from me. All you
have to do is open your mouth.

521
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,844
It's not a big deal, right?

522
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:02,114
I heard you're pregnant.

523
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:07,443
Congratulations. Out of all
the things you've done,

524
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,583
I think this is the best one.

525
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:14,094
I wanted you to be the
first person I told, Mom.

526
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:20,243
Guys like Jin Sang, who played
around a lot when they were young,

527
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,923
will have good marriages and are
less likely to cause trouble.

528
00:51:23,924 --> 00:51:29,573
Guys who want to play around after they
get married—there's no solution for them.

529
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:35,943
So... Don't worry, and be good to him.

530
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:40,523
But, we can't be romantic at all.

531
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:44,413
We can't even hold hands
properly, but we still did <i>that.</i>

532
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,193
- It's a mess.
- Hey!

533
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:51,113
You're looking for romance at your age?

534
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:55,313
You have a child together, game over.
Romance. What bull crap.

535
00:51:55,314 --> 00:51:57,503
Even so,

536
00:51:57,504 --> 00:52:00,713
we still haven't even said "I
love you" to each other, yet.

537
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:02,983
We even even held hands properly.

538
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:07,453
But how can... How can... How can...

539
00:52:07,454 --> 00:52:08,444
What?

540
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:10,424
How?!?

541
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:17,594
How can... poop... be first?

542
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:26,763
Thank you for the food.

543
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:30,813
How nice to have a sister-in-law. We even
get to eat such delicious side dishes now.

544
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,713
Your mother's cooking skills
are really a work of art.

545
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:36,614
- Then...
- Yes.

546
00:52:38,644 --> 00:52:44,043
Did something happen? I heard you left
early from the gathering tonight.

547
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:48,873
To be invited to a gathering of such important
directors means that they appreciate you that much.

548
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,144
Give him a call. It seemed like
Director Ahn was a little upset.

549
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,104
- Please rest.
- Yes, go ahead.

550
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:23,193
Why'd you come? You should
have stayed a little longer.

551
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:25,544
You said you wanted to eat pork belly.

552
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:37,813
Should I download a movie?

553
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,853
Sure.

Your concert went well. What's wrong, now?

560
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:18,944
Did you come so late to keep an eye on me,
just in case I did something bad again?

561
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:24,273
Are you doing this because you want to save
me, or because you want to save that guy?

562
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:26,044
Both.

563
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,754
<i>- Did your day go well?</i>

564
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:38,543
<i>Yes, I was a little busy recording
for the weekend, ahead of time.</i>

565
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:40,103

<i>Yeah.</i>

593
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:46,084
<i>You unplugged the toilet for her?</i>

594
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:54,453
Be quiet.

595
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:59,253
The man who unplugs the toilet that
I plugged up is my man forever.

596
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:02,233
But how can you unplug the toilet
even before you say, "I love you"?

597
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:06,053
That's almost the final level
between a man and woman.

598
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:10,103
- This couple is going in reverse order. They started their relationship by making a baby.
- What?!

599
00:57:10,104 --> 00:57:11,824
A baby?!

600
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:21,283
Is this couple going backwards?

601
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:22,653
Wow.

602
00:57:22,654 --> 00:57:24,464
So cool.

603
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:26,733
How is that cool?

604
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,903
It's so cool. Normally you begin
with love, then you speak freely.

605
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:35,293
You fart freely, then you unplug the
toilet. After that, you make a baby.

606
00:57:35,294 --> 00:57:39,783
But it's backwards. Have a child together, then unplug
the toilet for her. Then you fart in front of her.

607
00:57:39,784 --> 00:57:45,293
You've seen all the good and
bad already, and finally,

608
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:47,124
you say, "I love you."

609
00:57:48,554 --> 00:57:53,023
The words, "I love you," will
probably explode so amazingly.

610
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:56,813
Oh, reverse order! It's totally cool!

611
00:57:56,814 --> 00:57:58,993
Totally cool.

612
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,503
Is that so?

613
00:58:00,504 --> 00:58:04,763
Of course. The, "I love you"
that comes out in reverse order,

614
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:07,213
is a real, "I love you."

615
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:09,414
I'm so jealous!

616
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:17,113
Let's eat.

617
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:18,904
Okay.

618
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:42,393
She really thinks it's cool.
My noona is so simple-minded.

619
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:46,183
Wasn't I really good at acting surprised?
"What?! A baby?!"

620
00:58:46,184 --> 00:58:49,084
"A baby?!"

621
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:58,124
Here.

622
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:02,873
I wrote the script. "A love that goes
in reverse order." It's killer, right?

623
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:07,183
Ah, it was killer. Hey, my acting
was pretty good also, right?

624
00:59:07,184 --> 00:59:09,093
"Be quiet."

625
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:11,204
Yes, very natural.

626
00:59:16,884 --> 00:59:23,624
But the thing is, for some reason, going
in reverse order does seem really cool.

627
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:30,593
You must be joking.

628
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:34,584
No, no, wait a minute. No baby.
No baby. No baby.

629
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:46,433
Hey, I thought we should be laughing
loudly when I drank with you.

630
00:59:46,434 --> 00:59:50,454
I didn't want to drink while
pretending to be okay when I wasn't.

631
00:59:52,274 --> 00:59:54,724
My heart is at ease now.

632
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:57,503
- You hate me, don't you?
- Yeah.

633
00:59:57,504 --> 01:00:01,273
Hey, you were hateful too, during the
entire three years of high school.

634
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,763
And even up until recently.

635
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:07,863
But still, you're the winner.

636
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:13,734
Let's not call winners and losers
because of a man. It's embarrassing.

637
01:00:15,224 --> 01:00:20,584
I won't go to your wedding.

638
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:25,274
I think that's the right thing to do. I'm
also transferring to another company.

And you two, live happily
together for a long time.

642
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,114
