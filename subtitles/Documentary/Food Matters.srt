1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,665
Once you start asking questions, you can't stop.

2
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,871
You see, good health makes a lot of sense,

3
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,704
but it doesn't make a lot of dollars.

4
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,495
And not considering nutrition seriously,

5
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,504
we've done a terrible disservice to all these people.

6
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,602
Every single person in the world,

7
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,514
every culture, every language, every country,

8
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,108
every person in the world knows it,

9
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,811
you are what you eat.

10
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,878
Food does matter.

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,792
<i>The Supermarket:</i>

12
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:14,833
<i>symbol of the high standard of living
in this country today.</i>

13
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,800
<i>These products come from farms and ranches
despite distance and season.</i>

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,908
<i>They are the result of a miraculous agriculture,</i>

15
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,938
<i>maintaining farm fresh quality
all the way to your dinner table.</i>

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,516
<i>How old is your Food?</i>

17
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:38,513
If you think about it, your food really, in the best of times

18
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,449
is traveling between fifteen hundred

19
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,965
and two thousand miles before you get it
and is at least a week old.

20
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,592
Which becomes the next question:

21
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,864
How much nutrition value are you getting from food

22
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,203
that's at least five days old?

23
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:01,769
And if you're lucky, you're getting maybe
fourty percent of what you need.

24
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:07,609
Nearly every food that you'll find in the shops in a big city

25
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,549
has been processed,

26
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,158
it has been delayed to the shops

27
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,616
quite often nutrients have deteriorated
or disappeared from the food

28
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,856
by the time gets onto the plate.

29
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,401
We, for whatever reason, decided
we were going to spray everything

30
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,702
with every kind of pesticide,

31
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,438
herbicide, larvicide, fungicide,

32
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:29,704
we decided we were going to genetically
modify things we don't know anything about.

33
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,948
And one of the major problems is of course the soil

34
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,683
and what we do to the soil

35
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,520
and the air and the water and
everything we take in our food

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,488
Soils are used and used and used

37
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,857
and nutrients are drawn out of the soils
and the soils become new deserts

38
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,190
and that's happening worldwide.

39
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,765
We do really need to look at our systems of agriculture

40
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:57,099
and what we are really eating
and how we are producing food.

41
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:05,143
The so-called fertilizer is made up
of mainly three minerals:

42
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,048
N, P, K, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.

43
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,174
Well, that's nice,

44
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,180
but,

45
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:17,984
the problem is that the soil requires
approximately fifty-two different minerals.

46
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:22,124
So where is the calcium and the magnesium
and the manganese and the zinc

47
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:27,155
and the iron and all of the other things I can't mention?

48
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,635
They're missing.

49
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:35,263
But when the soil is deficient the plants also
are deficient and weakened,

50
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,040
and they lose their defenses,

51
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,813
and the bugs come and attack them

52
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,384
and the diseases and fungus come and attack them.

53
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,288
So now they come crying to the
chemical companies and they say

54
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,759
well, our plants are dying and they won't grow

55
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,093
and we have pests,

56
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,963
and of course the chemical companies are terribly happy

57
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,666
to sell them pesticides and fungicides

58
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,897
and growth stimulants and all kinds of other things.

59
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,366
Through his intellect,

60
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,571
man has developed a superiority

61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,343
over every other form of animal life.

62
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,980
From his modern chemistry, biology
and dedicated research

63
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,781
have come thousands of effective
chemical compounds,

64
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,787
all to help revolutionise the productivity
of our own agriculture.

65
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,361
So what were getting

66
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:33,321
even if we eat just commercial vegetarian food

67
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,792
we get deficient toxic food

68
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,742
because with all these pesticides and
chemicals and sprays and all of that,

69
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,334
the food is not healthy.

70
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,012
And its deficient.

71
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,072
So we can't help but be deficient and toxic.

72
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,011
And then...

73
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,121
Then we cook it!

74
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,926
And studies show that even if you lightly steam your food

75
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,095
you are going to lose the enzymes that are in it.

76
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,865
The simplest thing is there are live enzymes

77
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,236
or live workers inside of foods

78
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:14,307
that help with your body's digestion of foods

79
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,810
and the use of the nutrients that are there,

80
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,745
so raw foods should be apart of everybody's diet.

81
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,341
When you cook food the immune system
reacts to it as a toxin.

82
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,520
Most people don't know that.
When you cook your food

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,290
the body goes through a process
called digestive leukocytosis

84
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,386
where it starts generating white cell activity
against the cooked food you've eaten.

85
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,565
Presumably because the cooking process has
bastardised the food structure

86
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:44,570
In a way that the body cannot recognise,
and so the body is now treating that food as a toxin.

87
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,530
That's not a good thing for your body to do to
the food that you're hoping is going to nourish you.

88
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,379
There was a Swiss doctor by the name of Paul Kouchakoff

89
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,210
who was the first to show in the 1930's

90
00:06:55,548 --> 00:07:01,120
that if you ate a diet that was more than
fifty-one percent cooked food

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,752
that your body would react to the food as if
it was being invaded by a foreign organism.

92
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,263
Dr. Kouchakoff was the first to demonstrate

93
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,132
that if fifty-one percent of your meals were raw

94
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,703
that you would have no leukocytosis.

95
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,573
Or you would actually have no white blood cell reaction

96
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:25,704
so your immune system would not be
activated with a false alarm.

97
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,645
Because we are dealing with so many
immune system issues today

98
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:34,117
we have to make sure that at least fifty-one percent of
every meal that we have is raw,

99
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,653
So that we don't overburden that already
burdened immune system.

100
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:44,831
How can you build a building that
you expect to last a hundred years

101
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,822
if you put poor building materials in?

102
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,594
Same thing with your body,

103
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:54,068
how can you expect your body to last for
a long and enjoyable lifetime

104
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,776
if you don't put the proper building blocks in there.

105
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,710
Everybody knows we are what we eat.

106
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,541
If you eat garbage you are going to get garbage.

107
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,685
Think of it as chronic malnutrition
because that's what's going on.

108
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,243
That's why people look tired.

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,056
You are not supposed to be tired in the afternoon.

110
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,820
You are supposed to be alive and vibrant.

111
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:18,319
This has lead people naturally to discover super foods

112
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,503
and to discover certain foods have
an extraordinary quality of vitamins and minerals

113
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,941
and all kinds of co factors and
enzymes and special chemicals

114
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,138
that for example, that will cause us to live longer,

115
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,677
will cause our skin to be softer etc etc.

116
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:42,482
Spirulina was consumed in Mexico City as the
primary protein source for five thousand years.

117
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,958
Spirulina is the highest protein content food in the world.

118
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,630
The Max Planck Institute discovered
that fifty percent of protein

119
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,258
is destroyed in any food once you cook the food.

120
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,869
Therefore, super food plant-based protein sources

121
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,064
are going to be a key food of the future.

122
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,610
Because we can get all the protein
that we need from those sources,

123
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,712
they've been undamaged by heat

124
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,671
and they are completely absorbable.

125
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,353
They can be liquified easily -
that's what I am saying by absorbable.

126
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:19,125
How much energy do you think it takes to turn
Spirulina into a liquid and get it into your body?

127
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,160
Well you put Spirulina in water and it's already liquified,

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,560
you drink it and it goes right into your cells like that.

129
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:29,936
But a steak requires a massive amount of energy to liquify it

130
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,772
and make it absorbable by your digestive system.

131
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:40,611
These super foods can confer exceptional properties
to your health and wellbeing.

132
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,977
Cacao beans stack up on the mineral content
against anything in the world.

133
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,758
It's the highest natural source of magnesium.

134
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,794
It's the highest natural source of chromium.

135
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,890
It's very likely the highest natural source of iron.

136
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,034
It's very likely the highest natural source of manganese.

137
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,737
It's one of the highest contents of zinc.

138
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,671
It's one of the highest contents of copper.

139
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,776
All the co factors needed for healthy metabolism -
it's in the cacao bean.

140
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,768
It's one of the highest Vitamin C content foods in the world

141
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:18,681
but all processed chocolate has no Vitamin C in it
because heat destroys Vitamin C.

142
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,716
It has the highest anti-oxidant content

143
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:26,726
that means that if we are really going to
take advantage of what we have learned in nutrition

144
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:32,565
that anti-oxidants protect us from DNA damage,
viral damage, cancer,

145
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,728
protect us from skin damage etc etc.

146
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:41,207
It's either going to be this and then we eat
or it's going to be this and then we eat.

147
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:47,780
And this right here could be the most
horrid chemical soup of all time

148
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,717
or it could be the most extraordinary super food of all time

149
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,175
and it's the same amount of work to get it into our mouths.

150
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:01,027
We probably as a culture have got our values inverted.

151
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:06,732
We would rather spend our money on rent
than we would on the best food ever.

152
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,903
We would rather spend money on a car or a house

153
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:15,408
than on feeding our children the greatest super foods
that have ever been discovered in the world

154
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,575
because we don't know!

155
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,111
It's just a values inversion because we just got confused.

156
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,749
We saw some program that sold us on buying this car
and suddenly we are buying that car,

157
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,946
when really we should take that money
and invest it into our families health

158
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,511
by the best food ever which is the basis.

159
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,994
If I eat a lousy bread roll everyday,

160
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,054
have a cup of tea for breakfast, and a piece of toast,

161
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:43,124
a sugary drink for mid-morning, a donut for lunch

162
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,161
and take away fried chicken at night,

163
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,743
I am going to be massively deficient
in a whole range of nutrients,

164
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,078
and that's only one day.

165
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,515
So I'm going to need something in the way of supplements.

166
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:01,475
So the next day I eat salad until it's
coming out of my ears to try and make up for it

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,858
but I never ever correct the deficiency
that occurred from the day before.

168
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,562
There is always going to be a residual problem somewhere

169
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:14,659
so you cannot punish yourselves
without having to pay for it sooner or later.

170
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,801
We are lucky,

171
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:24,009
in the last hundred years we went from
not having any vitamin supplements

172
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,079
to having them over the counter and readily available.

173
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,084
And yet most people don't know
how important vitamins really are.

174
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,177
And if they take large enough doses

175
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,155
they can use them to prevent illness

176
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,989
and if they take large enough doses
they can use them to treat illness.

177
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,294
Once again how can that be?

178
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,063
I didn't hear it on the news...

179
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,792
in fact on the news it said,

180
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:50,199
''You shouldn't take too many of those vitamins,
it might not be a good idea.''

181
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,573
And yet they don't provide
any evidence of that, they just say it.

182
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,767
Doctors say...

183
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,901
''I don't believe in vitamins.''

184
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,173
Well...

185
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,853
We're not going to a shaman!
We're supposed to be going with scientists here.

186
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,222
It's not about belief; it's about facts.

187
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,728
Over the last twenty-three years according to the
American Association of Poison Control Centers

188
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,923
there have been ten-

189
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:24,095
a total of ten deaths alleged to be caused by vitamins.

190
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,473
That's one zero, ten in twenty-three years.

191
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,009
That's less than half a death per year,

192
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:36,938
and these are unproven, unverified
but they are attributed to vitamin consumption.

193
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,448
We have a nation where the very thing that will help people

194
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,858
is being presented as actually dangerous.

195
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:50,818
There have been studies that purport to show
that if you take an extra multi vitamin everyday

196
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,799
that it's going to hurt you.
And that's just nonsense.

197
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,759
There are studies that purport to say that
Vitamin C will cause a kidney stone.

198
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,976
Well, I have searched the medical literature and I've
asked all my students to search the medical literature

199
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:10,282
and my colleagues to search it and as soon as they find
scientific evidence of a Vitamin C caused kidney stone,

200
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,785
send me the paper. Send me the reference.

201
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,812
It's been thirty years and I’ve never gotten one.

202
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,289
Now either everybody is dumb...

203
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,657
...or it's a myth.

204
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,933
There is an assumption that vitamins are basically
like drugs and should be regulated like drugs.

205
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,893
There is an assumption that if it's therapeutically
valuable it must be dangerous because drugs are.

206
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,241
So we have been taught our whole lives to be consumers,

207
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,801
mostly consumers to modern medicine,
which is pharmaceutical medicine.

208
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,349
<i>What about drugs that you get by prescription?</i>

209
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:48,309
<i>Well nowadays there are many powerful drugs
that are not safe to take without a doctor's supervision</i>

210
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,358
<i>but you can rely upon your doctor and your pharmacist.</i>

211
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,792
<i>They're both professionally trained men.</i>

212
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,063
<i>A druggist must have received training
at an accredited college.</i>

213
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,600
A doctor goes to a medical school,
gets a medical education,

214
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,764
practices medicine, prescribes medicines
and is called an MD.

215
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,375
Well let's put nutrition into that and see how it sounds.

216
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,912
My doctor is a nutritionist who went to nutritional school,

217
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,144
studied nutrition and has a nutritional degree
and prescribes nutrients.

218
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,248
lt sounds very strange.

219
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:25,882
When we say I went to the doctor it is implicit
that the doctor was a medical doctor.

220
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,028
It surprised me in my clinical years

221
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,665
that nobody was interested in the patients' diets

222
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,536
when I spoke to my profs,
they weren't interested in diets,

223
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,171
the patients weren't interested in diets

224
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,141
and neither were the hospitals
so diet didn't come into it.

225
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,875
Whenever I mentioned it - nutrition -
it was basically put to the side.

226
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,525
I spent time as a student at the
Brigham Hospital in Boston,

227
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,425
which is right next to Harvard Med.

228
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:06,298
And this, even then back in 1974 it was a crisis hospital.

229
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,756
There were more doctors than patients.
It was really a grim place.

230
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,735
And I got a chance to see and
observe the failure of medicine.

231
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,646
You would see people like the
one woman I remember with Leukemia

232
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,911
and they would give her Jell-O and white bread to eat.

233
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,419
Now I am not saying that Jell-O
and white bread caused cancer

234
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,852
but they sure aren't the cure.

235
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,148
Twenty six percent of patients
who are discharged from hospitals

236
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,526
are more malnourished then when they went in.

237
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,697
And the reason they go in,
in eighty to ninety percent of cases

238
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,824
is related to their poor state of nutrition.

239
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:51,510
I started reading papers by William J. McCormack
and Frederick Robert Klenner;

240
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,013
the pioneers of using high doses of Vitamin C

241
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,541
and these gentlemen were curing viral disease
with high doses of Vitamin C

242
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,413
in the 1940's!

243
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,080
And then I had a poser.

244
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,492
Now just a minute here, hold on a second.

245
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,062
These are medical doctors and they're using vitamins

246
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,930
and they're using high doses of vitamins
and they're getting success.

247
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,427
But I didn't get any of this in college.

248
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,300
The medical profession,

249
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,674
medical education,

250
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,040
for that matter undergraduate education,

251
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,114
common education through magazines and television,

252
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:34,882
all manage to walk around
the rhinoceros on the living room.

253
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,422
And I saw the rhinoceros in the living room and I said:

254
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,526
''Hey there is a rhinoceros in the living room!''

255
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,530
and there it was right in the center
this body of knowledge,

256
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,933
this whole body of knowledge
and the more I looked into it

257
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,400
the more I found.

258
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:57,242
Linus Pauling first suggested that Vitamin C
could be useful against the common cold

259
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:03,442
but this was based on quite a lot of
science at the time and not just a guess or a whim.

260
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:08,821
Pauling was of course a colleague of Albert Einstein

261
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:14,521
and quite a large number of other
high level intellects of the time.

262
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:19,398
And he won two Nobel prizes:
one in chemistry and one in peace.

263
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,164
So he is a brilliant man and should
not be taken lightly.

264
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,932
The problem was that he was
getting in the area of clinical medicine

265
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:35,180
and he didn't have qualifications in this area
and so he was at the time very open to criticism

266
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,450
and his suggestion that Vitamin C would
have an effect on the common cold

267
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,147
was boo hoo'd by the medical profession.

268
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,192
And I must say that the medical profession
is not always that scientific and clear thinking.

269
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,595
And the other thing that we have a problem here,

270
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,630
a public relations problem with nutrients,

271
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,428
is that one nutrient is good for too many things.

272
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,139
Vitamin E is good to fight heart disease,
it's also good to put on burns,

273
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:06,442
it's also good to help reduce seizures
in teenagers that are Epileptic.

274
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,548
Now that's pretty diverse.

275
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,849
Vitamin C, let's see,

276
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,046
anti-toxin, anti-histamine, anti-viral,

277
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:19,079
helps regulate blood sugar, helps to elevate
mood in people that are depressed,

278
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,219
it's just too good for too many things
and I have an answer.

279
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,192
The reason one vitamin can cure so many illnesses

280
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,270
is because a deficiency of one vitamin
can cause many illnesses.

281
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,830
There's only about two dozen nutrients

282
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,045
and yet in your body there are
countless thousands of chemical reactions.

283
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,981
So obviously anything that is
vitamin mediated we can expect

284
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,610
that one vitamin is going to be involved in multiple reactions.

285
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,211
This is true with the minerals as well.

286
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,193
We have an idea that one drug one disease;

287
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,821
it's an old medical idea.

288
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,632
One drug, one disease; the doctoring of specifics.

289
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,001
And that is not true with nutrition.

290
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,072
You cannot heal selectively.

291
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,370
If you truly heal, everything heals.

292
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:16,014
If a patient comes for instance not only with cancer
but with high blood pressure, and or diabetes

293
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:20,974
and maybe fibromyalgia and other pains and so on...

294
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,818
...all the problems disappear.

295
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,116
You can't heal one disease
and keep two others; it's impossible.

296
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,922
When the body heals, it heals everything.

297
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,167
You nourish the body

298
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,067
and then the body fixes it.

299
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,968
When people take vitamins,
the vitamins don't specifically do it

300
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,345
they enable the body to do it,
they enable the body to heal itself.

301
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,677
This is a totally different way of looking at it.

302
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:58,845
The body has what my father called
it's own healing mechanism

303
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,987
and he went further and said,

304
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:09,057
''It’s the doctors duty to activate and reactivate
the body's own healing mechanism.''

305
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,602
And the patients heal

306
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,070
and it doesn't matter what you called the disease.

307
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,239
Not one cell in the human body is made out of a drug.

308
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,040
Surgery doesn't put anything into you.

309
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,250
They might put in something made of plastic;

310
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,241
they might take out something that is harmful.

311
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,487
But in the end, cutting into the body
doesn't really make it better.

312
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,754
Giving the body drugs doesn't really promote health.

313
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,828
So what we need is a new paradigm,
we need a whole new way of looking at it.

314
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:45,158
Boosting health has not been tried yet,
it's really kind of the one thing we haven't done.

315
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,875
When nutrients are tested as therapy
they use very low doses

316
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:57,714
and that's why the public and physicians see all
these research papers that show ambiguous results.

317
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,407
One study is published and says vitamins help a little bit

318
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,513
and another study is published that says
vitamins don't help very much

319
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,526
and you have this back and forth.

320
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,859
But the problem is because
all of those studies are low dose studies.

321
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:16,301
The recommended daily allowance
is the amount of a nutrient

322
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:21,261
that's required by the majority of the population
to prevent an overt deficiency disease.

323
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,810
That is if we give everybody in Australia

324
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,947
the recommended intake
of Vitamin C at 60 mg per day

325
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,750
then we should not see scurvy in this country.

326
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,742
However we still see scurvy in this country.

327
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,990
If you are indulging in a high stress job

328
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,995
or if you have a stressful lifestyle,
got some kids, running a home, doing a job,

329
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,933
then the body is going to be breaking
Vitamin C as you are generating adrenaline.

330
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,002
This is the link between stress and heart attacks,

331
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,672
that when you are stressed out
the body is making adrenaline

332
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,441
and is drawing down the levels of Vitamin C in the body.

333
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,812
So that's going to cause a vulnerability
to your cardiovascular system

334
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,507
because of the lack of Vitamin C.

335
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,072
The medical profession just treat disease,

336
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,653
they don't go back to the primary causes
of a lot of things because they can't;

337
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,791
they don't understand what
chemicals come from exercise,

338
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,986
they don't understand what
chemicals come out of meditation,

339
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,461
they don't understand what
chemicals come out of your food.

340
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,834
Where conventional medicine
misses the boat in a big way

341
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:28,295
is for long term, hard to deal with,
the chronic problems.

342
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,943
And the reason why they miss the boat
with the chronic problems

343
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:36,903
is because they do nothing to change the reasons
why the patient got the disease in the first place.

344
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,980
Basically they treat symptoms.

345
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,850
And if all you do is treat symptoms
you are not going to cure the disease.

346
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,690
What you need to do is change the root cause.

347
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,695
It took me about two years of seeing patients
that should already have died

348
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,163
with conventional medicine with their prognosis,

349
00:23:53,331 --> 00:24:02,741
their ability to survive more than just a few months
under traditional clinical conditions was fairly limited

350
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:06,404
and most of the patients who would have followed
conventional medicine would have died.

351
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,014
After I had been with the program for a couple of years

352
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,117
and I'd see patient after patient
so alive and getting better

353
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,076
and tumors going away and
multiple sclerosis disappearing

354
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:21,993
and arthritis going away and lupus going away
and all these really dramatic problems

355
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:26,231
and that's what really made me
one hundred percent fully convinced

356
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:32,500
that I was in the right line of work and
that this work really had something valuable.

357
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,211
Cardiovascular disease is a disease of civilization

358
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,974
it is a lifestyle disease

359
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,815
because we are eating too much of the wrong thing

360
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,717
and not enough of the right thing.

361
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,687
And your grandmother said it
and her grandmother said it

362
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,713
and everybody knows it's true but instead...

363
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,617
...it's fast food and meat, and fat,
and sugar, and starch,

364
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,196
and processed food that has few vitamins

365
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,423
and don't take vitamin supplements
because they might hurt you!

366
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,800
Of course cardiovascular disease -
that's not the risk!

367
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,407
I’ve been saying for at least twenty-five years

368
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,110
that cardiovascular disease is reversible.

369
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,602
Conventional medicine has claimed for a
longtime that it was not reversible.

370
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,874
To look at the cure I think tells us something of cause.

371
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:25,156
Dr. Dean Ornish has done a really good job
with people who have severe cardiovascular disease

372
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:30,116
and he puts them on a strict diet
which is basically a vegetarian diet.

373
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:35,300
That means a plant based diet, a high fiber diet
loaded with vitamins and nutrients

374
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,896
and good things that grow on the ground
or at least ground that is organically tended.

375
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,273
Ornish also has them do stress reduction

376
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:50,304
and these people are able to arrest
or reverse cardiovascular disease in a year or two.

377
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,185
The cause of cardiovascular disease therefore

378
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,985
is a failure to take the vitamins
and a failure to eat right.

379
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,861
The good news is that even people with
advanced cardiovascular disease

380
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,964
when they start taking the nutrients
and they change their diet

381
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,797
they can arrest it or reverse it without surgery.

382
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,607
What amazed me is that
we have some very smart people,

383
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,611
we have the brightest and the best wandering
the corridors of our leading medical institutions

384
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:23,515
with unlimited budgets and they
don't seem to want to finger food

385
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,818
and also the western lifestyle as being causative.

386
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:31,221
In fact about half of all deaths
are from cardiovascular disease

387
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:37,091
and in half of those deaths,
the first symptom is death.

388
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,002
So people can go through their life
for decades with no symptoms at all

389
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,971
and then drop dead and then of course it's too late.

390
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:52,210
It’s too late for a drug, it's too late for a bypass,
it's too late for the ambulance,

391
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,802
it's too late for resuscitation.

392
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,682
If one in every two and a half people,
if you can picture such a creature,

393
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,784
are perishing from cardiovascular problems

394
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,412
that follows that society is
doing something fundamentally wrong.

395
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:08,590
The only way to win is not to play
and that requires that they change their life.

396
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,055
Yet what are we doing?

397
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,799
Every year we are doing
billions of dollars worth of bypass surgery

398
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,759
that can be totally controlled
just by changing the way you eat, drink, live.

399
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,067
Did I mention it was safer?

400
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,005
Did I mention it was cheaper?

401
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,080
And it works very well.

402
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:37,120
Therefore why don't all cardiologists
recommend this approach?

403
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,519
Well, in fairness not all of them have studied it.

404
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,492
And in fairness...

405
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,195
...the drug companies have something to say about it!

406
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,401
Did you notice there is no drugs in there at all?

407
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,137
There is just like no drug therapy at all,

408
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,901
its just meditation and vegetarian diet.

409
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,399
There is no profit in this!

410
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,869
<i>...Prozac, ADD tablets, coke, smack,
now you know I am turning tricks 'cause</i>

411
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:08,341
<i>I used to get high for a livin'
believing everything that I saw on the TV</i>

412
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:13,513
<i>I used to get high for a livin'
eatin'all the bullshit food that you sold me...</i>

413
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:21,531
One of the big problems with the
drug approach is the issue of side effects;

414
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,435
adverse drug reactions

415
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:28,065
just for a start, in the UK the generally accepted figure

416
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:33,133
of the number of people who die each year
as a result of adverse drug reactions

417
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,777
is about ten thousand.

418
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,080
To put that into some sort of perspective

419
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,883
the number of people who die from
motorcar accidents is about three and a half thousand.

420
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,954
We are all very worried about motorcar accidents;

421
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,619
we don't seem to be so worried
about adverse drug reactions.

422
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:56,234
The number of people who
die as a result of prostate cancer

423
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,728
which is of enormous concern
and we have campaigns and so on

424
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,271
is round about nine thousand in this country.

425
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,913
The Journal of the American Medical
Association published papers,

426
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:16,046
which indicated that approximately
one hundred and six thousand Americans die

427
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:20,351
from pharmaceutical drugs each year.

428
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,387
Now these are drugs that are properly prescribed,

429
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:28,466
not physician errors and these are
side effects that are normally expected.

430
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,958
And these are people who
took the medication as directed.

431
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,999
This doesn't count overdoses or misuses.

432
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:40,934
So if a hundred and six thousand people
die from normal expected side effects of drugs

433
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,138
just in America just in one year

434
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,110
in twenty-three years

435
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,716
that's an enormous number of people,

436
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,747
were talking millions of people
dead from pharmaceutical drugs.

437
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:59,219
And in twenty-three years -
ten allegedly dead from vitamins.

438
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,795
Clearly we have to be a lot
more serious about prescribing nutrition.

439
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,472
And as Roger Williams said,
the discoverer of panathenic acid,

440
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,736
when in doubt use nutrition first.

441
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:14,345
The pharmaceutical industry is
in business not to make drugs.

442
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,446
It’s in business to make money.

443
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:20,110
Which I think is perfectly reasonable
they are large international corporations

444
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,687
and they have a duty to their shareholders

445
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,019
and that's what corporations do,
is they make money.

446
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:29,494
We live in a capitalist society,
and I don't happen to think that is a bad thing.

447
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,930
And I think capitalism has it's great advantages

448
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,761
and I think it can be abused roundly
and we have seen both sides of it.

449
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,059
The problem lies in the way that they are regulated.

450
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,840
I believe we have some very good regulators

451
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,274
but we've got some
very incompetent regulators as well.

452
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:51,037
The bodies which are required to both license drugs
and then to see what happens to them afterwards

453
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,716
are all paid for by the drug companies.

454
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,656
If you discovered that all the people who were
your hygiene inspectors for restaurants

455
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,956
were all paid for by the restaurant owners,
you might be rather suspicious about their findings.

456
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,392
That's the kind of situation we have with the drugs
and that's what needs to change.

457
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,067
They pay the regulators who are
supposed to be overseeing the drugs,

458
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,801
they pay the academics who are
meant to be researching the drugs

459
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:23,537
and very often the trials that they run will be
run by people who are part of the drug company.

460
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,519
They also put in adverts into the medical journals

461
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,717
most of the medical journals are
supported by drug company advertising.

462
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:37,852
If we check the medical literature for the
last sixty-five, seventy-five years

463
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,889
there are thousands of papers showing
that high doses of nutrients cure disease.

464
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,464
Now some of these papers you don't get to read

465
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,541
because they were published in journals that, say,

466
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,978
the United States National Library
of Medicine refuses to index.

467
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,812
Isn't that interesting?

468
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:02,020
So there are medical journals out there
that are basically blacklisted.

469
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,818
Whatever is published in certain medical journals

470
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:08,347
such as the Journal of Ortho-Molecular
Medicine of which I am assistant editor

471
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:13,131
whatever is being published in our journal
for the last forty-one years

472
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,156
and that's hundreds of papers,

473
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,070
none of that is indexed by the
US National Library of Medicine

474
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,562
self proclaimed as the
largest medical library on earth.

475
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:28,046
So that what looks like pure
scientific academics researching

476
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:34,085
journals publishing and the
whole edifice of science is actually,

477
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:39,045
has been turned by the drug companies
into an arm of their marketing department.

478
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,828
<i>But I'd like to know about health information
that comes to us from advertising?</i>

479
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:47,031
<i>That's what we call commercial health information.</i>

480
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,192
<i>It’sa mighty big business.</i>

481
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,704
<i>Millions of dollars are spent to
advertise health products</i>

482
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:57,164
<i>and all kinds of pills and other medicines
for all kinds of aches and pains.</i>

483
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,041
<i>You see sometimes the
advertising can be deceptive.</i>

484
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:06,184
There are twenty-five percent of the TV ads
in this country are drug commercials.

485
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,550
First question, why?

486
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,347
It’s not because they like spending a lot of money.

487
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,961
It's because while they're spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on TV time.

488
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:22,567
They are getting back billions on people
buying those things because people are sick.

489
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,968
They are not feeling well.

490
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,630
We need drugs.
There's no question about that at all.

491
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,831
Pain management, brilliant.

492
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:33,144
And drugs are necessary but there
comes this whole point where

493
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,180
we live in a society where if a little is good
more must be much better.

494
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,913
So we end up with now a drug industry
that is trying to find a drug for everything.

495
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,850
You know got a bad attitude - have a drug.
Feeling a little depressed you know - have a drug

496
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,692
and the public has come to rely on it,

497
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,093
the public has come to accept this
whole idea of taking a pill to fix an ill.

498
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:57,224
What would happen if everybody ate
lots and lots of fresh organic food

499
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,903
that was minimally processed?

500
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,064
I think we would have an epidemic of health.

501
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,207
I think the stock market would tremble.

502
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:11,816
The drug industry is a half trillion dollar
a year world wide conglomerate.

503
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:16,776
Almost three hundred billion dollars
just in North America.

504
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,956
This is really, really big business.

505
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,223
What would happen if everybody were well?

506
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,421
There is no money in health.

507
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,957
You see good health makes a lot of sense,
but it doesn't make a lot of dollars.

508
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,372
I think we can have an ethical drug industry.

509
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,464
I really, really do.

510
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,938
But I think we've really got to
start sharpening up the divides

511
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,978
between the regulators and
the people making the drugs

512
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,147
and this is an absolute shambles right now.

513
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:48,107
The idea that all drugs are
firmly based in the evidence

514
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,959
and all of the non-drug treatments
are just a mixture of hope and delusion

515
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:59,919
and placebo effect and charlatans
just doesn't really stand up to examination.

516
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,122
For example,

517
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,627
in order for a drug to be licensed

518
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:12,708
it has to show that it is more effective
than a placebo in two trials.

519
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,080
This doesn't mean to say that the
drug company can't do lots of other trials

520
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,717
in which it doesn't prove to be more effective,
it just doesn't need to publish those.

521
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:24,422
What it needs to do is go along to the
regulator and say we have these two trials,

522
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,050
which show the drug is
more effective than a placebo.

523
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,758
Can we have a license to market it please?

524
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,330
<i>Now these are samples taken from</i>

525
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,868
<i>manufacturers batches of insulin
and antibiotic drugs.</i>

526
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,928
<i>We test them for purity and potency
before they are sold.</i>

527
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,403
<i>Of course new drugs are always coming along</i>

528
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,210
<i>and we make sure that they have
been tested and found to be safe</i>

529
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,110
<i>before they are put on the market.</i>

530
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,550
The doctors will tell you that
the drugs have been trialled

531
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,884
and tested but what you have to realize
when you take a new drug

532
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:02,859
is that you are essentially embarking
on an uncontrolled experiment.

533
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,231
The drugs will only have been tested,
for the purposes of getting their license,

534
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,395
on maybe a few hundred,
at the most a few thousand people

535
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,166
and they are then going to be
given to literally millions.

536
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,704
And within those millions of people there
is going to be an enormous range

537
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,873
of the way that their systems work,
the way that they react to the drugs

538
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,117
And so people are going to have side-effects.

539
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:31,419
There is also the fact that the problems
most people in the west face

540
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:38,025
are not really acute disorders,
which medicine is very good at dealing with,

541
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,864
but they are chronic disorders.

542
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:44,202
They are disorders like depression,
diabetes, heart, arthritis and so on.

543
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,738
They are things that don't kill you
they just make you rather miserable

544
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,265
and feel rather terrible and they go
on for a long period of time.

545
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,402
And these are the kind of conditions
that all of the drugs are targeted at

546
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,778
but they're the conditions that
the drugs don't treat very well.

547
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,148
Short term some of them are very life saving-
you need to have them.

548
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,159
Some of the corticoid steroids some of the
other things that everybody says no, no, no.

549
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,661
Short term, life saving - fine.

550
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,562
Antibiotics short term,
life saving - no problem.

551
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:19,125
I abhor having patients on
any long term medication

552
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,629
and there is almost no medication in the world
that you can't get patients off of.

553
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:29,710
The perfect drug from the point of view
of a drug company is one first of all,

554
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:35,152
that doesn't cure people because
people need to take the drug

555
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,189
for a long period of time in order for it to be profitable.

556
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:43,094
Secondly, are they the best way to
treat everything from the start

557
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,529
and the answer would seem very clearly to be not.

558
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:50,001
And so for a lot of the chronic conditions,
it seems to make a lot of sense to start off

559
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,837
by doing what you can with non-drug approaches.

560
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,974
Firstly because they are very unlikely
to have the same range of side effects

561
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,101
and secondly because in a number of cases

562
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,681
it looks as though they have better chance
of tackling the underlying problem

563
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,876
rather than simply dealing with the symptom.

564
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,979
Doctor Abram Hoffer worked with Bill W
the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous

565
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,589
and Bill W and Abram became good friends.

566
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,553
Bill W suffered from severe depression.

567
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,300
Abram said,
''You should take some Niacin''.

568
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,869
He suggested 3,000 mg of Niacin a day.

569
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,928
That was the end of Bill W's depression.

570
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:32,743
Bill W then suggested to people that were
alcoholic why don't you try taking Niacin

571
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,873
and see if it helps your depression,
see if it helps your alcoholism.

572
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,320
And the majority of the people that tried
the Niacin had great improvement.

573
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,919
So Bill W, founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),
wanted AA to use Niacin and vitamin therapy.

574
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,530
But AA, which had already been infiltrated,
I would say, is a good word

575
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,998
by the medical profession, rejected that.

576
00:38:55,533 --> 00:39:00,971
So to this day Alcoholics Anonymous
focuses on many laudable steps

577
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,342
alcoholics can and should do to stop drinking.

578
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,903
But it does not recommend vitamin therapy.

579
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,481
At the time when there was concern,

580
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:17,114
a growing concern about the issue of
whether the anti-depressant SSRI drugs

581
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:22,214
were causing suicide and there had
been a few campaigners in roundabout 2000

582
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,363
who had been saying there were
problems with these drugs

583
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,821
and the regulatory authorities and the
drug companies had been denying it.

584
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,236
We did a whole study on those
school shootings over in America.

585
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:37,196
And we studied a number of these
incidents and in most cases,

586
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,668
in most cases...

587
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,813
the shooter is either on or withdrawing
from these types of psychiatric medications

588
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,678
at the time that they commit these offences.

589
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,979
And yet none of this stuff really
comes out in the trials at all.

590
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,857
And an American researcher came up
with the fact that Prozac,

591
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,559
which was of course the brand leader at the time,

592
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,429
was about to come off patent and so they
wondered whether there was a new drug coming up.

593
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,301
And they did some research
and they found indeed there was,

594
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,338
there was a thing called Prozac R
and there had been some tinkering

595
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,932
with the molecular structure of it.

596
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,445
In order to produce a new drug you
have to say what the improvements

597
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:21,009
are going to be and in the patent application
for Prozac R it said will not cause

598
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:27,182
the suicidal thoughts and feelings,
which are associated with the existing drug.

599
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,551
Precisely the thing the drug company had
been denying was going on for the past 10 years.

600
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,192
I worked with a lady once who
was suicidally depressed.

601
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,804
She lived at home with her family.

602
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:44,575
She was in her 50's and she spent all day
sitting in a corner, face to the corner.

603
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,669
She wouldn't talk to anyone.
She wouldn't eat with anyone.

604
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,037
She was totally uncommunicative.

605
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,981
She was under the care of a psychiatrist,
of course, as she should be

606
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,315
and the psychiatrist had her on a variety
of medications, which you would expect.

607
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,580
The family was wondering about nutrition

608
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,390
and I mentioned to them about
Dr Hoffers work with Niacin

609
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:09,822
and they wondered how much she
needed to take, this person was very seriously ill.

610
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:15,127
And I mentioned that Dr Hoffer normally
gave about 3,000 mg a day of Niacin

611
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,366
but some people need a lot more
especially very sick people

612
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,674
and they should give her as much
as it takes to make her better.

613
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,480
Well they figured they could do that.

614
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:30,321
So at 11,500 mg of Niacin a day
she was sitting at the table and talking to them

615
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,016
like nothing had happened.

616
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,887
So they went to the psychiatrist,

617
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:39,495
showed the psychiatrist this recovered
person and the psychiatrist said,

618
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,963
''Well I don't think you should take
all that Niacin it might be harmful.''

619
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,825
So they stopped giving her the Niacin

620
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,004
and she was back in the corner.

621
00:41:50,875 --> 00:42:00,351
Safety with Niacin? There's not one death
from Niacin per year on average,

622
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,082
There have been one or two attributed
over the last 15 or 20 years.

623
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,815
But there is not even one death
per year from Niacin.

624
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,791
And how many people that are suicidally depressed

625
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,955
actually go and end their lives.

626
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:48,190
Two handfuls of cashews give you the therapeutic
equivalent of a prescription dose of Prozac.

627
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,522
Now everyone then says,

628
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,134
''Oh but two handfuls of cashews,
isn't that fattening?''

629
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,399
And my point is - do you care?

630
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,644
Do you want to get over the depression?

631
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,678
Were having a difficult time
accepting a simple therapy.

632
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,906
Here is what you can do.

633
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:10,988
If someone is depressed the first thing they
can do is know that it's okay to be depressed.

634
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,479
If you are malnourished
you should be depressed!

635
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,352
So don't do that anymore go and eat good food.

636
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:24,835
What's going on in the mind, in the brain -
whatever the mind is - can be influenced

637
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:30,831
by the nutrients, the chemicals going into it
and what is happening as well.

638
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:35,112
This is not to say that psychological
treatments aren't important, they are

639
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:41,118
but you can't get anywhere with a patient who's got
psychological and psychiatric symptomatology

640
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:45,214
if their brain is hungry, if it's starved,
or if it's poisoned.

641
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,691
There is a fact of life in medicine that if
I take your bone and measure it

642
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:56,690
you've got 5,000 times more lead in it than you
would've been if you'd been an Egyptian pharaoh.

643
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:03,898
If I take some fat samples you've still got
DDT, DDE and DDD in your fat samples

644
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,807
even though DDT has been
banned a long time ago.

645
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,073
As well as a whole range of other chemicals.

646
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,179
But does anybody want to hear about that? No.

647
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:20,615
And that has not yet registered
or if it has doctors simply refuse to do it

648
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:25,291
because everything they do is toxic,
every drug they use,

649
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,891
Prescription drugs, over the counter drugs

650
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:32,032
all drugs are liver toxic bar none.

651
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,884
Something like 79 million Americans

652
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,652
are getting mercury fillings

653
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,212
put in their mouths everyday right now.

654
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,053
Legally we are not supposed to say they are toxic
so I never mention that to patients.

655
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,392
But for a documentary, are they?

656
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,723
You betcha.

657
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,932
If I look at your brain and do a brain biopsy

658
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,635
I'll find a large amount of Mercury in your system

659
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,694
if you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth.

660
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,575
What makes amalgam and mercury
so much safer when you put it into a tooth

661
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:15,534
compared to when it's sitting
on a dentist's tray?

662
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,639
It’s highly toxic and the dentist has to handle it as
one of the most toxic substances known to man

663
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:25,121
but it's made safe when put into
your tooth. Which is nonsense.

664
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,725
Suffice it to say if you have it in your mouth
you are being poisoned by it.

665
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,058
End of story.

666
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:37,958
These toxins when you stop pushing them
into the system start to come out.

667
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:45,804
And actually if you now only change your
diet to the point of eating all organic

668
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,772
you are releasing all these poisons,
they go into the bloodstream

669
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:55,808
and into the liver and unless you help the
liver get rid of it you can cause new damage.

670
00:45:56,153 --> 00:46:03,150
It’sa mistake, it's half a therapy,
the other half of the therapy is detoxify.

671
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:07,089
Colonics, enemas, things that
help to move stuff out.

672
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,394
Herbs that help to move things out.

673
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,761
Water that helps to move things out.

674
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:15,163
These are critical factors in the cleansing equation

675
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:21,469
because our body's primary method of
cleansing and detoxification is through the bowels.

676
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:27,005
We have to get the toxins out to even
allow the nutrients to get into the tissues.

677
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,054
You can't get them in there
if they are full of poisons.

678
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,852
You can't get two things into one space.

679
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,327
The basic idea is, is you've got to start

680
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:43,323
by doing the simplest thing ever which is
upon rising drink lots of water.

681
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:49,194
As simple as that is it's amazing
how few people actually do that.

682
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,934
Drink a litre, two litres of water
before you have any food,

683
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,816
before you have any coffee, whatever tea,
whatever you start your morning with.

684
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,020
Drink, just straight water and then begin your day.

685
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,184
What we notice first is initially -
boom, things flow out.

686
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:13,791
My cousin lost 150 pounds in about
an 18-month period on our program...

687
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:18,557
Raw organic natural foods across the
selection we have been talking about.

688
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:23,662
And he actually moved all that toxicity
out of his body through his bowels.

689
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,176
Twelve bowel movements a day.

690
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,976
One day he lost 15 pounds in one day.

691
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:36,053
That is really interesting but really difficult
to talk about to the general public

692
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,656
because when we think of weight loss
we think were going to go work out

693
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:43,927
and convert it into muscle and sweat it off
but actually in this day and age

694
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,863
with the toxicity that's in the average
fat cell of the average person

695
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,500
you don't want to move that
stuff out through your skin.

696
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,435
You want to get it out through
your bowels as quickly as possible.

697
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,445
The big problem with cancer research is that
the public is lead to believe

698
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,548
that the cancer breakthrough
is around the next corner.

699
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:09,508
Look at any newspaper most weeks
and there will be a story in there - new cancer cure.

700
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,823
And yet when you stand back and
look at what's actually happening

701
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,893
your relatives continue to die,
my relatives continue to die,

702
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,829
the cancer breakthrough turns out to be
just another drug that causes cancer

703
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,797
because most of these chemos are themselves
carcinogens that's the whole point

704
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:28,705
these are cell toxins they're designed to
poison tumor cells so they don't replicate.

705
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,474
So the big mistake that is happening here

706
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,911
is that the cancer industry is continuing
to view the tumor as the cancer

707
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,344
and we know the tumor is not the cancer
because if the tumor were the cancer

708
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,585
that would mean that we could cut
the tumors out of the human body

709
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,610
and they would never grow back
and we know that's not true

710
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,424
we know these tumors can and
do grow back and the reason they grow back

711
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,587
is you have not corrected
the underlying metabolic process.

712
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:55,888
<i>Cancer is one of the most deadly
and elusive enemies ever faced by man.</i>

713
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,005
<i>Once cancerous cells appear they soon
develop into a clump of tissue</i>

714
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,940
<i>that lives at the expense of the entire body.</i>

715
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:11,744
<i>This tissue crowds and robs nourishment
from other cells, tissues or organs.</i>

716
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:20,113
There's a lot of people that are beginning to
realize that conventional medicine just does not work.

717
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,859
The AMA (American Medical Association) themselves said

718
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:31,234
that for cancer specifically independent of the stage
that the patient comes to the doctors office

719
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:35,500
whether it's stage 1 or 4,
most cancers are divided into 4 stages-

720
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:45,010
Independent of the stage that the patient
first arrives less than 30% survive 5 years

721
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,879
using chemo, surgery or radiation.

722
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,985
That means that more than 70% of them die.

723
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,450
That is just not acceptable.

724
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,459
<i>What chance do I really have doctor?</i>

725
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,190
<i>Marshall...</i>

726
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,198
<i>I have no desire to mislead you</i>

727
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,569
<i>I am sure you realize that recovery
is not a sure thing, but... </i>

728
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,465
<i>... if we can go through surgery
as quickly aspossible</i>

729
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,669
<i>I believe you have a good chance at recovery.</i>

730
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:22,819
We have the precedent set by
Dr Max Gerson back in the 1930's and 1940's

731
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:28,257
who showed that vitamins and especially
large quantities of fresh vegetable juices

732
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,552
and organic foods would help to reverse cancer

733
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:37,689
and Gerson had about a 50% cure rate
with terminally ill patients -

734
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,562
that's extremely high.

735
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:43,228
With malignant melanoma,
the Gerson Therapy is spectacular.

736
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:49,006
That in itself is enough reason for every physician
to learn about the Gerson Therapy - but they don't.

737
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,878
Medical school does not talk
about these alternatives.

738
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,066
Normal human body has

739
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,624
powerful defenses

740
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,726
to the point where cancer is impossible.

741
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,672
The human body has such powerful defenses

742
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:57,714
that a normal healthy body cannot,
will not, develop cancer

743
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,740
or any other chronic disease for that matter.

744
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:07,746
Not only that but with good
healthy normal rich organic food

745
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:12,087
you can reverse these diseases,
and that's what we do.

746
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,565
So if you want to reverse cancer
what you really got to do

747
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:19,536
is get in there and wreck the internal environment
that cancer depends on to thrive

748
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,238
and that's how these clinics are doing it.

749
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,908
What they are not doing is loading loads of
chemotherapy, and radiation and toxicity

750
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,777
into the body to create more problems
for the immune system,

751
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:31,448
which is already weakened, and vulnerable -
that's why the person has got cancer.

752
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,385
And as G. Edward Griffin says if you
want to give somebody cancer...

753
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,046
...give them chemotherapy.

754
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,587
because those chemotherapies are themselves
carcinogens most of the time.

755
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,594
I receive thousands of phone calls a year
and not a few of those

756
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:49,599
are coming from people who went through all
the best medicine that hospitals could give them

757
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,328
and the tumors kept growing back...

758
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,801
and when they said;
''Why do I keep getting this cancer back?''

759
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,666
doctors said; ''We don't know -
in fact we don't really know what causes cancer.''

760
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,778
I mean we've known for 60 years!

761
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,813
In fact we have known since professor John Beard

762
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,083
of Edinburgh University wrote his thesis in 1904,

763
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,551
that cancer is a healing process that hasn't switched off.

764
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:14,520
But you see again it comes back to, it's not that
the drug industry is selectively lying to people

765
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,525
they're just not covering the issues the way
they should be covering it.

766
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:21,662
A classic example is the way they've
manipulated the survival rates.

767
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,596
The word ''survive'' you know
you'll hear an advert which says;

768
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,838
''Well now, give to this charity, we are now
seeing that eighty percent of women

769
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,007
are surviving breast cancer.''
And yet what they have done is

770
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,535
they've redefined the word ''survive'' to mean
only five years after initial treatment.

771
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:40,784
So take my aunt - my aunt got cancer, she is
forever immortalized as a cancer survivor

772
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:44,185
'cause she survived the five years
but she died six months later.

773
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,747
So she is cured and dead.

774
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:58,268
In 1972 our then President Nixon stated

775
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:02,602
that if we throw enough money at this
cancer problem we will solve it.

776
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,841
We were able to put a man on the moon

777
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,708
and we ought to be able to solve the problem.

778
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,146
<i>Together we can hardly fail</i>

779
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:13,216
<i>for there is no force on Earth to
match the will and spirit</i>

780
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,911
<i>of the people of America.</i>

781
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:24,493
And in 1972 he agreed to make
a great deal of money available.

782
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,789
That year, 220,000 Americans died of cancer.

783
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,036
Exactly twenty-five years later,

784
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,474
USA Today, the big newspaper,

785
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,442
I think it was also in Newsweek,

786
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:43,912
published the figures of what actually did happen.

787
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,717
What happened was the US government;

788
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:57,490
us taxpayers put out over
39 billion US dollars for research on cancer.

789
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:04,730
The result was twenty-five years later in 1996

790
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:11,571
560,000 people died of cancer, more than double!

791
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,841
The five year or better survival rate
for almost all forms of cancer

792
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:21,379
is unchanged for the last four decades.
That's pretty sad.

793
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,920
<i>Cancer remains man's number two killer,</i>

794
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,659
<i>second only to heart disease.</i>

795
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,686
<i>Little wonder that a victim of cancer
like Mr. Marshall feels depressed.</i>

796
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,801
You see the thing about a war,
and this is a cancer war -

797
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,666
wars are only profitable when
you are fighting them.

798
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:44,774
Let's face it, if cancer disappeared tomorrow,
millions of people would have to retrain.

799
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:49,507
I mean this is a 200 billion dollar a year industry
that you are going to have to dismantle

800
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,273
if the truth ever came out
about what we would need to do.

801
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,960
A lot of people ask, you know,
why I am in Mexico?

802
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,257
That's precisely why.

803
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:11,324
I am an American citizen, I live in San Diego,
my kids went to school here,

804
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:17,664
I would love to be able to do what I believe
is correct in the country of my birth.

805
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,635
My patients, a lot of them come from the US.

806
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:27,050
They would like to be able to do what is
in their opinion a good program

807
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:32,589
to cure their disease problem in their countries
of birth whether that be Australia,

808
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,887
whether that be New Zealand,
whether that be Canada,

809
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,018
England, the US it doesn't matter.

810
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,559
Unfortunately, we can't until we
get the health care laws changed.

811
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:47,728
The war against cancer has been fought
with one arm behind the back

812
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,807
and I would never go into the ring with the
heavyweight champion of the world

813
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,134
and fight with one arm.

814
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:59,409
And yet by restricting cancer research and
cancer treatment to basically

815
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,441
drug,

816
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,752
surgery,

817
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,485
radiation approaches

818
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,528
and not considering nutrition seriously

819
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,291
we have done a terrible disservice
to all these people.

820
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,165
So it's not that people are lying,

821
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:19,469
it's not that everybody who works in the
cancer industry is somehow an evil and wicked person.

822
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,770
What we look at here

823
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,262
is we are seeing that a lot of people
are doing what they believe is best.

824
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,843
You can be sincere and
you can be sincerely wrong.

825
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,680
The good news is we change that today.

826
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,083
One of the few free choices a person has
is what they will or will not eat.

827
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:39,789
So we have to make sure that we are
looking at doing everything possible

828
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,486
to build the body up and not break it down.
That makes all the sense in the world, doesn't it?

829
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,121
You should do everything you possibly can
and stack the deck in your favour

830
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:52,733
and that means building the
immune system nutritionally

831
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,070
and using vitamins to help the body fight the disease

832
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:00,007
because being malnourished
can't possibly help you beat cancer.

833
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:05,437
<i>In males the digestive tract is
most frequently afflicted with cancer.</i>

834
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,150
Colon cancer is a good place to start

835
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,448
because it's not very easy to treat.

836
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,957
Colon cancer is a very serious disease and
I would say its 100% preventable

837
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:22,699
by having a high fiber diet and
avoiding things that we know that aggravate cancer

838
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:27,193
such as certain additives, food preservatives,
environmental chemicals

839
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,969
they could be a cause of any number of cancers.

840
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:36,446
The Japanese who live in Japan and
eat the standard Japanese diet,

841
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:41,941
live the standard Japanese lifestyle,
have the lowest incidence of cancer in the world.

842
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:47,579
And it's believed that the low incidence
is due to the high intake of seafood

843
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,750
including fish and sea vegetables.

844
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:58,830
With that diet there is a high intake of
trace elements like selenium, zinc and germanium

845
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:02,338
and a whole range of other
anti cancer trace elements.

846
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,977
There is also a high intake of the Omega 3
fish oils which are protective as well

847
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,912
not only for cancers but
heart disease and Alzheimer's.

848
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,174
And they also drink green tea

849
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:19,785
and green tea has got a range of chemicals
to protect us against cancer as well

850
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,684
protect our cells and our genes and so on.

851
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:28,152
In the female cancers of the breast
and the uterus are the most prevalent.

852
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,534
You take a Japanese woman from Japan

853
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,836
where the incidence of breast cancer is very low

854
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:38,541
and transplant her into America
and she changes her lifestyle

855
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,912
the incidence of cancer then starts creeping up
to that of the American woman,

856
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,176
which is round about 13% now.

857
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:52,284
So 13% of females in America are at risk,
will get cancer of the breast.

858
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,383
Japanese are less than 1%.

859
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,926
<i>We doctors are improving our techniques.</i>

860
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,891
<i>No individual is alone in the fight against cancer.</i>

861
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:07,297
<i>Research workers are finding and
reporting more and more facts.</i>

862
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,006
<i>We will conquer cancer.</i>

863
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,946
When we look at high doses of
Vitamin C given intravenously

864
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,582
as an actual chemotherapeutic agent,

865
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,619
we have wonderful uplifting news

866
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,555
for every cancer patient in the world.

867
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:33,363
And it's easy and safe - and did I say
inexpensive? - to have a physician give an IV.

868
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,887
You just have to insist on it.

869
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,500
I believe in the next ten years
this will become more accepted

870
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,931
but people with cancer can't afford to wait

871
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:47,143
and the ones that are already dead have been
grossly mistreated by the medical profession

872
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,046
and by the government that is supposedly
supposed to encourage

873
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,916
free research and development of all possibilities.

874
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:58,521
So when you come along and say instead
of treating cancer with chemotherapy

875
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:04,858
you can give intravenous Vitamin C
30... 60... 100,000 mg a day

876
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:10,891
directly into the blood stream,
and that will kill cancer cells.

877
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:15,338
Vitamin C at that high dose is
selectively toxic to cancer cells

878
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,474
and that's exactly what chemotherapy
is but with Vitamin C

879
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:22,706
there's no damage to healthy cells
and people don't get nauseous,

880
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,412
they don't lose their hair

881
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,009
all they do is get better.

882
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,686
We pushed the dose up to 40,000 mg, 50,000 mg,

883
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,487
60,000 mg,

884
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,422
we pushed the dose up to 100,000 mg,

885
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,425
we even went to 200,000 mg,

886
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:43,232
we nearly got to a quarter of a kilo, IVin 24 hours.

887
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:48,626
No adverse events, no adverse side-effects
apart from thirst

888
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,805
and feeling a little bit woozy in the head.

889
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:55,034
Now that's with huge amounts of Vitamin C

890
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:59,806
the substances that were meant to cause
kidney stones if you took 100 mg.

891
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:03,886
Now we wonder; why isn't this being done?

892
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,253
because the next assumption is,
if this were so good

893
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,150
my doctor would already know about it,

894
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,892
if this were so good

895
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,723
it would be on television,

896
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,058
if this were so good

897
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,965
it would be taught in medical school
and that's another one of those assumptions.

898
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:23,528
Why would you want to teach
about vitamins in medical school?

899
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,733
Why would medical doctors who
studied medicine and practice medicine

900
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:31,445
and are heavily funded by
pharmaceutical companies

901
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,816
why would they go and look into vitamins?

902
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,552
The pharmaceutical companies are
not going to advocate vitamins,

903
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,610
that's not going to work.

904
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,490
The government doesn't know
anything that it isn't told

905
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,722
by the pharmaceutical companies and
other lobbies and by medical lobbies.

906
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,064
The people don't know because they had an education

907
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,828
that never had the word orthomolecular in it.

908
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,601
Dr Hugh Reardon said that orthomolecular,

909
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,473
which is therapeutic nutrition,
orthomolecular medicine

910
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:02,069
is not the answer to any question
posed in medical school.

911
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:07,839
So what you're set here with is
two divergent views on health care

912
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:13,244
and whenever you have that you have
what we are experiencing today,

913
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,325
an impossible dichotomy.

914
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,290
When you talk to people about using
high dose Vitamin C for cancer

915
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,824
and then you tell them that it's been heavily tested,

916
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,858
even the National Institutes of Health
are showing that this is working.

917
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:33,297
Dr Reardon's team has been doing this
for twenty-five years or more now.

918
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,547
I’ve seen for thirty years that high doses of vitamins

919
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,005
greatly improve a cancer patient's quality of life

920
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,842
and greatly improve a cancer patient's length of life.

921
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:50,693
And there's many, many places in
the literature where you can look

922
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:56,290
and find support for high dose nutrient therapy
to arrest or even reverse cancer

923
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,868
It’s an impossible question.

924
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,570
Why isn't it being done?

925
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:05,241
And the answer of course is
until enough people complain

926
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,401
<i>laughs</i>

927
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:07,735
it won't be done.

928
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,910
But if everyone demands
nutritional therapy it will change.

929
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:15,918
Right now if you want nutritional therapy
and you go to your doctor and ask for it

930
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,718
its sort of like ordering chow me in
in a French restaurant.

931
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,057
It’s not on the menu,
and they don't know how to make it,

932
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,559
and you're not going to get it.

933
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:30,189
You have a right to self-care and self help.

934
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,902
We need to again teach the regulators,

935
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:38,704
the politicians, the doctors and get to the
universities and the people training in medicine

936
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:44,104
to understand that there are plants
with anti-cancer properties,

937
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:48,317
there are plants with anti-nausea
and anti-vomiting properties,

938
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,478
there are plants that will help with rashes,

939
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,724
there are plants that will help with
headaches and tiredness

940
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,715
that occur as a result of chemotherapy.

941
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,084
<i>Mom listen....</i>

942
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,731
<i>Now I am sure that those government people
are experts at their work.</i>

943
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,325
<i>But ever since I have been taking
Mr Kahumana's tea</i>

944
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,835
<i>I’ve felt simply wonderful!</i>

945
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,360
<i>Why, I never knew that a remedy
could be so effective.</i>

946
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,238
<i>Why I haven't been having my usual attacks at all.</i>

947
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:15,566
<i>Now why is that if it isn't because
of Mr Kahumana's tea?</i>

948
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:23,545
What if they gave everyone in America
free health insurance and no one needed it?

949
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,251
There's a lot of debate over how we
should finance and change

950
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,521
provide health care to everyone in the United States.

951
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:36,065
Most civilized countries do have a
national program of health care

952
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,534
guaranteeing health care for pretty much everybody.

953
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,703
The United States is conspicuously absent.

954
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:44,764
We have 30 maybe 40 million people
that are uninsured in the United States.

955
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:47,168
That's getting some attention as it rightly should.

956
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:53,079
But is the solution to simply give them access
to a system that doesn't work very well?

957
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:59,677
Or would it be a good idea to
teach them how to be healthy?

958
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:04,792
I think they need education and not medication.

959
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:11,765
People need to be made aware of the
great benefit of improving their health

960
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:15,428
if they've got a cancer or
whatever disease they've got.

961
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:20,498
We are at a stage now where there is a major change
in what's happening with medicine,

962
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:25,915
which is that medicine no longer
has a lock on all the information,

963
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,542
the internet has changed that.

964
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:34,784
And as more and more and more of our population
start taking their health into their own hands.

965
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,426
There's going to be even more and more of a change,

966
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,728
it can't go on the way it is.

967
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,593
I mean the system right now is falling apart.

968
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:47,937
We must make nutrition the primary prevention
strategy for the population

969
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:51,964
and we have to be as zealous on nutrition
as we are apparently on global warming.

970
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,299
What we need to be able to do is to persuade the public

971
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:59,248
that you are what you eat,
food can change your mood,

972
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,784
that you are everything you
have ever done to yourself

973
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:05,221
and the choices you make directly
affect the outcome of your life.

974
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,924
And it might be easy enough to forget that
right now when your 21 years old

975
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:12,228
and very, very fit and healthy eating badly

976
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,965
but it all looks a lot different when get
into your 40's, 50's and 60's

977
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,567
and start to go down with a
serious degenerative illness.

978
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,737
We've still got a health system which
really is a disease care system

979
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:26,504
and dominated by doctors and hospitals,
pathologists, and pharmacologists.

980
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:31,647
And that sort of a system is going to look after itself,

981
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:36,243
it wants more work and is truly not interested in
reducing the amount of illness and disease.

982
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:42,084
The more work they get the more profit there is
and so that's part of the medical industry

983
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,552
and it does need to be there,
it's very, very important.

984
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,254
The medical industry does get a lot of things right.

985
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,792
Infant survivability at birth - brilliant.

986
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,101
A&E (Accident & Emergency) trauma medicine - brilliant.

987
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,572
God forbid you get smashed up on a motorway
and they have to put you back together again

988
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,107
they're very good at doing that.

989
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,098
Disease - pathetic.

990
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,170
The medical profession has it wrong.

991
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:07,808
Even the medical schools that offer nutrition
do not offer mega dose nutrition.

992
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:17,560
Even the medical schools that have courses in
alternative medicine are not really focusing on it.

993
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,790
I believe they are just giving it a nod.

994
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,367
The answer is for every person to realize that
if you want something done right

995
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,857
you have to do it yourself.

996
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,370
You have to read. You have to dig.

997
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,506
You have to want to have this information
and of course I might add

998
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:37,940
you have to be willing to actually take the vitamins
and actually juice the vegetables.

999
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,308
You have to walk the walk.

1000
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:47,857
And anybody who is watching this right now
has at some level made a choice

1001
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:52,862
that they want to do something that is going to
improve their lives, their families lives,

1002
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,831
their kids lives and the life of the planet itself.

1003
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,096
And the life of all the plants and everything.

1004
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:04,099
If that is our choice then our
food choices must correlate with that

1005
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:08,043
because if you've ever flown in a plane
and you look out the window of the plane

1006
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:11,308
and you see what's down there you'll see its all farms.

1007
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,951
The primary way that we are interacting
with our planet is through agriculture

1008
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:20,956
and if we change our food choices,
we change agriculture and all of a sudden

1009
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:26,962
we shift away from for example corn, wheat, soy diets

1010
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:32,134
over to super food diets and
organic diets and raw food diets

1011
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:37,868
and we shift the whole way that
we literally interact with the planet.

1012
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:41,966
The number one thing we are doing
on this planet is growing things.

1013
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:46,741
In spite of all the chemical controlled
giant agricultural businesses

1014
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:48,910
were still growing stuff.

1015
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,449
We could grow genetically modified corn

1016
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,917
or we could grow the most
extraordinary goji berries in the world.

1017
01:09:55,090 --> 01:10:00,050
There's a lot more turning to alternatives

1018
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:05,589
because what's being done beforehand
doesn't work, it just doesn't work.

1019
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:11,173
When I look cancer rates going up,
heart disease going up, stroke going up,

1020
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,768
Alzheimer's and senile dementia and
cognitive impairment going up...

1021
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,540
A change is due. Clearly the old ways aren't working

1022
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:21,981
and what we need to do, we need a fresh paradigm
and we need to go back to basics.

1023
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:26,283
And basics is all about going back to look at these
cultures who don't get these problems.

1024
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,013
In the same way if you want to be a millionaire,
go talk to a millionaire

1025
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,996
don't talk to the guy down at the pub
still recovering from the last golden opportunity.

1026
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,799
Go find these people who are living
a hundred years routinely

1027
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,802
without cancer, heart disease and see if
you can figure out how they are doing it

1028
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:43,973
and we've done that work, we have done
that science its been done over the last hundred years

1029
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:45,565
and its been completely ignored.

1030
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:50,179
The very first course I ever taught was in 1976

1031
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,080
and it was called forgotten research in medicine

1032
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,617
and I am doing the same thing to this day.

1033
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:05,160
I feel very strongly that the best doctor in the world,

1034
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,720
the best nutritionist in the world

1035
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,559
is you.

1036
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:14,062
You actually have everything inside of you,
all of the equipment necessary

1037
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,930
to feel if something is right for you or not.

1038
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:21,099
The good news is that people
are not a bunch of dummies.

1039
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,679
Abraham Lincoln expressed that when he said,

1040
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,981
''You can fool some of the people all the time,

1041
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,915
and all of the people some of the time,

1042
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,253
but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.''

1043
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:36,714
And that's why over half of the population
now takes vitamins even though

1044
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:41,126
most doctors would say that its really not necessary.

1045
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:45,829
We have a public that's catching on
quicker than the medical professions.

1046
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,568
In a way it's sad but in a way it's great.

1047
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,971
People should stop being patients
and start being people.

1048
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,377
Why not be healthy and happy? Why not?

1049
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,779
You change your life, you do some exercise,
you eat right,

1050
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,784
you feel better, alright that's good,

1051
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,821
you look better, alright that's good,

1052
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,356
you live longer, that's good,

1053
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,153
you save money, that's good

1054
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:14,061
and you have the enormous satisfaction
of having done it yourself.

1055
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,133
People think; ''I don't have a medical education,
I can't know this.''

1056
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,999
Oh please! How complicated is it to eat right
and drink vegetable juice sand exercise?

1057
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,841
You don't need any degree to know that.

1058
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,768
It’s too simple to work.

1059
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:34,349
It’s cheap, it's simple, it's safe, it's effective.

1060
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:38,078
The biggest single reason why
people aren't doing this

1061
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:43,282
is that it requires taking responsibility

1062
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,655
and that is the only way out.

1063
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:53,068
When we choose raw, organic plant based foods
we take our power back

1064
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:56,231
and we decide that we are going to have quality

1065
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:01,310
and that we are not going to suffer
from some 50 ingredients

1066
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,279
that are in there of chemicals
we've never even heard of before.

1067
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:10,041
I am not a big advocate of preaching vegetarianism
to everybody or veganism or even rawfoodism.

1068
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:17,059
But we do know for a fact that an 80% raw,
organic plant based diet

1069
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:22,064
that covers all the different facets of
fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seaweeds,

1070
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:29,869
sprouts, grasses, super foods and
herbs is a massively valuable part

1071
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:35,032
of a healthy and wonderfully abundant lifestyle.

1072
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:41,048
There is no magic bullet; there is no mono therapy
that cures cancer, that cures heart disease.

1073
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,909
But there is a lifestyle change

1074
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:51,348
that prevents, arrests, and
reverses serious chronic disease.

1075
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,997
The solutions are here;
they've always been here.

1076
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,465
The only thing that's left is just the education,

1077
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,832
because I am convinced that once people know
what the solution is they'll act on it.

1078
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,534
They will decide - yep, were doing it.
