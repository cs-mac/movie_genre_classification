1
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,406
<i>State your name for the record.</i>

2
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,107
<i>Dennis Gray.</i>

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,875
- Where were you born?
- Toledo, Ohio.

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,717
- What year?
- '48.

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,020
And where did you attend school?

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,656
St. Charles grade school,

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,662
Central Catholic high school.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,859
And what did you do after graduating
from high school?

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,767
I went into seminary - St. Gregory, Cincinnati.

10
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,670
Why did you decide to go into the seminary?

11
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,837
I decided that it would be a good life
if I was a priest.

12
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,843
See that.

13
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,286
We just got back from a fire. It was fun.

14
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,417
Little attic fire. Wasn't much, but I'm filthy.

15
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,489
This is the infamous fire pole.

16
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,523
Every little kid's dream.

17
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,466
- Tony!
- Yeah?

18
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,734
Fire safety. Time to go!

19
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,071
Anyhow, time to go.

20
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,076
Any of you know what monsters look like?

21
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,813
- They're slimy.
- Are they slimy?

22
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,084
- Are they really big?
- They have 10,000 eyes.

23
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,524
A lot of eyes? They got blinking stuff on them?

24
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,025
What I want to show you is that
what you might think a monster looks like,

25
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:23,229
is a lot what a fireman looks like
when he comes to your house at night.

26
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,567
OK, more or less like a monster?

27
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,505
No!

28
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,303
If you put the neck on.

29
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,607
- What about now?
- Now!

30
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,273
What about now? Look. Am I a monster?

31
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,408
No!

32
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,080
This is me coming into my neighborhood
every day for the last six months.

33
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,618
This is a nice park - one of the big things
that attracted us to the neighborhood.

34
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,924
Right in there, there's a walking trail,

35
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,898
public grade school's way back in there.

36
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,991
It's like living in the forest.

37
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,336
Hi, honey. Your hair looks great.

38
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,001
Thanks!

39
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,937
Mitch. Hey, Sam.

40
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,907
You guys go in the family room.

41
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,913
What makes it all worth it, right there.

42
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,079
Hey, Daddy, I can do somersaults.

43
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,589
- You can?
- Yeah. Watch.

44
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,182
All right.

45
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,427
Salt of the earth.

46
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,530
Mitchel? You gotta go to bed.

47
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,397
Remember that secret
you were gonna tell Mommy?

48
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,708
Here, Mitchel.

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,583
Go. Go fast. She won't even see you.

50
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,780
- <i>Tell me about Tony Comes.</i>
- <i>Just a friend.</i>

51
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,810
<i>A good friend?</i>

52
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,316
<i>He was a friend.</i>

53
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,327
- <i>And how did you know Tony?</i>
- <i>He was from school.</i>

54
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,124
- What school?
- Central.

55
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:01,259
- As a student?
- Correct. And as a fireman.

56
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,596
You knew him when he was a child, right?

57
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,161
Teenager.

58
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,673
And you ever take him out to the cottage?

59
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,938
He would come up different times.

60
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,670
He'd usually drive himself.

61
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,214
What kind of relationship did you
have with Tony?

62
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,582
More of a counselor.

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,552
He got us out of a lot of trouble.
He got me out of a lot of trouble.

64
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,457
You're late for class, you go to his office.

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,527
He did a lot of fun shit. He took you
to the racetrack, he took you to...

66
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,558
He took me out to eat.

67
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:41,630
In a family of seven kids, we didn't
eat out much. McDonald's was a big deal.

68
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,675
He'd pick on you.
His constant comment to me was,

69
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,205
"Comes, you're the only person I know
that would fuck up a wet dream."

70
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,377
At the time, it was, "Ha-ha, funny."

71
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,877
Now it's, OK, he mentions "wet dream."

72
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,050
And he said it all the time.

73
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,391
Was this part of some conditioning process?

74
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:07,058
It screws with you to the point where
you wonder, "How much was I manipulated,

75
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,159
"and at what point did I graduate

76
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,968
"to the 'Now it's appropriate
to fucking try something with this kid'?"

77
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,133
Did the church ever provide you, or any
of the Catholic schools at which you taught,

78
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:23,638
any guidelines as to what conduct was
considered to be inappropriate with a minor?

79
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,014
No.

80
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,613
Did they ever advise you as to when, if at all,

81
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,454
- child abuse should be reported?
- No.

82
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,552
Did they ever advise you when, if at all,

83
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,758
sexual contact with a minor
should be reported or to whom?

84
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,629
Nope.

85
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,501
The place I was first molested

86
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,637
is the rectory at St. Joseph.

87
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,750
Every day I gotta go to my psychologist's
office, I gotta drive by this place.

88
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,621
An invitation to Denny Gray's cottage was...

89
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,224
That was where it was at.

90
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,199
You could smoke, you could drink,

91
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,258
rake a pile of leaves 12 foot high,

92
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,362
dump a half a can of gas on it and light it,
and nobody gives a shit.

93
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,066
It was fucking cool.

94
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,707
And once I started getting abused,
for one reason or another,

95
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,805
I convinced myself
that that was still the better option.

96
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,518
Which I don't quite get.

97
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,347
Did you ever put your penis
in the mouths of any students

98
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,020
- when you were at central Catholic?
- Objection. Fifth amendment. Do not answer.

99
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,995
Did you ever put the penises
of any of your students in your mouth...

100
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,161
- Same objection.
- ...while at Central Catholic?

101
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,034
Do not answer.

102
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,033
Did you ever put your penis in the anus
of any of your students...

103
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,012
- Continuing objection.
- ...while you were at Central Catholic?

104
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,174
Continuing objection. Do not answer.

105
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:09,143
If you can imagine laying there
as still as can be, just...

106
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,513
I was asleep and then, as I came to,

107
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,851
I was like, "Oh..."

108
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,329
Realized what was happening

109
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,096
and just kept my eyes closed

110
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,233
and waited for it to be done.

111
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,706
And by done, I mean done.

112
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,169
It's like there's a siren going off in your head

113
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,612
"this is not happening, this is not happening,"

114
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,613
yet, the reality that it is happening

115
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,053
and you're trying to figure out why
and what the hell do I do?

116
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,889
And being so confounded that you do nothing,

117
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,018
that you just fucking freeze.

118
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,902
And then the shame, after,

119
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,464
or now, at 20, or you know, 33 years old,

120
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,773
that I didn't sit up and just fucking punch him
square in the face.

121
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,676
You know?

122
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,214
You're still feeling yucky?

123
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,285
- Your teeth hurt?
- Yes.

124
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,313
Yeah?

125
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,685
So what do I need to ask Grandma?

126
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,430
- To check my teeth.
- Check your teeth for what?

127
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,924
To make it... to see if it's better?

128
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,730
- To see if it'll get better?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,037
What do you think is wrong?

130
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,476
When I was lying in bed, it started hurting.

131
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,208
When you were sleeping
it started hurting?

132
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,910
Does the cold water make it hurt more?

133
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,781
Open your mouth. OK.

134
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,017
Is there blood on my hand?

135
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,052
Breathe.

136
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,529
Can you breathe? Breathe.

137
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,593
Take a sip.

138
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,802
<i>One of the reasons</i>
<i>that I fell in love with Tony...</i>

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,705
<i>Sorry, I'm not exactly centered.</i>

140
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,776
One of the reasons that I fell in love
with Tony was...

141
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:26,451
because he really did wear
his heart on his sleeve.

142
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:31,422
And unlike a lot of men, he was
very comfortable sharing his feelings

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,989
about me, about life...

144
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,594
Which was the complete opposite of me.

145
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,704
By the time we were married,
I had found out that Tony had been abused.

146
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,770
It was the first moment I had heard
Dennis Gray's name.

147
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,678
And I never knew.

148
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,445
Sorry. Trying not to cry.

149
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,647
I never knew how deeply...

150
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,422
that name would be ingrained
in our lives forever.

151
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,199
<i>Tony and I had bought a new house</i>

152
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,896
<i>and I remember...</i>

153
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,464
<i>we'd been here a couple of days</i>

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,202
<i>and I was out shopping</i>
<i>for things for the house.</i>

155
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,972
My cell phone rang and it was Tony,
and he said,

156
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,572
"You're not going to believe
who lives five houses down from us."

157
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,815
And I said, "Who?"

158
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,916
He said, "Dennis Gray."

159
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,757
<i>It was a horrible summer.</i>

160
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,572
Daddy! Dad!

161
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,478
I can jump on the jungle gym!

162
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,386
I gotta watch out!

163
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,052
Daddy!

164
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,272
<i>Because of the situation,</i>

165
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:28,203
<i>we had to tell our daughter</i>
<i>what had happened to Tony.</i>

166
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,211
What's going on?

167
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,383
You think something's up?

168
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,319
You know how Mom and Dad tell you...

169
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,628
to cross your legs when you sit down

170
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,159
and don't let other people see your underwear,

171
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,662
your privates are your privates
and if somebody touches you there,

172
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,699
tell a big person.

173
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,502
Well...

174
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,945
a long time ago,

175
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,045
when Daddy was a little bit older
than you are,

176
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,383
somebody did that to Daddy.

177
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,414
To me.

178
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,619
And today...

179
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,930
the person who hurt Daddy a long time ago,

180
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,458
Daddy saw that person.

181
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,494
And he lives right on this street.

182
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,708
And right now, I don't know what
that's gonna mean...

183
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,744
but what I want to tell you

184
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,047
is that Daddy's gonna be OK.

185
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,349
But I need to tell you so you understand,

186
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,053
cos you're big enough to understand now,

187
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,553
that I don't want you...

188
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,624
to hate this person,

189
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,067
because I hate him enough for me,

190
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,764
and hating somebody's not a good thing.

191
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,834
I also don't want you
talking to this person ever.

192
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,006
If you fall down and scrape your knee
on your bike

193
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,676
and this person comes up to help you,

194
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,708
you tell him to get away.

195
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,886
Do you understand what Daddy told you?

196
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,585
- You understand what I told you?
- I want to make sure you understand.

197
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:25,996
This man touched me on my penis...

198
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,022
A long time ago.

199
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,227
A long time ago, when he was little.

200
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,296
- A long, long time ago.
- But it still hurts.

201
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,276
But it still hurts.
It doesn't hurt like l-pinch-you hurt.

202
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,800
It hurts in here.

203
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,439
We didn't know this man lived on this street.

204
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,814
We didn't know he lived down the street
when we moved here.

205
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,785
I didn't know until today.

206
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,288
If I did, we wouldn't live here.

207
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,278
How would you decide which students to invite

208
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,117
- to Crystal Lake?
- There was no pattern.

209
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,680
Did you have any specific parameters?

210
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,955
- No.
- Any guidelines you would follow?

211
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,287
No.

212
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,959
Did you have any rules for the students

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,094
that were visiting with you at Crystal Lake?

214
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,262
Just act like gentlemen.

215
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,743
Did you have any rules that prohibited them
from drinking?

216
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,913
Yes, I told them, "You cannot drink."

217
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,940
- Pardon?
- I always told them,

218
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:56,182
"If I go to bed, you watch games or TV,
or something,

219
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,088
"but don't touch the beer or booze."

220
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,490
Was there beer or booze in the cottage?

221
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,394
I always had a bottle of Scotch or some beer.

222
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,381
It's the first time I've been back in...

223
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,348
Since the last time I was up here
in high school.

224
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,823
It's been a hell of a long time.

225
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,290
The same sheets and everything. Jesus.

226
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,063
What happened at the cottage stayed
at the cottage. That was the general rule.

227
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,540
I'd like to burn this fucking place down
if I could.

228
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,634
We'd come up here
and drink, eat, shoot pool.

229
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,271
The part where it gets weird

230
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,976
is Sunday morning, wake up
and some guy's sucking your dick.

231
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,045
A fucking half hour later, you take a shower,

232
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,488
and a half hour after that,
everybody who's here,

233
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,016
sometimes families included,
are sitting around the living room

234
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,120
and Denny's sitting there, saying Mass

235
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,960
cos it was Sunday.

236
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,263
So, here this guy just got done violating you

237
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,365
and now he's going,
"Body of Christ. Body of Christ."

238
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,135
It was fucked up beyond
the point that you would...

239
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,110
It was too screwed up to question.

240
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,984
<i>His bedroom was 20 feet</i>
<i>right inside that door.</i>

241
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,452
<i>I was just laying there...</i>

242
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,825
<i>wishing that it'd stop and wishing</i>
<i>it wasn't happening, knowing that it was.</i>

243
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,928
<i>I was a fucking little kid...</i>

244
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,871
<i>a kid, and I needed some help.</i>

245
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,888
I'm done looking at this fucking...

246
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,235
You know, no pill, no psychiatrist is ever
gonna completely take it away.

247
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,999
You see, hear, or do something,

248
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:33,944
and all of a sudden, you're thinking about
the worst thing that ever happened in your life.

249
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,745
And even at my most intimate times
with my wife,

250
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,774
not a stitch of clothes on,

251
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,582
somehow or another,
Denny Gray either sprints

252
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,522
or walks slowly through my head.

253
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,720
And so yeah, it's affected it in that respect

254
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,662
in that I don't think I've ever had sex
with somebody

255
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,159
that somehow or another, the issue didn't...

256
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,468
flash or play on slow play.

257
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,101
Once I knew what happened,

258
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,134
I noticed myself...

259
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,237
trying very hard to make sure that...

260
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,644
I was doing things so he knew this is me,

261
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,155
this is Wendy, your wife.

262
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,423
I have nails, so I would, you know,
scrape his stomach or...

263
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,589
It's something where it would...

264
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,225
Maybe he wasn't even thinking about it.

265
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,929
Maybe it was for my own benefit,

266
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,870
just to get my mind someplace else.

267
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,931
Just so he was not...

268
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,499
Neither of us was slipping there.

269
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:44,540
But while I was doing that, I had all this stuff
going through my mind, which sucked.

270
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,051
Unfortunately, it now -

271
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,886
and I think I said that a few times
when we were talking on my tape -

272
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:58,191
this wasn't just eating away at Tony's mind,
it was eating away at my mind.

273
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,691
The first time I went
to potty train my boy...

274
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:10,069
the fact that it came into my head
for a second -

275
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,839
"What do I do if this kid
gets an erection?"

276
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,572
Cos I'm trying to teach him how to aim

277
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,107
which is natural for a dad to do.

278
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,083
That I was uncomfortable,

279
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,352
that I was uncomfortable
because of what happened to me,

280
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,624
and it invaded or stuck its fucking hand
in one more part of my life,

281
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,461
a part of my life that it shouldn't have had to.

282
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,376
So when Tony got out of the Navy,

283
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,715
he'd been home for probably six months,

284
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,348
and he told me that
he'd been abused by Dennis Gray.

285
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,329
He didn't ask that I do anything.

286
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,627
He asked me to tell his father, which I did.

287
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,395
How did his father react to the news?

288
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,194
It was a long time ago.

289
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,540
"Oh no.

290
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,443
"What does Tony want to do?

291
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,750
"Does Tony want me to talk to him?

292
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,620
"What should we do?"

293
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,364
I guess, on his part and my part,

294
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,496
a lot of soul searching

295
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,529
as to what we would do as parents.

296
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,766
I remember John said to me...

297
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,009
"What does Tony want to do?"

298
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,916
And I said, "He don't want to do anything,
I don't believe."

299
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,283
He said, "Does he want me to talk to him?"

300
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,779
And I said, "I think you should
let him come to you."

301
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,262
So it just sort of got locked away,
like a skeleton in the closet.

302
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,697
His siblings were aware of it. I told them.

303
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:19,466
Nothing was ever done about it
and when the whole thing started in Boston...

304
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,966
Tony lost it.

305
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:27,905
<i>Where news comes first.</i>
<i>NBC 24 News at 6.00 starts now.</i>

306
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,309
<i>The scandal has ripped</i>
<i>through the Catholic church</i>

307
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,147
<i>in Boston, St. Louis, and now Toledo,</i>

308
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,914
<i>with allegations that priests</i>

309
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,581
<i>sexually abused young parishioners.</i>

310
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,819
<i>And today, Toledo's bishop issued</i>
<i>a letter to parishioners.</i>

311
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,851
<i>"If you were abused</i>
<i>by a member of the clergy</i>

312
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,023
<i>"or another church employee</i>
<i>and have never reported it,</i>

313
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,295
<i>"you should come forward."</i>

314
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:53,168
I remember when Tony came to me
the first time and said,

315
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,746
"I think that I need to...

316
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,374
"talk to the Bishop.

317
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:09,217
"I think that I need to tell somebody what
happened to me.

318
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,245
"Somebody in the church."

319
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,190
When he told me that, I was scared to death.

320
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,191
I was scared because...

321
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,969
Not only would he have to go through this,

322
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,142
but I would have to go through this with him.

323
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:09,997
<i>Six men claim Dennis Gray,</i>
<i>a former Toledo priest,</i>

324
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,025
<i>molested them during the 1980s.</i>

325
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,507
<i>All of the men were students at this</i>
<i>high school, where Gray taught religion.</i>

326
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,839
<i>Gray left the priesthood in 1987</i>

327
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,539
<i>and has worked in the Toledo</i>
<i>public school system for 12 years</i>

328
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,912
<i>and is currently a dean</i>
<i>at Rogers high school.</i>

329
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,679
<i>But Gray was put on</i>
<i>administrative leave on Monday,</i>

330
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:30,813
<i>and officials say they didn't know</i>
<i>about the accusations</i>

331
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:34,951
<i>despite Toledo's Catholic diocese records</i>
<i>dating back to 1995</i>

332
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:38,190
<i>that state Gray admitted to child abuse.</i>

333
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,561
- Did you know Matt Simon?
- Yes, I did.

334
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:44,898
And how did you become
acquainted with Matthew?

335
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,364
In my class.

336
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,238
Basically, he'd step in my office.

337
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:54,503
Your office at Central Catholic?

338
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:55,944
- Yes?
- Yes.

339
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:02,385
I meet Dennis Gray first day of school.
I'm in his religion class.

340
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't know if somebody told him my situation,
but he said,

341
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:10,517
"I understand you have some issues at home.
I'll take care of you. Don't worry."

342
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:14,998
He came to our school.
He was recruiting altar boys.

343
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,933
I kind of hung back at the time,

344
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,200
and he did whatever he could
to make you feel

345
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,230
wanted, welcomed...

346
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,098
special.

347
00:25:26,144 --> 00:25:28,374
He came over to our house,

348
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:30,813
a black shirt with his collar -

349
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:33,817
had a couple of drinks with my mom,
Dad was talking to him,

350
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:36,877
and I was asked if I would like
to go with him,

351
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:41,017
like a weekend vacation, to go fishing,
do some watersports,

352
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,460
do some swimming,
meet some other kids my age,

353
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:48,522
and try to give me a set of friends
that were heading in the right direction

354
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:51,535
instead of guys who were getting in trouble.

355
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:54,197
He invited me to come up to the lake house.

356
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:56,433
His family was up there.

357
00:25:57,275 --> 00:25:59,243
Friends of his were up there.

358
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:02,405
It was a very family atmosphere,
what I'd been used to.

359
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:05,109
I went with a friend
and we all went up together,

360
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,380
and I thought it was the greatest thing
in the world.

361
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:09,818
We went sledding...

362
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:12,322
There was a pool table,
there was a huge deck,

363
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:14,756
a huge fireplace,

364
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,919
all the things that were just kind of fun,

365
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,452
and everybody was gathered around.

366
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:21,465
It was just a good camaraderie.

367
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:24,662
All of a sudden,
it became more of a party atmosphere,

368
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:27,637
you could look forward to going up there
and having fun,

369
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:30,004
We can play pool, we can drink some beers.

370
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:33,101
We can act like adults,
what every teenager wants to be.

371
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:37,740
The real alarms went off the next trip we took
to the cottage.

372
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:39,773
I got really drunk.

373
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,888
Apparently, I would try to go out
into the snow naked.

374
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:46,787
When I was up there the second time,

375
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:49,918
he had a day bed and a double bed
in his bedroom,

376
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,589
he said, "You can sleep on
the day bed in here."

377
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,258
I was like, "My gosh, I'm sleeping in his room."

378
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:57,290
I thought, "Wow, that's pretty nice."

379
00:26:57,335 --> 00:27:00,099
A long story short,
I woke up the next morning,

380
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,971
and I'm laying in bed
naked with Dennis...

381
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:09,572
You don't remember
what happened the night before.

382
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:12,344
That was probably the first abuse
that took place.

383
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:15,250
You just wake up
and he's fondling you and...

384
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,153
you're not sure, you know,

385
00:27:18,189 --> 00:27:20,020
what's exactly happening,

386
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:23,857
because also a lot of times, you've been
drinking before you've gone to bed.

387
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:26,159
He made sure. And he'd fix you drinks.

388
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,633
You'd get these rum and cokes,
anything that was sweet.

389
00:27:30,701 --> 00:27:35,229
By then, I didn't know which way was right,
which way was wrong.

390
00:27:35,273 --> 00:27:38,834
Here's a man who's supposed to be
helping me, protecting me.

391
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,707
How can he be doing this to me?

392
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:43,543
He'd grab your arms
and you'd be thrown down,

393
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:46,379
and you were gonna get it
whether you wanted it...

394
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,409
You had no choice in the matter, basically.

395
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,751
It wasn't, "Matthew, what would you like?"

396
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:54,383
Or, "How does this feel?"

397
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:57,121
Or, "Are you OK?"

398
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,288
You know, it was a rape.

399
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:01,988
We had oral sex.

400
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:06,763
Yeah, this is very difficult.

401
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:12,666
We tried anal sex one time.

402
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:18,747
A lot of the times,
he would just lay on top of me

403
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:22,014
and hump until he orgasmed or came
or whatever.

404
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:25,113
At the time - I'm going to tell you this -

405
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:27,124
I had thoughts about guys.

406
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:29,752
I mean, I had had thoughts about guys.

407
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:31,762
I thought, "My God, maybe this is it,

408
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:34,356
"maybe this is what this really is.

409
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:36,662
"Maybe this is being gay."

410
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:40,296
I even had conversations with him about that,
and we went to meet with a priest

411
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:42,704
so I could talk to somebody
about my feelings.

412
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,641
They told me it was completely normal,
not to worry.

413
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:48,611
This was the kind of things
he would do for you

414
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:51,945
and you'd just go, "God,
he really does care about me."

415
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:54,884
I didn't really know that there were others

416
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,649
until after Dennis moved to Toledo.

417
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:02,591
I mean, then I knew for sure
that I wasn't just sharing time with him

418
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:04,925
where we would go out or whatever.

419
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:08,295
I was sharing and I felt betrayed,

420
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:12,393
like, "Well, how many people
does he love besides me?"

421
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:15,564
That love that he talked about. How many?

422
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:22,205
In an adolescent mind trying to rank them -
"Am I still the top?"

423
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:26,910
It's very hard.

424
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:33,717
There's a lot of guilt, a lot of shame,

425
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:36,788
and a whole lot of embarrassment.

426
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:45,702
I represent survivors of abuse across
the country and I've been trying these cases...

427
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:51,834
in the court of public opinion
and in the courtroom for 20 years.

428
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:56,313
And I am sad to say that the bishop here

429
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:58,747
and the officials of this diocese...

430
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:02,679
have operated above the law.

431
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,599
- How are you doing, my man?
- Good to see you.

432
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:22,498
Tony, we've talked a little bit about
what we want to achieve here.

433
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,874
The way it happened in Chicago,
and in part in Cleveland,

434
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:29,141
is that I said,

435
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,311
"You show us that you're willing to go
to the table on all these non-economic things -

436
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:36,843
"prevention, healing, outreach,
the whole thing."

437
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,117
That's what we'll do with this diocese...

438
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:42,990
So this isn't about the money.
It's about everything else first.

439
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:46,053
They'll say sorry to me,
my mother and everybody else

440
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:49,032
that I ask them to say sorry to -
my family, my parish.

441
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:51,432
I'm willing to compromise
on a lot of things.

442
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:54,529
I'm not willing to compromise
on any more lies or secrets.

443
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:56,767
There's going to be no more loopholes,

444
00:30:56,807 --> 00:30:59,935
whether it be amendment rights, statutes.

445
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:03,777
They're gonna respond like every rational,
thinking moral adult. It's important.

446
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:06,078
- Let's go get them.
- It's important to us too.

447
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:08,210
It's important they admit they're wrong.

448
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:11,715
This is the first one.

449
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,747
<i>The first of six new lawsuits</i>

450
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,554
<i>filed against the diocese.</i>

451
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:20,797
<i>Six allegations of sexual abuse</i>
<i>by a former Toledo priest.</i>

452
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:23,925
He is a predator. He is a pedophile.

453
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,027
He is a criminal.

454
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:30,531
<i>Six more allegations that the diocese</i>
<i>looked the other way.</i>

455
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:34,806
The diocese of Toledo,
like the dioceses across this country

456
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:37,541
have really operated in secrecy.

457
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:40,550
And there's been little and no disclosure,

458
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:43,985
and they have become
the big part of the problem.

459
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:21,224
The point I'm at now,
they've lied so many times

460
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:25,888
and no matter how I try and play along,
I end up feeling like I'm getting fucked again.

461
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,297
And now, what's going to make it right is...

462
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,925
shit's going to come to a head

463
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,904
and it's gonna get published in the Blade

464
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:37,032
and at least I'm gonna know...

465
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:41,838
that I did everything in my power

466
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:45,776
and didn't give up.

467
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:50,842
I think the church here was
trying to put on a front -

468
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:54,153
"We'll be transparent, help in any way we can."

469
00:32:54,191 --> 00:32:56,751
It was like pulling teeth. It really was.

470
00:32:56,794 --> 00:33:00,958
We asked them, and we put in
formal requests for records.

471
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:05,560
"Can we look at the archives of the diocese?

472
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:09,972
"Can we look at your personnel files
on these priests?"

473
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:12,874
- And we got nowhere.
- They didn't volunteer anything.

474
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,311
They have a very large,
very powerful law firm representing them,

475
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:20,681
and these lawyers
have been quietly settling cases for years.

476
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:23,278
This is a large diocese. It's 19 counties.

477
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,584
It's 8,200 square miles.

478
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:29,286
And these guys
have been criss-crossing northwest Ohio,

479
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:32,955
quietly settling cases,
silencing victims for years.

480
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,496
- What's on your mind?
- A lot.

481
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:41,464
I'm very anxious.

482
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:45,371
- Cos of the article coming out?
- Yeah.

483
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,034
Tony, what's that medal you got there?

484
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:24,172
- It's a St. Florian medal.
- Is that the patron saint...

485
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:26,205
Patron saint of firemen.

486
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:32,044
I used to wear a cross,
but I kind of took it off lately.

487
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,649
Can you go back a little bit

488
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,525
to how the bishop wasn't honest with you?

489
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:42,998
I got in contact with the diocese

490
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:47,527
because I wanted an apology
from the bishop to my mother

491
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:49,129
and to my wife.

492
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:53,041
I asked that he apologize to my wife

493
00:34:53,077 --> 00:34:56,843
for the various disruptions in our marriage

494
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,905
due to my...

495
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,077
whether it be depression or anger,

496
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,588
or however it came out.

497
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:09,125
He apologized to all three of us.

498
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,119
He said it with more sincerity

499
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:15,598
than anyone I had ever heard.

500
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:18,329
Then my mother asked him...

501
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,303
I asked the bishop. I said,

502
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:22,931
"Bishop Hoffman, are you aware

503
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,964
"of any other allegations...

504
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:30,640
"against Dennis Gray
regarding young people?"

505
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,612
And his response to me was...

506
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:39,185
- "Not to my knowledge."
- We asked him three times.

507
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:43,216
He said it with more sincerity
than anyone I had ever heard.

508
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,696
I believed that, based on who he was,

509
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,393
his position and what he represented
to the church,

510
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,402
that he was telling me the truth.

511
00:35:54,638 --> 00:35:56,503
<i>Anthony Comes was unable</i>

512
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,168
<i>to fight back tears while telling his story.</i>

513
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:02,076
<i>Comes claims he was molested</i>
<i>by his former priest</i>

514
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:06,378
<i>and later lied to by the highest leader</i>
<i>in the Toledo Catholic diocese.</i>

515
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:11,480
He had led me to believe
I was the only one. He lied to me.

516
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:13,922
Comes' feelings resurfaced last Memorial Day

517
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:18,087
when he was driving down this street
of the neighborhood where he'd just moved.

518
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:22,121
He noticed the priest he once knew
lived five doors down from him.

519
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:26,068
<i>The diocese intervened and Gray is now</i>
<i>in the process of moving.</i>

520
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:29,300
<i>But Comes says he's disturbed</i>
<i>Bishop Hoffman told him he knew</i>

521
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,830
<i>of no other allegations against Gray.</i>

522
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:36,209
<i>Then four months later, published an article</i>
<i>confessing there was another one.</i>

523
00:36:36,246 --> 00:36:38,942
<i>That's when the firefighter</i>
<i>decided to fight back,</i>

524
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:42,110
<i>suing the diocese and talking publicly.</i>

525
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:47,251
- <i>Were you an altar boy?</i>
- I</i> <i>was. Were you an altar boy?</i>

526
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:50,021
Yeah! Shut up!

527
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,197
Yeah, me, Canning, Williams,
Dattinger, you.

528
00:36:56,233 --> 00:37:00,602
I just don't understand how he got away with it
when there were other people there.

529
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,333
- Did it happen when we were there?
- Absolutely.

530
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:06,570
- He'd come out and say...
- I honest to God did not know.

531
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,010
Did you ever go skinnydipping there?

532
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:11,276
- At night?
- At the cottage?

533
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,707
I don't think so.

534
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:17,220
Do you recall anybody going skinnydipping?

535
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:19,552
I do recall that.

536
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,753
I remember wanting to go skinnydipping
with Molly Gray there.

537
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:25,853
Why would you want to go skinnydipping
with a bunch of guys?

538
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:29,730
It was innocuous.
Nothing happened other than fish biting you.

539
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,997
- Whatever.
- It's middle of the night.

540
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,662
If you're fucked up, I guess.

541
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:37,640
Why would you shower after a game
with a bunch of guys? Same deal.

542
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,802
A bunch of guys up in a cabin drinking,
getting fucked up. Who cares?

543
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,813
If none of us are gay,
who cares if I look at you naked?

544
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,441
Except you don't know if anyone's gay.

545
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:49,281
Bullshit. It's a very experimental time.

546
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,877
What?

547
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,687
Let me interrupt for a minute.

548
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:57,250
Do you see me...

549
00:37:57,294 --> 00:37:59,558
or my life now

550
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,996
in my decision to go public...

551
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,598
as a positive thing

552
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,465
or a negative thing?

553
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:14,534
And do you understand
that my position is not...

554
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,880
...Catholics, it's the leadership.

555
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:25,579
- Why have you forsaken the Catholic church?
- I have not forsaken it.

556
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,056
But based upon my own experience...

557
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:33,329
seeing the current behavior of the church...

558
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,528
I am given a choice to either trust the church

559
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,799
in the same environment
while they're still telling lies

560
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,136
- with the care of my daughter...
- But I...

561
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:45,903
Let me finish. And risk, as minimal as it is,

562
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:49,401
- something happening to her...
- You'd never forgive yourself.

563
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:52,142
<i>...or</i> take her out, put her in public school,

564
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:54,673
deal with all the crap you have to deal with.

565
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,447
I'm worried that...

566
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:01,350
you're going to make other people pay

567
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:05,725
for a bitterness that maybe
you're picking up from it.

568
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:11,223
Because I do truly believe in the priesthood

569
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,863
and the Catholic church
as a good organization.

570
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:19,968
We're looking at a thousand years
of good, OK,

571
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,137
- that the Catholic church has done.
- Right.

572
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:28,118
And what we're dealing with now,
is ten years of a cover-up.

573
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:58,366
The overwhelming urge to drive down to where
the Bishop's laying to rest

574
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:03,277
and piss on his grave
is almost completely overwhelming,

575
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:07,181
But in the light of things,
I think I'll hold off on that.

576
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:11,577
But I'll do it.

577
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:16,156
Denny, when you're dead,
I'll piss on your grave too.

578
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:54,191
When I got engaged to Tony,

579
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:56,028
I made the choice...

580
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,662
to convert to Catholicism.

581
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,568
<i>I did it because...</i>

582
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:06,042
<i>I believe in the Catholic religion</i>

583
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:09,273
<i>I believe in our Lord Jesus Christ</i>
<i>very strongly.</i>

584
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:15,047
Our strongest link
to the Catholic church...

585
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,389
when I met Tony was John Shiffler,

586
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,949
who was a priest

587
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:26,224
in the Catholic church in Toledo.

588
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:30,062
Tony and I felt a very strong bond with him.

589
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:33,529
He helped us through a lot of difficult times.

590
00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:37,496
He counseled us, he married us,

591
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:40,339
he baptized me, he baptized our daughter.

592
00:43:32,295 --> 00:43:34,354
<i>Unfortunately, over this past year,</i>

593
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:38,333
<i>we found out that he's also</i>
<i>one that has abused children.</i>

594
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,531
State your name for the record, please.

595
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:44,404
- John Charles Shiffler.
- And Mr. Shiffler,

596
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:47,035
when did you first meet Dennis Gray?

597
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:50,410
In 1986, when I first came there.

598
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,438
How did you come to know him at that time?

599
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:56,282
He was also one of the teachers
in the religion department.

600
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,514
Did you share an office with him?

601
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,388
Our offices were adjacent to each other.

602
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,724
How many times did you have
sexual encounters with Matt Simon?

603
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:09,095
One.

604
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:13,827
What occurred between you and Matt Simon
in June 1987?

605
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:17,365
I am instructing the witness not to answer.

606
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:21,133
You refuse to answer?

607
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:23,908
At the recommendation of my counsel, yes.

608
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:36,650
The lies, the deceit, the betrayal

609
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:39,321
wasn't just from Dennis Gray anymore.

610
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:41,489
It was from the Catholic church,

611
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:43,931
the Catholic diocese of Toledo,

612
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:45,730
the bishop...

613
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,237
everyone that knew what was going on.

614
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,997
They knew that...

615
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,671
abuse had occurred by Dennis Gray,

616
00:44:57,714 --> 00:44:59,181
by others,

617
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,207
but they chose to ignore it.

618
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,084
They knew before Tony was abused

619
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:08,852
that there had been allegations
against Dennis Gray,

620
00:45:08,892 --> 00:45:10,883
but they chose to ignore it.

621
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:48,965
<i>Please welcome Bishop Robert Donnelly.</i>

622
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:56,938
The most visible action on behalf of
social justice in the Toledo diocese

623
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:59,737
is the Catholic Charities organization.

624
00:45:59,776 --> 00:46:02,939
Catholic Charities seeks the common good
and wellbeing of all,

625
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:06,005
but especially the poor and the vulnerable.

626
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:08,779
My name is John Schoonmaker.

627
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:11,480
And with all respect, Bishop Donnelly, I ask,

628
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:14,115
where is the social justice

629
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:17,558
for the victims of sexual abuse by priests?

630
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:25,431
John, I want to...

631
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:30,599
respond briefly to that question, I guess.

632
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,540
I do want to say that we are

633
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:35,703
well along the journey

634
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:40,307
of responding dramatically, transparently

635
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,719
and justly to allegations, any and all.

636
00:46:44,754 --> 00:46:49,191
If you want to continue, I'll do so afterwards,
but I'd like to answer another question.

637
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:52,659
- Bishop Donnelly?
- Yes?

638
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:54,687
- My name is Claudia.
- Sure, Claudia.

639
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,427
I'm not as eloquent as some.

640
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,662
In fact as I was listening to you talk,

641
00:46:59,703 --> 00:47:02,866
I'd die a thousand deaths than stand up.

642
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,966
But I want you to know that while -

643
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,608
and please don't take my tears as weak -

644
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:14,142
but while you may be in compliance on paper,

645
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:17,620
there are people in this
community that are hurting.

646
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:19,747
And this is not an area

647
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,690
that social justice has prevailed.

648
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:27,026
And we need to be not thrown off
the church property

649
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:29,122
when we come to give you a letter.

650
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:32,657
We need to be engaging in a dialogue,
looking for solutions.

651
00:47:32,702 --> 00:47:35,694
Claudia, I would indeed...

652
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:39,140
welcome some way to dialogue,

653
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:42,838
but I'm not sure that this is the place or time
for us to say other than

654
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:45,871
we are in compliance,
that is to say, we do the best we can,

655
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:48,247
we have lay men and women
in different groups

656
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:50,752
that have been appointed
to look at our faults,

657
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:53,950
to tell us that we are doing what we've been
asked to do.

658
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,719
We have done it well.

659
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:59,422
It doesn't mean we're perfect at it,
but we're working on it.

660
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:02,694
Right off the top of my head,

661
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:06,293
I don't think bishops are accountable
enough to people.

662
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,199
They're appointed as a bishop,

663
00:48:12,242 --> 00:48:14,972
the priest council is their own council.

664
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:18,139
It's not like a legislative body or anything.

665
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:22,879
They're not evaluated by the parishioners.

666
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,046
Well, part of it goes back

667
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:29,422
to other situations of this diocese

668
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:35,360
where, I believe, the administration of
this diocese was protecting and covering for

669
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:38,060
and enabling people
who I call "faith molesters."

670
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:40,501
Did you have any priest who counseled you

671
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:45,770
or met with you, suggested that that would be
a good vocation for you?

672
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:48,175
- Yeah.
- Who were they?

673
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:51,203
A priest at Central, through the years.

674
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:56,676
Bob Donnelly, the Auxiliary Bishop today.

675
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,480
I know that Dennis Gray served with
Robert Donnelly, under Robert Donnelly.

676
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:06,791
Because I did my deacon internship with...
He was then Father Robert Donnelly.

677
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,231
It was 1979.
Dennis Gray was just being moved.

678
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,700
And I know that they were close.

679
00:49:12,735 --> 00:49:16,136
Did you talk to Donnelly about
wanting to move to Toledo?

680
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:17,867
- Bishop Donnelly?
- Yeah.

681
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:19,898
- Sure.
- And what did you say to him?

682
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:22,377
Objection. Privileged communication.

683
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:25,609
He wasn't the bishop at the time, was he?

684
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:27,548
He was a bishop.

685
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:30,314
- What kind of bishop?
- Auxiliary bishop.

686
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:35,620
- Where did he stand in the...
- Bishop.

687
00:49:35,658 --> 00:49:38,183
- ...chain of command?
- Number two.

688
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:41,391
- OK. Did he have authority over you?
- Sure.

689
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:44,264
I think Bishop Hoffman, Bishop Donnelly,

690
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,758
knew about these accusations on him,

691
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:50,739
and probably to protect his career,

692
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:54,265
remained silent and allowed this man
to be around children.

693
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,211
I think any of these bishops like this,

694
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:02,742
who place - I think across the country -
who place these molesters,

695
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:07,017
especially these serial molesters,
around kids should resign.

696
00:50:07,056 --> 00:50:09,889
They have no business being bishops

697
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:12,156
if they play with lives like that.

698
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,061
OK, so I'm wondering

699
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,260
if between the two of you, if that's come up.

700
00:50:18,301 --> 00:50:22,169
We were going out with his family
for a birthday party.

701
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:25,572
- We hadn't been out together since...
- Since we talked.

702
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:28,076
<i>...that</i> issue. And then Tony started talking

703
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,136
about the whole church situation,

704
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:35,583
and I think what made it worse was that
your brother was going to a church function.

705
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:38,712
So that put Tony in a whole different universe.

706
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:41,349
I was freaking out. So I said...

707
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:46,759
to her, across the table,
"Hey, can you come on over

708
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:49,731
"and sit on this side for a minute
until things get going

709
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:51,757
"and rub my back for a second?"

710
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:55,633
Now, I just sat down, I've had a long week.

711
00:50:55,672 --> 00:50:58,573
All I want to do is have a drink
and talk to adults.

712
00:50:58,608 --> 00:51:01,202
I didn't get shitty, I don't think.

713
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:04,805
- Not at that point.
- I think I just said, you know...

714
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:08,339
If he happens to be feeling a certain way
or feeling tight,

715
00:51:08,384 --> 00:51:11,376
everything that possibly
going on with me is just...

716
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,017
Too bad! Suck it up!

717
00:51:14,057 --> 00:51:16,548
- You turn invisible.
- "I'm tight, so the world ends."

718
00:51:16,593 --> 00:51:21,223
- Wait a second.
- I really wish that Tony could take

719
00:51:21,264 --> 00:51:23,755
all the stuff that's turning into anger

720
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,030
and do something different with that.

721
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:28,833
Help people in the Catholic church,

722
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:34,070
- or, you know, parents, or whatever group...
- Change canon law, leave the church?

723
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:39,047
If he could do something different with that
rather than get angry and pissed off.

724
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:44,452
I'm usually pretty good.
I may not be doing it the way you would,

725
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:47,923
but this is the way that I think
it's going to work for me

726
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:50,323
in order to get through it.

727
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,658
I am what I am.

728
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:13,247
Guess where I am?

729
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:15,273
That's the arch in St. Louis.

730
00:52:17,754 --> 00:52:19,779
Hey, Barbara. Tony Comes.

731
00:52:20,423 --> 00:52:23,517
Apparently, Claudia already has
a name tag for me?

732
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,550
She has everything for you.

733
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:31,431
Welcome to the first
national assembly of S.N.A.P.,

734
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:34,561
the Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.

735
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:41,666
Now, we are going to hear from
our national executive director,

736
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:43,201
David Clohessy.

737
00:52:49,686 --> 00:52:52,382
Welcome. Welcome to my town.

738
00:52:53,656 --> 00:52:57,023
We're here this weekend
for one simple reason,

739
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:03,258
and that is to gain
the strength and the skills

740
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,728
to go out and keep doing

741
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:10,637
what we've been doing, many of us,
for years and years,

742
00:53:10,673 --> 00:53:13,233
which is, to save lives.

743
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:17,542
I'm going to ask just a couple of people
to break the ice

744
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,209
and if you're comfortable sharing some of what
you shared this afternoon,

745
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,844
please head up to one of the microphones.

746
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:26,878
Good evening. I'm from Tucson, Arizona.

747
00:53:26,923 --> 00:53:30,859
I was raped by a priest
when I was 11 years old.

748
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:34,852
Up until that time,
I had one hundred per cent clarity

749
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:37,559
that God's plan for me was to be a priest.

750
00:53:38,334 --> 00:53:40,529
That plan changed,

751
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,038
because the closest thing I had to God

752
00:53:43,072 --> 00:53:46,405
was that priest that held me down
by the back of the neck

753
00:53:46,442 --> 00:53:48,876
and stuck his penis in my butt.

754
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:51,345
This is me as a teenager,

755
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,247
at the age when I was abused

756
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:57,116
by the bishop's director of youth ministry

757
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,451
for the diocese of Toledo.

758
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,356
I remember vividly on this youth trip,

759
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:06,487
he stopped at a hotel and checked in
with a fake name

760
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:10,488
and turned to me and said, "I can't believe
I would almost give my real name."

761
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:15,732
And being naive, like this person in the picture,
I thought, "Why wouldn't you?

762
00:54:15,772 --> 00:54:19,003
"If something happened,
how would they know where we're at?"

763
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,475
My first sexual assaults by a priest

764
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:26,039
started when I was
somewhere between five and six.

765
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:31,080
Fast forward to 21, 22...

766
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:34,813
and like many of us,

767
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:37,758
I was confided in a priest

768
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:40,194
who then immediately began an affair with me.

769
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:43,426
My father himself was a pedophile,

770
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:45,934
so he started around the age of two

771
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:47,959
to approximately the age of six,

772
00:54:48,004 --> 00:54:52,100
and then I met Father Geoghegan
who went from six to roughly ten.

773
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:54,473
So it was kind of natural for me.

774
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:59,872
I was just nine years old when Father Jim

775
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:01,975
worked very slowly and methodically

776
00:55:02,018 --> 00:55:05,419
to gain my trust and confidence and silence.

777
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:10,185
Through the course of it, French kissing,

778
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:12,217
forced masturbation, oral rape

779
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:15,822
became the traumas I experienced,
but experienced alone.

780
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:37,910
My name is Tony Comes.
I'm from Toledo, Ohio.

781
00:55:39,488 --> 00:55:42,753
I'm a 34-year-old father of two.

782
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:44,350
I'm a Toledo firefighter.

783
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:48,791
I was abused repeatedly.

784
00:55:51,534 --> 00:55:53,764
I allowed myself to continue to be abused.

785
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,405
I regret the most

786
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:02,036
that I've always been aware.

787
00:56:02,078 --> 00:56:05,639
And I always said, "If I ever find out

788
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:07,842
"that someone else was after me,

789
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:11,509
"it'll kill me."
I thought I was the only one.

790
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:19,520
You've taken a very brave step,

791
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:23,054
and we applaud you especially
for having the courage to come out

792
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:26,262
and be among people who can support you.

793
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:30,534
It's a very tough first step, and we welcome
you and applaud you for doing that.

794
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:32,404
And we applaud you for being here.

795
00:56:57,233 --> 00:57:02,227
Can you believe it? How are you?
It's so good to see you.

796
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:05,263
- Shorter than I remember.
- Just a little bit smaller.

797
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:12,876
I've been shitting my pants about meeting you.

798
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:17,074
- It's a gateway to your past.
- So you have not seen each other either?

799
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,781
I've had his number for months,
and every day...

800
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:21,847
"You should call him."

801
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:25,258
- I don't know...
- What to say? How to start?

802
00:57:25,294 --> 00:57:27,762
Yeah, it's not a conversation you really want

803
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:30,891
cos then you have to deal with it
when you talk to that person.

804
00:57:30,933 --> 00:57:35,029
So it's not a conversation you want
to exactly have, but it's a good thing.

805
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:37,198
I feel very responsible.

806
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:39,799
- Why?
- Because...

807
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,104
As I felt all along for 20 years,

808
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:47,274
my biggest fear was,
if I would have spoken up,

809
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:51,685
somebody else wouldn't have gone through
or feel what I feel.

810
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:55,748
And I asked myself a thousand times, "Why?"

811
00:57:57,393 --> 00:57:59,293
Do you think that it has a potential

812
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:01,455
to cause serious long-range harm to a child

813
00:58:01,497 --> 00:58:04,898
when someone in a position of authority
such as a priest

814
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:07,596
puts their penis in the mouth of that child?

815
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:11,094
- Yes.
- It has the potential cause serious harm.

816
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,801
- No.
- It doesn't?

817
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:15,333
- No.
- It doesn't have the potential to cause...

818
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:18,870
- He's answered the question.
- ...serious harm to the child?

819
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:22,042
Lack of foundation.
What are you talking about?

820
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:24,575
Serious, permanent harm to that child.

821
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:27,814
No, I think... No.

822
00:58:27,857 --> 00:58:30,621
On what grounds do you say it does not?

823
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:34,959
I don't want to go with medical,
I just say every person's different.

824
00:58:35,898 --> 00:58:39,390
So some children it wouldn't bother,
others it would?

825
00:58:39,435 --> 00:58:41,426
I would think so.

826
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:50,070
When you go out there
and your parents told you,

827
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,343
"Listen to him and do what he tells you,"
so when he's saying,

828
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:56,613
"You sleep in this room, you in this room,
you in this room,

829
00:58:56,652 --> 00:58:59,644
- "you and you are in this room with me..."
- No one ever asked,

830
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:01,679
"Do you sleep in the same bed with him?"

831
00:59:01,724 --> 00:59:03,624
They assumed you were at the cottage.

832
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:06,787
You know, there were times that I would run.
I would try to hide.

833
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:11,198
I would try to find people to be around
so I could avoid

834
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:13,201
going to Father Auth's garage,

835
00:59:13,235 --> 00:59:16,432
or the doctor's house, or his garage...

836
00:59:16,472 --> 00:59:19,305
Wherever he would tell me to go,
I would just try to hide.

837
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:22,799
But I knew that he would find me.
He was very clever.

838
00:59:22,845 --> 00:59:25,575
In the same vein, when I was getting abused...

839
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:28,082
when I say, I laid there,

840
00:59:28,117 --> 00:59:31,450
stiff as a board, pardon the pun,

841
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,717
just in agony,

842
00:59:33,756 --> 00:59:36,384
because I could not mentally control

843
00:59:36,425 --> 00:59:40,361
- a natural, physical, biological reaction.
- Physical reaction.

844
00:59:40,396 --> 00:59:42,830
And I was going, "Jesus Christ!

845
00:59:42,865 --> 00:59:48,132
"I have actually achieved an orgasm,
as unfun as it was.

846
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,662
"And it was with a man. I must be queer!

847
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:56,042
"Holy shit! What am I gonna do?"

848
00:59:56,078 --> 01:00:00,310
I had to get as many girls as I could
possibly find

849
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:03,716
- in order to prove it wrong.
- To prove that wrong.

850
01:00:03,752 --> 01:00:06,016
It ruined, for me...

851
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:09,821
Well, I mean, for any lack of better term...

852
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:14,887
any sex I had with any men
for several years after that, because...

853
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,990
the only way I could have a relationship
with someone was to have sex with them.

854
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:21,469
That was what I thought would
make them like me,

855
01:00:21,504 --> 01:00:23,836
- which I know sounds...
- No.

856
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:26,603
...really warped. I don't have to tell you that.

857
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:27,939
But yeah.

858
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:30,241
See, with me, the first girl that I was with

859
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:32,975
that wanted to become intimate with me,
I just said,

860
01:00:33,015 --> 01:00:35,449
"Why the hell do you want
to have sex with me?"

861
01:00:35,484 --> 01:00:38,544
She's like, "It's a nice way
to share of ourselves."

862
01:00:38,587 --> 01:00:42,318
I looked at her and said, "Who says I wanted
to share anything with you?

863
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:45,384
And it took a while for me to realize

864
01:00:45,427 --> 01:00:49,295
that there were girls who went through
similar abuse that I did,

865
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:51,322
and to them, that's the only way

866
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:54,632
of offering what they think is special
about them to you.

867
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:58,737
So tell me something.
If they were to come to us right now

868
01:00:58,774 --> 01:01:04,178
and say, "Here is such and such
of a settlement,

869
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:06,374
"and that's it - no ties to it..."

870
01:01:06,415 --> 01:01:08,645
- Fuck off.
- You'd really say fuck off?

871
01:01:08,684 --> 01:01:12,745
Somebody's admitting they were wrong,
the highest possible person.

872
01:01:12,788 --> 01:01:16,451
But a settlement,
you don't think that's admitting they're wrong?

873
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:19,086
No, if I take a settlement out of the courts,

874
01:01:19,128 --> 01:01:21,790
they, one, publicly aren't admitting anything

875
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,799
and I want Dennis to admit that he did this,

876
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,597
I want the church to admit
that they covered it up,

877
01:01:27,636 --> 01:01:30,537
I want the church to admit to all the other
cover-ups they have.

878
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:32,666
And I'll walk away without a dime.

879
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,438
- You pay my legal fees and I'm done.
- I want assurances

880
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:38,844
there's measures in place so this shit
doesn't happen anymore.

881
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:42,282
I think I would definitely entertain
the settlement, but I...

882
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,721
But you can't tell me that
while you were given a settlement...

883
01:01:46,755 --> 01:01:49,849
Like you, Tony and Matt were given
a group settlement of $20 million.

884
01:01:49,892 --> 01:01:52,486
- "So you should be happy now."
- "And you should be happy now."

885
01:01:52,528 --> 01:01:54,223
It's over. What do you think?

886
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:56,322
If you fucking think it's over,

887
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:58,765
come over to my house
and every night I wake up,

888
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:01,235
sweating my ass off
because I had a nightmare

889
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,363
because that fucker's face is in my head,

890
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:06,272
I'll tap you on the forehead and say,
"It's on, it's on!

891
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:11,610
"Wake up. You get to go with me for
another two hours while I go walking this off."

892
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:17,381
<i>There's a priest doing confession.</i>

893
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:20,616
<i>He's sitting in the confessional</i>
<i>and he's got to take a shit.</i>

894
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:24,092
He sees David the janitor walk by
and he says, "Dave, get in here.

895
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:26,526
"I need you to do me a favor.

896
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:28,792
"I got to take a shit. Do the confessions.

897
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:31,891
"All the sins are here, the punishments,
just follow the chart.

898
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:33,959
"Everything's there." A lady comes in,

899
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:38,599
confesses to adultery, performing oral sex
on somebody other than her husband.

900
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,804
Dave can't find oral sex
on the board anywhere.

901
01:02:41,844 --> 01:02:44,938
He sees one of the altar boys walking by,
he goes, "Tommy."

902
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:47,705
"Dave, what are you doing in there?"

903
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,878
He says, "I don't have time for idle chatter.

904
01:02:50,919 --> 01:02:54,548
"What does Father usually give
for inappropriate oral sex?"

905
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:58,788
He goes, "I don't know.
Ice cream and a movie?"

906
01:02:58,827 --> 01:03:00,692
Oh, Tony.

907
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:04,392
- OK, you've watched big-time wrestling?
- Yes.

908
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:07,368
And, being a non-athlete,
you'll still be able to get it.

909
01:03:07,403 --> 01:03:10,702
- What's that move called?
- ...move called? It's a half nelson.

910
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:13,603
What's this move called? It's a full nelson.

911
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:16,110
What's this move called?

912
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:18,978
- Father Nelson.
- Father Nelson.

913
01:03:19,014 --> 01:03:20,914
Have you heard that one, Matt?

914
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:36,164
Thank you for everything.

915
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:38,291
Buddy, I can't tell you.

916
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:42,169
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
01:03:42,204 --> 01:03:45,037
I would have never recognized you. Never.

918
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:47,167
Matt is easily recognizable.

919
01:03:48,877 --> 01:03:51,209
You know what? I'm probably a lot better

920
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:54,545
- than I thought I would have been.
- Me too.

921
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:13,634
<i>So, the diocese has filed</i>
<i>the motion to dismiss.</i>

922
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:16,297
They're saying, even if you have a good case,

923
01:04:16,338 --> 01:04:18,329
you brought it way too late,

924
01:04:18,374 --> 01:04:21,901
because the statute of limitations

925
01:04:21,944 --> 01:04:24,674
restricts your right to file

926
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:28,080
unless you do it within
a certain number of years.

927
01:04:28,117 --> 01:04:32,918
So at this stage, they're going
to take advantage of every single delay.

928
01:04:32,955 --> 01:04:37,255
And that can turn a two-year lawsuit
into an eight-year lawsuit.

929
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:41,319
They're sinning. I can fit it in I don't know
how many different commandments.

930
01:04:41,363 --> 01:04:44,821
I think if they were truly concerned
about helping the victims,

931
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:48,701
they would say, "Let's focus
on what really happened

932
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:52,673
"and look at the merits
and what we should be doing,"

933
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,699
but they're not inclined to do that.

934
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:59,476
Now, the next thing
is something called canon law,

935
01:04:59,515 --> 01:05:03,110
which is the book of rules
that the Catholic church lives by.

936
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:06,815
Under canon law, priests are authorized to lie

937
01:05:06,855 --> 01:05:09,847
if it is in the interest of the church,

938
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:11,860
to protect the church from scandals.

939
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:14,829
It's called "mental reservation."

940
01:05:14,863 --> 01:05:17,491
I don't know if you've heard of this term.

941
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:20,525
"Strict mental reservation" means that you can

942
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:25,597
not answer a question,
you can lie in your answer

943
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:28,804
in order to protect the interests of the church.

944
01:05:28,844 --> 01:05:32,644
And I think that's probably something
that most people don't realize.

945
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:35,548
There's a gajillion things
going through my head.

946
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:39,145
My daughter's having
her fucking first communion

947
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,156
in 15 days.

948
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:45,820
If it wasn't going to be hard to say,
"Welcome aboard!" before...

949
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:52,026
I don't even want to go. I don't want her to go.

950
01:05:57,272 --> 01:05:59,365
- But I'm...
- It's just...

951
01:05:59,408 --> 01:06:01,706
I'm putting her into a group

952
01:06:01,743 --> 01:06:05,839
that, knowing what I just know now,

953
01:06:05,881 --> 01:06:08,111
I don't want her to do it.

954
01:06:20,596 --> 01:06:23,087
<i>It's going to be a far longer process.</i>

955
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:25,763
<i>Like eight years.</i>

956
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,792
I would expect that from them.

957
01:06:30,506 --> 01:06:33,339
This is difficult for me.
The fact that I was an adult

958
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:38,779
and made a conscious decision
to convert to this religion.

959
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:42,846
Would you make the same decision now?

960
01:06:42,885 --> 01:06:44,785
I don't know.

961
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,448
Quite honestly, Tony, I...

962
01:06:48,323 --> 01:06:52,692
I'm also at a point where I've thought about
going over to Perrysburg

963
01:06:52,728 --> 01:06:55,322
and checking out Cedar Creek,

964
01:06:56,431 --> 01:07:00,231
- a non-denominational church.
- It's a non-denominational...

965
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:04,638
It's a place to continue
a relationship with God.

966
01:07:04,673 --> 01:07:09,201
You know, I think the communion piece
would be difficult,

967
01:07:09,244 --> 01:07:12,179
because that is a deep connection for me.

968
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:16,974
But...

969
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:19,010
I'm torn. I'm torn just like you are.

970
01:07:19,054 --> 01:07:20,715
And I think for me, it's easier,

971
01:07:20,756 --> 01:07:23,452
because I didn't grow up with this religion.

972
01:07:23,492 --> 01:07:26,689
You were brought up... I mean, you know...

973
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:30,255
You go to church, you don't have to look
at a book to recite anything.

974
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:34,258
You know exactly, by memory, because you...
Just like Samantha.

975
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:36,100
She knows...

976
01:07:37,406 --> 01:07:39,533
The prayers to say, when to say them.

977
01:07:39,575 --> 01:07:41,475
It's second nature for her,

978
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:44,536
and after communion,
it's gonna be even stronger.

979
01:07:52,588 --> 01:07:54,818
This side, knucklehead.

980
01:07:59,895 --> 01:08:02,022
- Hi.
- How are you?

981
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:04,055
OK.

982
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:06,067
Can you fit?

983
01:08:09,471 --> 01:08:11,871
Move that so you can sit down.

984
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,902
Buckle up.

985
01:08:15,944 --> 01:08:19,141
- What did you learn at school today?
- Jesus day.

986
01:08:19,181 --> 01:08:21,843
Jesus day? What was Jesus day?

987
01:08:21,883 --> 01:08:24,477
- I forget.
- You forget what Jesus day was about?

988
01:08:25,921 --> 01:08:28,219
- Jesus.
- OK.

989
01:08:28,256 --> 01:08:32,283
What did you guys try last week?

990
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:35,763
- The host.
- What's the host supposed to be?

991
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:37,321
Jesus's body.

992
01:08:52,948 --> 01:08:55,416
<i>I actually sat Sam down.</i>

993
01:08:56,218 --> 01:08:58,413
<i>Her book is very similar.</i>

994
01:08:58,453 --> 01:09:01,786
<i>It's slightly more updated,</i>
<i>but nearly identical.</i>

995
01:09:06,294 --> 01:09:09,354
<i>And I could remember. I was an altar boy,</i>

996
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:13,095
<i>And I enjoyed church until I was abused.</i>

997
01:09:14,169 --> 01:09:16,228
<i>And now, what I'm mad about</i>

998
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:19,502
<i>is that they're doing</i>
<i>everything exactly wrong.</i>

999
01:09:25,747 --> 01:09:28,238
<i>And it's the "forgive"part.</i>

1000
01:09:28,283 --> 01:09:32,310
<i>When the church adds "forget," that's stupid</i>

1001
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:35,079
<i>because it's impossible.</i>

1002
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:46,526
This particular dream,
we're at first communion,

1003
01:09:46,568 --> 01:09:50,698
and my wife and I are standing
hands on our daughter's shoulder.

1004
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:57,507
I look down and I see them place
the communion in my daughter's hand,

1005
01:09:57,546 --> 01:09:59,309
and I look up

1006
01:09:59,347 --> 01:10:01,508
and it's Denny Gray.

1007
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,786
I woke up

1008
01:10:07,823 --> 01:10:10,986
and I'll bet you I couldn't breathe

1009
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:13,153
for a full minute.

1010
01:10:16,064 --> 01:10:18,658
I was probably crying for ten

1011
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:22,192
before she woke up.

1012
01:10:22,237 --> 01:10:25,866
And by crying, I mean, shaking,

1013
01:10:25,907 --> 01:10:28,068
just sobbing.

1014
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:42,986
I have a sense of fear now.

1015
01:10:43,024 --> 01:10:45,857
Tony, you can be there.

1016
01:10:45,894 --> 01:10:48,362
- I refuse to go.
- She will understand.

1017
01:10:55,504 --> 01:10:58,473
I'm so sick to my stomach, I can't sleep.

1018
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:07,909
I need to figure out how I'm going to do this
before I walk in that church.

1019
01:12:05,373 --> 01:12:08,137
Samantha Comes.

1020
01:12:34,102 --> 01:12:36,366
Chris Wilson.

1021
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:54,051
<i>Well, other than picking her up from school,</i>

1022
01:12:54,089 --> 01:12:57,024
<i>that'll probably be the last</i>
<i>time I'm in that church.</i>

1023
01:12:57,792 --> 01:12:59,282
You know...

1024
01:13:00,295 --> 01:13:02,286
It's strange being 34...

1025
01:13:04,566 --> 01:13:07,057
and questioning everything you ever thought

1026
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:10,594
as far as what I think people
look to religion for

1027
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:13,335
is when everything else goes to shit.

1028
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,736
That's what you do. You turn to God,

1029
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:23,308
or you turn to God in a fashion
in which you were taught.

1030
01:13:23,351 --> 01:13:25,080
And now, I got nowhere to turn,

1031
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,611
so it's a bitch.

1032
01:14:15,437 --> 01:14:19,567
You know darn well how I feel about you,

1033
01:14:19,607 --> 01:14:24,704
but I hope you get to a point between now
and when this is all over,

1034
01:14:24,746 --> 01:14:27,943
where you do deal with it

1035
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:29,951
as you're through with the anger

1036
01:14:29,985 --> 01:14:32,180
and you're more down to the nitty-gritty -

1037
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:34,518
"This is right, this is wrong.

1038
01:14:34,556 --> 01:14:37,719
"Let's fess up, guys" - and not be angry.

1039
01:14:37,759 --> 01:14:41,422
When there is full disclosure and justice

1040
01:14:41,463 --> 01:14:45,900
- in my perception of it as done...
- Well, Tony, look't.

1041
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:48,459
I can deal with what I believe

1042
01:14:48,503 --> 01:14:51,700
was being told a lie by the bishop.

1043
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,731
I can deal with that.

1044
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:59,408
The church is like, to me,
like any large company.

1045
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:03,144
Sometimes the right hand doesn't even know
what the left hand's doing.

1046
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:05,584
- They know. They fucking know.
- No.

1047
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,521
They damn well know
that this is tearing up marriages,

1048
01:15:08,556 --> 01:15:11,184
that this is tearing up individuals, this is...

1049
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:15,923
They know, and they are
the pillars of society,

1050
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:18,489
and the sons of bitches
don't do anything to stop it.

1051
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:20,524
Watch your language.

1052
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:23,468
You know what?
You run around with those guys,

1053
01:15:23,505 --> 01:15:25,496
it's guilt by association.

1054
01:15:30,912 --> 01:15:33,642
I'm sorry, mom, but you're talking out
of two sides.

1055
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:35,512
You're wanting...

1056
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:40,078
You so vehemently want to hang on
to what you need to -

1057
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:42,419
and I don't besmirch you that -

1058
01:15:42,457 --> 01:15:45,585
but for God's sake, what is it going to take?

1059
01:15:45,627 --> 01:15:49,324
Are you asking me to leave
the Catholic church? I'm not going to do it.

1060
01:15:49,364 --> 01:15:52,765
I'm asking you to stand up.
I'm asking you to quit writing checks.

1061
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:56,931
What in hell's bells
do you think I've been doing?

1062
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,529
Or trying to do?

1063
01:15:58,573 --> 01:16:00,564
I'm not hiding.

1064
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,001
I'm not hiding.

1065
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:06,945
But I am...

1066
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,976
Do you put money in a basket every week?

1067
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:15,649
- Yeah. I think that's my obligation.
- The money you're giving...

1068
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:18,818
- Wait a minute.
- ...pays the attorneys that are fighting me.

1069
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:20,851
Put any kind of spin on it you want.

1070
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:24,831
Remember when I begged you and Dad
to let me out of Central?

1071
01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:26,857
- Yeah.
- Do you know why?

1072
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:29,563
- Why?
- Because it was happening.

1073
01:16:29,604 --> 01:16:33,301
- OK. Why... you know...
- Why didn't I tell you?

1074
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:34,672
You couldn't.

1075
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:39,169
I was getting beat up for being called "faggot,"
or "little," or whatever.

1076
01:16:39,214 --> 01:16:41,705
Am I gonna fucking put a billboard out
that says,

1077
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:45,913
"Yes, I'm getting a fucking hand job,
getting my dick sucked by a priest?"

1078
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:48,684
No, but you and dad
wouldn't let me fucking go

1079
01:16:48,723 --> 01:16:52,215
because "Catholic religion
and Catholic education is better."

1080
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:55,491
We didn't know what was going on, Tony.

1081
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:57,828
Well, when you did, you didn't do nothing.

1082
01:16:57,866 --> 01:17:00,630
All right, but at the time...

1083
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:04,061
I'm thirty-fucking-four years old

1084
01:17:04,105 --> 01:17:06,835
and I'm crying like a fucking scared
12-year-old.

1085
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:11,039
I know, and we made the best decision

1086
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:13,741
with the information
that we had at the time.

1087
01:17:27,662 --> 01:17:29,527
I'm sorry.

1088
01:17:30,298 --> 01:17:32,357
I needed to get my clothes and stuff.

1089
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,302
- Does Sam have clean clothes for tomorrow?
- Yes.

1090
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:47,105
<i>Right at the moment,</i>
<i>things aren't very good with Tony and I.</i>

1091
01:17:50,285 --> 01:17:52,549
He's definitely not one to...

1092
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:55,680
he rarely wants to go out anymore.

1093
01:17:55,723 --> 01:17:58,817
And if he does,
it's with a limited group of people

1094
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:01,158
that he's comfortable with.

1095
01:18:01,196 --> 01:18:03,960
That is like a 360 from when I met Tony.

1096
01:18:03,998 --> 01:18:05,932
I mean, Tony was like...

1097
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:08,595
You'd go out in a group of 100 people,

1098
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:12,197
and he'd be the one that's cracking jokes,

1099
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,470
telling his life story.

1100
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,376
That definitely has changed.

1101
01:18:25,386 --> 01:18:28,321
He's not comfortable
in his own body.

1102
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:31,154
Whether he's always felt that way or not,
I don't know.

1103
01:18:31,192 --> 01:18:34,389
But outwardly it didn't appear that way.

1104
01:18:36,264 --> 01:18:38,391
I mean, he really is...

1105
01:18:40,368 --> 01:18:41,733
Different.

1106
01:18:59,287 --> 01:19:03,485
<i>I'm exhausted. I've lost 27 pounds.</i>

1107
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:08,162
I'm about 152 pounds right now.

1108
01:19:08,196 --> 01:19:10,528
Two weeks ago, I was 150,

1109
01:19:10,565 --> 01:19:12,556
So I've been eating my ass off.

1110
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,898
But I don't sleep.

1111
01:19:14,936 --> 01:19:17,063
I have no appetite.

1112
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:21,066
Not because I'm not hungry.

1113
01:19:22,677 --> 01:19:26,272
But because I'm so fucking wound up
and angry all the time,

1114
01:19:26,314 --> 01:19:28,714
nothing tastes good, nothing...

1115
01:19:29,984 --> 01:19:33,818
It's easier to sit and smoke than it is to get up
and make a fucking sandwich.

1116
01:19:36,557 --> 01:19:42,223
But if she came home and said,
"I just can't get by. We're done,"

1117
01:19:42,263 --> 01:19:44,026
I wouldn't blame her.

1118
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:46,397
It'd kill me.

1119
01:19:48,603 --> 01:19:52,972
I believe I'd do just about anything
to hang on to my children and my wife.

1120
01:19:55,743 --> 01:19:58,576
I did not pressure Tony
to come back to church.

1121
01:20:00,114 --> 01:20:02,105
We rarely talked about it.

1122
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:06,152
But as things have...

1123
01:20:08,623 --> 01:20:11,023
taken some turns
over the last few months...

1124
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:16,688
We have talked about it bringing us
closer together as a family,

1125
01:20:17,732 --> 01:20:20,599
And that it was important for all of us to...

1126
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:26,638
go to church together, get communion,

1127
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:30,075
hear the same things and experience
the same things

1128
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:33,410
- religiously.
- To participate as a family.

1129
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:35,109
It almost feels

1130
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:37,640
like we're taking back some kind of control

1131
01:20:37,685 --> 01:20:44,818
and not leaving what we believe
to be the right religious choice for us,

1132
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:47,293
- for our family.
- You know...

1133
01:20:56,037 --> 01:21:00,303
I'm not going to be ashamed
of an awful lot of things anymore.

1134
01:21:00,341 --> 01:21:02,741
Being Catholic is one of them.

1135
01:21:10,885 --> 01:21:14,446
I've just had to suck it up in a lot of ways, so...

1136
01:22:20,988 --> 01:22:23,422
<i>That was incredible.</i>

1137
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:26,752
<i>That was the bombl</i>

1138
01:22:36,704 --> 01:22:39,764
When did you stop believing
in heaven and hell?

1139
01:22:41,008 --> 01:22:43,476
I don't think I ever believed in hell.

1140
01:22:44,812 --> 01:22:47,280
It's a state, not a place.

1141
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:49,840
And heaven to me is a state, not a place.

1142
01:22:49,884 --> 01:22:51,784
Do you believe in God at the present time?

1143
01:22:51,819 --> 01:22:53,912
- Oh, yeah.
- You do?

1144
01:22:53,955 --> 01:22:56,651
But you don't believe in heaven or hell?

1145
01:22:56,691 --> 01:23:00,183
No, I believe in a state, but not a place.

1146
01:23:00,228 --> 01:23:02,560
When did you stop believing
in heaven and hell?

1147
01:23:02,597 --> 01:23:06,124
I've always believed in heaven and hell,
as a state.

1148
01:26:48,022 --> 01:26:49,011
