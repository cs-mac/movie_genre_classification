<i>Every five seconds, someone lives.</i>

3
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,640
<i>And every eight
seconds, someone dies.</i>

4
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And every second in between,</i>

5
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,048
<i>we're here</i>

6
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:40,953
<i>or here</i>

7
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,367
<i>time...</i>

8
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,818
<i>they say that time
is lost in memory.</i>

9
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,541
<i>We cannot touch, see
or control time.</i>

10
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:08,084
<i>We are essentially prisoners
in this fourth dimension.</i>

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
<i>And one day,</i>

12
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,577
<i>all of this will be gone.</i>

13
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:23,505
<i>Yet, for some reason,</i>

14
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:27,320
<i>we don't seem to care too much</i>

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,080
<i>and would rather
fight each other.</i>

16
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:45,868
<i>The truth is...</i>

17
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,984
<i>we are not really
here for that long.</i>

18
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:56,242
<i>And for the majority of us,
we only get one chance</i>

19
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:01,599
<i>at all of this.</i>

20
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,710
- Why?

21
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:06,959
The question that has plagued the human
mind since the birth of the world.

22
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,839
What is all this about?

23
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,157
Who am I

24
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,009
and how did we all get here?

25
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,805
I find it interesting that
everything seems so strange to us.

26
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,321
If we look at a word too long,

27
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:23,204
if we really think too much,

28
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,396
It already doesn't make sense.

29
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,586
How strange is everything?

30
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:32,140
We float on a giant water-covered
ball in the middle of nothing.

31
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:35,104
Why is it so strange?

32
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:37,735
Why does it seem so weird?

33
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,584
What are we comparing this to?

34
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:44,266
I want honest answers here, people.
Right now.

35
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,586
The question is of course the ultimate one:

36
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,169
"Why are we here?"

37
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,219
I know what I think.

38
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:52,938
I wanna hear what you all think.

39
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,391
Jennifer?

40
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,371
- The bible has all the
answers for me, Mr. Wertz.

41
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,539
- Thank you.

42
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,345
Finally some truth in this room.

43
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:06,039
I wanna hear something new for once.
Something

44
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,607
totally different.

45
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:10,450
Raise your hands, people.

46
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:13,200
Dennis?
- Mathematically speaking,

47
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,678
we're most likely a microscopic
molecule in an atom that... that

48
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:19,045
makes up something a lot
larger than we can comprehend.

49
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,534
If we add time to the equation.

50
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,468
We could... we could be making up the
dirt on the bottom of the universal sizes

51
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,927
elephant that... that has taken
one step in our galaxy's lifetime.

52
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:32,249
- That's very interesting,
Dennis. And is this your truth?

53
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,146
- It just seems to
make sense to me.

54
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,335
You know? We used to think
that inside an atom was a

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,511
couple of nuclei. Now we've
discovered an entire cosmos.

56
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:43,941
The... the solar system itself resembles
the interior rotation of an atom anyway.

57
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,216
Science has to play a part in all of this.

58
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,168
- Take your pants off and prove it!

59
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,082
- Please, please... ladies
and gentlemen, please.

60
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,450
Anyone else?

61
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:55,682
What do you think?

62
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,244
Aidan,

63
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,116
what do you think?

64
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,887
- I... I believe in the unknown.

65
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,959
I don't know. I don't think we'll ever
know the answer to that question.

66
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,108
- So you believe in nothing?

67
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:12,139
- Oh, belief and reality
are two different things.

68
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,267
- Well, what about when you die?

69
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,161
- When <i>I</i> die?
- All of us.

70
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,017
Well, let me ask <i>you</i>, Jennifer.

71
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,489
What happens when you die?

72
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,088
- Heaven...

73
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:27,338
or hell.

74
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:29,377
- Dennis?

75
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:33,065
- That universal sized elephant
just keeps on walking.

76
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,322
- OK... OK.

77
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:36,401
Now, please, Aidan.

78
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,937
- We've all been dead a lot
longer than we've been alive.

79
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,114
- OK now down to business.
Ladies and

80
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,329
gentlemen, please
take out your papers.

81
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:48,385
Officially,

82
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,552
exclusively and mathematically

83
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:55,553
this is your final Philosophy exam for
the term this semester and the year.

84
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:01,624
Unfortunately, the remainder of your
possible careers finals to this point.

85
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,158
So, if you feel you're not ready,

86
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:08,255
bad luck. You have four and
a half hours, starting now.

87
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,851
Good luck. See you in the future.

88
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:30,712
- Hello.

89
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,032
- What?

90
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,406
- You're gonna listen
to me very carefully.

91
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:39,323
Don't go to the Ritz East Gate motel.

92
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,649
- What is that supposed to mean?

93
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,136
- Don't go to the East Gate motel.

94
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:45,071
Stay away.

95
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:46,868
- Wait!

96
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:50,998
Wait... wait a minute!

97
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:19,746
- So... Sarah...

98
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,810
- Haven't heard of her.
 It's open!

99
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,435
- Uh... She's pretty cute.

100
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,176
- Really?
- She's got it going on.

101
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:26,608
- How?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,352
- Hey, how was your exam?

103
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,740
- Alright, she's cute. You just... are
you gonna talk to to me about her?

104
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:36,483
- Oh, what's cute about her?
- Uh...

105
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,962
She's chubby, she's funny...
- Are you OK?

106
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:41,948
- I'm having...

107
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,623
running round and round
just doing finals stuff and...

108
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:47,224
- Did you just say that she's chubby
and that's what you love about her?

109
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,928
- Yeah.
- That's odd? That's...

110
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:51,552
- She lost so much weight, so.
- She was sweet, wasn't she?

111
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,645
- I'm taking my bike after
the exam and someone

112
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,973
came up to me and it
was... me, like...

113
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,135
- You?
- My clothes, my face,

114
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,690
my voice, everything.
- Were you standing in front of a girl?

115
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,195
- Was it like a cousin or relative
or something that you didn't...

116
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,219
- At first I thought it
was a joke, but then...

117
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,785
when I actually looked it freaked me out.

118
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,492
- Are you on drugs?-Are you
sure you want me to...

119
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:13,668
- He said "Don't go to
the Ritz East Gate Motel."

120
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,209
- How? Are you gonna do it for me?

121
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,736
- I hate to...
- I just don't see why...

122
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,982
- What?
- Why would he say that?

123
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,561
- Don't go in the Ritz East Gate Motel?

124
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,323
- Yeah.
- What's going on down there?

125
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:35,702
- Hello Gran.

126
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,476
- I've seen you before.

127
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:40,975
- Yeah. Something like that.

128
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:46,921
Hello?

129
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,797
Yeah, who else?

130
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,769
Yes. Middle name?

131
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,266
Uh, it's Sal.

132
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,387
Listen man, I gotta go.

133
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,266
- How was your exam?
- Yeah, it was fine, just fine.

134
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,477
Fingers crossed.

135
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,927
- What's the matter?

136
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:12,662
- Something... happened this morning.

137
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:15,527
- Are you in trouble?
- No, nothing like that, just...

138
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,930
something weird happened.

139
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,105
I saw something I can't explain and...

140
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:24,191
does our family have a
history of mental illness,

141
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,138
depression, paranoia,

142
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,998
hallucinations?

143
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,620
- A golf ball

144
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,978
drowned your grandfather, you know?
- Yes, I know, Gran.

145
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,128
- Wish I could see him again.

146
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:49,313
Your great-grandmother had diabetes,
there is a history of cancer, and

147
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:52,347
both was too, in the men.

148
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,128
What does Lauren think?

149
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,724
- Oh, nothing.

150
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,871
- When are you two
gonna get married?

151
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:08,362
- I don't know, grandma. Soon, maybe.

152
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,648
- But first

153
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:15,982
I want great-grandchildren and I want to
be at the wedding, but not in that order.

154
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:17,492
- OK.

155
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,878
- So, nothing brain related?

156
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:27,855
I just wanna make sure it's
not all just... in my head.

157
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,917
- Isn't everything just

158
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,362
in your head?

159
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,055
Will you read to me?

160
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:39,761
- Yeah, sure.

161
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:41,981
What shall we read?

162
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,856
The four swans

163
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,117
where did we stop?

164
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:50,970
- I'm at the beginning.

165
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,020
- It's a good place.

166
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,722
- Can I help you? Aidan.

167
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,087
- Hey, Lauren.

168
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,009
- What are you doing here?

169
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,485
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you worked here.

170
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:44,986
How's things?

171
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:47,228
- Things are good.

172
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,187
- How's your shift going?

173
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,766
- It's fine. Good.

174
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,227
Are you here for something?

175
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,396
- This is gonna sound strange.

176
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,977
Have I been here before?

177
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:04,130
- I don't know. Shouldn't
you know that?

178
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:07,492
- I know it sounds weird,
but have you seen me here

179
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:10,187
before? Like someone who
looks a lot like me?

180
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,306
- Uh, I don't think so. I...

181
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,685
- E... Everything alright here?

182
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:18,908
- Yeah, it's fine.

183
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,821
- He said "Don't go to
the Ritz East Gate Motel."

184
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:07,053
Well, here I am.

185
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:09,892
- Yeah...

186
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,134
That's an interesting story.

187
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:16,575
And I don't know whether I
should believe a word of it.

188
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:19,874
- That makes two of us.
- Don't you mean two of you?

189
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,856
- So what are you doing now?

190
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:28,378
- Nothing. Nothing much. Just working.

191
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,333
- Just working?

192
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:34,880
So you work, you go home
and you do absolutely nothing?

193
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,660
- No. I do things.
- And?

194
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,204
- And I'm doing a painting course.

195
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,286
- Painting? Really?

196
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,293
Finally.
- Yeah.

197
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,041
- And how's your grandma?

198
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,683
- She's OK.

199
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,685
Uh... we had to put her
in a home, pretty much.

200
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,351
Just after we broke up.
- Oh...

201
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,355
OK...

202
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,082
- It's been good to see
you again, Lauren.

203
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,644
- Good to see you, too, Aidan.

204
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,334
- You still live around here?

205
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,889
- No, I've moved, actually.

206
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,395
- Do you want a lift?

207
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:02,154
- Aidan?

208
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,044
- Yeah?

209
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,911
- I think I should tell you something.

210
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,052
- Yeah?

211
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,458
- Something I should have
told you a while ago.

212
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,567
Well, I'm just gonna say it.

213
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,883
Look out!

214
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,081
- OK...

215
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,682
There's no signs of
concussion or anything.

216
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:50,246
And he's gonna be sore for
a couple of days, but

217
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,378
other than that, he's
gonna be absolutely fine.

218
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:53,793
- OK.

219
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,260
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

220
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:57,129
- Hey man.

221
00:16:57,153 --> 00:16:58,493
- Hi... hi.

222
00:16:58,723 --> 00:16:59,723
- Hey.
- Hi.

223
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,028
- How are you feeling?

224
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,176
- Fine.
- Are you okay?

225
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,340
- You look pretty...
- What happened?

226
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,439
- You were in a car accident.
- Yeah, it was pretty bad.

227
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:16,263
And... and the... the... the doctor called
your grandmother and they called me and...

228
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:19,374
And then I called Nick and... and
we've been here for a while now...

229
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:20,492
- Where's Lauren?

230
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,937
- Oh, and... and he said that you may have
hit your head. They think that maybe

231
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:27,265
you've hit your head, so... um to ask
you if... if... if your head hurts.

232
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,341
Where's Lauren?

233
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,356
We could get you some
water, we could...

234
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,984
Get him some water.
- Sit back.

235
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,601
- Sit back... look, look, relax. It's okay.
The doctor will be here any minute.

236
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,789
- Don't sit up. Just relax, it's fine.

237
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:38,898
- The doctor will be here...
- I'm fine.

238
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,039
- Sit back.

239
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:41,958
- Where's Lauren?

240
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,686
- You cannot leave the hospital.

241
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,756
You are allowed to use the phone
to call family and friends.

242
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,685
A lawyer has been assigned and
will be meeting with you tomorrow.

243
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,906
- So I'm being charged for something?

244
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,451
- Well, the family has stated that
they'd like to press charges.

245
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:05,272
Given the circumstances of your past
relationship with the deceased,

246
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:08,457
they're having a hard time understanding
what she was doing in the car with you.

247
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,378
- Man, I was just going
to drive her home.

248
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,374
- You don't have to explain to us.
- Yet.

249
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,434
- Well, I don't see
your lawyers present.

250
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:18,017
- Just some of the things that have to
be done these days, unfortunately.

251
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,294
Now, we have to be
very clear on this.

252
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,068
You cannot leave the hospital.

253
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,872
Even though you're not
in custody, if you do

254
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,748
leave here, it can make
things a lot worse.

255
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,781
Do you understand?

256
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:30,586
- Yeah.

257
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:31,992
- Good.

258
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,820
- Peanut butter and Russian currency,

259
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,305
the Atlantic Ocean and
a melted Rollerblade.

260
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,310
It's a great game. Really simple.

261
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:13,411
You think of two things,

262
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:14,632
any things,

263
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,276
the only rule is

264
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,934
they have to be as non-related as
possible, just like you and me.

265
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,977
A lava lamp and a dead horse kidney.

266
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,029
The Atlantic Ocean

267
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:27,005
and a melted Rollerblade.

268
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,661
Helps take your mind off things.

269
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Give it a go.

270
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:36,897
- No, thanks.

271
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:39,163
- Well,

272
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:40,988
maybe one day I'll

273
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,838
find someone to actually play with.

274
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,087
You're in some trouble, I see.

275
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,217
I know something you don't know.

276
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,326
Something weird happened to you.

277
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,036
Didn't it?

278
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,380
Something really strange.

279
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,707
Something you don't seem able
to explain and most likely...

280
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,731
- What?
- Git you into this mess.

281
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:13,731
- How do you know about that?

282
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:15,916
- I could tell you,

283
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:19,184
but you're gonna figure it out for
yourself no matter what I say.

284
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:21,972
But I can give you a hint.

285
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,885
Go to the East Gate motel.

286
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:30,573
- I knew it! I knew
something was going on.

287
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,011
- Room 41.

288
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,198
There's a hole in the bathroom.

289
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:37,388
In the ground. You have
to go into the floor!

290
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,035
- The floor?

291
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:44,574
- Exactly.

292
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,170
- Hi, Aidan.

293
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:05,888
This is going to help you relax and sleep

294
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,212
and make sure you stay here tonight.

295
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,041
- Room 41, you said?

296
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,103
- And you're late!

297
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,458
- John turns up, and then,
his best friend.

298
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,125
And she brings up her brother,
You know who her brother is?

299
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:20,407
Sam! Jess!

300
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,019
- Yeah, looks funeral gonna be one night
next week I'm not sure when, but.

301
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,189
Um... I'll let you know when we've
got some more detail.

302
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,244
Uh, can you hang on for a moment?
I've got someone out here.

303
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,653
Uh, excuse me, can I help you? Come in.

304
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,420
Come in. I'll... I'll...

305
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,465
I'll have to... uh... call you back.

306
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,489
I've got to help somebody, OK?

307
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:04,958
Yes, sir, how can I help you?

308
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,003
- I just wanna get a room.

309
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:09,461
- Uh, fine, yes. We've got... uh...

310
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:14,194
got room. We've got room 11... eh... just
for yourself? One night?

311
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,519
- That's fine.

312
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:17,809
- How are you gonna pay for that?

313
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:19,276
Card? OK. Thank you.

314
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:26,371
OK...

315
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:29,606
Here you go.

316
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,379
OK, thanks very much. Good.

317
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,539
- It was late this afternoon
when a car swerved off.

318
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:40,647
Berkey Road and hit this
power pole behind me.

319
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:43,426
The passenger died on
site while the driver was

320
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,441
taken to the hospital
with minimal injuries.

321
00:25:45,465 --> 00:25:48,558
It is not yet known what caused
the car to lose control,

322
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,231
but police are pushing forward
for full investigation.

323
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:44,137
- Hey!

324
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,680
Get out of me

325
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
- Hey, man. It's me.
- Get out!

326
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,666
I'll stab you out!

327
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:52,847
- Aidan!

328
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,860
I read your paper.

329
00:30:55,183 --> 00:30:57,019
You really outdid yourself this time.

330
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,124
- You could have
told me, Mr. Wertz.

331
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,162
- You know, it's minds like yours

332
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:04,242
that... well... you really
think outside the box.

333
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,698
Me and a couple of colleagues of mine,

334
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:09,064
we meet every Wednesday to talk

335
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:10,611
about... science
related issues and...

336
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:27,283
- She's fine. You talk to her for
longer than sixty seconds and

337
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:29,995
she still informs you that a golf ball
thrown to my grandfather

338
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,245
- Grandfather. Yeah, I do remember that.

339
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,957
- I never actually told
her that we broke up.

340
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:41,392
- What?

341
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:44,014
After all this time?

342
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,423
- Yeah, after all this time.

343
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:48,571
- That's a bit strange, isn't it?

344
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,400
- It would have killed her.

345
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:55,179
She's still got that photo that you gave
her for her eightieth birthday of us.

346
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:57,002
She loves you.

347
00:31:58,713 --> 00:31:59,779
Still loves you.

348
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,230
- I miss your grandma.

349
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:10,107
- She called me out the other week and
she told me she wanted to go bowling.

350
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:11,454
I said "Are you serious?"

351
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,320
We went bowling and

352
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,625
Amy was in the stand bow. She
was in her slippers and gown.

353
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:21,120
Bowled a few balls within
the slab magazine thing.

354
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,506
She had fun.

355
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,647
- Yeah, that's cute.

356
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,844
- Mmm.
- I love bowling.

357
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,943
You remember that time that...
- ... we went bowling.

358
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,472
- Watch out!

359
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:21,060
- Can I get an ambulance please? To room 41.

360
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,645
East Gate motel.

361
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,633
- I don't know, like... he was
really weird. He was talking

362
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:18,482
about this room 41 of a
motel room that has a black

363
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:21,691
hole that... that leads to
yesterday and something about

364
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:24,765
like... he was in a car accident
with Lauren and she died.

365
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,729
And that he was the reason that she died?

366
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:31,194
And he's gonna be back
in time or something?

367
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:32,727
- Hey kid.
- Hi.

368
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,568
- How was your nap?

369
00:35:38,698 --> 00:35:39,877
- You don't believe, right?

370
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,553
- Come on, man, you're
actually joking, right?

371
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:45,003
- Come with me.
- Why? Did you lose it?

372
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:47,588
- What for?
- No, I'm trying to prove a point.

373
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,362
Call him.

374
00:35:58,393 --> 00:35:59,393
- Hello?

375
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:01,433
Who? Aidan.

376
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:03,551
This is you, Aidan.

377
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:06,172
- It's the other Aidan. He hasn't
been through this yet, right?

378
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:08,880
- If this is Aidan, what's
my brother's middle name?

379
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:10,742
- Uh, it's Sal.

380
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:13,715
Listen man, I gotta go.

381
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:14,947
- Hello?

382
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:16,338
Who tal...

383
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,150
He hung up.

384
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,424
- What? Are you sure?
- <i>You</i> hung up.

385
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:23,478
Come on, this is
actually a joke, right?

386
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:25,720
- Listen, you guys were
both there, after the

387
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,041
accident, in the hospital.
It's all gonna happen.

388
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:31,634
- Look, it's just weird, alright?
This is just getting really weird,

389
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:34,527
Aidan. Look, I... I know that you had
problems getting over Lauren and I

390
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:37,921
understand that, really, we do, we
care about you a lot, but Nick and I,

391
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,170
we checked her Facebook page before
and she was online. She's not dead.

392
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:43,686
- Not yet!
- Not <i>yet?!</i>

393
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,750
Can you go forward in time?

394
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,352
Like in the future?
- I don't know.

395
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:50,792
- What if Nick said that to you?

396
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:55,293
You know, "Ah, hey, I've found a
motel room 41 with a black hole.

397
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:56,659
- Crazy.
- But at least check it out.

398
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:57,909
- Crazy.
- It's crazy.

399
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,401
- No.

400
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,609
Because you remember this time
last year I told both of you

401
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,466
to come with me to the petrol station.

402
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:07,712
And I've been drinking

403
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,948
but I saw Elvis.

404
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:12,443
- Oh, hell no.
- He's alive.

405
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,265
I saw him and you wouldn't believe me.
- Shut up.

406
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:15,112
- And you wouldn't believe me.
- Shut up.

407
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,874
- Guys, you're not listening to me!

408
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,744
Just come to the motel with me
and I can prove it all to you!

409
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:22,324
- I'm sorry, OK? We're not gonna come, OK?

410
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,917
- Oh, oh... here, look what we've done.

411
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,331
- When all this happens...
- Look what we've done.

412
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,596
- Where are you going?
- When all this happens, just act surprised.

413
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,390
- Where you going, Sully????
- Aidan...

414
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,034
- I'm leaving.

415
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,839
- Look...

416
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,969
- He's probably going for a sniff.
- He's not going for a sniff.

417
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:03,979
- Aidan... Hello, what brings you here?

418
00:41:04,184 --> 00:41:06,311
- Hey, Mr. Wertz. Sorry to bother you.

419
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:09,472
I got your listing from the... university.

420
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,175
You said you had a meeting here?
- Yes!

421
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,026
Y... yes, of course. Please, come in.

422
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:15,402
- Thanks...

423
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:17,727
- It's screwed, but I disagree.

424
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:21,127
The fundamental world
of mathematics exists

425
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,220
only to comprehend the impossible.

426
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,166
One plus one does not always equal two.

427
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:28,288
- Everyone, this is Aidan.

428
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:33,934
Professor Jacobs has a fascination with
the alternative perspective of knowledge.

429
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:37,604
- To think, to know is to...
- ... know what to think.

430
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:41,027
Aidan, this is my very
old friend,

431
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:42,202
 Mr. Wertz.

432
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:46,372
- Aidan takes my philosophy class.
Top grades.

433
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:49,626
- So, what brings you here, Aidan?
- I've got a few questions.

434
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:50,945
- "Why" questions?

435
00:41:51,897 --> 00:41:53,300
- Not why, how.

436
00:41:54,623 --> 00:41:56,960
- It's about time travel.
- Ah, excellent.

437
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:59,088
- Interest or research?
- Both.

438
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,771
- Would you go forward or back?

439
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:02,269
- You can't go back.

440
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,505
It's already happened.
Forward is the most probable outcome.

441
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,658
It's being proven
that it's possible.

442
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,009
- I'm writing a book.

443
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:13,356
A novel, actually. So some of the questions
I ask may seem a little out there.

444
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,598
- We need more time-travel
books in this world.

445
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:18,533
- We don't need more books,
Mr. Wertz. We do need more

446
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:21,480
scientists that make the ideas
in those books a reality.

447
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:24,702
- Professor Jacobs...
- I'm sorry, Aidan. Go on.

448
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:30,067
- Uh... It's about a guy who finds a hole
in a room that leads to yesterday.

449
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,503
He goes through it and then
comes back out twelve hours earlier.

450
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,465
- Intriguing.
- Impossible.

451
00:42:35,716 --> 00:42:36,783
- Let him finish.

452
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:41,191
- If you were to travel backwards,
in time, say, to yesterday,

453
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,638
would you be... able to change your future?

454
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:47,708
- That all depends on the rules
of the time travel setting.

455
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,939
Can the traveler see
alternate versions of himself?

456
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:51,820
- Yes. Definitely.

457
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:54,218
- So that's complicated.

458
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:57,431
because time doesn't exist
in nature, of course.

459
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:59,714
It's a measurement of
movement in space.

460
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,276
- I tend to disagree with that.
Nature is based in time.

461
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,329
But we can go on and
on all night arguing

462
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:08,503
about what does and
doesn't exist.

463
00:43:09,234 --> 00:43:10,234
- I guess.

464
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,300
So, what are the rules?

465
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:14,600
How does it all work?

466
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:18,368
- Well, in fiction there are
four elements of time.

467
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:19,998
- What about non-fiction?

468
00:43:20,023 --> 00:43:22,022
- I guess it would be the same.

469
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:25,236
If you could travel through time,

470
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:27,909
there would have to be
a hole in space-time,

471
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,332
a rip, if you like.

472
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,978
If you could survive the
journey through the hole,

473
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:34,917
well, you'd arrive at the same
space at a different time,

474
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:37,362
or a different space, different time.

475
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,132
- Correct me if I'm wrong.
- Yeah, like a wormhole or a Stargate.

476
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:43,301
Go on. You're doing fine.

477
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,049
- So, if you could travel
back through... uh...

478
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:50,018
I'll tell you what.
A visual might be useful here.

479
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:52,284
- What are you doing?

480
00:43:53,627 --> 00:43:56,690
- So, this is your life from birth to death.

481
00:43:57,432 --> 00:43:59,183
And this is you today.

482
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:02,213
So, if we would go back in time to...

483
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:03,759
- Yesterday.
- ... yesterday,

484
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:08,011
OK, now, if time is circular,

485
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:11,722
you would bring space back to yourself

486
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:13,464
and travel through.

487
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:16,449
You could in theory visit
past versions of yourself.

488
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:21,720
In a two parallel universe theory

489
00:44:22,822 --> 00:44:25,886
one that is all in slices,

490
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:27,907
an infinite amount really,

491
00:44:28,768 --> 00:44:32,929
it wouldn't actually be time but
another dimension in reality.

492
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:36,147
- Because time...
- Doesn't exist in nature.

493
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:37,650
Well, I need to add that.

494
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,748
- So, what does this man do
when he goes through the hole?

495
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,877
- Uh... well, he's trying to save somebody.

496
00:44:44,197 --> 00:44:45,197
A girl.

497
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,383
- Classic.
- Predictable.

498
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:50,314
- So, he's already in a parallel universe,

499
00:44:50,728 --> 00:44:54,505
because past versions of himself have
already visited him before he traveled.

500
00:44:54,947 --> 00:44:56,797
You seem confused by
your own writing.

501
00:44:56,824 --> 00:44:58,429
It's very confusing.

502
00:44:58,513 --> 00:45:01,159
There's no pattern to it. He
tried to stop the accident

503
00:45:01,184 --> 00:45:03,640
as many times as he could,
but nothing ever worked.

504
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:07,759
- If he can't change his
own future surely he can

505
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:10,474
change the future of a
different version of himself.

506
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,330
Exactly. He cannot
change his own line of

507
00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:15,580
existence and yet
influence another line.

508
00:45:16,282 --> 00:45:17,415
- Then that sucks.

509
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:22,830
- So he needs to change a
different version of himself

510
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,328
to get the desired result.

511
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:28,219
- This story needs more emotion.
How does he know this girl?

512
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,210
- Uh, it's his ex-girlfriend.

513
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:35,448
- Weak, overused plot element. He
needs to save a part of himself.

514
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:38,949
- But wouldn't the girl be a part
of himself? A part of his history?

515
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:43,362
- Only if he set up a relationship in
the beginning. Set up to destroy.

516
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:46,641
It... lacks surprise, but it works.

517
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:49,018
What you'd really need is a twist.

518
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:52,231
- There are a lot of twists.
- But..

519
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:54,825
That's what keeps it into these days.

520
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,963
Special effects and twists.

521
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,675
- None. He just goes through the hole.
Turns up at the same hole.

522
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:05,156
- Sounds like the last 25
years of my marriage.

523
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,352
- Well, thanks for letting me
speak to your friends tonight, Mr. Wertz.

524
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:20,820
- You're more than welcome, mate.

525
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,772
Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah.

526
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:25,430
I'm all good.
- So where would you go?

527
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:26,696
If you could?

528
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:29,399
- I don't know.

529
00:46:31,962 --> 00:46:32,962
How about you?

530
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,219
Forward first

531
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:37,086
and then back to fix it.

532
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,188
When I was twelve years
old, I had this idea.

533
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:43,369
Most of my friends had
dreams of flying.

534
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:46,719
Mine were of traveling through
time, as a matter of fact.

535
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,556
I'd sit down at my grandfather's
typewriter and write to the universe.

536
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:53,055
The idea was to become famous.

537
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:56,177
I'd put the call out that I
wanted to travel through time.

538
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:57,602
Go on T.V.,...

539
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,797
... newspapers, concerts, t-shirts, books,

540
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,439
really put the word out there that

541
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,008
I wanted to travel through time.

542
00:47:06,602 --> 00:47:09,844
But I realized that time travel
in my lifetime would be impossible.

543
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:11,768
So I hoped that

544
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:16,195
someone in the future would
remember the time travel kid.

545
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:18,500
When time travel was actually possible,

546
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:22,057
you know? They'd go back
and come and get me.

547
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:24,268
- Maybe one day.

548
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:30,403
- So, your character... can it go forward?

549
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,307
- Only back.

550
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:35,284
- Make sure he goes back
for the right reasons.

551
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:37,652
Make sure he influences

552
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:39,176
the most important situations.

553
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:41,223
- I will.

554
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:39,097
- Aidan, 27. Graduated two years ago,

555
00:48:39,122 --> 00:48:42,704
extremely high marks in
philosophy and psychology.

556
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,140
You were a state champion scout member.

557
00:48:49,335 --> 00:48:51,999
Mom left you as a baby,
then Gran took the rights.

558
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:53,880
You broke up with
Lauren a few years ago,

559
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:56,322
decided to take her on a joy ride.

560
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,986
You crashed the car, killed her,

561
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,321
then ran away and then
you find yourself here.

562
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:04,204
- Dum, dum, dum...

563
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:09,289
Can I ask you why you
left the hospital?

564
00:49:10,977 --> 00:49:11,977
- I don't know.

565
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,127
- Do you remember us telling
you that you shouldn't?

566
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:17,665
- Yeah.

567
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:22,039
- You're deep in a lot
of trouble, Aidan.

568
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,328
We know what you did and why you did it.

569
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:30,498
Were you supposed to
die in that crash?

570
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:32,447
Is that why you're upset?

571
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,089
Your plan didn't work out properly?

572
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,788
- I had nothing to do with it.

573
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,269
The accident.

574
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:40,449
- Ah...

575
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:43,159
the boy's triggered a memory.

576
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:45,322
Things don't add up, Aidan.

577
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:48,192
You seemed genuinely
concerned the last time we

578
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:50,253
spoke to you, then you
decided to just run off.

579
00:49:50,644 --> 00:49:52,041
Not to get away,

580
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:55,449
but to go back to... where
you... picked her up from.

581
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:05,875
So, the question is...

582
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:08,138
what happens next?

583
00:50:10,086 --> 00:50:11,486
- What happens, Aidan?

584
00:50:19,221 --> 00:50:20,488
- You confess to us,

585
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:22,197
right now.

586
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,719
You're heading to court,

587
00:50:25,408 --> 00:50:26,756
the judge will be lenient,

588
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,318
say nothing, confess silence,

589
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:32,782
your penalty will be
something to regret.

590
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:35,029
- So what's it gonna be?

591
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:39,697
- You wanna know the truth?

592
00:50:40,324 --> 00:50:41,324
- Please.

593
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:44,936
- I found a time portal.

594
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:47,106
A hole that leads back to yesterday.

595
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,433
- Wow...
- This is classified as insanity.

596
00:50:51,457 --> 00:50:53,457
- I tried to go back and stop the accident.

597
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:57,830
- I couldn't save her.
- They never can.

598
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,444
- So you killed her and then went back in
time to stop yourself from killing her?

599
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:02,740
- I'm telling you the truth.

600
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:07,320
- So, you can really travel back in time?

601
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,959
So, why waste that privilege
on trying to save Lauren?

602
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,027
You still love her.

603
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,649
- I went back to stop the
accident from happening.

604
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:24,892
To save her.

605
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:26,447
I couldn't.

606
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,507
So I have to go back and try again.

607
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:39,727
- Why not go back in time and
break yourself out of custody?

608
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,823
- I'm not the only one of me out there.

609
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,178
Thanks for the idea.

610
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,250
- Woohoo!

611
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:02,516
Hoohoohoo.

612
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:07,688
- Come on! Come dance with me! Come dance.

613
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:11,712
Come dance with me!

614
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,429
- You'll be waiting.
You're not even funny.

615
00:52:15,734 --> 00:52:16,934
- Ha-ha! You got Meth?

616
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:19,259
Got heroin? Got any of the good kind?

617
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:22,399
Huh? You got to answer.
You got to answer to me.

618
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:29,566
Never. We're in this together. Dancin',
dancin', you gonna dance with me?

619
00:52:29,627 --> 00:52:31,950
Try this step. This works well.
This works well.

620
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,080
Try this step.

621
00:52:33,377 --> 00:52:36,982
Try it. Try these. Try dancing with me.
- Hey, hey, hey... you have to swap with me.

622
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:39,111
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

623
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,744
Alright!

624
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:46,361
Oh, good step!

625
00:52:46,572 --> 00:52:47,772
Oh! Oh!
- OK... go.

626
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:51,874
- Oh, wow! Look!
- Shh!

627
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,912
- Gotta keep dancing, man.
We're ahead of you, beginner.

628
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:58,275
it can't hurt.

629
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:00,299
We'd go home. Really good, man.

630
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:06,462
Don't leave me. Don't go.
Don't go! Don't leave me!

631
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:08,219
Don't go! Don't leave me!

632
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,609
Come back! Come back!

633
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,268
Me and you!

634
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,604
Oh!

635
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Hey!

636
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,039
Hey!

637
00:57:54,586 --> 00:57:55,586
It's me, Aidan.

638
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,914
- Sorry? Can... can I help you?

639
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:01,414
- You don't remember, do you?

640
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:03,711
- I'm sorry?

641
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,281
- Can I ask you a question?

642
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:08,240
- I think you just did.

643
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:11,296
- What do you do for a living?

644
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:14,501
- I'm a lawyer.

645
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,687
- Was there ever a chance any lot of
this could have gone another way?

646
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,727
- I don't know what you mean.

647
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,531
- Like your lot could have changed?
Like you weren't gonna be a lawyer?

648
00:58:28,106 --> 00:58:29,106
- Well,

649
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:32,783
yes, as a matter of fact,
I almost went off to war.

650
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:34,804
- And then what happened?

651
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,114
- I... I registered and I
was preparing to leave

652
00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,075
and then the strangest thing happened.

653
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,871
I'm sorry. I don't know you.

654
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:48,840
- That's alright. You've said enough.

655
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,310
You've changed, moved on,
it's... it's possible.

656
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,754
- OK.

657
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,544
- Tomato sauce

658
00:58:59,858 --> 00:59:01,391
and the musical Archie.

659
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:08,420
- A blue guitar and a
frozen gorilla lamp.

660
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:20,643
- Hello?

661
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,038
- I've seen you before.

662
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:37,462
- Grandma.

663
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:41,813
- I wish...

664
00:59:43,399 --> 00:59:45,732
I could see your grandfather again.

665
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:53,312
- Can I take you somewhere?

666
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:01,392
No...

667
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,017
- I'm so sorry.

668
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:05,993
- No, nothing.

669
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:09,495
- Will you read to me?

670
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:11,305
- Yeah, sure.

671
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:16,259
- In my bag

672
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:19,298
at the top.

673
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:24,276
- Where shall we begin?

674
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,247
- The end.

675
01:02:07,197 --> 01:02:09,897
- Oh, well, you again!

676
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:12,035
Is this the first time?

677
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:13,565
Or the second time?

678
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:16,128
Yesterday or... or tomorrow?

679
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,517
Who knows? Who cares?

680
01:02:18,728 --> 01:02:21,204
- You might wanna put that knife down.
- Oh no,

681
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:23,188
you can't stop me from cutting myself.

682
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:25,259
Don't you get it yet?

683
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,691
If I don't cut myself, I
don't get take to hospital,

684
01:02:28,716 --> 01:02:30,525
I don't meet you for the first time,

685
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:32,397
and tell you to come here!

686
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:33,831
- I can't change it?

687
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:37,629
- You can only influence it
to change it, not intervene.

688
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:42,270
You can't physically stop
me from cutting myself!

689
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:45,554
- So how do you... know that you're
gonna tell me to come here

690
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:48,902
if I'm already standing in front of you and
you haven't been to the hospital yet?

691
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,454
- Exactly!

692
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:55,863
So how do I influence time?

693
01:03:08,925 --> 01:03:11,096
- Open the door please, it's the management.

694
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:12,334
- I saw you.

695
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:16,213
A better version...
a different version of you.

696
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:17,427
You saw her, did you?

697
01:03:17,796 --> 01:03:20,993
- Thought I'd try it out.
- Worse. It will change your life.

698
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:23,764
- Not exactly, but close enough, right?

699
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:28,085
What the hell?

700
01:03:29,678 --> 01:03:31,225
- You think that's how we go there?

701
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,558
- You're a smart one!

702
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:38,234
- How did you do it?

703
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,980
How did you influence the
alternate version of you to do...

704
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:45,241
- The trick is to stop the person from being
in the situation in the first place.

705
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:47,045
if you can figure that out.

706
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:48,541
Open please.
Open up.

707
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:50,631
Remember...

708
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:53,600
time travels with you.

709
01:08:52,077 --> 01:08:53,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

710
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:56,350
- I'm looking for Bloodfield.

711
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:58,595
- Oh, you're a field away from there.

712
01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:00,108
- Oh, really?

713
01:09:01,874 --> 01:09:03,905
- Say... you look familiar.

714
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:06,402
Do we know each other?

715
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:07,935
- Not yet.

716
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:10,396
Aidan.

717
01:09:11,341 --> 01:09:12,341
- Dwight.

718
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,859
This is Aidan, dear.

719
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,050
- Oh.
- Aidan, this is my wife.

720
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:11,666
- Hello. Nice to meet you, Aidan. Stop it...

721
01:10:12,214 --> 01:10:14,611
- I'm going to give Aidan a lift in
the town. Would you like anything?

722
01:10:14,635 --> 01:10:17,896
- Yeah, actually, if you could return the
library books for me that would be great.

723
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:23,439
Say, you look awfully familiar to me.

724
01:10:24,605 --> 01:10:26,993
- I get that a lot.
- I said the same thing.

725
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,844
- Must just be all in my head.

726
01:10:34,903 --> 01:10:36,512
- Isn't everything all just in your head?

727
01:10:42,598 --> 01:10:44,198
- Well, we should be off.

728
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:45,356
- OK.

729
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:47,216
Bye.

730
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:49,457
Lovely to meet you, Aidan.

731
01:10:50,044 --> 01:10:51,044
- You too.

732
01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:52,528
- Goodbye.

733
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:24,739
- A golf ball

734
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,348
drowned your grandfather. You know?

735
01:11:33,537 --> 01:11:35,337
Wish I could see him again.

736
01:11:58,293 --> 01:11:59,626
- I've got something.

737
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:03,223
- What is it?

738
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:05,152
- You have to open it tomorrow.

739
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:06,449
- Tomorrow?

740
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:08,840
- Don't open it until then.

741
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:10,908
It's very important.

742
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:21,819
See you soon.

743
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:07,947
- So,

744
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:09,174
your character,

745
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:10,671
can it go forward?

746
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:12,237
- Only back.

747
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:15,931
- Make sure he goes back
for the right reasons.

748
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:19,517
Make sure he influences the
most important situations.

749
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:22,813
- I will.

750
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:56,879
- You have to go to the East Gate motel.

751
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:28,352
- Can I walk you home?

752
01:15:47,856 --> 01:15:48,856
- The truth is

753
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:52,155
we're not really here for that long.

754
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:59,153
And for the majority of us,
we only get one chance.

755
01:16:03,168 --> 01:16:04,168
At all of this.
