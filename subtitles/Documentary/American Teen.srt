1
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,954
<i>August 24th, 8:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>Warsaw, Indiana.</i>

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,966
<i>The first day of senior year.</i>

3
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,442
<i>Warsaw is your typical</i>
<i>Midwestern town,</i>

4
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,450
<i>mostly white, mostly Christian,</i>
<i>red state all the way,</i>

5
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,256
<i>middle-class,</i>
<i>but some very wealthy families</i>

6
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,693
<i>and far-from-wealthy families, like mine.</i>

7
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,837
<i>Good morning, staff and students,</i>

8
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,999
<i>we're going to have a wonderful day</i>
<i>here at WCHS.</i>

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,180
<i>Our Government teacher, Mr. Grose,</i>
<i>taught us that America is a meritocracy.</i>

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,879
<i>But here, it's a total caste system.</i>

11
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,582
<i>At the top is</i>
<i>the most popular group of girls,</i>

12
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,285
<i>led by queen bee Megan Krizmanich.</i>

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,624
<i>And then there are the jocks, who in</i>
<i>our school are the basketball players.</i>

14
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,689
<i>Colin Clemens is the star of the team,</i>

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,861
<i>which means he's second</i>
<i>only to Jesus in Warsaw.</i>

16
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,433
<i>At the opposite end of the spectrum</i>
<i>is Jake Tusing,</i>

17
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,203
<i>your quintessential</i>
<i>marching-band nerd.</i>

18
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,541
<i>Then there's</i>
<i>my best friend Clarke and me.</i>

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,514
<i>I guess you could say</i>
<i>we're the in-betweens.</i>

20
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,042
<i>This is all we've known</i>
<i>since we were little kids,</i>

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,553
<i>and in nine months, it'll all be over.</i>

22
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,249
<i>In the meantime, all we have to do is,</i>

23
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,624
<i>you know, figure out who we really are</i>
<i>and where we're headed in life.</i>

24
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:09,953
<i>Holy shit!</i>

25
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,247
It's gonna be a good year.

26
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,578
Whatever, dude, it's gonna suck.

27
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,745
It is our senior year, though.
No way we won't own the school.

28
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,948
I'll own the school.
I've always owned the school.

29
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,053
Megan Krizmanich, probably
the biggest drama queen in Warsaw.

30
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,499
Smart, popular, attractive.

31
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,127
The richest family.

32
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,431
- Powerful.
- Like a princess.

33
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,130
She's never talked to me,
she's never looked at me.

34
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,332
All through high school
I've heard she is the biggest bitch.

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,813
<i>Maybe I am, but I do what I want to do.</i>

36
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,873
<i>I'm not here to impress,</i>
<i>I'm here to be me.</i>

37
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:09,718
<i>I'm student council vice-president,</i>
<i>I ran track. I did volleyball, golf.</i>

38
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,450
<i>I'm in charge of the service committee.</i>
<i>I was in charge of prom last year.</i>

39
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,687
I mean, every day,
I'm after school, doing something.

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,528
<i>Megan's future plans include</i>
<i>attending Notre Dame University</i>

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,158
<i>and studying medicine.</i>

42
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,669
<i>Let's hear it for</i>
<i>our homecoming royalty!</i>

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,774
<i>Everybody around me thinks</i>
<i>that my life is perfect.</i>

44
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,367
But there is just
so much pressure on me this year.

45
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,745
All of my brothers and sisters
and my dad all attended Notre Dame,

46
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,912
which is unbelievably hard to get into.

47
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,347
<i>Usually they only accept</i>
<i>the valedictorian,</i>

48
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,491
<i>but my dad wants me to get in.</i>

49
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>If I don't get in, he'll be heartbroken.</i>

50
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,129
I have to behave.
I can't get in trouble this year.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,724
Megan, you're not gonna
get in trouble this year.

52
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,963
You always get out of things.

53
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,554
Colin's a great kid.
He's one of the funniest people I know.

54
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,086
- Shaun, you look like Magic Johnson.
- That's what my mom says.

55
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,686
Like today, not when he was thin
and good-Iooking.

56
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,592
He's very friendly.

57
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,658
Walk with me.

58
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,170
And he's really a sweetheart.

59
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,934
A lot of girls think he's just totally hot
and they have crushes on him.

60
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,876
His lifestyle is a mystery to me.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,610
<i>This is Colin Clemens</i>
<i>with a Tiger sports reminder.</i>

62
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,845
<i>On Friday, the boys' varsity</i>
<i>basketball team will be taking on</i>

63
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,682
<i>the Tippe Valley Vikings</i>
<i>to kick off the start of the year,</i>

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,279
<i>so get out there and support our Tigers.</i>

65
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,322
<i>That's all the news we have</i>
<i>for you today, so</i>

66
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,258
<i>- have a great day, Tigers.</i>
<i>- Have a great day, Tigers.</i>

67
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,898
- Let's go, Tigers!
- Let's go, Tigers!

68
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,943
<i>Around here,</i>
<i>high-school basketball is a big deal.</i>

69
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,274
<i>Warsaw's ridiculous about it.</i>

70
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,313
I mean, if we don't do well this season,
the community's going to go nuts.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,148
Come on now. One, two, three.

72
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,780
- Break!
- Break!

73
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:30,659
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Warsaw Tigers.</i>

74
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,089
<i>A lot more eyes will be on me this year,</i>
<i>because I'm the go-to guy,</i>

75
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,693
<i>the first scoring option now.</i>

76
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,866
<i>And the stakes are really high for me,</i>
<i>because I'm relying on this season</i>

77
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,173
to get a college scholarship
for basketball. I can't pay for it, and...

78
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,681
<i>It's 47 all, and Clemens</i>
<i>can still be the hero of this game.</i>

79
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,585
<i>What a moment. You dream about</i>
<i>these things in your backyard.</i>

80
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,881
<i>Clemens shoots it. Good.</i>

81
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,257
Yeah, we needed that one.
That was big.

82
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,264
<i>Warsaw leads 48-47, 1.4 seconds left.</i>

83
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,966
<i>Clemens with one more.</i>

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,473
<i>The second one by Clemens is rolling...</i>
<i>Good. He got them both.</i>

85
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,834
<i>They throw it long.</i>
<i>Taylor will chuck it at the buzzer.</i>

86
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,812
<i>Brimming, no!</i>

87
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,213
<i>The Warsaw Tigers have done it!</i>

88
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,655
<i>My dream is to play</i>
<i>in the NCAA Division I,</i>

89
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,024
<i>like Purdue and IU</i>
<i>and all those schools.</i>

90
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:40,828
<i>And a toast to 6'4" senior,</i>
<i>Colin Clemens.</i>

91
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,973
<i>Going to the Final Four.</i>

92
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,771
<i>Hitting a three for the win.</i>

93
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,618
<i>Then after that, to try out</i>
<i>with the Pacers, Indiana Pacers.</i>

94
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,284
<i>Making it that far would be incredible.</i>

95
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,225
<i>Good afternoon, sports fans, I'm Brian.</i>

96
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,631
<i>And I'm Phil, and this is the best darn</i>
<i>sports show at the Tiger nation.</i>

97
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,138
<i>On Friday, the boys' basketball team</i>
<i>took on Elkhart Memorial and won.</i>

98
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,730
<i>Wow, we rock!</i>

99
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,243
<i>Everyone has their own cliques,</i>

100
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,413
<i>and I just don't really belong</i>
<i>to any particular clique.</i>

101
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,153
The only people I hang out with
are in band, the other geeks.

102
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,629
I guess that is what I am.
I guess my clique is the band.

103
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,510
<i>I spend a lot of my time</i>
<i>playing video games.</i>

104
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,676
<i>I love</i> The Legend of Zelda.

105
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,118
<i>I don't have many friends,</i>

106
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:13,147
<i>so it's always been really important</i>
<i>to me to have a girlfriend.</i>

107
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,654
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I wish life were more like video games,</i>

108
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,629
<i>because then I'd always get the girl.</i>

109
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,473
<i>My idea would be someone</i>
<i>I can really connect with,</i>

110
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,099
<i>someone I can talk to.</i>

111
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,406
<i>Somebody who cares about me</i>
<i>for who I am.</i>

112
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,379
<i>If I have a girl,</i>
<i>I don't feel like I'm such a nobody.</i>

113
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,766
I do love the ladies,
but the ladies do not love me.

114
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,866
I don't know what it is about me.
Maybe it's the monotone

115
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:09,245
or the insane collections of video game
characters and the band, and

116
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,340
all the stuff that makes me
a supergeek.

117
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,752
But I don't know. It might be my face,
or the way I carry myself.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,417
I don't know what it is,
but they avoid me at all costs.

119
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,657
<i>But I am not going</i>
<i>to let anything stop me.</i>

120
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,199
<i>I am motivated.</i>

121
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,767
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,831
Do you want to do anything
anytime soon?

123
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,339
Probably in, like, two weeks.

124
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,434
- Two weeks?
- Yeah, I'm grounded till the 23rd.

125
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,445
Well, three weeks from now
on Saturday,

126
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,310
- you wanna go see a movie?
- We'll talk about it Monday.

127
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,474
- Sounds good. See you.
- Bye.

128
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,620
- Cedric, good news. It worked.
- No, it didn't.

129
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,385
- Three weeks from Saturday.
- Three weeks from Saturday?

130
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,483
She's like, "Yeah, we'll talk
more about it on Monday."

131
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,721
So I was like, "Okay."

132
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,922
You're gay!

133
00:09:58,864 --> 00:09:59,853
Yeah.

134
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,736
No horseplay in the hallway, please.
Thank you.

135
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,067
- Someone else will get hurt.
- Oh, sorry.

136
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,970
I'm escorting her to class.
She's a troublemaker.

137
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,065
You can't hit me.

138
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,201
Stop it. Go to class.

139
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,707
Hannah's not in the popular crowd.

140
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,945
Yes! Turn it up, man, turn it up!

141
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,079
She's definitely a rebel.

142
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,751
Not goth or emo or punk. Alternative.

143
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,259
- Artistic.
- Really strange.

144
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,386
No, my parents are upstairs. All right.

145
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,452
She's got heart.

146
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,191
Shoot!

147
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,775
- I don't understand what's going on.
- No, I don't, either.

148
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,344
It's like they're ants or bees,
they're part of a hive.

149
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,045
It's like they hear the signal
and they just do it, man.

150
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,281
<i>- Everybody, clap your hands.</i>
<i>- Everybody, clap your hands.</i>

151
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,452
<i>I'm a little different from</i>
<i>a lot of people around here.</i>

152
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,164
<i>Warsaw is such a conservative town,</i>
<i>and I'm so not conservative.</i>

153
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,700
I don't fit in. I hate it.

154
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:16,064
<i>I like music.</i>
<i>I like film and I like photography and art.</i>

155
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,475
Hannah, they have an M&M for energy.

156
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,206
- You might like that.
- Yeah.

157
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,271
<i>I live with my grandma.</i>

158
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,011
She's so thin,
she reminds me of those models.

159
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,519
She said she's been eating Whoppers.

160
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,990
<i>My mom has manic depression, so</i>
<i>it's almost impossible to live with her.</i>

161
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,722
<i>My dad moved to Ohio to work,</i>

162
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,795
<i>so I'm basically just on my own</i>
<i>for a while now,</i>

163
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,356
<i>except for Joel, my boyfriend.</i>

164
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,300
Hannah just got here.
I'm gonna surprise her.

165
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,744
- Oh, my God!
- Put this on. Let's play.

166
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,782
<i>Joel and I have been together</i>
<i>two years.</i>

167
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:02,319
<i>A lot of people in high school, like</i>
<i>their boyfriend is like... It's just for fun.</i>

168
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,188
<i>And then, with Joel, it's so different.</i>
<i>It's like, I really...</i>

169
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,028
<i>I really love him.</i>

170
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,499
<i>I can never imagine</i>
<i>not having him in my life.</i>

171
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,867
Now, Hannah, if you'll
just stand right over here,

172
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,240
just inside the door here. We are
going to do a mock interview up here,

173
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,077
so that you kind of get a feel
for job interviewing techniques.

174
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,706
Okay, here we go.

175
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,773
Now, Hannah, of course,
when I schedule people,

176
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,821
I expect for them to be here
and be here on time.

177
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,584
Keeping that in mind,
could you give me an example

178
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,785
of your dependability
or your willingness to work?

179
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,992
I'll be honest with you. I have
really bad dependability problems.

180
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,728
- I'm always late, always.
- All right.

181
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,993
Do you smoke?

182
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,735
Yeah.

183
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,744
Okay. Do you have any objections
to psychological or drug tests?

184
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,772
Yeah.

185
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,339
Okay, let's give her a round of applause.

186
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,918
All right.

187
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,583
<i>After high school,</i>
<i>do you want just a job?</i>

188
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,455
<i>Or do you want a real career,</i>
<i>making real money?</i>

189
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,860
<i>International Business College in</i>
<i>Fort Wayne, Indiana can take you there.</i>

190
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,660
<i>What I want to do when I grow up,</i>
<i>I want to work in film.</i>

191
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:26,137
<i>I want to be a director,</i>
<i>so I want to go to college in California.</i>

192
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,440
<i>But most people around here</i>
<i>just stay in Indiana for college.</i>

193
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,808
That doesn't sound great to me,
because I want to, you know,

194
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,813
I want to just work my heart out on this.

195
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,610
I want to actually...

196
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,813
My goal is, I want to make movies
that people remember forever.

197
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,151
I want people to remember me
after I die.

198
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,157
I don't want to just live for nothing,

199
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:51,060
and work some 9-to-5 shit job
and just die, you know.

200
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,927
I want to do something
that people will remember

201
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,161
and that will really touch people.

202
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,216
- One point.
- So it kind of sucks.

203
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,056
Hey, Clarke!
Hannah wants to talk to you.

204
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,026
<i>Hello?</i>

205
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,962
Hey, what's the matter?

206
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,891
<i>I just needed to talk to someone.</i>

207
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,938
- Do you want me to come over?
<i>- Okay.</i>

208
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,098
All right. I'll see you soon.

209
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,006
Did something happen?

210
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,619
Okay.

211
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,659
- Tonight he said that?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,030
So... Kill me.

213
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,073
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,138
I'm so in love with him.

215
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,416
I just can't stop being in love with him.

216
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,950
I can't go to school anymore.

217
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,782
I can't. I can't see him.

218
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,446
Hannah's at home again.

219
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,219
She missed all last week.
Didn't go to school at all.

220
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,522
- She's gonna get in big trouble.
- I know.

221
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,049
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

222
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,483
<i>I have a new crush,</i>
<i>and her name's Lorrin.</i>

223
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,524
<i>She's a freshman in band.</i>

224
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,254
<i>She just moved here,</i>
<i>so she hardly knows anyone at all.</i>

225
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,262
<i>So I actually might</i>
<i>have a chance with her.</i>

226
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,895
- Hey.
- Hey, is Lorrin here?

227
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,436
Yeah.

228
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,803
Lorrin?

229
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,641
- Hi.
- Hello.

230
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,304
- How are you?
- Pretty good, how are you?

231
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,576
Wow, thank you. What are these for?

232
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,880
- Just because.
- Oh, thank you, these are awesome.

233
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,889
I just got back from my game.
I'm smelling like crap. It's disgusting.

234
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,222
I took a shower today,
and then did almost nothing,

235
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,386
so I'm kind of just the opposite.

236
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,029
I got my oil changed. That was exciting.

237
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,165
So, do you want to go see
a movie Sunday?

238
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,630
Yeah.

239
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,476
They're not the easiest things
to eat in the world.

240
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,951
<i>I am nervous, 'cause somebody</i>
<i>likes me that I like back.</i>

241
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,977
I mean, usually
it's like a one-sided thing,

242
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,887
where it's a really creepy girl
that likes me,

243
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,892
or it's some girl that I like and hates me.

244
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,370
So, what's going on with Hannah?

245
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,969
Is she ever going
to come back to school?

246
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,278
I hope so.
She's gonna fail by missing so much.

247
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,285
<i>I got sick this morning</i>
<i>just thinking about going to school.</i>

248
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,185
I can't go today.

249
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,398
I just can't.

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,695
I have to tomorrow.

251
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,801
<i>The reason why I stopped going</i>
<i>to school in the first place</i>

252
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,276
<i>was because I was scared to see Joel.</i>

253
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:11,442
<i>And now, it's created this whole new</i>
<i>fear that has nothing to do with Joel.</i>

254
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,984
<i>It basically has to do with me.</i>
<i>I fear that I'm disgusting.</i>

255
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,045
<i>The reason why I stopped going</i>
<i>to school in the first place</i>

256
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,590
<i>was because I was scared to see Joel.</i>

257
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,990
<i>I'm completely worthless,</i>

258
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,497
<i>this piece of shit,</i>
<i>worthless, disgusting person.</i>

259
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,470
<i>I'm stupid. I'm ugly.</i>
<i>I'm a complete failure.</i>

260
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,533
<i>Who am I?</i>

261
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,271
<i>I'm just Joel's ex-girlfriend.</i>

262
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,832
<i>I'm nothing.</i>

263
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,108
<i>I'm scared of</i>

264
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,209
<i>people asking me what's wrong.</i>

265
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,253
<i>People thinking I'm crazy.</i>

266
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,778
<i>I don't want people making fun of me.</i>

267
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,485
<i>That would just make it so much worse.</i>

268
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,428
<i>It's one of my biggest fears.</i>

269
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:04,358
<i>And my mom,</i>
<i>she has a chemical imbalance,</i>

270
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,562
<i>and it is hereditary.</i>

271
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,303
<i>I don't want to be like my mom.</i>

272
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,140
<i>But it's almost like... It's happening.</i>

273
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,547
<i>I can feel it happening.</i>

274
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,816
<i>I feel completely crazy.</i>

275
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,318
<i>I hate that feeling.</i>

276
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,388
Dad, I missed 17 days this term?

277
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,268
When is she supposed to meet me?

278
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,001
Okay, well, I'll talk to her.

279
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,434
You need to get with the program.

280
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,003
Because it's not fair for you
to miss a third of the classes

281
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,344
and still get credit in the class.

282
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,048
What is it that you're dealing with?

283
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,052
Like, what makes you
not want to come to school?

284
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,849
I'm just scared.

285
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,891
I mean, what is it that scares you
about coming to school?

286
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,358
I don't know. Just...

287
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,590
I don't want people to think I'm weak.

288
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,024
Okay.

289
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,803
I don't want people asking
what's wrong with me.

290
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,533
I don't want to start crying
in front of people.

291
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,508
I don't know. I'm on medicine.
I don't know.

292
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,777
I haven't been on very long, so...

293
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,213
Okay, so what do they have you on?
An anti-depressant...

294
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,910
- Yeah. Yeah.
...or something like that? Okay.

295
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,383
I'm going to do a little bit of
tough love here,

296
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,012
and say, you know what, Hannah?
You need to come to school.

297
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,715
And right now, you're at your limit.

298
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,588
If you miss one or two more days,
I would be like, "You know what,

299
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,151
"she hasn't been here enough
to even give her the credit."

300
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,026
You know, I just don't want you
to look back and think,

301
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,359
"Okay, I went through
this really bad time,

302
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,525
"and I ended up missing out on
a whole high-school diploma

303
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,069
"because I couldn't be at school."

304
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,634
- Tomorrow.
- It's got to be today.

305
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,237
It's got to be now or never.

306
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,738
Remember what I said
about people being mean.

307
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,841
I do...

308
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,045
I don't think anybody
is going to be like that,

309
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,021
but if they are, then they're not
worth caring about what they say.

310
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,183
I'm just not ready today.

311
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,750
But that's why we decided
I was gonna come here.

312
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,161
Well, listen, I stayed up all night
last night worrying about this.

313
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:17,258
Maybe if you stay with me tonight
and I could talk to you tonight.

314
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,304
Well, you can do that,
but let's try right now.

315
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,398
Dad, I am gonna freak out.
Dad, I don't want to freak out.

316
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,806
I don't want you to, either, but...

317
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,606
Dad, please, please, please.

318
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,614
- She's such a skank.
- She's an ugly one, too.

319
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,818
Well, let's at least try.

320
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,725
No. No, I'm not going in.

321
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,856
<i>Good morning, staff and students...</i>

322
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,765
I'll walk with you in there.

323
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,860
No.

324
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,734
<i>... Veterans Day recognition program...</i>

325
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:58,572
Come on. If there's any possibility,
I want to give it a try.

326
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,007
I'll walk with you.

327
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,540
No?

328
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,048
<i>We will have the band playing</i>
<i>patriotic songs,</i>

329
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,281
<i>and then we will have</i>
<i>the posting of the colors...</i>

330
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,346
Can I just have one day?

331
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,690
The rum of Captain.

332
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,162
- Amen.
- Amen.

333
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,391
Mine, dude.

334
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,126
Do you realize how quick
we're gonna get drunk?

335
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,828
- Ali can't have more than five.
- Yeah, that's definitely gonna spin her.

336
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,892
Okay, you ready?

337
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,531
My first kiss was in spin the bottle.

338
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,598
Your first BJ was in...

339
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,133
My first BJ was in a serious relationship
that I had, okay?

340
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,203
<i>Ali is my really close friend.</i>

341
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,374
Oh, wait, no, we gotta
show them our handshake.

342
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,418
<i>Geoff is my best friend.</i>

343
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,949
<i>I've known Geoff the 17 years</i>
<i>that I've been alive.</i>

344
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,388
<i>I remember playing with him</i>
<i>when we were little.</i>

345
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,859
...turn the key, smash it together,
best friends forever.

346
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,589
Hey, Megan, you spin it first.

347
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,893
- I feel so on tonight.
- Megan, come on. Easy with it.

348
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,557
Gonna be my new word, a "bimho."

349
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,626
It's me. You have to make out with me.

350
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,131
Okay.

351
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:03,833
It's 3:15 in the morning,

352
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,173
and I just saw the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

353
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,370
Look, dude.

354
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,081
Okay, can we just make this brief?

355
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,482
All right, real fast, real fast, real fast.

356
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,445
Oh, my God.

357
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,012
It's my turn.

358
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,591
It's Geoff.

359
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,719
<i>Even though Geoff is not my boyfriend,</i>

360
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,233
<i>I look at Geoff with girls</i>
<i>and it's just weird.</i>

361
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,125
<i>Geoff is like a brother, and I get jealous.</i>

362
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,765
Ali, easy, easy, easy, tiger.
Three. Three.

363
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,832
That was four. Shut up.

364
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,968
- Let me live a little, man.
- Three.

365
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,271
<i>My best friend Geoff</i>
<i>with my close friend Erica.</i>

366
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,574
"Let me rub your back."

367
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,168
The blanket's coming out.

368
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,214
Sharing a blanket.

369
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,110
"Let's get comfy."

370
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,620
<i>I don't know, I don't think he should just</i>
<i>be randomly fooling around with girls.</i>

371
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,150
Megan, shit happens!
Testosterone is flowing.

372
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,662
Was it really that bad of a thing?

373
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,697
Oh, you're calling me
to tell me happy birthday?

374
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,737
Erica? Hey, tell her to slut up.

375
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,863
That's why she wants
to come over here... Cat fight.

376
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,841
- Man, we should do something to her.
- Like what?

377
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,175
I don't know.
Megan will think of something, though.

378
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,542
Piss off Megan, you're gonna get it.

379
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,083
Erica sent me an e-mail.

380
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,126
Oh, my God.

381
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,792
<i>Erica sent me a picture</i>
<i>of herself topless.</i>

382
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,768
<i>It was our own little secret.</i>
<i>It was harmless, but, of course...</i>

383
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,873
<i>Erica sent the picture to me and Skylar,</i>
<i>and Skylar sent the picture to Ali.</i>

384
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,882
<i>I sent it to Katie, Gaby and Jarod.</i>

385
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,117
<i>And then I sent it to Megan.</i>

386
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,549
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

387
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,992
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

388
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,723
<i>Hilarious.</i>

389
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,865
Look at her.

390
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,102
Oh, my God!

391
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,971
Holy!

392
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,387
Oh, my gosh.

393
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,790
This is awesome.

394
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,923
From Roman history, who were the
patricians and who were the plebeians?

395
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,091
Do you remember that?

396
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,994
<i>Oh, God, it was bad. Everybody saw it.</i>

397
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,369
<i>People had it on their phones.</i>

398
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,406
- What is it?
- Erica.

399
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,147
<i>Rumor has it</i>
<i>that the administration saw it.</i>

400
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,183
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>my dad ended up seeing the photo.</i>

401
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,649
Look at it. It's funny.

402
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,044
- Hey, there's a website.
- No, there's not.

403
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,751
I swear on my life.
You Google Erica, it comes up now.

404
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,990
- Oh, my God!
- It was a joke.

405
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,156
I don't even think it should have been
sent to anyone in the first place.

406
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,466
...stupid.

407
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,661
I just need Erica's number.

408
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,966
I really think
she's seriously had enough.

409
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,529
- No.
- Ready? Take your phone.

410
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,370
This is terrible.

411
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,633
<i>I'm in Chicago,</i>

412
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,974
<i>so leave your name,</i>
<i>I will definitely call you back.</i>

413
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:05,449
Not only are you a slut,
but you're also dumb.

414
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,348
Megan, this is just...

415
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,788
I've seen your titties,
and so has everyone else.

416
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,353
Your parents know.

417
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,594
Your priest knows.
And above all, God knows.

418
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,863
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

419
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:28,667
but you're sentenced to be a slut
for the rest of your life.

420
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,204
- Amen.
- Amen.

421
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,471
Let me leave her one.

422
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,640
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah.

423
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:43,245
Like, oh, my gosh, I was online today
looking at natty ho's,

424
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:47,348
and your picture popped up, and you
were, like, topless, and I thought,

425
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,691
"Who the hell would put a natty
picture of themselves like that online,

426
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,665
"when your body is not even that nice
and your tits are not even that nice?"

427
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,328
- Oh, my God.
- That was mean.

428
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,598
What if she kills herself in the morning?

429
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,764
- She won't.
- We'll leave her a message

430
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,365
telling her not to kill herself,
that life will get better.

431
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,907
<i>It's been hard.</i>

432
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,353
<i>I know what people are thinking.</i>

433
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,414
I get phone calls
in the middle of the night

434
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,926
that are just really, really mean.

435
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,462
<i>I know Megan actually called me</i>
<i>a couple of times,</i>

436
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,929
<i>but they are just doing this</i>

437
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,559
just probably 'cause they're bored
or something like that.

438
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:34,233
So, I definitely didn't take any of it
to heart or whatever.

439
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:38,765
But it was still hard to hear those things.

440
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,774
Want to hold my hand? Hold my hand.

441
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:48,402
My goal after four years of college
is you to be able to fit in this uniform

442
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,607
- and establish your own Elvis identity.
- All right.

443
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,550
All right, after basketball,
after academics,

444
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,417
after it's all said and done,
I want you to be Elvis for me.

445
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,580
- Can you do it?
- No.

446
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,680
Okay, I figured so.

447
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,362
<i>My dad used to play basketball.</i>

448
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,772
<i>He played at Warsaw.</i>

449
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,572
<i>He's in the hall of fame there</i>
<i>and stuff, so...</i>

450
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,682
<i>A lot of the basketball coaches</i>
<i>will expect me to be good</i>

451
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,080
<i>because of my dad.</i>

452
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,812
<i>That's my man, grab the ball.</i>
<i>Get that ball, buster.</i>

453
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,380
<i>Now take it to the hoop, score a basket.</i>
<i>Make a basket.</i>

454
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,854
<i>Colin, are you going to make a basket?</i>

455
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,419
<i>Are you going</i>
<i>to shoot a basket for Dad?</i>

456
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,627
<i>Oh, yeah, look at that.</i>
<i>He got hang time like his old man.</i>

457
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,259
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

458
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,203
<i>Yeah, baby. Shoot a basket, Colin.</i>

459
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,003
<i>At first, it was like I was doing it</i>
<i>because my dad wanted me to.</i>

460
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,670
<i>At first, when I was really little,</i>
<i>I didn't really understand it then.</i>

461
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,045
<i>- To the hoop! That's my man!</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah!</i>

462
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,949
<i>Thumbs up, Colin! Thumbs up!</i>
<i>That's my man!</i>

463
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,553
<i>I love it now. I love it.</i>

464
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,357
<i>Yeah, he taught me</i>
<i>to love it, pretty much.</i>

465
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,490
You know, you're going to have
college recruiters there tomorrow.

466
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,231
I would make sure that
I had 12 rebounds tomorrow.

467
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,671
Of course.

468
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,610
I'm serious. Dad doesn't have money
for college, but if you get 12 rebounds,

469
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,580
everything else will fall into place,

470
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,981
and they'll say, "Hey, we've got to get
that Clemens kid on the team."

471
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,882
Otherwise, it's the Army.

472
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,451
Yeah.

473
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,909
Let's go, let's go.

474
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,411
<i>A flip to Clemens. Clemens shoots, up...</i>
<i>Good.</i>

475
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,081
<i>Colin Clemens has</i>
<i>nine first-quarter points.</i>

476
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:16,684
<i>It's 11-2, Warsaw. The Tigers</i>
<i>have scored 11 straight points.</i>

477
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,525
<i>Left side, Clemens,</i>
<i>who scored 13 the first quarter,</i>

478
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,326
<i>but has been stone-cold since.</i>

479
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,727
<i>And we're starting to see</i>
<i>a little bit of unraveling.</i>

480
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,531
<i>You noticed it, I noticed it right there.</i>

481
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,595
<i>In the lane, Caroll's shot is good.</i>

482
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,732
<i>Now it becomes</i>
<i>anybody's game at this point.</i>

483
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,213
<i>Warsaw still down 45-44.</i>
<i>Get out the heart medicine, folks,</i>

484
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,612
<i>you're going to need the whole bottle.</i>

485
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,750
- Let's go, Tigers!
- Let's go, Tigers!

486
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,913
<i>And Clemens will shoot two.</i>

487
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,747
<i>So you wanna be the star,</i>
<i>so you wanna be the hero.</i>

488
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,522
<i>You gotta make these two.</i>
<i>You just have to.</i>

489
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,858
Go, Colin!

490
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,301
<i>Oh, I thought Colin, for sure,</i>
<i>was going to get that in there,</i>

491
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,600
<i>but he couldn't make the shot.</i>

492
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,637
<i>And now, Clemens for the second one.</i>
<i>Up in the air, missed it.</i>

493
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,202
Come on, man!

494
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,643
<i>The timer went out. The game is over.</i>

495
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,414
<i>A crushing defeat for the Tigers.</i>

496
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,048
<i>It's been a tough night for Colin.</i>

497
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,251
<i>He can't make a free throw.</i>

498
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,231
<i>Hey, Tiger sports fans, I'm Danielle.</i>

499
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,331
<i>And I'm Megan.</i>

500
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,639
<i>And we have your Tiger sports results</i>
<i>from this past weekend.</i>

501
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,613
<i>On Friday, the men's varsity basketball</i>
<i>team fell to NorthWood.</i>

502
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,616
<i>You'll get them next time, boys.</i>

503
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:58,388
Colin, what's the latest
with scholarships? Anything?

504
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,158
Parents are supposed to pay
for college.

505
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,426
Who said that?

506
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,365
- Like every parent...
- No.

507
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,096
...that's paying for their kids
to go to college.

508
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,138
Warsaw is an affluent community.

509
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,403
There's a lot of people
that have done very well,

510
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,371
and they can afford to just send their
kids to college, and God bless them.

511
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,779
We're comfortable, but just not wealthy.

512
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,910
I mean, not every kid goes to college.

513
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,591
Grandma? I'm going to school.

514
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,326
You are? Oh, my God.
Come here, child.

515
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,403
- Bye. See you later.
- Okay, I'm walking beside you, Hannah.

516
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,541
We're late.

517
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,908
I don't want to go.

518
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,849
I think I'm gonna puke.

519
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,497
I don't want you to get
kicked out of school.

520
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,001
Okay, well, I guess I'm kind of late
to class. Are you all right?

521
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,341
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll see you.

522
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,993
I hate school.

523
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,060
Well, it's all on your shoulders

524
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:51,234
not to even have the slightest mess-up.

525
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,834
- I mean, don't... Yeah.
- I'm not. I know.

526
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,845
You've used up your share for the year.

527
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,814
You can't have anything like that
happen now.

528
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,517
Are you all right?

529
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:13,826
I really don't care right now.
I just want to go to class.

530
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:20,068
Who can tell me
what caused the First World War?

531
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,604
- I know.
- Yes.

532
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,766
That one dude who decided
to kill Franz Ferdinand.

533
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,174
Hey, now, that's what
most people commonly think

534
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,337
starts the First World War.

535
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,744
It is what started it. I was there.

536
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,817
<i>I'm doing really good.</i>

537
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,751
<i>I've just been dreaming</i>
<i>about college and California.</i>

538
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,783
<i>I really don't know what's so great</i>
<i>about California. I've never been there.</i>

539
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,623
But if I had to imagine a cool place
to live, it would be fricking California.

540
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:47,152
They have beaches and mountains
and casinos.

541
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,965
Why not? Why not?

542
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,559
Arnold Schwarzenegger
is the fricking governor.

543
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,504
I fricking hate Arnold Schwarzenegger,
but anywhere

544
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,031
where Arnold Schwarzenegger
can become elected for governor,

545
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,805
that's fucked up.

546
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,021
I have this.

547
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,389
- Hello.
- So how are things up there?

548
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,363
It seems like it would be really boring.

549
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,797
It is boring up here.

550
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,334
You want to sit back here?

551
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,632
I wish I could, but I can't.

552
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,035
- Bye.
- Bye.

553
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,074
Smoke out on the lake.

554
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,973
That would be awesome!

555
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,774
<i>Mike is kind of the opposite of me.</i>

556
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:39,942
<i>He is very outgoing. All the girls like</i>
<i>him. He's the marching band stud.</i>

557
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,584
<i>I'm definitely envious.</i>

558
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,158
<i>I wasn't a shy kid,</i>
<i>but then middle school started.</i>

559
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,831
<i>In seventh and eighth grade,</i>
<i>I was really tiny,</i>

560
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,666
<i>so everyone made fun of me</i>
<i>all the time for being short.</i>

561
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,537
<i>One time, somebody knocked</i>
<i>a bowl of hot chili all over my lap.</i>

562
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,268
<i>I had to walk up</i>
<i>in front of the whole school</i>

563
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,140
<i>and ask if I could change my pants,</i>

564
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,439
<i>and Nate Salsger was like,</i>

565
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,106
<i>"Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>Jake has got his first period!"</i>

566
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,945
<i>So everyone laughed.</i>

567
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,818
<i>That was pretty much the point where</i>
<i>my life turned completely different.</i>

568
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,152
<i>Well, it shaped</i>
<i>who I was gonna be in high school.</i>

569
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,891
I think that's what made me
be so afraid of who I am.

570
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,295
Do you want your sideburns trimmed?

571
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,299
Hey, Lorrin?
Should I get my sideburns trimmed?

572
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,862
I don't care.

573
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:41,776
I hope she doesn't share with you
some of the texts that I send her.

574
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,144
She doesn't share a lot of the texts
with me.

575
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:48,845
And we just hope that she doesn't get
caught in class with her phone.

576
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,910
- Huh, Lorrin?
- Mom, whatever.

577
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,357
What do you think?

578
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,893
- I liked it better long, I'm sorry.
- Why?

579
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,428
- I think it just looks retarded.
- Sorry, Jake.

580
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,656
It's all right.

581
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,028
- Do you want to go look?
- Sure.

582
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,063
Do you think people are going
to make fun of him at school

583
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,071
with his hair cut so short?

584
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,039
No, no one notices him.

585
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,471
Well, that's mean.

586
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,943
I'm serious.

587
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,310
- Jake, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

588
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,612
Are people going to make fun of you
because your hair's cut short?

589
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,743
- They always make fun of me.
- Why?

590
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,254
- Because it's me!
- I told you.

591
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,493
So, how are you and Lorrin doing?

592
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,997
I don't know.

593
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,524
Why?

594
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:15,366
People have been talking in band
that Lorrin's been cheating on you.

595
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,805
I don't mean to change your mood,

596
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,076
but I heard some really
nasty rumors about you.

597
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,209
- Like what?
- There's like...

598
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,588
Only one person came up
and talked to me,

599
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,283
and if he's telling the truth,

600
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:39,762
then everything's different
between you and me.

601
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,320
What was he saying?

602
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,765
He's like, "Lorrin's been seeing
other guys behind your back."

603
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,067
You know the only thing I could ever
think about was talking to Mike.

604
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,235
Am I not allowed to?

605
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,707
There's nothing wrong
with having friends.

606
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,471
That's just something that...

607
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,105
- It's just common courtesy.
...people have to trust each other on,

608
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,876
I guess,
because I'm not the type of person

609
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,541
that would do something like that.

610
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,945
Yeah. I don't know what's going on.

611
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:17,660
<i>I'm thinking that Lorrin told me a lie.</i>

612
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,936
<i>I'm really pissed at Mike. I hate that kid.</i>

613
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,648
<i>I have one ultimate fantasy.</i>
<i>The final battle between me and Mike.</i>

614
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:38,581
<i>I'd have the master sword out,</i>
<i>then I'd be very heroic.</i>

615
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:44,060
<i>And then I'd bring death and destruction</i>
<i>to my archnemesis.</i>

616
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,226
<i>Then I'd do the finishing move on him.</i>

617
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,499
<i>Until finally,</i>

618
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:03,412
<i>Lorrin was looking in my eyes</i>
<i>and she said, "Jacob, you're so cool."</i>

619
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,517
<i>And then we'd ride away</i>
<i>on a horse in the sunset.</i>

620
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,228
We don't have anything in common.
We're not interested in the same things.

621
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,428
We never had anything to talk about,
we were just...

622
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:30,166
Everything was so boring
and scheduled and just the same.

623
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,470
I think just us breaking up
is probably the best thing

624
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,137
that's just gonna happen right now.

625
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,737
Okay.

626
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,681
You can't agree with me on everything.

627
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,615
But you don't even want to try
to make it work.

628
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,051
I just feel pretty heartbroken.

629
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,918
It's not that I don't care or whatever.

630
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,357
It's just... I just moved here, I haven't
got to know anybody, you know.

631
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:53,021
I want to experience high school,
I guess, just...

632
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,462
Well, don't worry about it, then.

633
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,863
So, you do what you want to do.

634
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:05,370
There's a lot of grease on the table now
because I put my face on it.

635
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,520
Did I tell you?
My SAT score went up 70 points.

636
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,658
And then, of course, when I call home
to tell my dad, he goes,

637
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,895
"Yeah, it would have just been better

638
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,371
"if you could've gone up
like 100 more points."

639
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,198
Gosh.

640
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,765
- Ladies.
- Hey, Dad.

641
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,004
That's a nice outfit. I like those colors.

642
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,377
I think he's just wearing it
to brainwash me more.

643
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,474
Yeah, do I need to do that?

644
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,543
I bet I don't.

645
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,754
I just want to see where everyone's
going to end up for college.

646
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,024
I hate talking about Notre Dame.

647
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,588
Everything's going to be
so much better...

648
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,156
Once we know.

649
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,701
- Yes.
- Yeah.

650
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,294
What?

651
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,305
<i>Megan, they just got</i>
<i>the Prom Committee</i>

652
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,170
<i>to vote for that jungle theme.</i>

653
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,267
The tackiest theme
I've ever heard of in my entire life.

654
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,471
<i>Yeah, they're talking about</i>
<i>getting stuffed animals</i>

655
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,175
<i>and hanging vines on the walls</i>
<i>and all kinds of shit.</i>

656
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,614
It's awful.

657
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:26,283
Turn on some music. I'm pissed as hell.

658
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,356
<i>There's a fight about prom theme.</i>

659
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:35,522
<i>I wanted to make it Oriental, with</i>
<i>little cherry-blossom trees all over.</i>

660
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,035
<i>And then the junior class</i>
<i>president, Ben,</i>

661
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,163
<i>decided to pool his friends together</i>

662
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,208
<i>and have them vote for</i>
<i>"Welcome to the Jungle."</i>

663
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,770
<i>It's very victimizing just to be</i>
<i>backstabbed at the last minute.</i>

664
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,516
<i>I know it's wrong,</i>
<i>but I just believe in getting even.</i>

665
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,150
What?

666
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,124
Okay, yeah.

667
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,660
Hey, Megan!

668
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,977
Someone looked in the window?

669
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,613
Dude, that was stupid.

670
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,590
Why? It's window paint.
It comes right off.

671
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:36,717
- Does it really?
- Yep.

672
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,921
- Are you sure?
- You're an ass.

673
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:45,366
<i>Good morning, staff and students,</i>
<i>we have a very serious announcement.</i>

674
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:49,838
<i>This weekend, a student council</i>
<i>member's house was vandalized.</i>

675
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:53,638
<i>We urge anyone who has information</i>
<i>about this incident</i>

676
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,508
<i>to come forward immediately.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

677
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,877
- I'm telling.
- No, you're not.

678
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,006
- I'm telling.
- You can't!

679
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,515
Yes, I can!

680
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:04,315
Megan, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

681
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:08,381
Dude, I am, okay?
I have forgiven myself, though.

682
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,791
How have you forgiven yourself?
It happened yesterday.

683
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,693
I'm a quick forgiver.

684
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:18,125
- So what are you gonna do?
- Nothing. Say nothing. Say nothing.

685
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,469
Hi, Dad. They know it's
somebody in the student council

686
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,666
that did the vandalizing.
They're accusing me of lying.

687
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,868
<i>This was stupid, Megan.</i>

688
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,674
<i>More stupid if you can't do it</i>
<i>and not get caught.</i>

689
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,117
...so, if that is something
that interests you...

690
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,484
Megan, come here, please.

691
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:45,191
This is a very serious situation.

692
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:50,325
It's sexual harassment because of
what was said and what was drawn.

693
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,928
Unwelcome comments were...

694
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:56,905
- "Fag," and...
- Yeah, yeah. Of a sexual nature.

695
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:02,040
If there had been a threatening word,
that could have been a Class D felony.

696
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:06,412
Normally we suspend out of school
for sexual harassment,

697
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:11,716
but because this is
really your first offense,

698
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,724
we have decided to suspend
your student council office.

699
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,558
It's a slap on the wrist of
what could have happened to you.

700
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,871
<i>Vandalizing happens</i>
<i>every weekend in Warsaw.</i>

701
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,002
<i>It really is just unfair that</i>
<i>I'm being punished so much.</i>

702
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,170
<i>I'm worried that Notre Dame</i>
<i>will find out,</i>

703
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,842
<i>and I could not get in,</i>
<i>which is just going to kill me.</i>

704
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,651
<i>I'm scared.</i>

705
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,728
I still want to give
that Air Force recruiter a call.

706
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,287
I think you'd be a fine soldier.

707
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,027
- Dad, I'm never going to the Army.
- Why?

708
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,934
One, I don't have what it takes to kill
a person. I could not do it. I'm sorry.

709
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,029
Well, they need cooks, too.

710
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,574
And two, I'm not going
to cook for them, either.

711
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,007
What are you going to do?

712
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,875
They've only so many comedians
in the world.

713
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,040
I could be a comedian if I wanted to.

714
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,515
You're going to slough through college
like you did high school?

715
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,644
I don't slough. I have a 3.3 grade point
average, or whatever it is.

716
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,813
I've got a 3.5.

717
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:19,913
- Shut up, Shaun.
- I do.

718
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,014
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do!

719
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,286
Colin did homework once
in his four-year career.

720
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,022
Yeah, look at that. I don't even do
homework and I get A's and B's.

721
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,326
If you got A's and B's
we'd be getting scholarships.

722
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,729
I do, Dad.

723
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,735
You should've got all A's.
You're a smart kid.

724
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,600
Could've been a cook in the Army.

725
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,606
Thank you, Dad.
Good to know you support me.

726
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,378
Push down! Push down!
Push down, Colin!

727
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:49,181
<i>... Clemens backs away, 18-footer. No,</i>
<i>way off the backboard first. No good.</i>

728
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,245
Colin, get in here! Colin,
did you hear me calling push down?

729
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,349
That's not a very good shot, anyway.

730
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,060
Colin, come here.
You got to play patient.

731
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,224
I'm calling push down,
and you take a ridiculously bad shot.

732
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,325
- I want push down.
- I didn't know.

733
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,063
- I know it's a bad shot.
- It's a bad shot.

734
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,107
You don't shoot it
every time you catch it.

735
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,308
<i>Cabrera looking for dribbling room,</i>
<i>throws it outside the lane...</i>

736
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,902
<i>Throws it in, Clemens, low block left,</i>

737
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,743
<i>shoots it up and missed it.</i>
<i>And the rebound...</i>

738
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:23,886
<i>Colin's one of my best friends,</i>
<i>but he can be selfish on the court.</i>

739
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,785
<i>Bounces to Clemens, faces up,</i>

740
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,120
<i>shoots it up there,</i>
<i>and couldn't get the roll again.</i>

741
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,718
<i>Colin, it's okay to take a couple</i>
<i>dribbles and just pass it.</i>

742
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,990
<i>He needs to impress college coaches,</i>

743
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,157
<i>so if he can get the shot off,</i>
<i>he's going to shoot it.</i>

744
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,224
<i>I'm sorry, that just is not a good shot.</i>

745
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,825
And it's hurting our team.

746
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,998
Colin! Slow up!

747
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,607
<i>This is where Colin</i>
<i>has got to grow up and mature.</i>

748
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,240
<i>And I don't like this shot selection.</i>

749
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,512
<i>He's just trying to come in</i>
<i>and get his shots in.</i>

750
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,449
Everybody's losing their confidence,
and instead of encouraging more,

751
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,958
we kind of just yell at each other.

752
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,692
- What's your deal?
- Pissing off.

753
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,696
I said what's your deal?

754
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,128
<i>The Tigers fall to 8-11 on the season.</i>

755
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,397
<i>They have lost five games in a row.</i>

756
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,063
<i>And Tracy, it's very simple,</i>

757
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,542
<i>Warsaw won't go very far unless</i>
<i>Colin really brings his A-game with him.</i>

758
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,780
What color should I make this one?
This fish.

759
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,620
Like a rainbow trout.

760
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,927
I don't know if I should, like,
be able to see this,

761
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,122
what's going on underneath.

762
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,430
<i>I applied to</i>
<i>San Francisco State University.</i>

763
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,566
<i>They have an amazing film program,</i>
<i>so I have completely made up my mind</i>

764
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,701
<i>to stay away from anything</i>
<i>like a boyfriend-type attachment.</i>

765
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,077
<i>I'm trying to be completely ready</i>
<i>to leave Indiana.</i>

766
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,608
<i>Knowing me, I will find someone</i>
<i>and I won't want to leave.</i>

767
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,349
And I don't want that. This is one
of the most crucial times in my life

768
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,358
to make something of myself
and get somewhere,

769
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,621
and start having an education,

770
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,153
start having my own life, and I don't
want anything holding me back.

771
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,557
No one.

772
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,662
<i>So, right now, I'm just trying to</i>
<i>focus on things that I love doing,</i>

773
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,534
<i>like creative things.</i>

774
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,773
<i>We got a great group of bands tonight.</i>

775
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,277
<i>You are going to be</i>
<i>thoroughly entertained.</i>

776
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,313
They started already.

777
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,076
Dude, I am, like, drunk.

778
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,813
- Tell me about it.
- I am drunk.

779
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,020
We need to go backstage.

780
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,077
Are we next?

781
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,784
Dude! I will rock out.

782
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:55,932
Oh, boy.

783
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,573
<i>All right, let's hear it for Strumtulescent!</i>

784
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:35,572
<i>Hannah Bailey. Four years,</i>
<i>and I have never met Hannah Bailey.</i>

785
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,244
<i>It's not too late. There's always hope.</i>

786
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,486
<i>I have a crush on Hannah Bailey.</i>

787
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,023
Thank you.

788
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,461
My pleasure.

789
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,460
Do you know if you replace
the first letter of your name

790
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,434
with a "B," it's "Bitch"?

791
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,402
Do people ever call you "the bitch"?

792
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,202
- My name rhymes with "bitch."
- It does. It's so close.

793
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:10,440
You are so intelligent. You're the first
ever to make that observation.

794
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,878
I'm so impressed.

795
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,915
Do you need help?
I'm really good at pumping gas.

796
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,453
- Lf you want to.
- Yes.

797
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,419
Do you want anything?

798
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:26,087
<i>If someone asked, "What's Mitch like?"</i>
<i>I would never say, "He's a jock."</i>

799
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,529
<i>I guess I would've before,</i>
<i>but now that I know him a little,</i>

800
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,057
I'd say he's really nice,
and he listens when you talk.

801
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,627
You can actually tell
he's taking in what you say,

802
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:39,004
rather than just nodding
'cause he wants to get laid later.

803
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,309
I want her to look at me. I love the hat.

804
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,010
<i>I like Hannah a lot.</i>
<i>I'm enjoying every second with her.</i>

805
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:54,523
I feel like I can be myself around her.
I can be stupid, or kind of nerdy.

806
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,687
I like that one.

807
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,259
- I look horrible.
- That looks awesome.

808
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,457
I think they all taste the same.

809
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,932
No, they don't,
this is grape and that's strawberry.

810
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,807
<i>This is just, like, unbelievable.</i>

811
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:17,313
There's so many girls
that would give their left boob

812
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:21,083
to go on a date with him,

813
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,918
and he's so into hanging out with me?

814
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,853
<i>Did the orbit of Earth</i>
<i>just reverse or something?</i>

815
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,453
<i>Did our axis just tip to the other side?</i>

816
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,723
It's flat-out good.

817
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:50,836
She's a beautiful girl. I like that she
doesn't care how she looks or whatever.

818
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,680
Most of the girls at our school
have to wake up two hours early

819
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,345
to do their hair and put on makeup.

820
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,412
I mean, she just goes with the flow.
It's refreshing.

821
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,587
And then I got this.

822
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,718
<i>I'm hoping that he feels</i>
<i>he found someone</i>

823
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,763
<i>he can express himself around</i>
<i>and be comfortable,</i>

824
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,799
rather than his friends
making him a bet,

825
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,198
like see how long he can last
going out with this lame girl

826
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,496
or something like that.

827
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,672
<i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was the movie
I watched last night with Hannah Bailey.

828
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,640
- Do you like that movie, Mitch?
- I did like it.

829
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,335
I think Mitch would have been
a good character in it.

830
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,672
Mitch is the character in it.

831
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,305
- That's coming from your cuz.
- Dude, your cousin's calling you gay.

832
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,782
<i>We obviously are</i>
<i>in different social groups.</i>

833
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:31,844
My friends were all, "What are
you doing? That's kind of weird."

834
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,416
I mean, I'd like to say that
that wouldn't affect me,

835
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,188
and that wouldn't affect my decision,
but I don't know.

836
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,161
- Thanks.
- There you go.

837
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,460
Now you got to get down on the grass
and pretend you're crawling.

838
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,932
- No. No.
- Come on! I'll do it with you.

839
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,062
I can't... What am I doing?

840
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,032
All right, ready?

841
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:55,504
All right. Now you're thinking about
your dragon life. Okay, awesome.

842
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,915
- I can't keep a straight face.
- That made my day.

843
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,344
- I like Mitch.
- Okay.

844
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,322
I like him more every time I see him
and hang out with him.

845
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,687
Yep.

846
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,489
It's worrying me, because
this is the worst time possible

847
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:18,432
that I could finally find a really
amazing guy and start liking him a lot,

848
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,961
like, right before I'm ready to graduate
and make very important decisions

849
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,974
about where I'm going
to be living next year.

850
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,710
As much as I don't want to admit it,

851
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,508
he's gonna at least weigh in
a little bit on my decision,

852
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,847
like I'll at least consider the fact
that he's going to IU, you know.

853
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,346
I don't know. I'm worried.

854
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,356
I found one sock. That's me.
I'm one sock.

855
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,331
I need another sock to go with,
to be joined up with.

856
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:57,135
And I see all these other pairs of socks,
and then there's just me,

857
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,300
and it makes me feel Ionely.

858
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,900
<i>I need to find my missing sock mate.</i>

859
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,184
The semi-formal is tomorrow.
Are you busy tomorrow?

860
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,742
I'm supposed to work tomorrow.

861
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,381
I could probably get it off, though.
My manager likes me.

862
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:19,395
Well, I mean, you'd have to, like,
try right now, because it's tomorrow.

863
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:25,166
So were you planning on going
to senior semi-formal?

864
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:29,569
No. It makes me nervous
being around popular people.

865
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,803
But, I don't know. I just thought
it'd be fun to ask you last-minute,

866
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:37,904
because we're a lot alike,
a lot of the same interests.

867
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,412
We both suck at life.

868
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,118
I said both.

869
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,218
- So much better.
- It is.

870
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,754
- Thanks. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

871
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,727
So, now what do we do?

872
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,593
Hey, how's it going?

873
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,831
I didn't... Okay, bye.

874
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,670
Look, Mike, my boobs look a lot bigger
than they actually are.

875
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,867
- It's actually a really cool dress.
- Thanks.

876
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,034
This is my sister's.

877
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,771
Jackie, you've got to dance
with me, man.

878
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,075
- All right, let's find a table.
- Sit with us, sit with us. Here.

879
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,543
What?

880
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,552
What are you doing?

881
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,532
What's the matter?

882
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:36,436
I liked it better
when it was just you and me.

883
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,564
Why?

884
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,200
Because I felt like less of a loser.

885
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,353
- I'm gonna go dance.
- Okay, you go dance.

886
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,448
- I'll cry.
- I don't care.

887
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:24,480
<i>This is my birthday. The very start</i>
<i>of my birthday. Right before midnight.</i>

888
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:32,360
<i>In a few seconds, I'll be 18, so it's like</i>
<i>a huge transition in a matter of seconds.</i>

889
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:39,697
<i>My life sucks right now, but what if</i>
<i>it's even worse after high school?</i>

890
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,565
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>of what's gonna happen to me.</i>

891
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,590
<i>Good morning, Tigers!</i>
<i>Happy April Fools'.</i>

892
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,996
<i>As many of you know,</i>

893
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:13,399
<i>college acceptance letters</i>
<i>will be arriving in the next few weeks.</i>

894
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,961
<i>Please don't forget to report your</i>
<i>decisions to the Counseling Office</i>

895
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,873
<i>as soon as possible. Good luck.</i>

896
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:24,875
I have two weeks until my letter from
Notre Dame is here. I'm freaking out.

897
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,312
I know.

898
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,974
Well, we were gonna
go to Matt's for a little bit.

899
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,951
Not for long, like not past 12:00.

900
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,452
I'm not going.
I don't want to go to Matt's.

901
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,649
Not past 12:00? That's not late?

902
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,748
Okay, not past 11:00.

903
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,190
There's no point
in you coming back here, then,

904
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,161
if you're going to be out there till 11:00.

905
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,690
I didn't know
you were going to be that late.

906
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,994
Like, stopping by
to me means, like, an hour.

907
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,934
Okay, fine.
Then I'll just stop by there till like 10:00.

908
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,028
If you want to go out there all night,
that doesn't matter.

909
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,470
Well, I don't want you to be mad.

910
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,564
I don't know. You've pissed me off.

911
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,871
I don't know whether you realize
that or not, but you have.

912
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,207
Like you honestly came here to eat

913
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,940
and wait until you figured out
what you were doing.

914
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,140
I invited you to go with me.

915
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,742
It's not like I came here and was like,
"Oh, by the way, I'm going over there."

916
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,582
No, fuck this, dude!

917
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,358
How disappointing will it be
if you don't get into Notre Dame?

918
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,522
Very.

919
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,326
And how are you going to deal with it?

920
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,527
I don't know, probably not well.

921
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,696
Okay. That doesn't mean
it's the end of the world,

922
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,833
and a quarter of the class
is reserved for grads' kids.

923
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:32,441
Is this pressure yours or your friends'?

924
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,313
Mine. And yours.

925
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,976
Okay.

926
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:40,614
If you'll be disappointed for you,
that's fine,

927
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,284
but you shouldn't be
disappointed for me.

928
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,691
And you're not doing this for me.

929
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,596
I like Notre Dame. Your brothers
and sister like Notre Dame.

930
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,232
There's just a lot of pressure.

931
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,295
And if you get in,
do you think that all goes away?

932
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

933
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,308
So there's no other pressure
in life, then?

934
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:05,745
I mean, there's other,
but this is the main bulk of it.

935
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,207
There's still gonna be things
to deal with.

936
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:23,731
<i>My older sister, Sara, she was the only</i>
<i>child that didn't go to Notre Dame.</i>

937
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,099
<i>She was different from all of us,</i>
<i>and we always knew that.</i>

938
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,968
<i>She had some learning disabilities</i>
<i>and she was always slower,</i>

939
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,032
<i>and I think it was rough on her</i>
<i>being inferior to everybody else.</i>

940
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:38,305
<i>She had always wanted to be a teacher.</i>
<i>She was amazing with little kids.</i>

941
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,110
<i>And she got accepted to college,</i>

942
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,878
<i>but she was struggling</i>
<i>with student teaching,</i>

943
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,715
<i>and she was struggling</i>
<i>with the exam that she had to take.</i>

944
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,655
<i>I think she just saw her dream</i>
<i>just being taken away from her.</i>

945
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:54,286
<i>It was almost two years ago,</i>
<i>Sara committed suicide.</i>

946
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,831
<i>She was living here.</i>
<i>It happened in the basement.</i>

947
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,767
It was awful. I mean...

948
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:04,933
It was definitely the worst thing
that ever happened to me,

949
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:14,843
and at the same time, it really
brought us together as a family.

950
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:19,351
It was very hard on Megan.
Megan was just 16 when Sara died.

951
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,423
And I think it was very...

952
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,585
I think it affected her, and I think it
still affects her. It affects all of us.

953
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:29,921
My presumption is that
there's a certain element of guilt,

954
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,526
because Sara and Megan
were never close.

955
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:39,105
She may not even be aware of the fact
that this is affecting her the way it is.

956
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:45,813
<i>But sometimes I see this rage in Megan,</i>
<i>this inner anger.</i>

957
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,215
<i>I just always want to go back in time</i>
<i>and change something,</i>

958
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,846
and reach out to Sara,
and hopefully have done something, but

959
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,584
I don't even know if there's
something I could have done.

960
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,237
Honestly, we haven't talked for a while.

961
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:16,769
A week.

962
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:20,077
I guess I kind of apologize.
I'm sorry for like anything I did.

963
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,207
Same here.

964
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,014
I mean, I don't really know what we
both did to piss each other off so bad.

965
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,783
It was really bad timing.
It was Sara's birthday Saturday.

966
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,155
- Shit.
- That's why I was just such...

967
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,352
Like, I was just like...

968
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,124
- Now I feel like a bitch.
- No, you didn't know, though.

969
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,325
And that's why I didn't want to, like,
spurt it out and be like, "That's why..."

970
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:39,800
And blame it on that.

971
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,302
Well, I mean,
it would've helped, you know.

972
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,739
I hate that stuff. I got that for six months
of my life right after it happened.

973
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,708
I hated it. Like, I hated that pity.

974
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,642
So, I'm really not mad.
Like, I'm not lying when I say that.

975
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,706
- Okay, good.
- I'm trying not to hold a grudge.

976
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:59,380
That's new. Let's just forget about it.
And I really have started that.

977
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,116
Good feeling, huh?

978
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,722
- It's good. I like it.
- Yeah, I know.

979
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,160
<i>I think she is under a lot of stress</i>
<i>about getting into Notre Dame.</i>

980
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,753
<i>It's what's expected of her, you know.</i>

981
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,662
I don't know how many times
I said that to Megan.

982
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:15,102
<i>I think she does hold a lot of it in, like</i>
<i>a lot of the actual stuff that's important.</i>

983
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:21,337
I think she's got a barrier up,
but recently it's different.

984
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,311
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Megan's kind of more open and honest.

985
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,678
<i>Sometimes Megan surprises me.</i>

986
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,512
<i>She'll do something</i>
<i>really sweet or nice.</i>

987
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,745
<i>You know, it's like,</i>
<i>"Wow, this is different."</i>

988
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,015
Where is it?

989
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,360
- That's Loyola.
- Oh, my God.

990
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,765
This is Saint Mary's.

991
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,167
Hey, this is not funny right now!

992
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:59,007
Do you have the right school?

993
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,212
Thank you. This is what we wanted.

994
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,891
How come I didn't notice
that one was Saint Mary's?

995
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:16,826
I got in!

996
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,404
I got in!

997
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,209
I got in!

998
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,444
You're not supposed to be crying.

999
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:38,749
You're supposed to be happy.

1000
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,752
Oh, Megan.

1001
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,883
- Yeah, I'm happy!
- Okay.

1002
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,589
You asshole!

1003
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,131
That's not the way
you talk to your father.

1004
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:54,067
You gave me two fake letters!
Oh, my gosh.

1005
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,968
"Congratulations on your acceptance
to Saint Mary's."

1006
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:09,006
- Clarke, so how'd the show go?
- Oh, it was great, it was fun.

1007
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,152
That jacket looks a little familiar.

1008
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,150
What?

1009
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,655
- Is that Mitch's?
- Yeah.

1010
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,491
That's what I thought.
That's why I said it looks familiar.

1011
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,859
How do you feel about her?

1012
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,123
- Hannah?
- Hannah.

1013
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,363
- I like her. She's cool.
- Scale from 1 to 10.

1014
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,666
I don't know, don't have the number yet.

1015
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:30,727
Just because it's different?

1016
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,138
- It is different. I like it.
- It works out better.

1017
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:34,733
Different is good.

1018
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:39,008
You've got to stay clear of the
materialistic bitches that are your age.

1019
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,579
Can't think of any.

1020
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,950
Hey, Tigers, I'm Colin.

1021
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,956
And I'm Zach, and we have
your Tiger news for you today.

1022
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,050
<i>For lunch today we'll be having</i>
<i>chicken tenders, green beans,</i>

1023
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>peaches and steak hoagie sandwich.</i>

1024
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,722
<i>So, now, we're tossing it</i>
<i>over for your sports.</i>

1025
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:04,098
<i>I think that there is a lot of</i>
<i>attention about athletics.</i>

1026
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,403
<i>There's a large group of them</i>
<i>that are very stuck-up</i>

1027
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,773
<i>and won't even talk to people.</i>

1028
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,278
<i>I think a lot of them are hard-working,</i>

1029
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,077
<i>good individuals who care</i>
<i>about this school</i>

1030
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,141
<i>and want the best for everyone.</i>

1031
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,715
Mitch is on there.

1032
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,287
Hey, I saw you
on the announcements today.

1033
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,556
You were like, "Sports rule. Jocks rule."

1034
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,028
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1035
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,997
I didn't mean that.

1036
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,192
- I know.
- I really didn't want to be on there.

1037
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,499
I just thought
they made you look stuck-up.

1038
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,665
I really don't remember any of it.

1039
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,777
I don't remember. Never mind.

1040
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,176
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not.

1041
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,875
It wasn't you,
it was how they put it together.

1042
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,011
I wish I wouldn't have said anything.

1043
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,114
So, this coming weekend,
party at my house.

1044
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,250
Okay.

1045
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:00,124
We're inviting Hannah and Mitch.

1046
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,485
Why?

1047
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,224
Because I want to see
Mitch and Hannah, like, interact.

1048
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,630
I do, too.

1049
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,458
It's just funny.

1050
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,400
I mean, I think Mitch could get
any girl he wanted.

1051
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,200
And he loves to try new things,
like Hannah.

1052
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:15,709
Him and Hannah,
I think it's really cute, you know.

1053
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,804
Do I think it's gonna go anywhere?
I don't know.

1054
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,145
I can just see Mitch
gives into like peer pressure.

1055
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,946
- Yeah. Easily.
- Oh, yeah.

1056
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,381
- Oh, well.
- It happens.

1057
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,348
All right, who's playing the winners?

1058
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,984
Yeah, she's really cool.

1059
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,392
- She's cool.
- Okay.

1060
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,697
What the heck, Geoff? Oh, my gosh.

1061
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,900
- Really? Good word.
- We're having a conversation.

1062
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,710
Setting it up, right?

1063
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,609
Setting it up.

1064
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,787
- Mitch likes it in his butt.
- I love it.

1065
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,824
It's not what it looks like.

1066
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,892
- I'll do it later.
- All right.

1067
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,624
No, like not "it," but...

1068
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,202
- Hey, Megan.
- Yeah?

1069
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,136
Are Mitch and Hannah dating now?

1070
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,572
Oh, Hannah, you're right there.

1071
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,038
- Are you two dating now?
- I don't know.

1072
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,417
Where are you going?

1073
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:33,581
I was gonna see if you could sneak out.
We could go for a walk.

1074
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,154
How you doing?

1075
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,996
- Is everyone in the basement?
- Yeah, they're downstairs.

1076
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,862
How's it going, Potts?

1077
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,895
All right. That could be a tall order.

1078
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,906
His dad's home alone,
so he wants us to go.

1079
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,407
Yeah.

1080
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:57,507
And I rode with him,
so I don't have my car.

1081
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,878
- We're gonna go.
- That sucks.

1082
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,513
I wanted to hang out with you tonight.

1083
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,883
Me, too.

1084
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,618
I'm kind of sad.

1085
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,561
- What?
- Nothing.

1086
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,322
- You leaving?
- I'm coming back.

1087
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,394
All right, we'll see you later.

1088
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,737
All right.

1089
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:27,170
- See you, guys.
- See you, dude.

1090
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,335
- Taking off, Mitch?
- Yeah, going back to the folks.

1091
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:30,435
Good to see you, home.

1092
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,538
See you, Megan. See you.

1093
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,581
I'm not gonna sit there and wait
for him to take a shower.

1094
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,676
No, in the shower with him.

1095
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,248
Mitch is going to IU. He just decided.

1096
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:42,847
- He is definitely going there?
- I should do that.

1097
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,314
That'd be good.

1098
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,090
I think out of the places
you've been accepted,

1099
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,721
IU is the best situation.

1100
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,789
And that's the one I least want to go to.

1101
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,357
You know where I want to go.

1102
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,097
- Yeah. California.
- You're not moving there, Hannah.

1103
01:12:56,171 --> 01:13:01,268
As a young 18-year-old girl,
moving out by yourself to a major city,

1104
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,469
it scares me.

1105
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,603
I'm an adult, though.

1106
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,376
I'll be 19 years old.
I can take care of myself.

1107
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:09,474
We told you before,

1108
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,714
you're not always going to get
exactly what you want.

1109
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,517
You're not special.

1110
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,370
<i>- Hey, Tigers, I'm Karla.</i>
<i>- And I'm Alli.</i>

1111
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,235
<i>And we have your sports for you today.</i>

1112
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,673
<i>The Warsaw Tigers boys' basketball</i>
<i>team will face Columbia City</i>

1113
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:12,544
<i>for the sectional championships</i>
<i>Saturday, April 15th. Be there.</i>

1114
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:17,210
<i>Sectionals is my last chance</i>
<i>for a scholarship.</i>

1115
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,949
All my friends are getting into schools.
They already know what they're doing,

1116
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:24,151
know where they're going,
and I have nothing.

1117
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,697
I just don't know what to do.

1118
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,292
I always thought that
that was the only way

1119
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,167
I could get noticed
by college scouts and stuff,

1120
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,968
is if I scored a bunch of points, and...

1121
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,738
I've always pushed you
towards wanting to score a lot,

1122
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:47,145
probably just overemphasized
the scoring part too much.

1123
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:51,448
But if you can play
with the patience Coach talks about,

1124
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,045
you can still turn this year around.

1125
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:59,053
<i>We don't have very many practices left</i>
<i>before the sectional.</i>

1126
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,021
Colin, don't shoot it. Pass it out.

1127
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,962
We cannot waste any of them.

1128
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,132
No. Again.

1129
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,005
Come on. Pass it, Colin.

1130
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,305
Good. That's the way, Colin.

1131
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,168
I want more.

1132
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,943
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1133
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:27,177
<i>It has been six years</i>
<i>since Warsaw won a sectional.</i>

1134
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,883
<i>I will just tell you this upfront,</i>

1135
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,916
<i>there are very few people that think</i>
<i>that the Warsaw Tigers have any shot</i>

1136
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:34,792
<i>of winning this game.</i>

1137
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,089
- One, two, three! Tigers!
- Tigers!

1138
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,132
- Come on. Let's go, boys!
- Let's go.

1139
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,469
Come on, Tigers! Live the dream!

1140
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,707
<i>Up she goes, and the tip</i>
<i>controlled by Columbia City.</i>

1141
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:55,942
<i>11 to 3, Columbia City leads Warsaw.</i>

1142
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,351
<i>Outside, Clemens, 10-footer in the lane.</i>
<i>Rolled it. No good.</i>

1143
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,857
<i>Columbia City leads 18-11.</i>

1144
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:06,656
Come on, Colin. Step up, son! Step up!

1145
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,889
<i>Robbie in the alley-oop to Rucks</i>
<i>threw it behind him,</i>

1146
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,761
<i>and it's taken away.</i>
<i>Clemens, the steal.</i>

1147
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:11,821
Move, baby!

1148
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,697
<i>Clemens runs down the lane</i>
<i>right of the key.</i>

1149
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,704
<i>Flip it out to Cabrera. For three. Good.</i>

1150
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,467
<i>Warsaw has come roaring back.</i>

1151
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:24,876
<i>Outside the lane, Clemens, across</i>
<i>to a wide-open Mitch Reinholt for two.</i>

1152
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:26,778
<i>Great pass by Clemens.</i>

1153
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,078
<i>Twenty seconds left to play</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

1154
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,278
<i>Warsaw's down by one basket.</i>

1155
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,345
<i>Looking for the upset,</i>
<i>perhaps, of a lifetime.</i>

1156
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:48,200
<i>It's over!</i>
<i>Warsaw has won the sectional.</i>

1157
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:52,900
<i>They have taken out Columbia City</i>
<i>in the championship.</i>

1158
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,466
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

1159
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,172
Did you watch your brother out there,
Aaron and Justin?

1160
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,409
Did you watch him? He never stopped
believing, even when things got tough.

1161
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,509
He kept believing and he won the game.
That was awesome.

1162
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,878
<i>Your game has really changed.</i>

1163
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,947
<i>What conscious decisions</i>
<i>did you make to turn that around?</i>

1164
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,217
I just started passing to my teammates,
trusting my teammates,

1165
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,091
and it paid off in the end.

1166
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,426
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you, Roger.

1167
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,090
I like you a lot.
I mean, you got a lot of skill.

1168
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,961
And I know Coach Gunner's been
talking to you on the phone a lot,

1169
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,095
and we're definitely really interested
in having you come over

1170
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,968
and take a look
at what we're trying to do...

1171
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,234
We're looking forward to coming over.

1172
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,572
Very good. We're looking forward to
having you. Okay, we'll see.

1173
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,770
Thanks, John.

1174
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:41,889
<i>Hey, Tigers, I'm Colin.</i>

1175
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:45,825
<i>And I'm Erica, and we have your news</i>
<i>for you today, April 27th.</i>

1176
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:48,021
<i>The last chance to sign up for the prom.</i>

1177
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:51,361
<i>You need $60 and</i>
<i>your entrance ticket will be included.</i>

1178
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,833
<i>So, please sign up if you're interested.</i>

1179
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,828
Okay, about the whole prom thing.

1180
01:17:55,904 --> 01:18:00,273
I'd love to go. Like, you have to
understand that. But now I'm with Nate,

1181
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:04,745
and we are going out now, and that is
gonna be really awkward for him.

1182
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,543
Sitting at home, saying,
"What is she doing?"

1183
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:11,313
I mean, it's nothing against you or
anything. I can't do that to Nate.

1184
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:12,876
- Yep.
- Okay.

1185
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,254
All right.

1186
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,082
Okay? Okay.

1187
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,992
<i>I'm never gonna find a prom date now.</i>
<i>I just need to get out of town.</i>

1188
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,559
<i>Maybe I'll go visit my brother</i>
<i>in San Diego.</i>

1189
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,607
Well, Jake. Welcome to Mexico.

1190
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,836
Mama comes prepared, boys.

1191
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:41,713
The goal of tonight
is to get my little brother drunk.

1192
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,075
I just want to see how he acts.

1193
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,544
I don't know.
He's getting ready to go off to college.

1194
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,589
I'd much rather
him be drunk with me first

1195
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:51,922
than going off with some people
I don't know to drink. So...

1196
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,858
I'm not necessarily proud of it.

1197
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,397
Well, yeah, I am.
I want to get him drunk.

1198
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,923
Okay, so, the idea of the shot is
to drink the whole thing, right?

1199
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,764
And not just sip it.

1200
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,138
Bottoms up. That's a baby shot.

1201
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,107
Slam it down on the counter. Yeah!

1202
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,341
Let's get drunk.

1203
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,717
Jake can feel wasted! Yeah.

1204
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,045
Hey, he needs one, too!

1205
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,911
Slap it, slap it!

1206
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,889
Come on! There, right there!

1207
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,954
Wasted!

1208
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,897
Wake up, Jake.
You need to come in the hot tub, dude.

1209
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:11,302
Hot tub, shmot tub.
I'm trying not to vomit.

1210
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,448
Stonehenge Pro Shop, Ali speaking.

1211
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,453
- Hello?
<i>- Megan?</i>

1212
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,580
- You're on your way?
<i>- I'm hanging out with Geoff.</i>

1213
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,218
<i>- Like hanging, hanging out with him?</i>
- Yeah, maybe.

1214
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:35,821
I mean, I like Geoff. He's really nice.
He's just nice to talk to.

1215
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,024
<i>So is that liking him?</i>

1216
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,198
<i>- Do you want to go to prom with Geoff?</i>
- Yes.

1217
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,102
Twenty-ones.

1218
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:52,479
- What you doing?
- I'm checking my messages.

1219
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:55,939
I want to read them.

1220
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,781
No, you can't just go on reading
my messages now.

1221
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,549
What are you doing?

1222
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:03,182
- I want to read his messages.
- Why?

1223
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,691
- I don't know!
- Erasing.

1224
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:06,124
Why does it matter?

1225
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,095
- She's curious. She's curious tonight.
- I'm curious.

1226
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:13,291
Let's see who she's talking to.

1227
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,233
Fine. Leave me here.

1228
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,703
- Dude, it's just weird, you know?
- How is it weird?

1229
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:18,830
It's just kinda weird!

1230
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,432
It's like,
best friend, best friend, best friend.

1231
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,170
And then it's like,
best friend, best friend.

1232
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,371
It's just awkward, it's just like...

1233
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,438
Do you want me to back off of Geoff
for some God-unknown reason?

1234
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,278
I'm not saying that.

1235
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:31,775
I don't know what I'm saying.
I didn't say anything.

1236
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,287
- I came in here to call Bridget.
- Okay, but you've been shitting me.

1237
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,916
All right, well,
I just won't get near Geoff.

1238
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,059
Did she say something to you?

1239
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,090
You said something to her, didn't you?

1240
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:46,531
It wasn't me, though.
Ali approached me!

1241
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:47,659
And said what?

1242
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,330
She goes, "What's your problem?"

1243
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:51,599
Say, "Nothing."

1244
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,368
I tried to.

1245
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:56,069
She goes, "You're acting really weird
towards me and Geoff."

1246
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:57,702
I said, "You're ignoring me.
You're ignoring me."

1247
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,543
She has not come near me
the rest of the night.

1248
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,640
Okay, I'll fix it.

1249
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,718
Whatever.

1250
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,253
I hate you.

1251
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,051
It's probably the nicest thing
I've done for her in my life.

1252
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,421
Really?

1253
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,460
- Thank you.
- I didn't have to do it.

1254
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,462
I hate Geoff. I hate Geoff.

1255
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,829
Megan's jealous.

1256
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,357
- What?
- Geoff.

1257
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,564
Geoff, can you leave?
I'd really like you to leave.

1258
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:26,334
- I'd really like to not.
- Geoff, I'd just like you to leave.

1259
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,740
- Can you shut the... up?
- Geoff, I... hate you.

1260
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,370
- Get over it.
- "Hey, I'm Geoff. I'm ignorant as shit."

1261
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,880
"Hey, I'm Megan, I'm a... whore."

1262
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,747
Geoff is the biggest... licker.
Geoff likes hairy...

1263
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,514
Megan doesn't even have a preference,
as long as it's...

1264
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,248
- Geoff, we're gonna make noise.
- What about this?

1265
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:42,483
Is that loud enough for you?

1266
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,491
Megan, you need to relax.

1267
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:47,327
Listen up, you ass.
I don't want you here.

1268
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,030
Now leave.

1269
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,360
Ever since Megan got into Notre Dame,

1270
01:22:55,437 --> 01:23:00,033
she's on a frigging power trip again.
I'm just, like, over it.

1271
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,542
"You know, it was just a joke.

1272
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:05,340
"Sorry if what I did would make you
mad, but I'm not sorry for what I did."

1273
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,711
I'm not taking this anymore, you know?

1274
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,354
<i>Ali and Geoff completely ditched me.</i>

1275
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,091
<i>Now they're not talking to me.</i>

1276
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,261
I'm all alone now.

1277
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,496
I want you to calculate for me
how much total pressure will go...

1278
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,166
<i>Everybody's kind of disappointing me.</i>

1279
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,638
<i>I can't wait to get out of here.</i>
<i>I can't wait to get to Notre Dame.</i>

1280
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,453
<i>Notre Dame's beautiful.</i>

1281
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:49,918
<i>The quality of people at Notre Dame are</i>
<i>different from, like, a lot of universities.</i>

1282
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:54,360
<i>There really are whole people that go</i>
<i>to Notre Dame, and caring people.</i>

1283
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:58,190
<i>You go there</i>
<i>and you get this sense of unity.</i>

1284
01:23:58,266 --> 01:24:00,928
<i>It's unbelievable</i>
<i>how close the kids are there,</i>

1285
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,436
<i>and the connection that they have.</i>

1286
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,271
<i>It'll be a completely different lifestyle.</i>
<i>Better.</i>

1287
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,375
I'm very excited.

1288
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,285
I've been looking forward to this day
for a couple weeks now.

1289
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:24,580
I'm going up to Chicago to pick up
Leslie at the airport.

1290
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,423
<i>Leslie is a girl that I met</i>
<i>at my brother's wedding.</i>

1291
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,053
<i>She lives in San Diego.</i>

1292
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:32,327
<i>I've had a crush on her</i>
<i>since the first day I met her.</i>

1293
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,795
<i>And I'm taking her to prom.</i>

1294
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,373
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good.

1295
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,241
What's there to do in Warsaw, then?

1296
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:46,109
Absolutely nothing.

1297
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:49,241
So, I want to get over there,
but we're not gonna make it.

1298
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:53,048
Yes, you could.
You accomplish amazing things.

1299
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,346
You lived through high school.

1300
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,655
- This is for you for letting me stay.
- Thank you.

1301
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:00,716
I didn't get Jake anything.

1302
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:03,389
Well, if you have to sleep in his room,
you might want this back.

1303
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,665
I opt for the couch.

1304
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,074
Other than the dead animals,

1305
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:23,773
it's not that bad.

1306
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,749
No offense, Jake. It's not you, it's me.

1307
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,550
<i>I'll definitely be uncomfortable at prom,</i>

1308
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,720
<i>but I'm not gonna let it</i>
<i>get to me as much.</i>

1309
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,230
- I like that!
- The <i>Labyrinth</i> poster?

1310
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,324
<i>Since Leslie is gonna be with me,</i>
<i>prom should be really exciting.</i>

1311
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,904
Did you do somebody else's hair
for prom?

1312
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,601
You told me
you weren't doing anybody else.

1313
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,240
Jesus Christ.

1314
01:25:58,119 --> 01:25:59,848
You look so cute.

1315
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,383
Oh, look great.

1316
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,018
- Princess.
- Very nice.

1317
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:10,826
You are scrumptious.
Are you going to put makeup on?

1318
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:11,923
I did.

1319
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,059
You could add a little blush.

1320
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:15,727
I already put some on.

1321
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,707
Like my barrette?

1322
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:24,802
- Beautiful. Did you do a little?
- I'm done.

1323
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:26,972
- Yes, I did!
- It's very faint.

1324
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,072
I'm pale!

1325
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:29,874
Pretty.

1326
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,633
I sure like the way that suit fits him.

1327
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,465
Honey, go on Clarke's side. Go!

1328
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,439
- Right here.
- Yeah.

1329
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,908
Okay, I'm gonna try to stand up straight.

1330
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:59,335
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1331
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,939
- We're trying to stand up straight.
- Okay, I'm going to count to three.

1332
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,184
I love your dress. It's so bright.

1333
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,118
Hang on, hang on,
we have to do this right.

1334
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:11,022
Okay, come over here.
And now I pull the chair out for you,

1335
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,753
and then you pretend
like you're sitting down,

1336
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:15,591
but don't really, until I do that.

1337
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,425
You can get whatever you want.

1338
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,398
I have 60 bucks in my wallet.

1339
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,263
Okay. Okay.

1340
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,308
Hello, do you know
where we're supposed to park?

1341
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,343
- Nope.
- Are the doors locked?

1342
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,038
No, we're just standing out here
because it's fun.

1343
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:33,205
Cool.

1344
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:35,747
So we're early.

1345
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,684
How big of a loser
does that make you feel?

1346
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:43,054
Yeah, me, too. This is gonna be great.

1347
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,938
<i>This year's King and Queen</i>
<i>of the Jungle</i>

1348
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,340
<i>are Kim Clay and Mitch Reinholt.</i>

1349
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:16,715
<i>Looking at everyone...</i>

1350
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:20,056
<i>All these kids that care so much</i>
<i>about what other people think</i>

1351
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,289
<i>and are afraid to be themselves...</i>

1352
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:33,063
<i>I will never, ever belong here.</i>
<i>I cannot stay here.</i>

1353
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:40,074
I'm going to California.

1354
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:45,484
Well, I know San Francisco State
is where your heart is set,

1355
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,522
but it's... It's not possible.

1356
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:52,047
Well, I'm glad that it's not your choice
and it's mine.

1357
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:55,186
But with the cost of being
an out-of-state student,

1358
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:57,731
you need our assistance
in helping pay for those choices.

1359
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,632
Well, what if I don't go to school?

1360
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:03,896
It's not a smart thing
you're wanting to do, Hannah.

1361
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:06,599
It's not like I'm just gonna go out there
and never go to college.

1362
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,801
I'm gonna go out there
and live for a year

1363
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,470
and gain residency
and then go to college.

1364
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:15,983
If I gain residency, it'd make it about
five times less to go to school there.

1365
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,713
I'm doing the most, like...
It seems like the most logical thing.

1366
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,723
You've got to remember
how far away that is.

1367
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,349
That's why I want to go.

1368
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:30,693
But you're gonna be on your own.
A young girl all alone in a big city...

1369
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:35,266
A young, attractive female living alone,

1370
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:41,332
you are a target
to a lot of nuts out there, Hannah.

1371
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:45,539
You know, I read about this all the time.
You know that's my hobby.

1372
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,479
We're not wanting
to try to scare you or...

1373
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,915
- You're not.
- Yeah.

1374
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,613
We're just trying to tell you
what we think is safe for you

1375
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,952
and what we think is smart for you.

1376
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:58,890
No. You know what?
I would take you guys' advice

1377
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,294
if I wanted to live your lives. But I don't
want anything like you guys' lives.

1378
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:04,558
I don't want to live in Indiana.

1379
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:08,295
I don't want to raise a family and work
a 9-to-5 job that I absolutely hate.

1380
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:12,169
I don't want any of that.
So that's why I'm not taking your advice,

1381
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,334
- 'cause I don't want to end up like that.
- Then what do you want?

1382
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:20,109
I want to work in movies
and live in a city that I actually enjoy.

1383
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,979
But you know something?
We're trying to give you some advice

1384
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:27,077
so that you can sit down
and think about things.

1385
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:30,750
- Give the whole picture some thought.
- I already have.

1386
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:33,817
You think I haven't thought about
things in the last six months?

1387
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,125
But you haven't considered us.

1388
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:37,926
It's not your life.

1389
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,470
It's hard to believe it's Monday.

1390
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:45,870
Yeah, it is. Four-day weekend.

1391
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,573
Nice.

1392
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:50,406
Best four-day weekend ever.

1393
01:30:57,685 --> 01:31:00,153
<i>This is something really different.</i>

1394
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:05,455
<i>I think she really likes me and</i>
<i>I feel completely relaxed around her.</i>

1395
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:08,162
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>how this is gonna turn out.</i>

1396
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:10,163
<i>But I can see us staying together,</i>

1397
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,223
<i>having like a fairytale</i>
<i>romantic relationship,</i>

1398
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,998
or I can see us breaking up
within the next two months,

1399
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:21,030
like something unbelievably horrible
happening while she's here in August

1400
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:22,473
and then she hates me forever.

1401
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:27,443
<i>But, right now,</i>
<i>I guess you could say I'm falling in love.</i>

1402
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:44,193
Well, this is exciting, isn't it?
This is your first real offer.

1403
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:49,067
Tuition, living in the dorm,
room and board is 25 grand.

1404
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:53,873
The Indiana Tech University
scholarship, that's $19,941.

1405
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:57,344
And there's the deficit, $5,737.

1406
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:58,969
I think it's a good package.

1407
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:03,883
The basketball part
we think is top-notch.

1408
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:11,851
Did I tell you today,
did I tell you how proud I am?

1409
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:13,518
I know I get on you all the time.

1410
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:17,325
I just don't want you to miss on
all you can be.

1411
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:23,298
I love you. Even if you're not
gonna be Elvis, I love you.

1412
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,464
All right, congratulations.

1413
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,442
<i>As you sit here and take in the final</i>
<i>odor of your senior class...</i>

1414
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:32,604
<i>We are sure there are many questions</i>
<i>still burning through your minds.</i>

1415
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,375
<i>Will I find my place in the world?</i>

01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:35,676
<i>And more importantly...</i>

1417
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,843
<i>Who are these two attractive individuals</i>

1418
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:42,015
<i>and how long do we have the privilege</i>

1419

<i>As much as this day is for you,</i>

1420
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,018
<i>They sit in this gym today pondering</i>
<i>the possibilities that lay ahead of us...</i>

1421
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:52,361
<i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>are apprehensive about letting us go.</i>

1422
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,594
<i>They stood behind us</i>
<i>for the past 18 years...</i>

1423
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:58,196
<i>And now stand poised</i>
<i>to push us into the next stage of our life.</i>

1424
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:01,036
<i>They have and always will be</i>
<i>there for us.</i>

1425
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:04,544
<i>We know everyone in this gym</i>
<i>holds a dream in their heart.</i>

1426
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:07,308
<i>The truth is that some of us</i>
<i>realize those dreams.</i>

1427
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,612
<i>But most of us don't.</i>
<i>The future may seem a little vague.</i>

1428
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:11,913
<i>But it's full of promise.</i>

1429
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:14,250
<i>- So go.</i>
<i>- Get what you need.</i>

1430
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,449
<i>- Reach for what you want.</i>
<i>- But most importantly...</i>

1431
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,651
<i>Know what you already have.</i>

All right, Hannah.

01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,295

<i>Jacob Lee Tusing.</i>

1440

1442
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,890
New chances to just be
a whole new person.

1443
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:32,131
I mean, once I get there,
I could be like Mr. Muscles.

1444
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:35,168
Like, I could work out every day
and go swimming.

1445
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:39,532
I don't know,
I could also be the really smart kid.

1446
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:40,972
I could study all the time.

1447
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:44,170
Or I could be a true wildman
and party every night.

1448
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:45,678
I don't know,
there's just so many options

1449
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,839
and I'm really looking forward to that.

1450

- We're rolling.
- Good luck.

1451
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,491
Go tell Clarke goodbye.

1452
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:11,604
We'll be thinking of you.

1453
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,872
- You're the best friend I've ever had.
- You're my best friend.

1454
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:17,604
- Bye.
- Bye.

1455
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:22,240
Be careful.

1456
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:24,477
You use your good
common sense, okay?

1457
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,850
- Okay.
- Be smart about things.

1458
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,980
- You're gonna be in a big city, and...
- Okay.

1459
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,387
All right.

1460
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:33,859
- And if it doesn't work, come home.
- Okay.

1461
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,260
- No questions asked.
- Bye.

1462
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:37,490
Okay.
