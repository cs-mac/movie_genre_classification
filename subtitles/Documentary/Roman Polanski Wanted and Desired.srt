1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,550
Around 140 years
ago during the Boshin War...

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,600
There was an assassin
named Hitokiri ("Killer") Battosai...

3
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:45,300
He roamed the streets of Kyoto
and was feared for his strength
and his skill.

4
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:54,550
And now at the battlefield
during the war...

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:25,400
1868 JANUARY
KYOTO - MOUNTAINS OF TOBA FUSHIMA

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,310
They're here! Shinsengumi!

7
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,350
Hitokiri Battousai!

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,990
Where?! Where are you?!

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,910
Prepare yourself Shinsengumi Third
Division Captain Saito Hajime!

10
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,950
Show yourself, Battousai!

11
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,990
We won! It's Nishiki's group!

12
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,070
Are you guys from the rebel army?!

13
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,550
We've won!

14
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,870
It's begun...

15
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
The new era.

16
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,470
Finally...

17
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,990
Himura Battousai!

18
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,310
Do you think it ends here?

19
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,869
Although the world is about to change...

20
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,530
We all live and die by the sword.
This will never change for us.

21
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,470
Why?

22
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,460
Why am I the only one...

23
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
What's with this katana?

24
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,950
This was Hitokiri Battousai's...

25
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,750
And now a few words from Admiral
Aritomo Yamagata!

26
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,030
Salute!

27
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,310
At ease!

28
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,230
It has been 10 years since
the Restoration!

29
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,110
This country is now a model for
Western European countries!

30
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,940
To new trade agreements!

31
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,240
We shall make this new government
last and thrive!

32
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,190
There will be happiness
and stability all over!

33
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,830
The era of fear and violence
is now over!

34
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,310
Salute!

35
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,150
Humans are weak.

36
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,300
Let us discuss this ideal.

37
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,190
Humans eventually become what
they fear, monsters.

38
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,350
For yourself.

39
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,150
For profit.

40
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,230
And for pleasure.

41
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,900
Excuse me.

42
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,750
You did well. I'm proud of you Megumi.

43
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
Thank you.

44
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,190
This calls for a new pin.

45
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,710
The change from man to beast.

46
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,190
You may go.

47
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,430
I know how to use humans. One
will be enough for now.

48
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,030
Which one?

49
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,870
Thank you very much!

50
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,830
Damn it!

51
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,110
Let's go!

52
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,870
Leave him!

53
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,510
That man...

54
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,030
Battousai will take care of him.

55
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,470
Banzai! Banzai!

56
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,910
Come on! How about some
grilled dumplings?

57
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,910
One please!

58
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,270
He was an undercover police officer.

59
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,300
A serial killer?

60
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,110
Hitokiri Battousai again? Why now,
all of a sudden?

61
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,580
A fake.

62
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,430
What?

63
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,550
There's something wrong with the way
this man was killed.

64
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,300
What do you...?

65
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
This was no Battousai.

66
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,630
Oro?

67
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,310
"Hitokiri Battousai..."

68
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,910
Kamiya Kasshin Ryu?

69
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,670
You there!

70
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,430
To carry a sword, ignoring
the law against them...

71
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,500
Are you the rumored Hitokiri Battousai?

72
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,750
Oro?

73
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,150
They found a murder victim today.
Come quietly!

74
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,230
Hold on! Wait a second!

75
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,820
Shut up!

76
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,510
You're mistaken!

77
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,230
Ororo...

78
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,340
I'm a wanderer...

79
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,030
I'm merely a wandering swordsman,
that's all.

80
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,340
You understand?

81
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,150
Right, then what's with that thing?

82
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,510
This is a reverse-blade sword.

83
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,190
Reverse blade sword?

84
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,390
This sword...

85
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,070
has the blade reversed,
on the opposite side

86
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,590
reversed from the normal katana.

87
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,600
You can't kill people with this.

88
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
Right?

89
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,780
That's unnecessary.

90
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,060
In any case, that description...

91
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,590
It started six months ago...

92
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,790
Every time he kills, he leaves a letter
claiming responsibility.

93
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,670
Even though times have changed...

94
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,150
Oro?

95
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,910
Kanryu-sama!

96
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,230
We have a guest.

97
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,780
I thought the person who
called the police was already
in custody?

98
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,150
Here, want one?

99
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,910
What about it?

100
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,840
An undercover cop was killed last night.

101
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,670
He calls himself "Battousai."

102
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,110
The ghostly samurai from 10 years ago?

103
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,470
You think he's the killer?

104
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,630
What are you storing at the Shinbashi
warehouse?

105
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,630
Warehouse?

106
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,630
Ah, no need to worry about that one.

107
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,740
We just keep all our imported goods
in that warehouse, nothing illegal.

108
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,460
Of course if you wanted to search it,

109
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,270
You would need a formal warrant.

110
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,420
Otherwise, you'll stay out of it.

111
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,310
Because it is a new era

112
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,980
Quit fucking around.

113
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,700
That samurai is long gone,
times have changed.

114
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,030
There's food!

115
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,390
Look at this hapless bunch.

116
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,190
Samurai have no choice
but to wander aimlessly
in this Meiji Era.

117
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,550
It's a terrible time for them, and they
work for practically nothing.

118
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,350
And when the dogs are hungry,
they get to eat.

119
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,550
Do you still think you're a samurai?

120
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,750
I still am.

121
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,830
The government mule does not fit.

122
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,350
Be warned.

123
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,230
The police may need proof
and evidence, but not me.

124
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,270
Kanryu-sama, Megumi isn't here.

125
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Wait what? Megumi ran away?!

126
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,070
Money in exchange for information
from the police.

127
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,390
So much commotion over one woman.

128
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,270
That bitch, Megumi!

129
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,150
"Don't worry!"

130
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,280
If they find out about the opium,
we're in trouble.

131
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,110
Stupid big brother

132
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,750
I know how to handle such
desperate women.

133
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,470
Do you guys even understand women?

134
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,930
What'd you say punk?!

135
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,750
Shut up!

136
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,790
Return that woman to me immediately.

137
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,660
Don't touch me.

138
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,980
What'd you say?

139
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,900
I'll do it.

140
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,790
What?

141
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,310
Don't kill her Jin'ei.

142
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,630
I need that woman for her
"purification methods."

143
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,670
After that, do as you like... Battousai.

144
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,030
Aren't you the one that
needs protection?

145
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,300
You must understand, if you
don't tell us...

146
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,510
well, I guess there's nothing we can do.

147
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,340
Hey there!

148
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,820
It's over there over there

149
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,710
Move! Move!

150
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,550
Are you the "Battousai"?!

151
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,750
What the...?!

152
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,390
Don't move!

153
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,950
Stop!

154
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,750
This is not sorcery.

155
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,940
Nikaidou Heiho Ryu, "Shin No Ippou"

156
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,020
Human fear is fragile.

157
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,950
When their fear is intensified,
they are unable to move.

158
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,620
Painful?

159
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,310
People with fragile hearts
are easily controlled.

160
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,830
Neko-chan!

161
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,230
Neko, nya!

162
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,980
Hey!

163
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,870
Freeze!

164
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,390
You're "Battousai"?

165
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,910
Why are you doing this?

166
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,060
The name Kamiya Kasshin Ryu
has been smeared...

167
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,750
Because of you. My father...

168
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,540
The Kamiya Kasshin Ryu
left by my father!

169
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,430
What happened to your father?

170
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,720
He frowned upon the use of swords
to kill or be killed.

171
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,110
The people who took advantage
of the sword, those people!

172
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,470
Does a woman with a wooden sword
expect to stand up to me?

173
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,510
Shut up!

174
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,790
What you can do with this stick?

175
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,790
What does a sword bathed
in blood live for?

176
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
You will find out in the afterlife.

177
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,470
Don't forget this.

178
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,990
Who are you?

179
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,110
Just someone else.

180
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,670
You. Are you the one calling himself,
"Battousai"?

181
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,990
That scar...

182
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,030
That agility...

183
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,510
You are the legendary...

184
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,430
It doesn't work on you...

185
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,870
Run.

186
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,150
This way! This way!

187
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,709
It's the Battousai!

188
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,550
Living through this world
finally has meaning.

189
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,660
You can't get away!

190
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,070
Are you okay?

191
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,220
Battousai went this way!

192
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,710
Get him!

193
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,220
This way.

194
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,510
No, this way!

195
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,270
Oro?!

196
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,750
I'd say thanks,

197
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,750
but I was fine.
I can take care of myself.
I didn't need your help.

198
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,740
Do you normally look for trouble
this early?

199
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,950
Kamiya Kaoru assistant instructor...

200
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,150
It was originally a school.

201
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,310
But my father died.

202
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,990
We had many students practicing here.

203
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,150
But six months ago,
the "Battousai" mess began.

204
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,830
This is all that's left.

205
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,230
I have to stop that man
as soon as possible.

206
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,030
Why must you do this?

207
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,310
Huh?

208
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,190
That man is stronger
than you Kaoru-dono.

209
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,190
Accepting one's own strength, and
the strength of others is an important
quality of a swordsman.

210
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,990
It is something you will come to find
naturally, through technique.

211
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,350
The reputation of one's style.

212
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,870
Is it worth risking your life
to protect such a thing?

213
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,870
"The sword is not a tool for killing."

214
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,190
To go against the human ideal
is Kamiya Kasshin Ryu.

215
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,900
Swordsmanship is the art of killing.

216
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,100
A mere wanderer...

217
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,910
would not understand my frustration!

218
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,030
"A sword that protects."

219
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,230
Well...

220
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,430
Your wounds are still fresh, so you
won't be able to fight tonight.

221
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,270
Also, I don't think your father

222
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,420
would want her daughter's life
to be spent

223
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,630
so that the family style
would be protected.

224
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,780
Pardon me.

225
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,310
What a mess!

226
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,350
Is this a challenge?

227
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,340
Rurouni?

228
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,910
Oh it's you...

229
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,710
Whaddya mean "oh it's you"?

230
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,070
Myojin Yahiko-sama is more like it!

231
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,830
Quiet down.

232
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,350
Is there any breakfast?

233
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,590
Please! Give an orphan a hot meal,
so he can practice!

234
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,910
Shut up.

235
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,750
Practice was earlier.

236
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,910
Kaoru: Clean up!
Yahiko: Come on...

237
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,270
What do you guys want?

238
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,950
To buy this dojo.

239
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,550
What'd you say?

240
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,590
I'll give you a good amount.

241
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,070
A very wealthy man wants
to buy this dojo.

242
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,070
For you...

243
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,590
It's not such a bad deal.

244
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,940
What are you talking about?

245
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,150
My father's dojo
is not for sale!

246
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,110
Assistant instructor dude!

247
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,100
You're quite the brazen woman,
aren't you?

248
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,750
From a school that trained a murderer!

249
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,990
Battousai has nothing to do with us!

250
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,100
Impossible!

251
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,670
This is the famous "Hitokiri" dojo!

252
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,950
No one believes you.

253
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,470
Wait! Stop it!

254
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,620
Stop that!

255
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,470
What're you punks doing?!

256
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,150
Yahiko!

257
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,310
What is this kid?

258
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,300
Samurai Myojin Yahiko of Tokyo.
Bullying is unforgivable!

259
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,430
Let the child go!

260
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,990
What are you!

261
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,950
If the boss says so, we shall!

262
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,260
That's correct!

263
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,510
The school here preaches,
<i>you must not take advantage
of the sword.</i>

264
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,670
And that sword there,
are you not taking advantage?!

265
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,510
Do not enter with your dirty shoes!

266
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,190
What is a sword without a human?

267
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,510
Remove your shoes!

268
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,670
A sword is not a tool for killing.

269
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,030
That is the essence of swordsmanship.

270
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,710
Bullshit!

271
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,550
You'll pay...

272
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,190
What the...?

273
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,540
Rurouni...

274
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,220
Out of the way!

275
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,180
Who're you?!

276
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,590
Certainly,

277
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,670
It's been said that the katana,

278
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,550
is merely the tool, and
the person kills.

279
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,870
That makes sense does it not?

280
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,390
The sword is a weapon.

281
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,070
Swordsmanship is learning how to kill.

282
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,740
No matter how much you sugar coat it,
that is the truth.

283
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,590
I believe that is the truth.

284
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,750
But what Kaoru-dono is saying,

285
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,150
I kind of like that idea better.

286
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,110
Get him!

287
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,620
The style of Hitokiri Battousai
is Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu.

288
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,190
It is a style meant to fight many.

289
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,230
As long as it's this sword.

290
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,750
None of you will die.

291
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,420
You!

292
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,430
You're...

293
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,340
Kaoru-chan!

294
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,910
Did something happen?!

295
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,390
They're dead!

296
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,830
Wait a minute!

297
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,270
What happened... was that?

298
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,380
Is he the killer?!

299
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,430
You're mistaken!

300
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,590
These people were vandals!

301
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,940
But everything's fine.

302
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,750
No one was killed. Just unconscious.

303
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,590
Over here!

304
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,790
What happened here?!

305
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,830
Don't you guys know it is forbidden
to wear swords!

306
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,150
Arrest them!

307
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,470
What happened?

308
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,790
Don't blame them.

309
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,270
I am a wanderer and I happened
to pass by.

310
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,470
This dojo has nothing to do
with any of this.

311
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,460
Let's go!

312
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,500
Hold it!

313
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,630
Rurouni-san...

314
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,350
What is it?

315
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,820
Tell me your name.

316
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,670
Ororo!

317
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,980
Wait a minute!

318
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,350
Himura Kenshin.

319
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,790
Out of the way!

320
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,870
Kenshin?

321
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,350
Heart of Sword?

322
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,750
Shut the fuck up!

323
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,550
A newbie!

324
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,020
Walk quickly!

325
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,740
Open!

326
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,950
The man with the cross-shaped scar.

327
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,790
It was you.

328
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,470
It's been awhile.

329
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,590
Hitokiri Battousai.

330
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,850
It's been 10 years since the battle
at Toba Fushimi.

331
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,460
What's your story?

332
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,100
Retired?

333
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,040
Hitokiri Battousai...?

334
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,870
It's been a long time, where
have you been?

335
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,070
Yamagata-san!

336
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,870
I suppose your disappearance
in the last decade

337
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,550
is testament to your devotion
to <i>never killing again.</i>

338
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,060
What?

339
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,950
This man?

340
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,070
That was a different era.

341
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,750
I wanted a better country.

342
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,910
Now, it is Fujita Goro's job to protect.

343
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,590
What do you want with me?

344
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,430
These things are purchased openly.

345
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,750
Known as "Spider's Web"

346
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,270
Looks ordinary, but its contents
are completely different.

347
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,590
We've come across them a few times now.

348
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,950
Opium will destroy a nation.

349
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,790
Even the Kano Dynasty was unable
to stop opium.

350
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,070
Some of the land became
colonies of England.

351
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,270
I am only a wanderer.

352
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,750
Why're you telling me this?

353
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,150
If they can make this,

354
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,790
no doubt they are planning
something bigger.

355
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,150
Lend me your strength.

356
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,470
In return, you will have a
key position in the Army.

357
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,639
Use the strength in these arms
once more.

358
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,930
I have no intention of becoming
"hitokiri" again.

359
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,990
"Hitokiri" huh?

360
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,710
That's it? This is for the Restoration!

361
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
Have you become a fool?

362
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,230
What is this joke of a katana?

363
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,510
How does one protect people
without killing?

364
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,870
With this sword...

365
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,830
I'm able to protect those around me.

366
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,190
Show me.

367
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,390
Because those words are just words
unless you can protect yourself.

368
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,659
I won't draw my sword.

369
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,700
Screw you!

370
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,590
Reverse your sword,

371
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,070
or I will make you suffer.

372
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,230
It was like this...

373
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,800
Do you remember those days?

374
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,150
That was me in the past,

375
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,110
I don't kill anymore.

376
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,150
Forget it!

377
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,710
I'm sorry.

378
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,830
It's okay.

379
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,150
Let him go.

380
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,350
Hey Kaoru?

381
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,990
Kaoru!

382
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,870
Oh!

383
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,590
Hey! Are you okay?!

384
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,230
Please help!

385
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,590
I'm being chased!

386
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,060
Please...

387
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,300
Kaoru-dono...

388
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,510
You have nowhere to go, right?

389
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,870
Come with me.

390
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,350
Because you helped me.

391
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,070
I understand.

392
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,229
But I'm the "hitokiri"...

393
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,950
I don't know who that is.

394
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,270
The person I met,

395
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,110
was a wanderer named Kenshin.

396
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,590
Everyone has a past they wish to erase.

397
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,710
Right?

398
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,110
Here.

399
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,270
Take it!

400
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,270
Let's go!

401
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,550
Hurry!

402
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,630
Let's go!

403
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,230
Come inside.

404
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,910
Excuse me.

405
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,270
Yahiko

406
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,910
Myojin Yahiko, sometimes
I teach him fencing.

407
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,070
And kind of stays here.

408
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,510
Only because you have no other students.

409
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,110
He has a bad mouth. But
he has a good heart.

410
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,430
Shut up! I'm going to be strong!

411
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,950
I know I know.

412
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,390
Kenshin will be staying
with us from today.

413
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,110
Well, I'm the sempai then!

414
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,110
Nice to meet you.

415
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,030
Hey! Introduce me too!

416
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,660
Who are you?!

417
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,590
She was soaking wet so
I let her take a bath.

418
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,329
Without asking me?!

419
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,990
Hey, who's the gentlemen over there?

420
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,350
Wait! Wait...!

421
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,150
A wanderer, Kenshin.

422
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,990
Oh you!

423
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,250
I heard it from this child

424
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,790
Nice to meet you, I am Takani Megumi.

425
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,830
Nice to meet you.

426
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,430
I brought you a change of clothes.

427
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,350
You didn't have to.

428
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,230
These were my fathers,

429
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,870
they are all I have left
from when I was a child,
but they should fit.

430
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,780
Wait...

431
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,350
Is the color too much?

432
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,710
No... it's fine.

433
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,510
"A sword that protects."

434
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,470
Welcome!

435
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,390
By the way...

436
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,070
Why are you here?

437
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,870
Oh, she seems to be bothered
by my words.

438
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,670
There's not a lot of people
in this area, right?

439
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,310
Where's your home? Where are you from?

440
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,460
Secret!

441
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,710
"Mysterious Beauty" sounds nice, right?

442
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,350
Anyway.

443
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,910
Here you go.

444
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,110
Oh, thanks.

445
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,630
I want to thank you for helping me.
Eat as much as you want.

446
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,990
Okay.

447
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,830
Delicious.

448
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,390
Isn't it?

449
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,790
Hot! Hot!

450
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,990
Eat carefully!

451
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,340
I know!

452
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,860
Kaoru-chan

453
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,400
Things are tough at the dojo, huh?

454
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,540
Tae-san...

455
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,270
Let me know if we can help.

456
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,830
Everyone around here

457
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,590
will help you no matter what happens.

458
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,670
Welcome!

459
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,270
Welcome!

460
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,230
Takeda Kanryu!

461
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,780
He's the wealthy merchant who
owns a mansion at the edge of town.

462
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,470
Where is the kitchen?

463
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,910
Over there

464
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,910
Kanryu-sama!

465
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,870
Please excuse me for interrupting
your meal.

466
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:51,670
Aren't you the person who beat
up the 10 thugs at a nearby dojo?

467
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,910
I am a businessman.

468
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,430
Hey.

469
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,140
We'll be straightforward.

470
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,270
We want to hire you with this money

471
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,470
We can hire 10 people with that. That's
10 times the amount for one.

472
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,830
What do you think? Want to be
our bodyguard?

473
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,390
I must refuse.

474
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,990
Is this not enough?

475
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,310
I see.

476
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,150
You're "the samurai who hasn't eaten,
yet picks his teeth"

477
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,270
That's all fine!

478
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,350
But in the Meiji Era,
money is everything!

479
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,310
Unfortunately I don't value such pride.

480
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,870
Unlike this man here.

481
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,150
I do not take such valuables so lightly,

482
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,790
that I can throw it away!

483
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,230
All it takes is one walk down
the red-light district,

484
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,430
and you could lose your wife
or even your daughters!

485
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,270
I am merely trying to free this world
of samurai and catch all bandits!

486
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,470
That life may be fine for samurai.

487
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,670
To have fun,

488
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,310
and live,

489
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,780
remember this.

490
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,750
You're being very rude.

491
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,990
You would throw away my money?!

492
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,910
Then give me the money.

493
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,350
Sanosuke-san?

494
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,710
Wa..wait!

495
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,470
You can hire me.

496
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,700
What are you?

497
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,830
Sagara Sanosuke of the Brawlers.

498
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,870
Fishing for money straight
out of jail?

499
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,460
Are you worth this much money?

500
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,030
Are those arms?

501
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,500
I'll give it a shot,
against the legendary "hitokiri."

502
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,830
Himura Battousai-san

503
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,390
Eh?!

504
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,710
How about a fight
so they can hire me?

505
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,510
This is not the place.

506
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,540
Meet me outside.

507
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,670
Oh! I've been waiting for this!

508
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,119
Come out and watch everyone!

509
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,210
They are going to fight!
Come out and watch everyone!

510
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:56,910
They are going to fight!

511
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,950
This guy here,

512
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,470
is a horse killing sword called Zanbato.

513
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,440
It's an antique from the Onin Wars.

514
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,790
It doesn't look like you
share my tastes.

515
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,790
However...

516
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,590
It can still crush you.

517
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,230
Get over here!

518
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,630
Himura Battousai!

519
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,870
Assassin for the Ishin Shishi Faction,

520
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,260
A killer from the age of 14 to 19.

521
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,390
I've been waiting for this for 10 years!

522
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,190
That's good!

523
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,750
You're in!

524
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,460
Out of the way! Move!

525
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,670
I will not draw my sword.

526
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,150
You'll need your sword
to fight me!

527
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,660
You will not touch me
with that huge sword.

528
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,750
Why is that?!

529
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,150
There is no reason to adjust the sword.

530
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,070
That man...

531
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,430
You would fight for a man like him?

532
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,390
Kanryu: What is it?! What's going on!

533
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,590
What's happening over there?!

534
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,230
What are you doing, Brawler?

535
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,150
Hurry up and finish him!

536
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,550
Shut up!

537
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,510
You don't tell me how to
fight from where you are!

538
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,630
Is it over?

539
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,180
Oh well.

540
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,230
I'd probably end up back
at the police station.

541
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,910
The trouble is over folks!

542
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,950
Hey everyone back to the store!

543
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,590
The show is over!

544
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,750
It's over, it's over!

545
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,110
I'll be back!

546
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,870
I ran into trouble.

547
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,590
Let's eat.

548
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,870
We should not be wasteful.

549
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,910
He's the real deal.

550
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,710
You have done well

551
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,630
Battousai is not someone
that can be bought.

552
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,860
Your pleasure!

553
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,790
I need blood!

554
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,350
I need more blood!

555
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,100
I still thirst for more!

556
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,820
I thirst for Hitokiri Battousai!

557
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,150
The work of the fake battousai again...

558
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:31,150
He kills people, policemen,
which side is he on?

559
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,830
Once you become a murderer,
there's no turning back.

560
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,030
That is the life of a "hitokiri."

561
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,070
Please, go ahead of me.

562
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,110
Huh?

563
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,030
Let's go

564
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,030
Hold on!

565
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,220
I got it!

566
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,190
Those men who attacked the dojo,

567
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,710
You should have killed them back then.

568
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,630
The trick is to kill them,

569
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,550
So that the cops don't get
mixed up in all this.

570
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,590
I wonder if that reversed-blade sword,

571
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,070
really does protect people!

572
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:31,870
Out of the way!

573
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,390
Out of my way!

574
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,830
An assassin for the sake of a new era.

575
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,350
Beyond the life that was sacrificed

576
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,990
So that everyone can live in peace

577
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,180
The dawn of a new era.

578
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,200
Still the world is
at a time like this...

579
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,110
Do not mention the Shugen!

580
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,670
Sorry

581
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,150
Is it not good enough?

582
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,670
Such a happy person!

583
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,630
He's just jealous!

584
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,710
What?

585
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,660
Who goes there? Identify yourself!

586
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,270
Are you "Battousai"?

587
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,310
You damn spy!

588
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,910
Yourself!

589
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,710
I don't want to die!

590
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,990
I can't die!

591
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:26,910
There are people who are important to me
I'm not going die!

592
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,230
I can't die yet!

593
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,790
People are important...

594
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,110
cannot die...

595
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,070
I must not die!

596
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,070
To kill the young man responsible
for the future

597
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,670
What will this assassination
bring for the new era?

598
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,630
Was I correct?

599
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,930
"You're just a murderer."

600
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,190
Kenshin!

601
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,430
Kaoru-dono?

602
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,630
You didn't come back,
I thought something happened.

603
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,460
I didn't know if you had gone somewhere.

604
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,150
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

605
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,430
Wonderful!

606
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,300
I didn't think such a thing existed.

607
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,190
And, what of our plans?

608
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,270
Everything has been arranged.

609
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,310
I'm wasting my time around this harbor.

610
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,190
Where shall I smuggle opium next?

611
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,710
All over Japan!

612
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,630
No!

613
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,550
All over the world!

614
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,590
What is the best way to siphon money
from opium?

615
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,310
Replace the weapons!

616
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,270
A Kanryu Empire!

617
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,910
That will be the new government!

618
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,630
It's time...

619
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,270
to awaken the battousai.

620
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,820
Megumi.

621
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,710
For you to be in such a place...

622
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,460
The one who had the method
of purifying opium.

623
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,550
Together. No...

624
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,430
A common "opium" dealer.

625
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,950
Maybe I should tell your friends,

626
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,500
Be careful.

627
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,790
Megumi made food!

628
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,310
Kenshin is making soup. And the fish...

629
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,670
The fish made by Kaoru.

630
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,830
This is good training eh?

631
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,590
It's good to marry a woman who can cook.

632
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,790
He'll be taken...

633
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,580
Hey you!

634
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,990
Honestly...

635
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,740
I'm too busy looking for disciples.

636
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,670
Especially when this child is incapable
of washing his own hands.

637
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,430
Better get in line!

638
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,750
Now now Kaoru-dono, you too Yahiko.

639
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,790
Come get some food.

640
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,870
Hey! Kaoru-chan!

641
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,710
Someone! Is anyone there?

642
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,030
Kaoru-chan!

643
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,630
Help!

644
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,550
Her body suddenly began to shiver!

645
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,520
She has a hard time breathing!

646
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,070
What about a doctor?

647
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,460
I've asked everyone,
I couldn't find one since yesterday.

648
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,190
Do you have any idea what this is?

649
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,230
Hey!

650
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,060
Be careful.

651
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,070
This dojo will suffer!

652
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,969
Kaoru-chan! Kaoru-chan!

653
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,790
Help!

654
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,430
Kaoru-chan!

655
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,990
Help Kaoru-chan!

656
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,110
What's wrong?

657
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,950
Her stomach has been burning
since this morning!

658
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,310
One of the servants fell too.

659
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,190
Where?

660
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,100
What's going on?!

661
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,070
Such a horrible disease!

662
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,790
Hey!

663
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,910
Someone call a doctor quick!

664
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,470
I'm a doctor

665
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,590
She has a high fever.

666
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,150
Or toxic rat poison

667
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,470
What?

668
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,150
Poison? Are you certain?

669
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,040
Hurry! Or I won't extract
the poison quickly!

670
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,710
But the well water is no good!

671
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,870
It's potentially toxic as well!

672
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,230
Go to the herbal shop, and
buy some castor!

673
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,230
Kettle with the same towel

674
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,030
You!

675
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,910
Go to Mizuya and buy as much water
as you can!

676
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,990
Kaoru-san! Is there an herbalist
in the next town?

677
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,190
There is!

678
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,150
Bring me the medicine I need.

679
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,430
Detoxification treatment, and quickly!

680
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,670
Kenshin: Understood!
Kaoru: Right!

681
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,350
I've got some water! Do you guys
have any water?!

682
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,350
Hang in there! Do your best!

683
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,630
It's cured.

684
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,750
This is unforgivable.

685
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,790
What if they had died.

686
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,270
Megumi-dono.

687
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,430
I think it's time you told me the truth.

688
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,960
Did you say Takani-san?

689
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,830
Do you know Megumi-san?

690
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,990
You know her?

691
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,790
I don't know her,

692
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,550
But any living doctor would know
the name Takani.

693
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,100
Takani Family,

694
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,070
is a venerable family of doctors
that span generations.

695
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,790
But ever since the Aizu War,

696
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,470
I heard that everyone in the family
was killed.

697
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,670
That's that.

698
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,390
The little girls are safe.

699
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,750
You, you're the man slayer right?

700
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,030
Before asking people about the truth,

701
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,750
I wonder if there is another here
who should speak.

702
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:15,430
I am sure those hands have deprived many
of their lives.

703
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,870
That scar?

704
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,030
Are you proud of it?

705
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,550
Perhaps it's some kind of medal.

706
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,150
This scar...

707
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,590
Belongs to a young samurai.

708
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,070
And the other scar,

709
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,430
The wife of a man I killed.

710
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,630
I have many others.

711
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,030
I've taken many lives...

712
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,070
I'm different from you.

713
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,420
I have no family or relatives.

714
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,110
I worked for Kanryu.

715
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,630
Became his woman.

716
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,430
Just to use each other.

717
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,950
He sells opium for the money,

718
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,270
I do it to survive.

719
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,590
To survive.

720
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,510
Please give me opium!
Please!

721
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,270
No way!

722
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,660
Pipe down!

723
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,910
Kanryu is holed up in his mansion
with 250 guards.

724
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,510
Most haven't fought since
the Restoration.

725
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,190
You have my fists.

726
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,910
I'll go with you.

727
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,030
Kenshin!

728
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,590
Kenshin, look at this!

729
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,670
Megumi-san isn't here!

730
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,020
Don't tell me...

731
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,180
I'm going too!

732
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,030
Kaoru-dono must stay here.

733
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,310
This is no concern for the
head of Kamiya Kasshin Ryu.

734
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,310
But...

735
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,030
We'll be fighting all night.

736
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,630
Make sure to have breakfast
ready for us.

737
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,180
I'm also going!

738
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,870
Wait!

739
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,910
You'll only be a nuisance.

740
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,630
Shut up!

741
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,670
Yahiko!

742
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,590
You will remain in the dojo.

743
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:43,990
What?

744
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,350
Protect the dojo with Kaoru-dono.

745
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,750
Of course...

746
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,700
I knew you'd come back.

747
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,710
You can't return home,

748
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,110
because you belong here.

749
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,870
Now, tomorrow...

750
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,670
I didn't come back,

751
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,910
to make more opium.

752
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,750
Huh?

753
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,110
I came to kill you!

754
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,590
Don't worry!

755
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,310
We will do down together!

756
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,390
I'll die soon enough!

757
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,270
What are you guys waiting for?!

758
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,830
Stop this at once.

759
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,510
I will atone for my sins!

760
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,700
This bitch!

761
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,350
This is how you treat me?!

762
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,510
They've come.

763
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,470
It's him.

764
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,190
Takeda Kanryu!

765
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,950
Hey there!
I'm here to kick some ass.

766
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,910
Come out here now!

767
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,590
Himura Battousai!

768
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,340
Megumi-dono!

769
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,510
I'm paying you all to kill anyone
who enters the premises!

770
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,750
What's wrong with you idiots?!

771
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,710
What're you talking about?!

772
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,990
There's no need to hesitate!

773
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,550
Do it!

774
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,670
Look!

775
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:05,100
Kill him! There's plenty of money
to go around!

776
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,990
Get your money!

777
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,590
I'll pay the man who defeats them
any amount of money!

778
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,430
Kill them!

779
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,630
I don't get it!

780
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,630
Why?! What reason does the Battousai
have for coming after me?

781
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,470
He needs no reason.
This is who he has become.

782
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,830
As a fellow patriot of the Ishin
Shishi Faction.

783
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,980
Is that so?

784
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,670
It's time!

785
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,470
For "that"? But!

786
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,910
No more questions!

787
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,430
This is merely business!
Kill or be killed!

788
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,430
Grab the woman!

789
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,140
He does this for you.

790
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,030
Where's that squid with glasses?

791
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,630
I'll find him.

792
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,670
Which one of you is my opponent?

793
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,990
I'm your opponent!

794
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,900
Fist to fist?
It's the brawler's turn!

795
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,310
Hurry, go!

796
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,830
Apologies!

797
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,990
So you're the Battousai?

798
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,830
Where is Megumi-dono?

799
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,470
Is that woman worth your help?

800
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,790
No human is beyond help.

801
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,990
Such a worthy reason.

802
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,150
And you?

803
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,500
Why sell your soul to Kanryu?

804
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,100
Soul?

805
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,180
I believe you guys
used to be samurai.

806
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,630
What a stupid notion.

807
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,670
To not eat,

808
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,390
because men like us
have no place in times of peace.

809
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,870
Hey there! Hey!

810
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,950
Kenshin! Are you okay?!

811
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,070
Die!

812
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,390
What is that katana?

813
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,950
My vow never to kill.

814
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,790
My "sakaba" sword.

815
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,630
Hey! Where you going?!

816
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,990
Hold on! Wait!

817
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:22,870
Why am I waiting?!

818
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,190
You want to eat some too?

819
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,190
Here!

820
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,350
I'm a vegetarian.
Poor thing.

821
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,020
Do you drink?

822
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,860
Give me.

823
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:29,340
You have to kill people to survive
you can't do that with a "sakaba" sword!

824
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,750
Don't give me that bullshit!

825
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,110
Fight with everything!

826
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,100
Head to head!

827
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,350
It was fun!

828
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,710
[Sagara Suplex!]

829
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,030
You're finally getting serious.

830
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,070
What is this vow not to kill?

831
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,030
Do you think you can end this fight
without killing me?

832
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,180
I'll show you.

833
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,900
Just try!

834
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,550
Looks like it was a flashy fight.

835
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,070
Let us go.

836
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,590
Wait...

837
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,590
This duel isn't over!

838
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,110
Fight!

839
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,070
This duel is over.

840
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,030
Welcome!

841
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:10,830
Yes

842
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,390
Light!

843
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,150
Yes

844
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,540
Sanosuke!

845
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,750
Maybe the tobacco is making me slow eh?

846
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,500
That one? You're not the one I want,
you messed me up!

847
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,509
The mother fucker!

848
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:34,150
You're the one blabbering about stinkie!

849
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,350
Where is the legendary "hitokiri"?!

850
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,190
Don't take me so lightly!

851
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,350
If it's to bring him in,
I'll lend a hand.

852
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,110
You... why?

853
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,510
One of your friends rushed
to the police.

854
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,110
Yahiko?

855
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:53,150
Over here!

856
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,470
Look...

857
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,190
A gun like that only works
in one direction.

858
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,830
The other side is the blind spot.

859
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,190
Hey! Come out!

860
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:08,030
Welcome! Welcome!

861
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,710
What're you doing?!

862
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:11,550
You've got me!

863
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,030
I surrender!

864
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:17,070
Hey hey! Don't shoot!

865
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:21,030
You've already won.

866
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,710
Right, Kenshin?

867
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,380
Just get out here, we can't win.

868
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,550
I surrender.

869
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,590
Put the katana down.

870
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,110
Now apologize,

871
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,590
and bow down to me.

872
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,580
Take them off!
Take off all your clothes!

873
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,790
And bow down to me!

874
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,790
Not in this lifetime!

875
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,270
Damn you!

876
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,420
Shoot me!

877
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,790
Fire fire fire!

878
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,590
Shoot shoot more and more!

879
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,510
Damn you!

880
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,460
Do you know what money can't buy?

881
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,660
What you have now...

882
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,150
Life.

883
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,820
Stop it!

884
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,020
So finally we get to kick your ass!

885
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,830
I'll take it from here.
Go!

886
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,870
Apologies!

887
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,350
Megumi-dono!

888
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,870
Sorry we're late.

889
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,590
It's alright now.

890
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,150
Are you okay?

891
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,710
You must hurry! Kaoru-san is...!

892
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,950
You're finally awake.

893
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,350
You won't break free.

894
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:23,950
I will use you as a hostage
and it'll make Battousai angry.

895
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:29,470
He'll be so angry he'll go back
to killing people like before.

896
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,470
He should be arriving any moment now.

897
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,700
Kenshin...

898
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,510
Are you angry?

899
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,830
To involve Kaoru-dono in such matters,

900
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:23,340
I could not stop myself.

901
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,830
Kenshin?

902
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,710
Excellent, Battousai!

903
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,830
Get angry! Even more!

904
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,140
Kaoru-dono!

905
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,950
Are you going to kill me
with that katana?

906
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,220
Kenshin!

907
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,090
Did you not predict that move?

908
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,950
Kenshin!

909
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,190
Not yet!

910
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:37,030
You still haven't reverted
to the old Battousai.

911
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,110
Kaoru-dono!

912
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:56,790
A stronger version of Shin No Ippou.
I've paralyzed her lungs.

913
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,800
She has about 2 minutes.

914
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,060
Jin'ei!

915
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,310
There's no time.

916
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,950
Say what you have to say
with your sword!

917
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,790
As expected...

918
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,630
One life is enough!

919
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,710
Don't subject Kaoru-dono to this,
let her go!

920
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:36,030
It's too late.

921
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,980
There's only two ways...

922
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,190
Kill them.

923
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,670
Or kill the user of the jutsu.

924
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,790
Will you break your vow?

925
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,700
In that case!

926
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:50,910
Fight me, Himura Battousai!

927
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,270
No more games.

928
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:20,310
You want me to kill, come at me!

929
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:50,300
[Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, Ryu Tsui Sen]

930
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:31,030
Is this the infamous Battou-jutsu?

931
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,870
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, Battou-jutsu,
Sou Ryu Sen.

932
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,230
I broke your elbow joint
and the muscles around it.

933
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,190
You life with the sword is over.

934
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,910
And...

935
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,390
This is the one life,

936
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,830
for the sake of protecting Kaoru-dono.

937
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,550
I once again return to being "hitokiri."

938
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,430
Kill

939
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,270
Die!

940
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:47,110
Stop Kenshin!

941
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,350
She overcame it.

942
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,460
Kaoru-dono.

943
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,580
Please don't go back to
being a "hitokiri"!

944
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,620
Don't kill him!

945
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,630
You're not supposed to kill!

946
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:25,470
Kenshin...

947
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:31,220
Do you...

948
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:38,310
For those who were killed

949
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,950
Do you...

950
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,500
Until now...

951
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,590
For those you who have helped

952
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,590
You cannot kill again!

953
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,310
You can help someone else.

954
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,340
Isn't that...

955
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,470
what...

956
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:26,510
Kenshin aimed for in the new world?

957
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,030
Kaoru-dono...

958
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:55,230
I'll end this, Battousai.

959
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,580
That's enough.

960
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,710
You have no chance of winning
using only your left hand.

961
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,430
That won't stop me.

962
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:25,750
It is in human nature to kill.

963
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,980
I may not be talking to the same
person as before...

964
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,540
Murder is murder after all

965
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:41,190
Can you be a wanderer forever?

966
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,670
I'll see you in the depths of hell.

967
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,830
You do realize...

968
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,830
You won't be able to bring about
justice and security wandering around
without killing.

969
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,630
Can you?

970
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,190
When one person kills,
resentment is born.

971
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:03,980
Just let people kill themselves.

972
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,190
Until that ideal is severed.

973
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:13,310
That is the purpose of my sword.

974
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,400
Pretty words, I'll give you that.

975
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,510
Going to wander off again?

976
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:40,910
The path of rurouni is
an escape for the weak!

977
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,230
Live by the sword die by the sword.

978
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:54,750
There is no other way for us.

979
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,020
There's a lot of drug trafficking!

980
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:17,500
Do not miss even one!

981
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:26,990
Don't let any of this leave the harbor!

982
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:30,550
These are all very valuable!

983
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:36,780
I've got money in my pocket!

984
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:37,950
Money in the pockets!

985
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,590
Gold over here in the pocket

986
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,710
Can you at least grab my shoe?!
It fell off!

987
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:43,310
Silence!

988
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,590
It's not difficult to walk!

989
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,470
I'll be back, just you wait!
I'll be back!

990
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:55,510
Kenshin!

991
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,350
Oh, you're awake?

992
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,150
Kenshin!

993
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,550
Where's Kenshin?

994
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,870
Huh?

995
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,030
No way!

996
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,310
What is it?

997
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,390
H..hold on!

998
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:18,990
Oro?

999
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,070
Kenshin!

1000
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,830
You're already up I see, Kaoru-dono.

1001
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:32,470
To the very end!

1002
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,030
A new diet today! Kenshin
was getting groceries.

1003
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,310
Ah! I'm hungry!

1004
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,350
Welcome back, Kenshin...

1005
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,950
I'm back...

1006
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:24,400
