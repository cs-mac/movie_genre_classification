00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:58,132
Well, Neil, I take it
that filmmaking is your
number one passion.

62
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,927
Now, you wanna tell me why
you want to study acting?

63
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,682
Well, you know,
I'm a method director.

64
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:11,270
And I believe that actors
are the heart of any film.

65
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:14,815
And in order to speak
the language of an actor,

66
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,111
I must become an actor.

67
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,447
You'll do well.

68
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,591

108
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:10,009
Uh, yeah, actually. I'm looking for 
Room 310. Mr. Dowd's class. Acting?

109
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,261
Yeah. Actually,
I think they're that way.

110
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,597
I saw somebody
with a wig and cape
going down the hall.

111
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,808
Okay. Thanks.

112
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,018
Yeah.

113
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,520
Good luck!

114
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,689
Hope you get in.

115
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:26,692
Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

116
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,903
My theory is ...

117
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,866
Um ...

118
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,244
Parents are given a ...

119
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,830
Jenny, Jenny, it's okay.
It's okay.

120
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:44,043
There are a lot of things
in this world to be
nervous and afraid of.

121
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,211
And this isn't one of them.

122
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,507
So just relax, take a deep breath,

123
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:54,845
and then when you're ready,
I want you to talk to us ...

124
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,514
and not at us.

125
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,224
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,410
My theory is that

127
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,791
when parents get divorced,
they're given some kind of
a handout.

128
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:29,463
When my parents told me
that they were splitting,
they told me three things.

129
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,632
One, "It's not your fault."

130
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,093
Two, "It's not your fault."

131
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,262
And three,
"It's not your fault."

132
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,103
Problem is, I don't buy it.

133
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,272
No kid does.

134
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:52,945
I've seen the pictures
of when you got married.

135
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,826
When you were good-looking,
and you smiled at each other.

136
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,037
Hell, when you even
just looked at each other.

137
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:05,582
So what happened
between then and now?

138
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:08,961
Me.

139
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,174
I ... I came along,

140
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:19,471
and I made you tired
and cranky and anxious

141
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:25,978
and I made you lose your hair 
and gain 20 extra pounds and ...

142
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:32,609
Somewhere in all of that,
I ... You stopped loving each other.

143
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,032
So I have my own idea
for a handout.

144
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,539
Next time tell me,
"One, happiness is hard."

145
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:52,171
"Two, don't make the
same mistakes we did."

146
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:00,512
"And three, okay, so maybe it is
your fault a little."

147
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,726
You want me to be honest?

148
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,313
You go first.

149
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,361

This is the theater, Malik.

00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,419
Not the street.

167
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:16,588
The theater.

168
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,715
Sacred.

169
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,426
This is not a place of anger.

170
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:24,888
Oh, yeah, you get to
play angry characters.

171
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:28,767
But there are no angry actors.

172
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,062
And do you know
the difference between the two?

173
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:35,023
All righty.

174
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,025
- Marco.
- Yeah.

175
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,069
Uh, where have you trained?

176
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:42,072
Um, I sing at my dad's restaurant
every once in a while.

177
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,615
That's pretty much about it.

178
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,992
Really?

179
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,077
Well, that's pretty impressive.

180
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:48,537
Thank you.

181
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,956
So, did I get in?

182
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,045
Welcome.

183
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,717
This year we received
over 10,000 applications ...

184
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,470
for the 200 openings from students all
across New York City.

185
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,139
And you got in.

186
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,099
Congratulations!

187
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:20,444
For the next four years,
you have the unique opportunity ...

188
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,904
to immerse yourselves in the arts.

189
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:25,615
You can be spontaneous,

190
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,785
original, maybe even a little outrageous.

191
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:31,121
You got it made, right?

192
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,998
Wrong!

193
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,293
You're gonna have it twice 
as hard as everybody else.

194
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:39,588
In the mornings, you're gonna 
have all your arts classes.

195
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,134
After lunch, you will cram in
a full day of academics.

196
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:47,679
Drop below a "C" average
and you're out. No exceptions.

197
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,599
Now, let me make this very clear.

198
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,603
We don't care about your headshot.

199
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,813
Or your dress size.

200
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,317
Or your dreams of being
in OK! Magazine,

201
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:02,277
on talk shows, on the red carpet.

202
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,947
Here, you will learn a discipline.

203
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,200
Here, you will come to understand ...

204
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:11,328
what being a performing 
artist really means.

205
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:16,583
Here, you will dedicate
yourself to your craft.

206
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,754
Now, if you're looking for shortcuts,

207
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,882
if you want fame,

208
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,967
if you want easy rewards,

209
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:30,055
I highly recommend
that you get up and leave now.

210
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,724
There are many very
talented young people ...

211
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:35,727
who would be thrilled
to take your place.

212
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:40,065
So, have a great year.

213
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:46,238
Five, six, seven, eight, go!

214
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,241
Extend that leg. Travel!

215
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,163
Rosie, you're getting dizzy
because you're not spotting. Now, spot!

216
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,582
- I'm trying.
- Yeah, not hard enough.

217
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,085
Shoulders down.
Press them down.

218
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,182
Stay with her, Kevin.

219
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:20,021
No, no. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

220
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,858
Kevin, you're a mess. Look.

221
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,694
She does passé fifth position. 
Let her get a real good plié,

222
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,864
so you both have a good 
preparation for the pas de chat.

223
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:33,243
On her next lift, you've got to use 
your stomach and your back.

224
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,037
Stay strong.
You have to support her.

225
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,623
All right, take a minute.

226
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,710
Jeremy and Alice.

227
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,005
Kevin, you're not gonna
be a professional ballet dancer ...

228
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,840
unless you learn how to partner.

229
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:49,509
And ...

230
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,897
Kevin, watch Jeremy.

231
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:04,816
See that?

232
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:15,076
Lovely.

233
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,496
Beautiful, Alice.

234
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,291
All right. I don't want
you to think about it.

235
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,002
Get out of your head
and let it be spontaneous.

236
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:28,173
This exercise is about honing in 
on your natural instincts.

237
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:32,177
Free your inhibitions and 
physically inhabit your own body.

238
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:36,598
Otherwise, you'll never be in touch 
with any characters you're playing.

239
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,767
Here we go.

240
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:40,936
Zip-Zip! Zip-Zip!

241
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,187
Whoom! Whoom!

242
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,313
Pow! Pow!

243
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:46,816
Be! Be!

244
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,026
Booga-Booga! Booga-Booga!

245
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,152
Bam! Bam!

246
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:50,820
Che-whe-wow! Che-whe-wha!

247
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:57,536
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,
get out of your brain!

248
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,162
You got to learn to loosen up ...

249
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,331
and go with the first thing
that pops in your head.

250
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:03,333
Okay, everybody follow me.
Come on. Shake it out.

251
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,503
Shake it out. Shake it out.
Come on, shake, shake, shake!

252
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,046
Come on, it's the
only body you got!

253
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,965
You gotta be loose!
Loose, loose!

254
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,925
Jenny, is that loose?

255
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,388
You gotta learn not to be embarrassed
and you better do it now.

256
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:19,015
All right, loose, folks!
Loose. Loosen your bodies up.

257
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:44,708
Keep your eyes on
the sheet music.

258
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,903
If you holdin'
my money then pay me.

259
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,531
Just another day
in the life of the queen MC.

260
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,242
Can't stop, won't stop
until I cop a Bentley.

261
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,453
No, no, throw the dice.

262
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:23,413
Where you been, man?

263
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:24,789
I had to get this out
of the storage room.

264
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:25,999
We gotta get rollin'.

265
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,667
- Yo, plug this in.
- Are you serious?

266
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,294
Rosie, plug it in.
Come on. Right now?

267
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,094
Your action is "to give love."

268
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,513
Or "to seduce."
Let's try "to seduce."

269
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,308
All right, what does that look like?
What does that look like?

270
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,518
Okay. No, that was awful.

271
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,146
Can I sit down?

272
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,397
Sure.

273
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,274
Thanks.

274
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,485
I just met these agents,
like, a month and a half ago,

275
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:54,944
and they've been sending me out,

276
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,156
and I guess these casting directors 
are really excited to see me for this pilot.

277
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,741
You didn't like the shaking?

278
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,494
See, I didn't see that as fun. 
It was more of a hassle.

279
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,162
It doesn't really have 
anything to do with acting.

280
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:08,583
I can maybe introduce you guys 
to the agents if you want. You know?

281
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,001
But it loosens you.

282
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,337
Okay, what happens
if your character's, like, really tense?

283
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,923
Joe, does it work?

284
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,469
Today?

285
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:20,595
No.

286
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,972
I keep telling her to just relax.
It's nothing big.

287
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,266
But I have too much work
to do after school.

288
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,019
I have vocal exercises
and memorizing monologues,

289
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,355
and that's all before
I even start on my normal homework.

290
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,857
You actually do all that stuff?

291
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:35,318
Huh?

292
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:37,654
There's a drum set over there.
I dare you to go on it.

293
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,030
How many years
have you been rapping?

294
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:40,407
She won in the last round.

295
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,617
You are retarded.
Your brain is not working right.

296
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,702
Yeah? Is that so?

297
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:56,923
- Hi.
- Hi.

298
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,466
- This is Marco.
- How you doing?

299
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,862
You know I'm gonna
eat you up in front of everybody.

300
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:19,946
You can never ...

301
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:34,669
Whoa!

302
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,464

Not your thing?

333
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:53,808
Not really.

334
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:59,022
My parents would die
if they saw that.

335

00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,049
You know, if it makes
you feel any better,

341
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,509
my mom doesn't
even know I go here.

342
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,802
Seriously?

343
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:32,764
She thinks I'm down
at the public high school.

344
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,934
She works three jobs.
She's never gonna check.

345
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,270
Why don't you just tell her?

346
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:44,525
She doesn't want me to be
an actor or a rapper.

347
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:51,950
Look, what about you?

348
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:55,662
I mean, I see you playing the piano 
like you're Beethoven and everything.

349
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,622
Is that your thing?

350
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,958
- Yeah.
- Cool.

351
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:04,128
Well, actually, I don't know.

352
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,464
I mean, I guess, I think it ...

353
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,341
Okay, truth is,

354
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:12,261
I've never tried anything else.

355
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:14,806
Oh.

Yeah, I've seen her.

359
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:41,457
But she thinks she's, like, 
the most talented kid in the school.

360
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,042
Maybe she is.

361
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,963
Well, I gotta go. You want to 
keep staring, go right ahead, man.

362
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:48,339

You know,
you can really dance.

369
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:26,127
Thanks for the newsflash.

370
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:31,132
But I think you could dance a little better, 
though, if your music wasn't so wack.

371
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:34,260
I'm just saying.

Excuse me?

373
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:40,475
Yeah. I mean,
if you really wanna dance,

374
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,311
you need something
way better than that.

375
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,980
And you know just what that is.

376
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,274
Yeah.

377
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,319

00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:56,157
That's just a demo, too.

379
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,118
I mean, I'm adding, like,
a lot more bass and effects.

383
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:09,837

Okay. Very good, Jenny.

396
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:08,980
Thank you.

397
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:13,568
Except for the fact that you 
have no idea what you're singing about.

398
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:18,406
Well, it's about a girl who gets her heart 
broken and is looking for another guy.

399
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:22,410
Yeah. I was not feeling
that from you.

400
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,746
That is technically what the song is about. 
Okay, this is very important.

401
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,331
Jenny, for your homework tonight,

402
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:31,377
I want you to go home and 
write out all the lyrics to that song ...

403
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:35,256
and then work on them like 
they're an acting monologue. Okay?

404
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,843
Because there's really
no point in singing a song ...

405
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,429
if you don't understand
what it is you're saying.

406
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,973
Okay, go sit down. Thanks.

407
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,687
It was pretty. I just wasn't getting 
a lot out of it. All right?

408
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:51,772
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,524
Life will go on.

410
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,860
Okay, next.

411
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,403
Uh ...

412
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:00,072
Let's see. Marco.

413
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,325
That's right.

414
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,911
I want you to sing the same song,

415
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:07,622
but I want us to all really understand ...

416
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,790
what the song is about.
Do you know it?

417
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,626
Yeah. A little bit.

418
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,793
A little bit?

419
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:16,172
All right, well, this should be
interesting. Come on.

433
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:32,456
Very good, Marco.
Thank you.

434
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,170
- So you live in Long Island, right?
- Yep.

435
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:41,424
And stay with my dad enough days 
to meet the residency requirement.

436
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,385
I'd like to stay
with my mom more, but ...

437
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,553
Yeah. Is it worth it?

438
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,595
Of course.

439
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,766
It's what I want. Always wanted. 
You understand.

440
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,395
I mean, not everyone
is like you, Jenny.

441
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,690
You know, as committed and focused 
as you are. All the damn time.

442
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:00,484
Yeah, but you're
the best singer in our class.

443
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:03,029
With that kind of a talent,
you have a responsibility.

444
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:06,157
I mean, the only thing
I gotta do is be happy.

445
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,535
What?

446
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,455
Do you always take
things this lightly?

447
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,583
I would give anything in order 
to stand up in front of class ...

448
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,085
and sing a song and
be completely in tune.

449
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,378
Or whiz through a monologue ...

450
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,088
and have everybody laughing.
- Jenny ...

451
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,925
And there are so many kids in this city 
that would love to be going to this school.

452
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,638
You wouldn't understand.
See you in class, Marco.

453
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,856
These are not diaries.

454
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:42,485
They're journals.

455
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:49,533
I'm not interested
in what you had for breakfast,

456
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:54,038
or what you think of
your stepmom's boob job.

457
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,042
Not even your latest breakup.

458
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,962
I wanna know about
the world you inhabit.

459
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,924
The people around you.

460
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,052
Who are they?

461
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,766
How do they behave?

462
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:24,068
Language and behavior,
that's all the actor's got to work with.

463
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,947
So keep your eyes open.

464
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,075
Observe. Record.

465
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:48,634
Mr. Bazinska, this is disgraceful.

466
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,845
It's unhealthy, it's unsanitary.
No, it's fine. It's clean.

467
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,013
No, it's not unsanitary. It's ... 
The only thing missing from it ...

468
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:57,017
is a finger on the scale. 
Your finger on the scale. You're the worst.

469
00:33:57,102 --> 00:34:02,982
How is emotion
expressed through action?

470
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,484
Gesture?

471
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,238
That's disgusting. What can I say.

472
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:11,198
Look, it's clean.
So they got all the ...

473
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,575
Now what are you doing?

474
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,786
- Taking my pictures without asking!
- Sorry. Homework.

475
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,414
You're supposed to get me
to write off something before you do that.

476
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,624
I could sue you,
and I could sue you.

477
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,295
Dad, you home?

478
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:39,018
Understand other people. 
And you'll begin to understand yourself.

479
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:14,178
Bye, Mr. Cranston.

480
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,429
Ms. Dupree.

481
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,182
Yes?

482
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:21,560
You practice more than 
any other student here at P.A.

483
00:35:21,645 --> 00:35:24,355
You are a very talented
classical pianist.

484
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,440
Thank you, Mr. Cranston.

485
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,860
I happen to be looking
for an accompanist ...

486
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,571
for our spring production
of Chicago.

487
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,866
It might serve you well
to branch out a bit.

488
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:37,785
Expand your horizon.

489
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:41,830
Okay, so what does this entail?

490
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,542
It's just a couple rehearsals. 
It might go a little late ...

491
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,168
Okay, what's "late"?

492
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:47,461
Midnight.

493
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:51,215
- Midnight?
- Only on the nights it performs.

494
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:52,967
That's what Mr. Cranston said.

495
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:57,054
Daddy, it's a big honor for a freshman 
to be asked to play for one of the musicals.

496
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,681
And it's Chicago!
Do you realize ...

497
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,350
You are training to be
a classical pianist.

498
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,227
Can you tell me how
playing honky-tonk songs ...

499
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,937
till all hours of the night
is gonna help with that?

500
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:08,732
It won't, but it
would be fun. Fun!

501
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:11,860
Something new! Daddy, I want to 
do something different for a change.

502
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:14,238
"Something different"
was never part of the deal, Denise.

503
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:18,742
You will be saying "no" or I will be 
pulling you out of that school. Period.

504
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,417
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:32,214
Ma, I was gonna tell you.

506
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:33,882
Performing Arts?

507
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,093
Do you have any idea
how risky that is?

508
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,303
As a career?

509
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:38,470
Of course I do.

510
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:41,348
Malik, you're trying to do 
something everyone wants to do.

511
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,476
Every teenager on this block thinks 
they can make it as the next rapper ...

512
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:47,896
Look, Ma. You have to let me stay there.
It's everything I have now.

513
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:50,190
I just don't know about this.

514
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:54,862
Look, they're good grades!
Did you even look at it?

515
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:58,240
Look, Ma.

516
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:01,869
I'm talented.

517
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,288
If somebody's gotta make it 
out there, why can't it be me?

518
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:07,625
And who in the world
told you you were so special?

519
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,044
You did.

520
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:20,846
I just can't deal with this 
right now. I'm late for work.

521
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:09,728
All right. Bobby.

522
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:29,540
Okay. Kevin!

523
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,801
Look out!

524
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,791
- Yeah? 
- Master Tavares,

525
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:16,295
you play with élan,
brio, gusto, panache

526
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:18,755
and a host of foreign adjectives 
that indicate excessive style.

527
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,134
What you neglect to do is 
play the music as written.

528
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:25,304
And though your interpretation
may be entertaining,

529
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:28,140
it is of no value in my class.

530
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:30,934
May I suggest that the only thing of 
value you could possibly bring to Bach ...

531
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:32,728
is your respect.

532
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:34,730
And unless you devote
yourself to study,

533
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,982
drill and mastery of technique,

534
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:41,403
you will be of little or no value 
to anyone. Including yourself.

535
00:39:42,238 --> 00:39:44,907
Now let's try this again, as written.

536
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:47,993
Parenthetically,

537
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:53,123
study, drill and technique
do not stifle talent.

538
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,252
They free it. Once more.

539
00:39:57,337 --> 00:40:01,089
Mr. Cranston.
This music, it's boring.

540
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,175
It's just not my thing.

541
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:05,344
No, it's Bach's thing.

542
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:07,179
Stubby little German guy.
Wore a wig.

543
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,890
Yeah, and he died 1,000 years ago.

544
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,186
His teachers told him to stop 
playing music his way. He said no.

545
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:16,021
Really?

546
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:19,691
Well, if his teachers told 
him that, then they were wrong.

547
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:22,027
And should your music ...

548
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:24,696
survive for the next 350 years,

549
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:27,950
please allow me to
apologize in advance.

550
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:31,411
Proceed. We will suffer
through it with you.

551
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,125
She was eight years old.

552
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,753
Her name was Ayanna.

553
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,756
Means "beautiful flower."

554
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:48,887
She was always
on the street, playing,

555
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:52,224
jumping rope.

556
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:56,687
Happiest girl you ever saw.

557
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,274
She didn't see the man in the car ...

558
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,485
or the man running past,
until the bullets flew.

559
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,780
The day after she was buried,

560
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:12,995
I got this.

561
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:16,707
I was only 13 at the time.

562
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:19,459
I thought my mom would whup my ass.

563
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:23,338
But she didn't.

564
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,762
Said I should remember
every single day ...

565
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,270
what happened to my little sister.

566
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:43,734
How did her death affect you?

567
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,322
I mean, you've given us the facts.

568
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:53,368
And you waited till the end to let 
us know that Ayanna was your sister,

569
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,413
which was very dramatic.

570
00:41:56,497 --> 00:42:00,751
But I want to know how you felt.

571
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:05,714
And I think you need
to know how you felt.

572
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:11,219
How do you think I felt?

573
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,058
Well, I have no idea.
Why don't you tell us?

574
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:21,730
You know what? Screw this.

575
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,611
I ain't gonna cry for you.
I gave you the truth.

576
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:31,615
Is that what happened?
Did you cry the night she died?

577
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:36,286
Did you blame yourself? Do you 
think you could have prevented it?

578
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:41,875
Listen, I'm gonna be famous.

579
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:44,544
And I don't need you
or your therapy bullshit!

580
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,130
So screw this and
screw this class!

581
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:52,386
The theater is not a place

Attention, students.

626
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:21,404
After-school rehearsal will be canceled 
due to the dance performance class.

627
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,866
Tomorrow, regular scheduled 
rehearsals will resume as normal.

628
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:27,118
Those of you who would
like to see the show,

629
00:47:27,203 --> 00:47:31,081
tickets will be on sale in the 
main office starting Thursday.

630
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,386
Yeah?

631
00:47:45,888 --> 00:47:47,972
I know your secret.

632
00:47:48,057 --> 00:47:49,849
What are you talking about?

633
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,852
Why didn't you tell me
you could sing like that?

634
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,396
Wait, you were in there?

635
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,690
Yeah. And I heard you.

636
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:00,026
Look, look, just come with me.
I got an idea. Okay?

637
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,404
Hold on, hold on,
calm down. I have class.

638
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:03,988
Look, just trust me.
Come with me.

639
00:48:04,073 --> 00:48:06,991
All right? It won't
take long. Come on.

640
00:48:07,076 --> 00:48:08,493
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

641
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,245
Where are we going?

642
00:48:10,538 --> 00:48:13,373
Me and my man, Victor, is working 
on this record that's gonna be huge.

643
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:17,168
I'm talking about beats you 
wouldn't even believe. All right?

644
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:18,586
Yo. Yo!

645
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,214
- What's up?
- Listen.

646
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:25,009
If you think the girls
we've been trying out are good ...

647
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:26,761
Ten times better.

648
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,471
I didn't know you could sing.

649
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:30,849
Dogs, this girl is amazing.

650
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:32,642
Wait. Hold on. You guys produce?

651
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:33,768
Yeah, we produce.

652
00:48:33,853 --> 00:48:37,230
I'm actually working on a track 
right now. We still need a singer.

653
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:39,983
So, what's good?
Will you do it?

654
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,987
I can't.

655
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,196
Come on. Why not?

656
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:48,825
My dad. He doesn't like me
to get distracted.

657
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,120
And why, exactly,
would he have to know?

Yo, Malik. I just
finished it last night.

681
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:44,899
Pop it in, man.
Let's see what they think.

682
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:34,908
Malik, what are you doing?
Why are you playing our song?

683
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,826
What's the problem? Victor said 
he finished it last night.

684
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,995
I just wanted to put it in and 
see what people thought about it.

685
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,330
But you know this is our secret.

686
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:41,831
My parents don't know
about this. I don't ...

687
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,792
Just relax.
Your parents aren't even here.

688
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:48,004
And besides, they like it. Look.

689
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:33,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

690
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,888
Yo, give it up for a track 
produced by my boy, Victor!

691
00:52:38,973 --> 00:52:40,139
Yeah!

692
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,812
You made that?

693
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:48,731
And of course, yours truly.

694
00:52:48,816 --> 00:52:51,109
Let's go!
Let's give it up, y'all!

695
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:58,741
And on vocals, give it up for —

Anonymous.

697
00:53:08,335 --> 00:53:10,670
And she's drinking.

698
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:15,633
All right, hurry up before 
someone steals my camera.

699
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,762
Are you wasted yet?

700
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,600
I don't know.
I've never been drunk.

701
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:27,562
What's it feel like?

702
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:30,523
It feels like that.

703
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,493
Yo, check it out.

704
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:44,787
This is for my homies.

No, don't waste it.

Mike check, one-two.

00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:37,131
Well, first of all,
I loved the presentation.

722
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:41,010
Why, thank you. I mean, it's, you 
know ... It's totally not ready yet.

723
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:42,470
But, I mean, it's ...

724
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:44,305
The drunkenness, however ...

725
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:47,809
I was trying to expand
my life experience.

726
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:50,812
I've never been wasted before.

727
00:54:50,896 --> 00:54:53,523
Trust me. I'm not gonna do it again.

728
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,823
Hey, hey, Jenny, hold up.

729
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,700
Just a dinner. At my dad's 
restaurant. I promise.

730
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:07,078
If you don't have a good time,
I'll stop asking.

731
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:08,454
I don't understand.

732
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,707
You keep asking me out
and I keep telling you no.

733
00:55:12,334 --> 00:55:14,252
Why do you keep trying?

734
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:17,797
I don't know.
I feel like if I keep asking,

735
00:55:18,132 --> 00:55:21,384
maybe one of these times,
you'll actually say yes.

736
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,513
Text me the address.

737
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:27,640
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll come.

738
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,226
Okay. I'll see you later then.

739
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,645
- Okay. See you later.
- Okay, bye.

740
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,822
So, how's school?

741
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,991
Do you think you'll
get what you need?

742
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,994
Will it be enough to get you
into a professional company?

743
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,412
How am I supposed to know?

744
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:50,580
You know, Alice,

745
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:54,333
Dr. Malamed thinks
that your aloofness ...

746
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,211
is a sign of sub-clinical
depression.

747
00:55:57,296 --> 00:55:59,338
So, are you depressed?

748
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:01,716
No, Dad. I'm bored
like I always am.

749
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:04,343
Alice!

750
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:09,223
- Excuse me, sir.
- Huh? Oh, I'm with them.

751
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:12,185
May I take your hat?

752
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,561
No, no ...

753
00:56:13,645 --> 00:56:14,979
Are you sure I
can't take your hat?

754
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:16,522
Who is that?

755
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,191
The opposite of boring.

756
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:22,445
Hey, baby. How are you?

757
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:23,863
What's up?

758
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
These your parents?

759
00:56:28,076 --> 00:56:30,703
I know, I know, it's just that ...

760
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:34,874
I've never had to work this hard
in my entire life.

761
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,377
And they don't really tell you 
what it's gonna be like.

762
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:43,591
I don't know why I'm
telling you all of this.

763
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:48,429
Everything seems to come
so easily to you.

764
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,932
No, that's not true.

765
00:56:51,892 --> 00:56:54,560
I've just ... I've been
performing my whole life.

766
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:58,314
I mean, as soon as I could,
I was out there singing.

767
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,815
I will tell you this,

768
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,027
no one makes as much in tips
as a first grader.

769
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,906
So, you play the piano, too?

770
00:57:09,284 --> 00:57:10,826
A little. Yeah.

771
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:13,704
Okay, I want to hear.

772
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,501
I mean, you see me sing all the 
time at school. There's no need to ...

773
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:21,462
Yeah, I want to hear something 
different. Come on, Marco.

774
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:22,713
No. Just 'cause
the piano's there ...

775
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:24,173
Just me, you, and the restaurant.

776
00:57:24,258 --> 00:57:25,466
You're playing for me.

777
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,717
Jenny ...

778
00:57:26,802 --> 00:57:28,636
I told you,
you've already seen this.

779
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,805
No! Go on.

780
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,600
Well, what do you want me to play?

781
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,102
Uh, anything you want.

782
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,355
And we'll see if I'm willing
to give you a tip at the end.

783
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:40,606
Okay.

784
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,114
Seriously?

785
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:52,493
Okay.

786
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:56,914

You could say that.

813
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:37,783
Okay, that was good, but let's take 
it again from bar four-twenty. Okay?

814
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,034
Denise!

815
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,245
We got in with the label.

816
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:43,289
They want us to come in
and talk about our stuff.

817
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,124
Can you go?
Tomorrow, after school.

818
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,085
I'm supposed to have extra piano ...
No, no, cancel it.

819
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,337
No, no. Cancel it, cancel it.
Meet me out front at 3:00, all right?

820
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:53,466
Sorry. This is it, Denise.
Our big break. I can feel it!

821
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,974
Okay. Sorry, let's ... Sorry.

So, I have an audition later today,

834
01:01:44,184 --> 01:01:46,519
but I don't think I'll go
because I'll never get it.

835
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:49,021
But you're working with 
a casting director. That's huge.

836
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,524
See, that's what I thought, too.

837
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,317
And they do get me some auditions,

838
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:55,528
but I'm up against the same 15 girls.

839
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,238
And they always get the part.

840
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:59,740
Yeah, maybe, but they're not Joy.

841
01:02:00,242 --> 01:02:04,703
Yeah, well, me, I've got a lot of good 
shit happening off of my YouTube page.

842
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:07,039
In fact, I'm meeting
with a producer today ...

843
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:09,959
about putting together
an independent film.

844
01:02:10,168 --> 01:02:11,293
What?

845
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:12,628
Yeah. Uh ...

846
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:18,300
I have an idea for a short.

847
01:02:18,927 --> 01:02:21,303
It's about a legendary director ...

848
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:23,931
who suddenly dies
while filming his movie.

849
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:27,893
So his inadequate son decides to 
honor his father by finishing the film,

850
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:31,772
but the only help he has is 
this misfit cast of characters,

851
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:33,399
like, straight out
of a Wes Anderson.

852
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,777
It's The Life Aquatic meets
The Bad and the Beautiful.

853
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:39,280
Sounds really artistic, Neil.

854
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:40,990
Well, I think so.

855
01:02:41,616 --> 01:02:43,701
Hopefully, Sundance agrees.

856
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,472
- Small place.
- Yeah.

857
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:07,099
You want some coffee or some water?

858
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,226
I'm all right.
You don't want to see me on coffee.

859
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,394
Wired enough as is.

860
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:11,854
Take a seat.

861
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,064
The script is good.

862
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,358
Thank you. Um ...

863
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:20,654
It's, you know, a labor of love of 
mine and it's not quite there yet.

864
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:23,115
I would be honored to take it on.

865
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,287
We don't often do shorts, but, 
in your case, we'll make an exception.

866
01:03:28,747 --> 01:03:31,123
Eddie, that's ...
That's amazing!

867
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:34,251
Now ... Now,
let's talk about the budget.

868
01:03:34,336 --> 01:03:36,879
Yeah, let's talk about it.
Let's talk about the budget.

869
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:39,465
How are you gonna raise the money?

870
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:45,054
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.

871
01:03:45,138 --> 01:03:47,973
I don't understand. Shouldn't 
he be giving you the money?

872
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,433
Isn't that what producers do?

873
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:53,103
He's not the financier. He's the 
producer. And there's a difference.

874
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:55,189
All I need you to do is kick in, 
like, five grand.

875
01:03:55,273 --> 01:03:56,315
And I know. I'm aware.

876
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,692
I'm aware that's a lot of money.
I really get it. I get it.

877
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:01,779
But, you know, Eddie says
we could even, you know ...

878
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:04,615
We could sell it to television 
and make a profit.

879
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:06,116
You gotta trust me on this one, Dad.

880
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:08,661
I'd be shooting on a real film
and everything.

881
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:12,164
I mean, Dad ...
I mean, this is the real deal, Dad.

882
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,042
The real deal, huh?
You think so?

883
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,756
Come on, Dad.

884
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:22,883
Help a brother out.

885
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,766
So this is what it's like
to have a social life?

886
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:32,851
Yeah, well, it beats memorizing 
Shakespeare, doesn't it?

887
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,061
Yeah.

888
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:37,648
How long do we
have to stay here?

889
01:04:37,732 --> 01:04:39,692
I don't know. Come on,
let's just have fun.

890
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,193
We haven't been out in a while.

891
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,403
Okay.

892
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:45,739
- I'll get us some drinks.
- Okay.

893
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:02,464
Well, look who it is.

894
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,967
- Andy! Hey!
- Hey! Um ...

895
01:05:05,427 --> 01:05:07,678
- Jenny. 
- Jenny. That's right. Of course.

896
01:05:07,762 --> 01:05:09,138
I remember you from last year.

897
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:11,890
You did the show with
the monologue from ...

898
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,058
From Proof, right?

899
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:14,101
Yeah!

900
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:16,729
Yeah, you were really good.

901
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,732
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

902
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:22,443
So how is P.A.? I kind of miss it.

903
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,820
It's the same-old, same-old.

904
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,406
But I've been watching you
on your show.

905
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,657
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

906
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:31,744
Well, thanks.
Yeah, it's going pretty well.

907
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,912
I got a big storyline
right now, so ...

908
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,831
- Andy. 
- It's kind of blowing up.

909
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:37,750
- We're slamming shots, bro.
- Yeah. Shots.

910
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,544
Give me one second.
I'm talking to Jenny. Um ...

911
01:05:40,628 --> 01:05:41,795
You want to take shots?

912
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,921
I'm good, thanks.

913
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,090
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. - Okay.

914
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:49,720
You know, they're looking
for day players on the show.

915
01:05:49,804 --> 01:05:52,055
Would that be something
you might be interested in?

916
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:55,476
- Seriously? - Yeah. I mean,
I could put in a good word.

917
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,688
Yeah! That would be perfect.
Thank you.

918
01:05:59,898 --> 01:06:02,608
Okay. So how should we do this? 
Do you want to give me your number?

919
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,443
Yeah, I don't think
I have a pen or a ...

920
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,613
No, no, don't worry about it.
Just put it right in here.

921
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,198
Okay.

922
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:11,825
Um ...

923
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,535
I think that's it.

924
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,205
Yeah, I can do this.
Yeah, I don't ... Yeah, okay.

925
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:19,792
Perfect. Well, it's so good 
to see you. You look great.

926
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:21,126
Thanks. You, too.

927
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,294
All right. I'll see you later.

928
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,213
Okay.

929
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,381
- Bye.
- See you.

930
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,261
See you.

931
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,973
Shots up. Ready to go.

932
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:37,476
One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

933
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:41,647
All we were doing
was talking, okay?

934
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,482
He saw my monologue from P.A.

935
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,276
That's all we were talking about.
He wants to help me.

936
01:06:46,361 --> 01:06:48,570
God, could you possibly
be that naive?

937
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:50,072
He's trying to hook up
with you, Jenny.

938
01:06:50,156 --> 01:06:51,990
That's ridiculous.
He's a big-time actor.

939
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,867
He can hook up
with whoever he wants.

940
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:56,537
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, he loves 
your talent. That's what he loves.

941
01:06:56,621 --> 01:07:01,124
So it's that preposterous that somebody 
might actually like me for my talent?

942
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,044
No, of course not.

943
01:07:04,128 --> 01:07:07,756
Look, no one believes in you more 
than I do, and you know that.

944
01:07:07,882 --> 01:07:10,968
Honestly, it's just
the way he was looking at you.

945
01:07:12,053 --> 01:07:13,136
Fine.

946
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:18,183
If it means that much to you, I won't 
talk to him ever again. Promise.

947
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,979
Now let's get out of here.

948
01:07:23,022 --> 01:07:24,690
We can go to my dad's apartment.

949
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,108
- What, now?
- Mmm-hmm.

950
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,402
He's on a date.

951
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,154
He won't be back until later.

952
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:52,968
There's definitely something there.

953
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:55,596
Something that could be interesting.

954
01:07:58,016 --> 01:08:00,684
Check it out.
We've got an A&R meeting next week.

955
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:02,644
What I'd like to do
is play it for the team,

956
01:08:02,729 --> 01:08:04,563
see what kind of feedback we get,

957
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,189
and I'll get back to you.

958
01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:07,316
Nice.

959
01:08:08,276 --> 01:08:10,277
Yo, yo, did you see him
bobbing his head?

960
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:12,821
He was bobbing his head to himself.
He was bobbing ...

961
01:08:12,906 --> 01:08:15,490
Guys, guys.
He didn't say he wanted us.

962
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:18,410
Did you not hear what he said?
He said, "Interesting."

963
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:19,912
- Interesting!
- Man, we are so in.

964
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:22,748
Yo, I'm gonna give my moms a house 
in the Hamptons on the beach.

965
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,541
- Guys?
- It's gonna be crazy.

966
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,256
You're not even trying, Rosie.

967
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:35,594
Ballet is a requirement for every 
student dancer in this school.

968
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,638
But, Ms. Kraft,
I'm good at hip-hop!

969
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:42,851
My job isn't to cast music videos. 
It's to train serious dancers.

970
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:46,271
P.A. isn't about just
doing whatever you want.

971
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,232
It's about becoming
a complete performer.

972
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:52,736
I ... I don't know
where you fit in here.

973
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,113
Fit in here?
What's that supposed to mean?

974
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,866
It means you're gonna keep
flailing around and you're not gonna ...

975
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,785
This isn't about me, is it?

976
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,703
You don't like my body.
Admit it!

977
01:09:01,788 --> 01:09:05,874
Don't be ridiculous. Modern companies 
are full of girls who don't have the ...

978
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:09,002
Oh, really? Then how come this department 
is filled with skinny little girls ...

979
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:12,839
with no titties and tight little butts, 
walking around drinking Diet Coke?

980
01:09:12,924 --> 01:09:15,634
I ain't never gonna be
like them. And I don't wanna be.

981
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,761
You want girls who've
been starving themselves,

982
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:20,597
and look like they're 11
and have so little body fat ...

983
01:09:20,682 --> 01:09:23,350
they can't even get a period 
to dance parts for real women.

984
01:09:23,434 --> 01:09:24,685
And that sucks!

985
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:28,480
You're part of a machinery of 
oppression, Ms. Kraft. Just admit it.

986
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:33,110
Hey! First of all,
don't speak to me like that.

987
01:09:33,194 --> 01:09:36,238
Don't speak to any teacher like that.
It's very rude.

988
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:37,698
It's also very ugly.

989
01:09:38,366 --> 01:09:40,325
And second of all,
you know that's not true.

990
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,160
I want my dancers to be healthy,

991
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:45,247
and I talk to you
all about that all the time.

992
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:47,874
You don't have a good technique,

993
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,961
and you're not working
toward a technique.

994
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:53,422
And yet, I wanna keep you here.

995
01:09:54,632 --> 01:09:55,757
Shit.

996
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:02,931
Jenny! Guess what.

997
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:04,141
What?

998
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:05,308
I got a job.

999
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:06,518
You're kidding!

1000
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,521
I've been trying to find you to tell 
you that it's the best show ever,

1001
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,189
and I'm only semi-regular at first,

1002
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:12,691
but then they said
I could get a lead,

1003
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,818
and it's so amazing
you won't believe it.

1004
01:10:14,902 --> 01:10:16,945
Yay! Okay.
So what show is it?

1005
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:18,405
Sesame Street.

1006
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:19,990
Holy shit. That show's still on?

1007
01:10:20,074 --> 01:10:21,950
I'm gonna get paid to act.

1008
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:23,201
That's incredible!

1009
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,619
You bitch.

1010
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:27,664
I wonder if they need any hot, 
young, new, macho director types.

1011
01:10:27,749 --> 01:10:30,709
I mean, I know they're always 
looking for new talent on that show.

1012
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,085
I don't think so.

1013
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,963
But if you're really nice
and give me back rubs,

1014
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:36,882
I might let you be
part of my entourage.

1015
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,051
Ooh, back rubs.
You mean like ...

1016
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:42,763
Oh, I'm sorry, did that hurt?
I'm sorry.

1017
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,065
Yeah. You know what?

1018
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:55,942
Singing in front of all of 
your friends in the classroom ...

1019
01:10:56,027 --> 01:10:58,320
is one thing, but now we're here.

1020
01:10:58,404 --> 01:10:59,780
And you guys are gonna sing ...

1021
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:03,700
in front of this lovely group of
total strangers,

1022
01:11:03,785 --> 01:11:07,412
who actually are sort of hoping 
that you'll be really bad.

1023
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:09,831
It's gonna be great.

1024
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,377
Also, try to have fun,
because it's part of your grade.

donate my time.

01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:08,473
I'm gonna do a little
something special.

1041
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:12,102
I'm gonna give my time over to 
someone very important to us.

1042

Our teacher and hero ...
No.

1044
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:18,650
No!

Why are you guys
so boring in class ...

1082
01:14:58,269 --> 01:15:00,186
and so great at karaoke tonight?

1083
01:15:00,271 --> 01:15:02,689
Why didn't you ever bring us 
there before? That was so much fun.

1084
01:15:02,773 --> 01:15:04,149
I know. I should've done it before.

1085
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,401
You know, that was so great,
because it's not about you.

1086
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:08,695
It's about the audience, and I 
really saw that. It was great.

1087
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:10,196
- I know.
- You know what else is great?

1088
01:15:10,281 --> 01:15:12,365
- That girl gave me her number.
- That was a guy, Neil.

1089
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,075
Irregardless, I was flattered.

1090
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,661
Joy, you were on fire.
- It was unbelievable. - Thank you.

1091
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,289
I mean, it was so cute and good.

1092
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:22,042
And completely ambushed by Kevin.

1093

01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:24,836
How come you never sang 
in front of us until tonight?

1095
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,463
Oh, my God. Because
I'm the teacher. Seriously.

1096
01:15:26,547 --> 01:15:29,632
You should more often,
because you were stellar, man.

1097
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:32,302
I mean, I'm inspired.
Speaking of ...

1098
01:15:33,304 --> 01:15:34,554
So do you ever perform,
ever? Like ...

1099
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:35,680
Do I what?

1100
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,140
Recently, any of these days,
do you ever perform?

1101
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:38,892
- No, no. No, no, no.
- You should.

1102
01:15:38,976 --> 01:15:40,310
- Yeah.
- Gosh.

1103
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:43,146
- Especially for your students.
- Well, why ...

1104
01:15:43,314 --> 01:15:44,647
No, no. Too much.
Can't ...

1105
01:15:44,732 --> 01:15:46,441
- Why did you quit?
- Huh?

1106
01:15:46,525 --> 01:15:48,234
Why did you quit?

1107
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:51,112
It's ... Why did I ... Um ...

1108
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:53,198
She's like, "What ..."

1109
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,576
It's not a good ... It's a boring 
story. It's long and boring.

1110
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,828
No, really. Why did you quit?

1111
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:03,374
Um ... Well, let's see.

1112
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:08,171
You know, I went to college and I was 
a little, happy theater major ...

1113
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:10,048
and all bright and
shiny and everything.

1114
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:14,844
And graduated from college
and moved to the big city ...

1115
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:18,056
and started getting out there and 
auditioning, and I did the whole thing.

1116
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:23,353
You know, I did all the cattle 
calls and the whole nine yards.

1117
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:27,899
I don't know, after a while I just 
kind of started feeling like ...

1118
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,193
it really wasn't meant to be.

1119
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:32,946
But, you know, I mean,

1120
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:36,032
sometimes when I go see
a Broadway musical,

1121
01:16:36,117 --> 01:16:38,701
I just kind of
sit there and think,

1122
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:42,539
"You know, I could've done that."

1123
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,290
"I totally could've done that."

1124
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,001
I think. I think.
I think I could've.

1125
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:49,824
Now, look, man, you said there was 
something interesting about it, though.

1126
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,409
Yes. There is.

1127
01:16:52,411 --> 01:16:53,495
Her.

1128
01:16:55,164 --> 01:16:57,874
Look, you don't come across
a voice like that every day.

1129
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,794
Hold up, man.
She didn't even want to sing!

1130
01:17:01,462 --> 01:17:04,297
Look, you need to find
different producers.

1131
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,300
You know? Work with Pharrell,
Ronson, Timbaland.

1132
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:10,470
No, look, I'm the producer, man. 
I make the tracks, right? Me.

1133
01:17:10,554 --> 01:17:12,597
And I found her. She wouldn't 
even be here if it wasn't for me.

1134
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:15,850
Look, guys, I'm sorry. That's just 
the way this business works.

1135
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:17,393
Look, you're young.

1136
01:17:17,478 --> 01:17:18,561
All right, you're
just getting started,

1137
01:17:18,646 --> 01:17:20,897
but right now
this is her time to shine.

1138
01:17:21,857 --> 01:17:25,485
Look. Give me an opportunity
to do this for you.

1139
01:17:25,986 --> 01:17:28,029
We're doing 360 deals
that will blow your mind.

1140
01:17:28,114 --> 01:17:29,531
We just joint ventured
with Live Nation.

1141
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:32,826
Clear Channel's giving us 1,000 
spins of anybody that we want.

1142
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,536
Listen, I worked on
Alicia Keys' record.

1143
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,870
I worked on Lauryn Hill's record.

1144
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:40,041
I know what to do for you. But you 
gotta trust me. Let's do this.

1145
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:44,337
Come on, let's go.

1146
01:17:46,465 --> 01:17:48,925
This is bullshit. And you know it.

1147
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:05,567
Wait, wait. Hold, hold on.

1148
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:07,443
Now, you were born to do this.
You know that.

1149
01:18:07,528 --> 01:18:09,404
You know what, thank you,
but I can't. I just can't ...

1150
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:10,530
I know they're your friends.

1151
01:18:10,614 --> 01:18:13,074
But what I'm trying to do 
for you could make you a star.

1152
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:18,288
Look. Just take my card
and think about it, all right?

1153
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:23,084
Denise! You coming?

1154
01:18:44,523 --> 01:18:47,901
So, this is all I've been able to 
come up with for the moment,

1155
01:18:47,985 --> 01:18:51,321
'cause my financiers
were slightly shallow ...

1156
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:54,282
Don't worry about the money. 
I mean, we'll shoot some scenes.

1157
01:18:54,366 --> 01:18:55,408
Okay. We'll cut a mini-trailer.

1158
01:18:55,492 --> 01:18:57,660
We'll use that to get more money.

1159
01:18:57,745 --> 01:19:01,497
I'm feeling it. I mean, I've already 
got this storyboard thing going with ...

1160
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:02,874
I've got some visuals here.

1161
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,584
- I thought I could run this by you.
- Right, right. Yeah!

1162
01:19:04,668 --> 01:19:07,420
I have a shot list in my bag somewhere 
if you'd like to see it now.

1163
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:09,547
- You just get into your process.
- Sure.

1164
01:19:09,632 --> 01:19:11,591
I've already talked to
my friends at Sundance.

1165
01:19:11,675 --> 01:19:14,552
This is exactly what
they're looking for.

1166
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:20,350
That's incredible. Let's make 
a movie. Let's make a movie.

1167
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:34,127
Excuse me.

1168
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:36,587
Hi, I'm looking for
Andy Matthews' trailer.

1169
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:37,714
Is he expecting you?

1170
01:19:37,798 --> 01:19:38,923
Yeah.

1171
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:40,717
Right this way.

1172
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:46,347
So what's going on?

1173
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:47,974
Um ...

1174
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,895
We were gonna go see your
casting director, right?

1175
01:19:54,148 --> 01:19:55,565
At least that's what
you said on the phone.

1176
01:19:55,649 --> 01:19:59,402
Right. Yes. No, no, no. Totally. 
She's actually out today.

1177
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:01,529
She has a flu.

1178
01:20:01,989 --> 01:20:04,907
Wow. I'm so sorry. Well, then I 
should come back another time ...

1179
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:09,120
No, no, no, no. She said that we 
could put a scene on tape for her.

1180
01:20:09,997 --> 01:20:12,999
Yeah. No, that's fine.
That's great.

1181
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,168
Okay. Perfect.

1182
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:18,379
So, I have a scene coming up this 
afternoon if you want to run that one.

1183
01:20:18,464 --> 01:20:20,381
Yeah, sure, that'd be good.

1184
01:20:20,466 --> 01:20:24,010
Okay.

1185
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:28,139
Um ...

1186
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,391
- It's ...
- Yeah, it's a scene where ...

1187
01:20:30,476 --> 01:20:34,479
we're coming back from a party 
and we're just at my apartment.

1188
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:36,397
Just relax. Here.

1189
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:38,941
You're gonna be great.

1190
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,443
Thanks.

1191
01:20:41,028 --> 01:20:44,655
So I told her a lot of stuff 
about you, you know.

1192
01:20:46,116 --> 01:20:48,493
I told her you're the prettiest 
girl at Performing Arts.

1193
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,037
- Thanks.
- It's true.

1194
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,333
So, what we're gonna do here,

1195
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,835
we're just gonna slate.
- Okay.

1196
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,505
Okay. It's like name and age, and 
then we'll get going with the scene.

1197
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01,714
Okay.

1198
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,138
And go.

1199
01:21:10,015 --> 01:21:12,892
Hi, I'm Jenny Garrison
and I'm 17 years old.

1200
01:21:14,812 --> 01:21:16,062
Perfect.

1201
01:21:24,405 --> 01:21:25,738
And action.

1202
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:30,076
"The music was so loud,
I had to get out of there."

1203
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:33,996
"Well, Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you."

1204
01:21:34,415 --> 01:21:36,582
"You know how I feel about you."

1205
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:39,502
"Or at least I hope you do."

1206
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,758
- Andy, you actually have 
still another line. - Right.

1207
01:21:45,843 --> 01:21:50,513
Yeah, that line. I like to 
improvise. It's kind of my thing.

1208
01:21:50,597 --> 01:21:51,681
You know? I'm sorry.

1209
01:21:51,765 --> 01:21:54,434
No. It's okay.
Just don't stop the scene again.

1210
01:21:54,518 --> 01:21:56,978
- Okay.
- You want to be an actress, right?

1211
01:21:57,062 --> 01:21:58,604
Right, of course.

1212
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,857
You gotta be ready for whatever 
they throw at you.

1213
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:02,400
I mean, our job, as actors,

1214
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,694
is to make the audience believe
what's really going on.

1215
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:06,737
- Right.
- I remember learning that at P.A.

1216
01:22:06,864 --> 01:22:09,449
- Am I wrong? - No, not at all.
That's exactly ... Yeah.

1217
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:11,742
- No, that's it. Perfect.
- Okay.

1218
01:22:12,453 --> 01:22:13,494
Let's try it again?

1219
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:15,079
Yep. Let's do it.

1220
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:16,664
Okay.

1221
01:22:18,459 --> 01:22:19,834
And action.

1222
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,545
The music was so loud,
I had to get out of there.

1223
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:25,548
Maddy, I'm so glad
you brought me with you.

1224
01:22:26,258 --> 01:22:28,885
I mean, you know
how I feel about you.

1225
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,096
Or at least I hope you do.

1226
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,485
- Andy.
- Jesus, Jenny.

1227
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:48,654
Look, I don't understand it.
You're not getting it.

1228
01:22:48,739 --> 01:22:52,450
I mean, do you know how many girls 
would die for this opportunity with me?

1229
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:56,329
Yeah. And I'm sure you've had 
every one of them in this trailer.

1230
01:22:56,413 --> 01:22:58,289
No, probably not every one of them.

1231
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:02,335
Look, is this even an audition or do 
you have a collection of these tapes?

1232
01:23:03,462 --> 01:23:05,171
I might have a few.

1233
01:23:05,797 --> 01:23:08,132
Look, Jenny.
No. You came here.

1234
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,259
Okay, what did you think
was gonna happen?

1235
01:23:10,344 --> 01:23:13,304
We were gonna talk about our craft?

1236
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,931
I don't do that.

1237
01:23:15,015 --> 01:23:17,350
- Okay, you don't, but I do.
- Right.

1238
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:18,684
No, look.
Stop it, okay!

1239
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,102
- Can you just leave me alone?
- Jenny.

1240
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:21,979
Just leave me alone!

1241
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:35,034
Wait. Andy?
What about Andy?

1242
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:40,331
Andy invited me to set
to meet a casting director.

1243
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:45,545
And we went into
his trailer. And ...

1244
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,547
- Well, I ...
- Jenny.

1245
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,758
Well, did he try something on you?

1246
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,802
Kind of.

1247
01:23:52,886 --> 01:23:55,263
I knew it! I knew
this was gonna happen.

1248
01:23:55,347 --> 01:23:56,639
- Marco!
- I told you

1249
01:23:56,723 --> 01:23:58,349
about this asshole
from the beginning.

1250
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,934
But you still went behind my back.

1251
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:02,228
I know. And I'm sorry,
but I ...

1252
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:05,481
Look, I thought that maybe if he did 
want to flirt, just a little bit,

1253
01:24:05,566 --> 01:24:07,066
that it would be fine if I ...

1254
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,277
What, if you got the job?

1255
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:10,486
You know what, Jenny?

1256
01:24:10,571 --> 01:24:13,614
If becoming famous
is so important to you,

1257
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:16,200
then go for it. I'm done with this.

1258
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,120
- Marco, I ...
- Hey, you know what?

1259
01:24:19,204 --> 01:24:22,290
I hope you really get
the role. I really do.

1260
01:24:25,752 --> 01:24:28,212
What do you mean, 
I can't have my camera equipment?

1261
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,631
You see, I already gave
the check to my producer.

1262
01:24:30,716 --> 01:24:32,216
So, this is a matter of ...
Sir, there's no ...

1263
01:24:32,342 --> 01:24:33,718
- You are not registered
on the computer. - Right.

1264
01:24:33,844 --> 01:24:35,303
- Neither you nor your
producer are here. - Okay.

1265
01:24:35,387 --> 01:24:36,387
I cannot do that.

1266
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,347
At the same time,
this film is fully funded.

1267
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,516
- I don't care. It may be.
- He just called me.

1268
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:43,019
He goes, "Earl's gonna help you out." 
You're not helping me out, Earl.

1269
01:24:43,103 --> 01:24:45,479
I would love to help you out, but 
there's nothing I can do. I cannot ...

1270
01:24:45,564 --> 01:24:46,939
You know what, let's check
the name again.

1271
01:24:47,024 --> 01:24:49,066
I've checked the name
already three times ...

1272
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,694
Please just check the name again. 
Let's do it again. Come on.

1273
01:24:51,778 --> 01:24:54,614
B-A-C-Z-Y-N-S-K-Y.
I know how to spell it.

1274
01:24:54,698 --> 01:24:56,032
I tried it three times.
Earl, please help me here.

1275
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:59,201
I would love to help you, but it's 
not there. There's nothing I can do.

1276
01:25:11,632 --> 01:25:13,966
Eddie, it's Neil.

1277
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:50,002
You remember how you asked me to write 
you that letter of recommendation?

1278
01:25:50,087 --> 01:25:51,170
Of course.

1279
01:25:52,005 --> 01:25:53,297
Well ...

1280
01:25:54,007 --> 01:25:57,385
I'm sorry, but I can't
write you that letter.

1281
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:06,644
Sometimes we get students
who are promising,

1282
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:11,691
but they never progress
past that early promise.

but I don't believe that's
going to happen for you.

Kevin, there are students who are
going to get picked up ...

1305
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:13,145
by Ailey, City Ballet,
Complexions.

1306
01:28:13,605 --> 01:28:18,651
And there are other students who are 
going to have to pursue other options.

1307
01:28:21,404 --> 01:28:22,655
Like,

1308
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:27,493
you might make a wonderful teacher.

1309
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,545
- Maybe you're right.
- I know, I'm so proud of you.

1310
01:28:37,629 --> 01:28:40,589
It's Sesame Street. Okay, 
who doesn't know Sesame Street?

1311
01:28:40,674 --> 01:28:44,134
- Everybody grew up with it at 
some point. - Cookie Monster!

1312
01:28:44,427 --> 01:28:46,345

- No.
- No?

1318
01:29:11,162 --> 01:29:12,913
See, there are some people
that like crispy cookies ...

1319
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:14,415
and some people that like gooey ...
I don't like ...

1320
01:29:14,499 --> 01:29:17,835
And so, if I could create my perfect
Sesame Street cast ...

No, see, you see, if I could make 
my ideal Sesame Street cast ...

Kevin!

1324
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,839
Did he call you again?

1325
01:30:45,924 --> 01:30:47,925
Yeah, he called me again.

1326
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:51,929
So does he want you to record 
an album or something?

1327
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:57,184
Yeah. He wanted me to work with Damon 
and Poyser, whoever those people are.

1328
01:31:00,313 --> 01:31:01,939
What'd you say?

1329
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:03,357
I told him no.

1330
01:31:03,441 --> 01:31:05,275
Because of your pops?

1331
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:07,027
No.

1332
01:31:07,737 --> 01:31:09,363
What? Because of us?

1333
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:11,156
Yes, because of us.

1334
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,868
It's you, me and Malik.
That's it. Package deal.

1335
01:31:20,834 --> 01:31:25,129
Denise, look, I ... I don't wanna 
keep you from your dreams, all right?

1336
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,798
That man's right,
you were born to sing.

1337
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:30,175
Jesus, Victor!
Enough already.

1338
01:31:33,763 --> 01:31:35,431
Before you and Malik,

1339
01:31:35,515 --> 01:31:37,474
I didn't even realize
I could sing that music.

1340
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:39,560
That I loved that music.

1341
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:44,106
I didn't even know who I was.

1342
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,691
You guys believed in me,

1343
01:31:45,775 --> 01:31:48,569
so I'm not gonna sell you out.

1344
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:50,320
And that's that.

1345
01:31:52,824 --> 01:31:55,284
Now, can we get back to practice?

1346
01:31:56,786 --> 01:31:57,911
Yeah.

1347
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,466
I've been calling you
and texting you.

1348
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:13,177
Left a few messages
and you don't even respond.

1349
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:17,347
And I didn't see you
at school. What's up with that?

1350
01:32:18,016 --> 01:32:21,935
I'm sorry. It's been crazy. I've 
been so busy getting ready and stuff.

1351
01:32:23,229 --> 01:32:25,606
Busy? Doing what?

1352
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:29,943
I got into Complexions.

1353
01:32:30,653 --> 01:32:32,321
Complexions? What's that?

1354
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:36,825
Only the greatest modern 
dance company in the world.

1355
01:32:37,911 --> 01:32:40,162
They want me for a world tour.

1356
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,415
What?

1357
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,210
Wait, are you serious?

1358
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:47,336
Yeah.

1359
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:51,507
Oh, my God.

1360
01:32:52,717 --> 01:32:55,135
That's what I'm talking about.
What did I tell you?

1361
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,929
It's gonna be a lot of work.

1362
01:32:57,013 --> 01:32:59,598
I bet. What's it like?
Give me details.

1363
01:32:59,682 --> 01:33:02,643
Twenty-two cities.
We start rehearsing next week.

1364
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:04,937
Next week? What about school?

1365
01:33:05,522 --> 01:33:07,231
I'm dropping out.

1366
01:33:09,192 --> 01:33:10,609
Your parents will let you?

1367
01:33:10,693 --> 01:33:14,279
Are you kidding? They've put me 
in dance class since I was five.

1368
01:33:14,364 --> 01:33:15,447
They're thrilled.

1369
01:33:15,698 --> 01:33:16,782
Oh.

1370
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:20,202
That's great.

1371
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:24,039
I know I should have told you 
sooner, Victor. I'm sorry.

1372
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:28,877
We'll still, like ...
We'll still see each other, right?

1373
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:32,714
When you come back to
visit your parents. Right?

1374
01:33:34,384 --> 01:33:36,844
Alice, baby, come on.

1375
01:33:36,928 --> 01:33:40,639
Victor, listen.
It's not just us.

1376
01:33:40,723 --> 01:33:43,851
A lot of my friends
say that after P.A.,

1377
01:33:45,687 --> 01:33:47,437
you just go on your separate ways.

1378
01:33:49,274 --> 01:33:52,067
It's just the way
the world works, Victor.

1379
01:33:52,902 --> 01:33:54,945
That's just how it works?

1380
01:34:27,312 --> 01:34:28,729
Hey, Malik.

1381
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,607
What happened to your dad?

1382
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:34,860
What?

1383
01:34:35,987 --> 01:34:38,113
Your dad. Where is he?

1384
01:34:40,867 --> 01:34:42,284
Mrs. Simms?

1385
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,494
Joy. Come in.

1386
01:34:47,457 --> 01:34:49,208
Have a seat, dear.

1387
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:50,459
Come here.

1388
01:34:52,712 --> 01:34:55,047
Come and have a seat.
I want to talk to you.

1389
01:34:55,131 --> 01:34:58,133
I think we both know
why I asked to see you.

1390
01:34:59,469 --> 01:35:00,886
Your grades.

1391
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:07,017
I'm your teacher, Malik.
And I want an answer.

1392
01:35:10,897 --> 01:35:14,107
The oldest story in the book, 
all right? He left.

1393
01:35:16,694 --> 01:35:20,989
After Ayanna was born. Didn't 
even come back for her funeral.

1394
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:27,246
Was there anyone there
to take his place?

1395
01:35:28,665 --> 01:35:32,251
I tried to make it work for 
as long as I possibly could.

1396
01:35:32,335 --> 01:35:33,377
I know.

1397
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:35,587
You know how I feel about P.A.

1398
01:35:35,672 --> 01:35:38,799
But I'm working on the show
all the time now.

1399
01:35:39,676 --> 01:35:42,261
And I ... I just ...

1400
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:46,974
I don't know what to do.

1401
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:49,977
Everything you're ashamed of,

1402
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:53,897
all the parts of yourself
that you keep secret,

1403
01:35:53,982 --> 01:35:57,901
everything you want to
change about yourself,

1404
01:35:57,986 --> 01:35:59,987
it's who you are.

1405
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:02,781
That's your power.

1406
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,952
Deny it and you're nothing.

1407
01:36:07,036 --> 01:36:11,331
And you'll never be
much of an actor.

1408
01:36:13,126 --> 01:36:16,670
This school is here to
develop you as an artist.

1409
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:20,007
And when you're ready, send you 
out there to go to work.

1410
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:22,718
Are you ready?

1411
01:36:26,556 --> 01:36:29,224
Now, you're good, Malik.

1412
01:36:29,309 --> 01:36:33,645
But you've got to start
breaking down those walls ...

1413
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:38,317
and accept your circumstances.

1414
01:36:41,321 --> 01:36:43,113
Just tell the truth.

1415
01:36:44,782 --> 01:36:47,159
Nobody cares about that shit.

1416
01:36:48,453 --> 01:36:50,078
Yeah, maybe so.

1417
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,790
But I do.

1418
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:36,375
You all right?

1419
01:37:36,459 --> 01:37:38,168
Why the hell are you so nervous?

1420
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:42,923
Cool. You invited them.

1421
01:37:43,007 --> 01:37:44,966
No, not exactly.

1422
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:47,344
What does that mean?

1423
01:37:48,846 --> 01:37:51,556
I told them some kids 
from school were performing

1424
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:54,101
who were, I don't know,
musically gifted.

1425
01:37:54,185 --> 01:37:56,853
Wait, so they don't know
you're singing tonight?

1426
01:37:56,938 --> 01:37:58,105
No.

1427
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:01,566
But do they know it's hip hop?

1428
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,028
I told them, "Classical jazz."

1429
01:38:09,575 --> 01:38:11,701
Oh, it's gonna be good tonight.

1430
01:38:11,786 --> 01:38:13,120
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:38:14,372 --> 01:38:16,248
You sure you don't want
anything to drink?

1432
01:38:16,332 --> 01:38:19,584
I'd love one, but I'm gonna be 
paying my dad back till I'm 30.

1433
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:21,545
I can't afford a drink.

1434
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:24,297
You don't mind if I have a sip 
of yours, though, right?

1435
01:38:24,382 --> 01:38:25,632
Look who it is. Look who it is.

1436
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:28,802
Mr. Dowd.

1437
01:38:38,688 --> 01:38:41,064
Yeah, sorry, guys,
I gotta go.

1438
01:38:48,865 --> 01:38:50,115
How've you been?

1439
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:51,408
I've been okay.

1440
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:54,369
That's good.

1441
01:38:56,873 --> 01:38:59,416
I've been thinking
a lot about you.

1442
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,586
Yeah, I have, too.

1443
01:39:03,379 --> 01:39:05,964
I think about how I hurt you ...

1444
01:39:07,049 --> 01:39:09,384
and it kills me. I'm so sorry.

1445
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:13,722
I went there for all the wrong 
reasons and I know that now.

1446
01:39:13,806 --> 01:39:17,392
Things will probably never be 
the same between us, but ...

1447
01:39:18,728 --> 01:39:21,229
Mike check, one-two, one-two.

1448
01:39:21,314 --> 01:39:23,815
Do you think you'll ever
be able to forgive me?

1449
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,942
Hey, guys, the show's
about to start.

1450
01:39:26,027 --> 01:39:27,486
Coming.

1451
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:29,321
Listen.

1452
01:39:29,947 --> 01:39:33,200
Let's just talk about this later.
Okay?

1453
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:35,869
All right.

1454
01:39:37,997 --> 01:39:41,416
Yo, what up, everyone?
How y'all feeling tonight?

1455
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:43,293
Come on, let me hear y'all.

1456
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:44,586
Yeah!

1457
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,963
Come on, y'all can
do better than that.

1458
01:39:47,048 --> 01:39:50,425
Look, look, look. we got a 
special group for y'all tonight,

1459
01:39:50,509 --> 01:39:52,636
straight out of the
Performing Arts High School.

1460
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,804
How y'all feel about that?

1461
01:39:54,889 --> 01:39:56,056
I got a question for y'all.

1462
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:59,309
How many people here have gone 
to the Performing Arts?

1463
01:39:59,393 --> 01:40:01,519
Okay, raise your hands.
Let me see. Let me see.

1464
01:40:01,604 --> 01:40:05,607
I see you. Okay, one, two, ten.
Okay, good, good.

1465
01:40:05,691 --> 01:40:08,777
So look, look, tonight is their
first performance ever ...

1466
01:40:08,903 --> 01:40:11,947
- Good luck, girl.

1467
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:14,950

1543
01:44:05,598 --> 01:44:06,723
you tricked us into
coming here tonight.

1544
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:07,807
I thought it was a school event.

1545
01:44:07,892 --> 01:44:09,142
I had to. There was
no other choice.

you were up there with?

01:44:10,769 --> 01:44:11,936
They're my friends. I ...

1548
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:14,814
And when the hell
did you start singing?

1549
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:17,817
I just want you to know that 
this is completely unacceptable.

1550
01:44:17,902 --> 01:44:21,404
You know what? If you can't accept 
this, then you can't accept me.

1551
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:23,323
Because this is who I am.

1552
01:44:23,407 --> 01:44:25,825
Playing piano isn't enough for
me anymore, Daddy.

1553
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:28,119
Sitting in an orchestra,
invisible. I hate it!

1554
01:44:28,204 --> 01:44:29,954
That's it! I'm pulling you out
of that school.

1555
01:44:30,039 --> 01:44:31,331
I don't care if there's
three months left.

1556
01:44:31,415 --> 01:44:32,916
- But ... What?
- No.

1557
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:37,587
I have been watching Denise play the 
piano all her life and she is good.

1558
01:44:37,963 --> 01:44:41,716
And she practices and she's done 
everything we asked her to do.

1559
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,301
But she doesn't love it.

1560
01:44:43,385 --> 01:44:45,261
She went to school to be ...

1561
01:44:49,767 --> 01:44:54,103
You will stay at that school and 
we will support you no matter what.

1562
01:44:54,188 --> 01:44:55,230
Now, wait ...

1563
01:44:55,314 --> 01:44:57,649
There will be no more discussion.

1564
01:45:09,578 --> 01:45:12,455
There are some things
success is not.

1565
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:16,000
It's not fame.
It's not money or power.

1566
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:20,922
Success is waking up
in the morning ...

1567
01:45:21,006 --> 01:45:23,466
so excited about
what you have to do ...

1568
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,636
that you literally
fly out the door.

1569
01:45:27,513 --> 01:45:30,473
It's getting to work
with people you love.

1570
01:45:32,434 --> 01:45:36,771
Success is connecting with the 
world and making people feel.

1571
01:45:37,815 --> 01:45:40,149
It's finding a way to
bind together people ...

1572
01:45:40,234 --> 01:45:42,777
who have nothing in
common but a dream.

1573
01:45:43,112 --> 01:45:46,656
It's falling asleep at night knowing 
you did the best job you could.

1574
01:45:47,825 --> 01:45:51,953
Success is joy and
freedom and friendship.

1575
01:45:54,707 --> 01:45:56,541
And success is love.

1576
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,671
What are you doing here?
You're not graduating.

1577
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:04,757
True, but my best friend is.
I bought you a present.

1578
01:46:04,842 --> 01:46:06,926
Oh, my God!
Where did you find this?

1579
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:09,929
I thought the Gucci print might be a 
little too much, but I thought you'd like it.

1580
01:46:10,014 --> 01:46:11,681
No, it's perfect.

1581
01:46:18,689 --> 01:46:21,024
What happened to all your stuff?

1582
01:46:23,861 --> 01:46:25,987
It all went home already.

1583
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,448
What do you mean?

1584
01:46:30,242 --> 01:46:32,160
I'm going back to lowa.

1585
01:46:33,037 --> 01:46:35,121
But I thought we talked
about you staying here,

1586
01:46:35,205 --> 01:46:36,789
doing dance class and Broadway ...

1587
01:46:36,874 --> 01:46:38,499
Joy, Joy, Joy.

1588
01:46:38,917 --> 01:46:41,711
I'm lucky. I have a place to go.

1589
01:46:43,047 --> 01:46:45,840
I'm gonna take over
my mom's dance studio.

1590
01:46:46,342 --> 01:46:50,261
And I'm gonna be the best goddamn 
dance teacher there ever was.

1591
01:46:58,896 --> 01:47:01,898
Four years of ups and downs,

1592
01:47:02,566 --> 01:47:06,402
of wonderment and disappointment,

1593
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,405
of ennui and joy.

1594
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:14,535
It was everything
I'd ever hoped for.

1595
01:47:17,414 --> 01:47:18,915
And scene.

1596
01:47:21,543 --> 01:47:24,545
- Congratulations!
- Can I take a picture?

1597
01:47:31,095 --> 01:47:32,261
Over here.

1598
01:47:33,097 --> 01:47:34,514
- Hi.
- Hi.

1599
01:47:34,765 --> 01:47:37,475
Welcome, everyone, to the 
New York High School of Performing Arts ...

1600
01:47:37,559 --> 01:47:39,227
graduation and performance.
I got us seats right here.

1601
01:47:39,311 --> 01:47:41,813
we ask that you now turn off 
all your cell phones ...

1602
01:47:41,897 --> 01:47:44,190
and please refrain from
any flash photography ...

1603
01:47:44,274 --> 01:47:45,692
during the performance.

1604
01:47:45,776 --> 01:47:48,611
Thank you very much
and enjoy the show.
