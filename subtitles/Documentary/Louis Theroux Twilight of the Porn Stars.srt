1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,747
<i>I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.</i>

2
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:37,797
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.</i>

3
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:15,007
<i>So I can't bring myself to
regret the decision to leave home.</i>

4
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,202
<i>I would miss Phoenix.</i>

5
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,338
<i>I'd miss the heat.</i>

6
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,481
<i>I would miss my loving, erratic,
harebrained mother.</i>

7
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,779
Okay.

8
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,711
<i>Renee, come on.
- And her new husband.</i>

9
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,552
Guys, come on. I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.

10
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:40,220
<i>But they want to go on the road,
so I'm gonna spend some time with my dad,</i>

11
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:42,927
<i>and this will be a good thing.</i>

12
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>I think.</i>

13
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:49,604
<i> When the thorn bush turns white</i>

14
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:55,872
<i>That's when I'll come home</i>

15
00:01:55,872 --> 00:02:02,908
<i>I am going out to see what I can sow</i>

16
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:09,616
<i>And I don't know where I'll go</i>

17
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,991
<i>And I don't know what I'll see</i>

18
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,461
<i>In the state of Washington,</i>

19
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:17,499
<i>under a near constant cover
of clouds and rain,</i>

20
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,966
<i>there's a small town named Forks.</i>

21
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:24,199
<i>Population, 3, 120 people.</i>

22
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,699
<i>This is where I'm moving.</i>

23
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,574
<i>My dad's Charlie.</i>

24
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:34,509
<i>He's the chief of police.</i>

25
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:39,082
<i>Curse the powers that be</i>

26
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,923
<i>Cause all I want is...</i>

27
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:45,790
Your hair's longer.

28
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:51,197
I cut it since the last time I saw you.

29
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,768
Guess it grew out again.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,807
<i>I used to spend two weeks here
almost every summer,</i>

31
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:10,384
<i>but it's been years.</i>

32
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:27,299
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.

33
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,597
Right. One bathroom.

34
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:38,076
It's a pretty good work lamp.

35
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,949
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.

36
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,542
You like purple, right?

37
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,212
Purple's cool.

38
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,354
Thanks.

39
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:55,959
Okay.

40
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:04,029
<i>One of the best things about Charlie,</i>

41
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:06,006
<i>he doesn't hover.</i>

42
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,347
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

43
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,009
Good to see you.

44
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,654
Bella, you remember Billy Black.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:25,023
Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.

46
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:26,955
I'm glad you're finally here.

47
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,327
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it
since you told him you were coming.

48
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:33,400
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
After I ram you in the ankles.

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,963
You want to go?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,267
Bring it.

52
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,275
Hi, I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

53
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,107
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.

54
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,010
Right. No, I remember.

55
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:49,241
Are they always like this?

56
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,719
It's getting worse with old age.
- Good.

57
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,517
So, what do you think?

58
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,686
Of what?

59
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,660
Your homecoming present.
- This?

60
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:03,029
Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.

61
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,124
I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
- Come on.

62
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,964
Oh, my gosh!

63
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,405
This is perfect. Are you joking me?

64
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,206
Sorry.

65
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:16,143
I told you she'd love it.

66
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,111
I'm down with the kids.

67
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,671
Oh, yeah, dude. You're the bomb.

68
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,080
Okay.

69
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,845
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

70
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:27,081
but besides that, you should be good.

71
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,386
That's this one?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.

72
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,982
All right.

73
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,785
Do you want a ride to school or something?

74
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:35,887
I go to school on the reservation.

75
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:38,325
Right, right.
- Yeah.

76
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:41,563
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.

77
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,034
<i>My first day at a new school.</i>

78
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,444
<i>It's March, middle of the semester.</i>

79
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,910
<i>Great.</i>

80
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:04,284
Nice ride.
- Thanks.

81
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,158
Good one.

82
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,927
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.

83
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,372
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.

84
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,277
Anything you need, tour guide,
lunch date, shoulder to cry on?

85
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,786
I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

86
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:33,779
Good headline for your feature.

87
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,518
I'm on the paper,
and you're news, baby, front page.

88
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,025
No, I'm not.

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,194
You...
Please don't have any sort of...

90
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,459
Chillax. No feature.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,399
Okay, thanks.
- Cool?

92
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,469
All right. Okay. Yeah.

93
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,268
Get it! Get it! Get it!

94
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,203
To you!

95
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,711
Whoa!

96
00:06:58,711 --> 00:06:59,839
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,179
I told them not to let me play.

98
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,950
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

99
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,454
You're Isabella, right?

100
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:08,990
Just Bella.

101
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,219
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

102
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,654
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,993
She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

104
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:17,794
I'm Jessica, by the way.

105
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,199
Yeah.

107
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,001
Aren't people from Arizona
supposed to be, like, really tan?

108
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,132
Yeah.

109
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:28,802
Maybe that's why they kicked me out.

110
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,781
You're good.

111
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,712
That's so funny.

112
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,149
Back in, Jess.
- Down here.

113
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,253
Like a masterpiece, you know,

114
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,590
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,

115
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,596
and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.

116
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,791
You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?

117
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,494
Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella?
- Hey.

118
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,896
Your home girl?

119
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:55,959
Yeah.
- Yeah?

120
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,869
That's...
- My girl.

121
00:07:58,273 --> 00:07:59,740
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!

122
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,797
Tyler.

123
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,205
Yes!

124
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,269
Oh, my God.

125
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,408
It's like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.

126
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,082
Smile.

127
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:12,715
Okay.
- Sorry.

128
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,187
I needed a candid for the feature.

129
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,655
The feature's dead, Angela.

130
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,783
Don't bring it up again.

131
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,185
It's okay, I just...

132
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,525
I got your back, baby.

133
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,794
Guess we'll just run another editorial
on teen drinking.

134
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:29,031
You know,
you can always go for eating disorders.

135
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,506
Speedo padding on the swim team.

136
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,132
Actually, that's a good one.

137
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:37,303
Kirk. Right? That's exactly what I thought.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,540
We're talking Olympic-size.

139
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,708
There's no way. He's so skinny.
It doesn't make sense.

140
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,445
Totally.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,478
Who are they?

142
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,648
The Cullens.

143
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,251
They're Dr. and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.

144
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:57,856
They moved down here from Alaska,
like, a few years ago.

145
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,060
They kind of keep to themselves.

146
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,069
Yeah, Because they're all together.

147
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,162
Like, together, together.

148
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,402
The blonde girl, that's Rosalie,

149
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:13,073
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

150
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:14,615
I'm not even sure that's legal.

151
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,049
Jess, they're not actually related.

152
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,781
Yeah, but they live together. It's weird.

153
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:23,484
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's Alice.

154
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,459
She's really weird,

155
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,691
and she's with Jasper, the blond one
who looks like he's in pain.

156
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,468
Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad/matchmaker.

157
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,531
Maybe he'll adopt me.

158
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:43,144
Who's he?

159
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,215
That's Edward Cullen.

160
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,084
He's totally gorgeous, obviously,

161
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:57,489
but apparently nobody here's
good enough for him.

162
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,793
Like I care, you know?

163
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,728
So, yeah.

164
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,233
Seriously, like,
don't waste your time.

165
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,430
I wasn't planning on it.

166
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,450
Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.

167
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,883
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

168
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,801
Hi. Can I have the pass? Thank you.

169
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,203
Welcome to the class.
Here. Here's your stuff, okay?

170
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,936
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.

171
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:50,342
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.

172
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:54,508
<i>All right, guys, today we are gonna be
observing the behavior of planaria,</i>

173
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,642
aka flatworms.

174
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,647
So what we're gonna do...

175
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,383
...regenerate.

176
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,451
Zombie worms.

177
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,026
No cell phones. Guys, let's get to it.

178
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,864
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.

179
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:18,703
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

180
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,742
You won't believe this.

181
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:24,838
Let's try to focus
while we check those out, huh, guys?

182
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,122
There must be something open.

183
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:40,127
Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.

184
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,554
Just a minute, dear.

185
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm afraid you'll have to stay in biology.

186
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:50,171
Fine. Just... I'll just have to endure it.

187
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:10,021
I just can't get over how grown up you are.
And so gorgeous.

188
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:12,617
Hey, Bella.

189
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,355
You remember me?

190
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,691
I played Santa one year.

191
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:20,929
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had
a Christmas here since she was four.

192
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,130
I bet I made an impression, though, didn't I?

193
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,730
You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?

194
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:28,299
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.

195
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,608
All right,
let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.

196
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,114
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.

197
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:36,013
Berry cobbler, remember?

198
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:39,019
Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.

199
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,214
Thank you. That'd be great.

200
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,259
Here.

201
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:48,957
Thanks.

202
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,670
<i>Hey, baby. So, listen,
if spring training goes well,</i>

203
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,902
<i>we could be moving to Florida.</i>

204
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:05,071
<i>Please insert $1.25
for an additional three minutes.</i>

205
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,341
Mom, where's your cell?

206
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:07,882
Okay, don't laugh.

207
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:10,440
I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away.

208
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,851
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.

209
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:19,015
I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

210
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,392
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?

211
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,522
<i>Are there any cute guys?</i>

212
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,429
<i>Are they being nice to you?</i>

213
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:27,930
Well,

214
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,432
they're all very welcoming.

215
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,674
Tell me all about it.

216
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,437
It doesn't even matter.

217
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:36,704
<i>Yes, it does, honey.</i>

218
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:39,906
I have homework to do. I'll talk to you later.

219
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,348
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

220
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:44,009
Love you, too.

221
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:57,460
<i>I planned to confront him
and demand to know what his problem was.</i>

222
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,340
<i>But he never showed.</i>

223
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,878
Bella!

224
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:33,034
<i>And the next day, another no-show.</i>

225
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,803
<i>More days passed.</i>

226
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,006
<i>Things were getting a little strange.</i>

227
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,319
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

228
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,229
Ice doesn't really help the uncoordinated.

229
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,962
Yeah. That's why I had
some new tires put on the truck.

230
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:43,800
Old ones were getting pretty bald.

231
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,864
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.

232
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:51,208
Security guard at the Grisham Mill
got killed by some kind of animal.

233
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,380
An animal?

234
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,277
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.

235
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:59,445
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

236
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,785
Be careful.
- Always am.

237
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,782
And thanks for the tires.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:23,910
Prom Committee is a chick thing,

239
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,879
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway,

240
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,710
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,

241
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,806
so I need your play list.

242
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:33,411
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

243
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,217
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

244
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,224
How you liking the rain, girl?

245
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:38,384
Better get used to it, girl.

246
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,223
Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.

247
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:43,458
Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.

248
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,829
Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.

249
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,630
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?

250
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,742
Hello.

251
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:04,509
I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself last week.

252
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,520
I'm Edward Cullen.

253
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,078
You're Bella?

254
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,282
Yes.

255
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,087
Onion root tip cells,

256
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,889
that's what's on your slides right now.

257
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:18,160
Okay? So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,

258
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,193
and the first partners that get it right
are gonna win the Golden Onion.

259
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,902
All right, good.

260
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,601
Ladies first.

261
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,141
You were gone.

262
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:38,712
Yeah.

263
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,678
I was out of town for a couple of days.

264
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:43,553
Personal reasons.

265
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,084
Prophase.

266
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,230
Do you mind if I look?

267
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,961
It's prophase.

268
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,361
Like I said.

269
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,276
So are you enjoying the rain?

270
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,414
What?

271
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:12,783
You're asking me about the weather?

272
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,219
Yeah, I...

273
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,380
I guess I am.

274
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,695
Well, I don't really like the rain.

275
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:27,089
Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...

276
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,866
What?
- Nothing.

277
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,644
It's anaphase.

278
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:43,447
You mind if I check?
- Sure.

279
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,322
Anaphase.

280
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,487
Like I said.

281
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,398
If you hate the cold and the rain so much,

282
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:05,565
why'd you move to the wettest place
in the continental US?

283
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,076
It's complicated.

284
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:15,706
I'm sure I can keep up.

285
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,382
My mom remarried, and...

286
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:26,623
So you don't like the guy, or...

287
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,891
No, that's not...

288
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,363
Phil's really nice.

289
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:49,145
It's metaphase. You want to check it?

290
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,144
I believe you.

291
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:56,115
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

292
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:01,928
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball player,

293
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:04,897
and he travels a lot,

294
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:08,367
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,

295
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,930
so I figured I'd stay with my dad for a while.

296
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,036
And now you're unhappy.

297
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,840
No.
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

298
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,646
I'm just trying to figure you out.

299
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,152
You're very difficult for me to read.

300
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:28,451
Hey, did you get contacts?

301
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:29,201
No.

302
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:33,156
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

303
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:37,187
and now they're, like, golden brown.

304
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:39,426
Yeah, I know, it's the...

305
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,859
It's the fluorescents.

306
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:38,885
Bella!
- Bella!

307
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:41,083
Dial 911!

308
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,130
I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.

309
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,722
Bella, I'm so sorry. I panicked.

310
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,632
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.

311
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,708
Bella. You okay?

312
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,045
You and I are gonna talk. You all right?

313
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:01,911
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

314
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:04,417
I'm sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.

315
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,543
I know. It's okay.

316
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:08,054
No. It sure as hell is not okay.

317
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:09,549
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

318
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,683
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

319
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

320
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:17,692
You can kiss your license goodbye.

321
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:20,393
I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- Dr. Cullen.

322
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,833
Charlie.

323
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:24,296
I've got this one, Jackie.

324
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:26,703
Isabella.

325
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,497
Bella.

326
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,845
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?

327
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,073
Good.

328
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:35,213
Look here.

329
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:40,244
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

330
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:42,221
but your vitals look good.

331
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,383
No signs of any head trauma.

332
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:45,983
I think you'll be just fine.

333
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,528
I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

334
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,891
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse

335
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:55,834
if Edward wasn't there.
He knocked me out of the way.

336
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,996
Edward? Your boy?

337
00:22:58,606 --> 00:22:59,971
Yeah, it was amazing.

338
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,805
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

339
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,970
Sounds like you were very lucky.

340
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,343
Charlie.

341
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:13,581
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...

342
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:16,722
You should probably call your mom.

343
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:18,418
Did you tell her?

344
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:23,162
She's probably just

345
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,959
freaking out.

346
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:28,600
fifteen kids that saw
what happened.

347
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,230
What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?

348
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,001
This isn't just about you. It's about all of us.

349
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,873
I think we should
take this in my office.

350
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:41,882
Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.

351
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,354
What?

352
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,093
How did you get over to me so fast?

353
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:57,631
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

354
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:01,499
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

355
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:03,695
No, I wasn't.

356
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,869
Yes, you were.

357
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,777
Bella, you're... You hit your head.

358
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,610
I think you're confused.

359
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,115
I know what I saw.

360
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:18,311
And what exactly was that?

361
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,518
You...

362
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:24,190
You stopped the van.

363
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,455
You pushed it away with your hand.

364
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:31,126
Well, nobody's gonna believe you, so...

365
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,595
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.

366
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,703
I just need to know the truth.

367
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,538
Can't you just thank me and get over it?

368
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,467
Thank you.

369
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:47,642
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

370
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:50,684
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

371
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:28,778
<i>And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.</i>

372
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,852
I need everybody's permission slips, okay?

373
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:34,656
Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.

374
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:36,458
Guys, let's go.

375
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,466
Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

376
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,309
Look at you, huh? You're alive.

377
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,942
I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.

378
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:01,786
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

379
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:03,551
it's like a month away, but...

380
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:08,689
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

381
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,826
So, what do you think?

382
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:16,836
About what?
- Do you want to go?

383
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,273
To prom?

384
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:22,002
With me?

385
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:24,942
I...

386
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,776
Prom.

387
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,014
Dancing.

388
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,779
Not such a good idea for me.

389
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:35,853
I have something that weekend anyway.

390
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:37,857
I'm going to Jacksonville that weekend.

391
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,893
You can't go another weekend?

392
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:41,861
Non-refundable ticket.

393
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:44,722
You should ask Jessica.

394
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:46,767
I know she wants to go with you.

395
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,597
All right. All right.

396
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:52,238
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, guys, come on.

397
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:55,434
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.

398
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:57,875
Let's go. Guys, come on.

399
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,108
Other bus, other bus. Let's go.

400
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,740
<i>Egg shells, carrot tops.</i>

401
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,445
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

402
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:07,009
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.

403
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:12,458
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.

404
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:13,885
Okay.
- Give me that.

405
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:17,863
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

406
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:20,560
Don't drink it! It's for the plants.

407
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:23,362
What's in Jacksonville?

408
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,434
How did you know about that?

409
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,772
You didn't answer my question.

410
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,776
You don't answer any of mine, so...

411
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,476
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

412
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:38,112
Hi.

413
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:42,381
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

414
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:45,357
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

415
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:48,487
It's very common. You can Google it.

416
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,128
Floridians.

417
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,499
That's what's in Jacksonville.

418
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:59,835
Can you at least watch where you walk?

419
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:06,609
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all the time.
I just think it's the best way.

420
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:09,445
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.

421
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,213
Who?

422
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:16,746
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

423
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:19,987
It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

424
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:21,926
You guys are great together.
- I know, right?

425
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,964
Tyler...
- Gross.

426
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,125
Bella, look. It's a worm.

427
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,691
It's a worm.

428
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:35,107
Bella, we shouldn't be friends.

429
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:41,407
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

430
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:43,541
I mean, why didn't you just
let the van crush me

431
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,085
and save yourself all this regret?

432
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:50,020
What, you think I regret saving you?

433
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,549
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

434
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,655
You don't know anything.

435
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,562
Hi.

436
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,093
Are you gonna be riding with us?

437
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:01,998
No, our bus is full.

438
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,170
Your mom called. Again.

439
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,139
Well, that's your fault.

440
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:19,846
You shouldn't have told her
about the "almost" accident. You finished?

441
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,251
Yeah.

442
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:25,916
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.

443
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:29,193
She seems different.

444
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,724
She seems happy.

445
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,593
Phil sounds like an all right guy.

446
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:40,663
Yeah, he is.

447
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:48,447
All right.

448
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,277
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

449
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:54,252
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

450
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:57,415
You're gonna get frostbite!
- I don't even know.

451
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,219
Yeah. Hey!

452
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,060
La Push, baby. You in?
- Should I know what that means?

453
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,657
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

454
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:10,932
Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.
- And I don't just surf the Internet.

455
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:13,269
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

456
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,706
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.

457
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:18,836
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

458
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:21,304
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?

459
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,940
Seriously, dude. It's creepy, man.

460
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,279
What? That's what it's called.
- So...

461
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:25,952
Edible art?

462
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,553
Bella.

463
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,090
Thanks.

464
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,960
You know, your mood swings
are kind of giving me whiplash.

465
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,124
I only said it'd be better
if we weren't friends,

466
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,634
not that I didn't wanna be.

467
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:43,533
What does that mean?

468
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:47,472
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

469
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,639
Okay, well, let's say for argument's sake
that I'm not smart.

470
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,909
Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

471
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:58,382
I'd rather hear your theories.

472
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,611
I have considered

473
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:05,690
radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.

474
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:09,827
That's all superhero stuff, right?

475
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:13,298
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?

476
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,558
You're not.

477
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,371
I can see what you're trying to put off,

478
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:20,737
but I can see that it's just
to keep people away from you.

479
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,366
It's a mask.

480
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,077
Why don't we just hang out?

481
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,016
Everybody's going to the beach.

482
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:35,487
Come.

483
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,148
I mean, have fun.

484
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:45,022
Which beach?
- La Push.

485
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,664
I don't know.

486
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:49,066
I just...

487
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:52,438
Is there something wrong with that beach?

488
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,068
It's just a little crowded.

489
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:05,511
Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.

490
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:08,413
I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.

491
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:10,320
I'm at least paddling out.
- Yeah.

492
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,915
She's right.
- You guys are babies.

493
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:15,587
So, I keep thinking that Eric's
gonna ask me to the prom,

494
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:18,154
and then he just doesn't.

495
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,769
You should ask him.

496
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,968
Take control.
You're a strong, independent woman.

497
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:29,370
I am?
- Yes.

498
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,109
Hey, will you do me up?
- Yeah.

499
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,943
Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.

500
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:38,609
Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

501
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,085
Hi.
- Hi.

502
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:43,981
What are you, like, stalking me?

503
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:46,151
You're on my rez, remember?

504
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,619
Are you surfing?

505
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,894
Definitely not.
- Thanks.

506
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:53,866
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

507
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:54,992
What date?

508
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:56,900
She invited Edward.

509
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,496
To be polite, that's it.
- I think it's nice she invited him.

510
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:02,098
Nobody ever does.
- Yeah, Because Cullen's a freak.

511
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:04,076
You got that right.

512
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,239
You guys know him?

513
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:08,577
The Cullens don't come here.

514
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:21,423
What did your friends mean about,
you know, "The Cullens don't come here?"

515
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,520
You caught that, huh?

516
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:28,097
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

517
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:30,995
Hey, I can keep a secret.

518
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,009
Really, it's just like an old scary story.

519
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,504
Well, I want to know.

520
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,650
Okay, did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?

521
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,955
What? Like, wolves?

522
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,993
Yeah.
- Like, real wolves?

523
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:56,427
<i>Well, that's the legend of our tribe.</i>

524
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,654
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:33:57,654 --> 00:34:00,495
So what's the story about the Cullens?

526
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:06,498
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like, enemy clan.

527
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:13,804
<i>My great grandfather, the chief,
found them hunting on our land.</i>

528
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,806
But they claimed to be something different,

529
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,148
<i>so we made a treaty with them.</i>

530
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:22,247
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands,

531
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:26,453
then we wouldn't expose
what they really were to the palefaces.

532
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,352
I thought they just moved here.

533
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:32,832
Or just moved back.

534
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,862
Right.

535
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:38,232
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

536
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:42,573
Well, what are they really?

537
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:44,736
It's just a story, Bella.

538
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:47,610
Come on, let's go.

539
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:53,409
A snake! A snake!

540
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:03,622
<i>My mama said I didn't know
how to make a kitty meow</i>

541
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:12,135
Hello?

542
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:20,341
Gerald?

543
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:22,877
Gerald?

544
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,597
Hello.

545
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:45,995
Nice jacket.

546
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:50,202
Who are you?

547
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:53,178
It's always the same inane questions.

548
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:54,441
"Who are you?"

549
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:56,278
"What do you want?"

550
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,876
"Why are you doing this?"

551
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:02,615
James, let's not play with our food.

552
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,631
He's not here.

553
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:59,108
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

554
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,375
What, do they just ditch?

555
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:06,147
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out
for, like, hiking and camping and stuff.

556
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,415
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.

557
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:11,287
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.

558
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:15,055
I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.

559
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:17,596
Are you sure you have to go out of town?

560
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,224
Oh, yeah, it's a little family thing.

561
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:21,665
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles

562
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:24,670
before all the good dresses get cleaned out.

563
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:30,375
Port Angeles? You mind if I come?

564
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,776
Yeah, I need your opinion.

565
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:36,040
I like this one.
- That's cool.

566
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,448
But, like, I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

567
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:39,986
I like this one.
- Yeah, I like the beading,

568
00:37:39,986 --> 00:37:42,351
and you wouldn't need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

569
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,322
Is that good? Is that my color?
- I like it.

570
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,382
I liked that dusty rose one, too.

571
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:49,429
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.

572
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:50,656
Hey.
- Right?

573
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:51,925
Nice.

574
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,262
Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.

575
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,298
That's disgusting.

576
00:37:57,538 --> 00:37:59,369
Bella, what do you think?

577
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:00,667
Yes?

578
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:02,871
That looks great.

579
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:05,912
You said that about, like,
the last five dresses, though.

580
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,209
I thought they were all pretty good.

581
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:10,807
You're not really into this, are you?

582
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:14,183
I actually really just want
to go to this bookstore.

583
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:16,045
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?

584
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,853
Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a minute.

585
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:20,484
Okay.
- Okay.

586
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:24,188
She's right, though. This looks awesome.

587
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,128
There you go.

588
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:32,901
Have a good night.
- Thank you.

589
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:08,771
Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?

590
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:10,002
There she is.

591
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:11,942
What's up?
- It's my girl.

592
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,673
How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.

593
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:16,614
What's up, girl? Hey... Where you going?

594
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:18,742
Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.

595
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:20,150
Yeah, you should hang out with us.
- Come on.

596
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,551
It's fun.

597
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,021
What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.

598
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:24,489
You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.

599
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,458
Cute.
- Really, no. Seriously, you should.

600
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,084
Don't touch me.

601
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,595
Get in the car.

602
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,901
That was a very dangerous maneuver.

603
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,329
I should go back there
and rip those guys' heads off.

604
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:12,429
No, you shouldn't.

605
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:15,373
You don't know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.

606
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:16,875
And you do?

607
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:19,636
It's not hard to guess.

608
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:25,183
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me so I won't turn around.

609
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,785
You should put your seatbelt on.

610
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:32,523
You should put your seatbelt on.

611
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:40,124
I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys, I'm sorry. I just...

612
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,724
Where were you? We left you messages.

613
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:45,238
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like,
starving, so we...

614
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,773
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

615
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:52,175
We just sort of ran into each other
and got talking.

616
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:54,841
Yeah.
- No.

617
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:58,646
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

618
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:00,611
Yeah, we were...

619
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:03,554
We were, yeah, we were just leaving. So...
- Let's get this...

620
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:05,557
Bella, if you wanna...

621
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:09,020
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.

622
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,620
If you'd like.

623
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,292
I'll drive you home myself.

624
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,733
That's so thoughtful.

625
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,271
It's really thoughtful. Yeah.

626
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,067
Yeah. I should eat something.

627
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:23,439
Yeah.

628
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:26,802
Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.

629
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:28,711
See ya.
- Okay.

630
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:41,993
All right, one mushroom ravioli.

631
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,229
Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

632
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,464
So are you sure there isn't anything
I can get for you?

633
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,435
No. No, thank you.

634
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:52,899
Let me know.

635
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:00,973
You're really not gonna eat?

636
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,778
No, I'm on a special diet.

637
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,420
You gotta give me some answers.

638
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:13,058
Yes, no.

639
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:16,227
To get to the other side.

640
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,764
1.77245...

641
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:21,164
I don't want to know
what the square root of pi is.

642
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,929
You knew that?

643
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:25,130
How did you know where I was?

644
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,467
I didn't.

645
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:29,569
All right.
- What?

646
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:31,304
Don't leave. I...

647
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,275
Did you follow me?

648
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,249
I...

649
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:44,757
I feel very protective of you.

650
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:48,958
So you followed me.

651
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:52,021
I was trying to keep a distance
unless you needed my help,

652
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:56,330
and then I heard what those low-lifes
were thinking.

653
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,734
Wait.

654
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,306
You say you heard what they were thinking?

655
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:06,040
So what, you...

656
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:08,910
You read minds?

657
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:15,448
I can read every mind in this room.

658
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:18,387
Apart from yours.

659
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,956
There's money, sex,

660
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:26,899
money,

661
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,091
sex,

662
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:30,431
cat.

663
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:36,239
And then you, nothing.

664
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,204
It's very frustrating.

665
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:45,082
Is there something wrong with me?

666
00:43:46,486 --> 00:43:48,681
See, I tell you I can read minds,

667
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,815
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

668
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:00,958
What is it?

669
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:08,304
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

670
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,277
Then don't.

671
00:44:32,065 --> 00:44:34,659
Okay, I think I'm warm enough now.

672
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:43,132
Your hand is so cold.

673
00:44:54,054 --> 00:44:55,078
Whoa!

674
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:57,020
What is going on?

675
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,526
My dad's still here.

676
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,584
Can you pull in?

677
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:07,433
That's my father's car on the end.

678
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,892
What is he doing here?

679
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,800
Carlisle, what's going on?

680
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:19,777
Waylon Forge was found in a boat
out near his place.

681
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,208
I just examined the body.
- He died?

682
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:27,016
How?
- Animal attack.

683
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:32,619
Was it the same one that
got that security guard down in Mason?

684
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,954
Most likely.

685
00:45:33,954 --> 00:45:37,861
Well, it's getting closer to town, then.
- Bella, you should go inside.

686
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,422
Waylon was your father's friend.

687
00:45:40,422 --> 00:45:41,694
Okay.

688
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:47,237
I'll see you later.

689
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:01,150
Hey.
- Hey.

690
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,925
Dad, I'm really sorry.

691
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:14,058
I've known him going on 30 years.

692
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,982
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.

693
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,652
Meantime,

694
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:38,356
I want you to carry this with you.

695
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:44,958
I don't know if you...
- It'll give your old man some peace of mind.

696
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,293
Okay.

697
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:51,230
Let's go home.

698
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,215
Cold One.

699
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:48,243
You're impossibly fast and strong.

700
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:52,483
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.

701
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,387
Your eyes change color.

702
00:49:56,322 --> 00:50:00,622
And sometimes you speak
like you're from a different time.

703
00:50:02,262 --> 00:50:06,392
You never eat or drink anything.
You don't go out in the sunlight.

704
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,264
How old are you?

705
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,129
Seventeen.

706
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:18,503
How long have you been 17?

707
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:23,380
A while.

708
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:38,294
I know what you are.

709
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,200
Say it.

710
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:47,104
Out loud.

711
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,340
Say it.

712
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:58,580
Vampire.

713
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,613
Are you afraid?

714
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:12,889
No.

715
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:18,470
Then ask me the most basic question.

716
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,233
What do we eat?

717
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:24,973
You won't hurt me.

718
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,747
Where are we going?

719
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:34,112
Up the mountain.

720
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:36,155
Out of the cloud bank.

721
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:39,385
You need to see what
I look like in the sunlight.

722
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:01,071
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

723
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,615
People would know we're different.

724
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:15,556
This is what I am.

725
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,934
It's like diamonds.

726
00:52:31,511 --> 00:52:33,206
You're beautiful.

727
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:37,940
Beautiful?

728
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,645
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.

729
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,684
I'm a killer.

730
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:52,697
I don't believe that.

731
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,960
That's because you believe the lie.

732
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:58,196
It's camouflage.

733
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:03,373
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

734
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:07,340
Everything about me invites you in,

735
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:11,247
my voice, my face, even my smell.

736
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,843
As if I would need any of that.

737
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:19,718
As if you could outrun me!

738
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:27,729
As if you could fight me off.

739
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,070
I'm designed to kill.

740
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:37,669
I don't care.

741
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:40,638
I've killed people before.

742
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:44,212
It does not matter.

743
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:50,753
I wanted to kill you.

744
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:58,664
I've never wanted a human's blood
so much in my life.

745
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:01,456
I trust you.

746
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,267
Don't.

747
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,540
I'm here. I trust you.

748
00:54:13,112 --> 00:54:16,343
My family,
we're different from others of our kind.

749
00:54:16,343 --> 00:54:18,178
We only hunt animals.

750
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:20,879
We've learned to control our thirst.

751
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:24,317
But it's you, your scent,

752
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:29,056
it's like a drug to me.

753
00:54:30,463 --> 00:54:34,297
You're like
my own personal brand of heroin.

754
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,503
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

755
00:54:44,503 --> 00:54:46,044
I did.

756
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:49,075
Only for making me want you so badly.

757
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:52,651
I still don't know if I can control myself.

758
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,281
I know you can.

759
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:06,756
I can't read your mind.

760
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:10,402
You have to tell me what you're thinking.

761
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,567
Now I'm afraid.

762
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:20,910
Good.

763
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:23,982
I'm not afraid of you.

764
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,816
I'm only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.

765
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:41,923
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

766
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:52,975
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.

767
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:58,413
What a stupid lamb.

768
00:55:58,413 --> 00:56:01,078
What a sick, masochistic lion.

769
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,766
<i>About three things
I was absolutely positive.</i>

770
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,303
<i>First,</i>

771
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:35,443
<i>Edward was a vampire.</i>

772
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:41,281
<i>Second,</i>

773
00:57:42,088 --> 00:57:44,022
<i>there was a part of him,</i>

774
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,217
<i>and I didn't know
how dominant that part might be,</i>

775
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,922
<i>that thirsted for my blood.</i>

776
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:55,356
<i>And third,</i>

777
00:57:56,435 --> 00:58:00,235
<i>I was unconditionally and irrevocably
in love with him.</i>

778
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:08,972
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

779
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:13,747
Gambling, tuxedos, and Bond, James Bond.

780
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,658
Oh, my God.

781
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:29,727
Wow.

782
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:34,236
You know, everybody's staring.

783
00:58:38,177 --> 00:58:41,544
Not that guy. No, he just looked.

784
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:46,781
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway.

785
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:48,979
Since I'm going to hell.

786
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:56,190
So, does a person have to be dying

787
00:58:58,764 --> 00:59:00,664
to become like you?

788
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:04,202
No, that's just Carlisle.

789
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:09,229
He'd never do this to someone
who had another choice.

790
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,506
So, how long have you been like this?

791
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:16,004
Since 1918.

792
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,580
<i>That's when Carlisle found me
dying of Spanish influenza.</i>

793
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:23,881
<i>What was it like?</i>

794
00:59:25,057 --> 00:59:27,423
<i>The venom was excruciating.</i>

795
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,288
<i>But what Carlisle did was much harder.</i>

796
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:32,830
<i>Not many of us have the restraint to do that.</i>

797
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,560
But didn't he just have to bite?

798
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:39,270
Not exactly.

799
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,602
When we taste

800
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:47,178
human blood, a sort of frenzy begins,

801
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:51,172
and it's almost impossible to stop.

802
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,114
<i>But Carlisle did.</i>

803
00:59:55,114 --> 00:59:58,020
<i>First with me
and then with his wife, Esme.</i>

804
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:02,618
So is Carlisle the real reason
that you don't kill people?

805
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:08,562
No, he's not the only reason.

806
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:13,799
I don't want to be a monster.

807
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,571
My family,
we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right,

808
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:22,978
Because we only survive
on the blood of animals.

809
01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:24,515
But it's...

810
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:28,047
It's like a human only living on tofu.

811
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:32,648
It keeps you strong,
but you're never fully satisfied.

812
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:39,197
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood,
for instance.

813
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:47,663
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?

814
01:00:47,663 --> 01:00:49,002
Yeah.

815
01:00:49,002 --> 01:00:53,340
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.

816
01:00:55,314 --> 01:00:59,250
Can the rest of your family
read people's minds like you can?

817
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:04,186
No. That's just me.

818
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,790
But Alice can see the future.

819
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:10,818
I bet she saw me coming.

820
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:14,598
Alice's visions are subjective.

821
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:17,832
I mean, the future can always change.

822
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,010
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.

823
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,950
I'm gonna take you to my place tomorrow.

824
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:36,820
Thanks.

825
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:40,224
Wait, like, with your family?
- Yeah.

826
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:43,688
What if they don't like me?

827
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:48,158
So, you're worried not because
you'll be in a house full of vampires,

828
01:01:48,158 --> 01:01:51,361
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

829
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,570
I'm glad I amuse you.

830
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,698
What is it?

831
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,602
Complication.

832
01:02:01,647 --> 01:02:03,740
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

833
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:32,410
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

834
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:36,013
Looks good. Got that dent out.

835
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:38,709
Yeah.
- Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.

836
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,014
First Mariners game of the season.

837
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:44,817
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about
seeing you again.

838
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,824
Great, Dad. Thanks.

839
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:49,087
Just keeping it real, son.

840
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,225
Vitamin R.

841
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:54,026
Well done, Chief.

842
01:02:54,026 --> 01:02:56,499
Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

843
01:02:56,499 --> 01:02:58,058
Good man.

844
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:02,236
Any luck with that Waylon case?

845
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,105
Well, I don't think it was an animal
that killed him.

846
01:03:05,105 --> 01:03:07,236
Never thought it was.

847
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,476
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?

848
01:03:10,476 --> 01:03:12,107
Keep the kids out of the woods.

849
01:03:12,107 --> 01:03:13,481
Will do.

850
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:17,255
Don't want no one else getting hurt, do we?

851
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,149
Whoa.

852
01:03:51,256 --> 01:03:53,019
This is incredible.

853
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,790
It's so light and open, you know?

854
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:04,425
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?

855
01:04:04,937 --> 01:04:07,337
No, not the moats.

856
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,967
Not the moats.

857
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:19,651
This is the one place we don't have to hide.

858
01:04:22,187 --> 01:04:24,018
I told them not to do this.

859
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:27,752
<i>You add a little bit of olive oil
to a non-stick saut pan,</i>

860
01:04:27,752 --> 01:04:31,227
<i>and you want to cook
with the olive oil in medium-high heat.</i>

861
01:04:31,227 --> 01:04:35,062
<i>What I do, I cut this in strips,
and then we gonna cut this...</i>

862
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:38,262
Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.

863
01:04:38,262 --> 01:04:41,306
I'm sure she'll love it, no matter what.

864
01:04:41,306 --> 01:04:43,170
Get a whiff of that.

865
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,869
Here comes the human.

866
01:04:49,748 --> 01:04:52,376
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.

867
01:04:53,552 --> 01:04:57,989
Bella, this is Esme.
My mother for all intents and purposes.

868
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,990
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time.

869
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,221
I hope you're hungry.

870
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:06,924
Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.

871
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:14,669
Perfect.

872
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,233
Yeah, it's just because
I know that you guys don't eat...

873
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:21,802
Of course. It's very considerate of you.

874
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:24,440
Just ignore Rosalie. I do.
- Yeah.

875
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,679
Let's just keep pretending
like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

876
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,314
I would never tell anybody anything.

877
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,753
She knows that.

878
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:36,919
Yeah, well, the problem is,
you two have gone public now, so...

879
01:05:36,919 --> 01:05:37,984
Emmett.

880
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:39,758
No, she should know.

881
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:43,528
The entire family
will be implicated if this ends badly.

882
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:45,731
Badly, as in...

883
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,705
I would become the meal.

884
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:58,481
Hi, Bella.

885
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,777
I'm Alice.

886
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:06,020
Hi.
- Hi.

887
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,793
You do smell good.

888
01:06:09,793 --> 01:06:11,021
Alice, what are you...

889
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:14,554
It's okay.
Bella and I are gonna be great friends.

890
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,371
Sorry,
Jasper's our newest vegetarian.

891
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:22,532
It's a little difficult for him.

892
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,508
It's a pleasure to meet you.

893
01:06:24,508 --> 01:06:27,374
It's okay, Jasper. You won't hurt her.

894
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:32,476
All right, I'm gonna take you
on a tour of the rest of the house.

895
01:06:32,476 --> 01:06:34,849
Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.

896
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:36,148
Okay.

897
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,681
Cute!
- I know.

898
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:41,487
I think that went well.

899
01:06:41,487 --> 01:06:43,960
Clean this up. Now.

900
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,157
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?

901
01:06:47,157 --> 01:06:49,029
I don't know.

902
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:56,367
Graduation caps?

903
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:00,375
Yeah. It's a private joke.

904
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,214
We matriculate a lot.

905
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,650
That's kind of miserable.

906
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,585
I mean, repeating high school
over and over.

907
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:11,748
True, but the younger we start out
in a new place,

908
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:13,950
the longer we can stay there.

909
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,550
Come on.

910
01:07:25,804 --> 01:07:27,704
Yeah, this is my room.

911
01:07:40,552 --> 01:07:41,917
No bed?

912
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:44,045
No, I don't...

913
01:07:44,823 --> 01:07:46,381
I don't sleep.

914
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:49,557
Ever?
- No, not at all.

915
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:54,061
Okay.

916
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:04,772
Boy, you have so much music.

917
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:07,739
What are you listening to?

918
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:12,740
It's Debussy.

919
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,120
I don't know...
- Yeah.

920
01:08:20,926 --> 01:08:23,224
<i>Claire De Lune is great.</i>

921
01:08:57,863 --> 01:09:00,559
What?
- I can't dance.

922
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:12,171
Well, I could always make you.

923
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,447
I'm not scared of you.

924
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:22,786
Well, you really shouldn't have said that.

925
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:30,026
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

926
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,862
Do you trust me?

927
01:09:37,402 --> 01:09:38,960
In theory.

928
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,505
Then close your eyes.

929
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:07,293
What?

930
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,294
This isn't real.

931
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:13,530
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

932
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,368
It does in my world.

933
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:46,787
Hold up.

934
01:11:52,037 --> 01:11:53,527
It's human.

935
01:11:57,576 --> 01:12:00,477
Arizona. Yo, what's happening?

936
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,037
So you and Cullen, huh?

937
01:12:03,037 --> 01:12:05,582
That's... I don't like it.

938
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:08,045
I mean, I don't know,

939
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:11,384
he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.

940
01:12:13,992 --> 01:12:16,517
Here's your veggie plate, Stephenie.

941
01:12:17,028 --> 01:12:19,622
Hey, sorry I'm late. Biology project.

942
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:23,632
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope that's okay.

943
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:25,727
You should order one for yourself next time.

944
01:12:25,727 --> 01:12:27,829
Cut back on the steak.

945
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:30,471
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

946
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,968
Say, Chief, boys want to know,

947
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:38,748
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

948
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:43,887
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint,

949
01:12:43,887 --> 01:12:46,321
but it looks like whoever that is,
is headed east,

950
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:49,155
so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take
over from here.

951
01:12:49,155 --> 01:12:50,888
Okay.
- Okay?

952
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:53,328
I just hope they catch him fast.

953
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:05,474
Looks like your friends are flagging you.

954
01:13:07,278 --> 01:13:09,007
It's okay if you wanna go join them.

955
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:11,742
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.

956
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:13,181
Me, too.

957
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,742
Bella, it's Friday night. Go out.

958
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,223
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

959
01:13:19,223 --> 01:13:21,349
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

960
01:13:22,227 --> 01:13:24,525
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?

961
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,621
Anybody interest you?

962
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,397
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?

963
01:13:31,736 --> 01:13:33,397
Yeah, I guess not.

964
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:37,575
I just feel like I leave you alone too much.

965
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:40,037
You should be around people.

966
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:43,645
I don't really mind being alone.

967
01:13:44,249 --> 01:13:47,309
I guess I'm kind of like my dad in that way.

968
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:54,452
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

969
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:57,091
Phil's working so hard.

970
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:59,630
You know, spring training.

971
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,667
We're looking for a house to rent
in case things become more permanent.

972
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,065
<i>You'd like Jacksonville, baby.</i>

973
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,261
Yeah?

974
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:07,672
I'm really liking Forks.

975
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:08,933
What?

976
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:12,506
Forks is growing on me.

977
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:15,444
Could a guy have anything to do with that?

978
01:14:15,444 --> 01:14:17,640
Well, yeah.

979
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:21,750
I knew it. Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

980
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,118
<i>I bet he's smart. Is he smart?</i>

981
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:28,489
Mom, can I talk to you later?

982
01:14:28,489 --> 01:14:31,688
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

983
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:39,265
How did you get in here?

984
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:40,861
The window.

985
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:43,204
Do you do that a lot?

986
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,871
Well, just the past couple of months.

987
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,943
I like watching you sleep.

988
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:58,078
It's kind of fascinating to me.

989
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,958
I always want to try one thing.

990
01:15:06,231 --> 01:15:08,062
Just stay very still.

991
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:16,663
Don't move.

992
01:16:00,618 --> 01:16:02,279
Stop it!

993
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,146
I'm sorry.

994
01:16:08,993 --> 01:16:11,154
I'm stronger than I thought.

995
01:16:11,763 --> 01:16:14,254
Yeah. I wish I could say the same.

996
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,630
I can't ever lose control with you.

997
01:16:27,946 --> 01:16:29,607
Hey, don't go.

998
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,956
Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.

999
01:17:19,956 --> 01:17:22,499
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

1000
01:17:24,736 --> 01:17:27,261
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

1001
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:28,831
No.

1002
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,670
He's a junior. I'm a junior.

1003
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,776
I thought you liked the Cullens.

1004
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:37,775
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

1005
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:40,079
Edward doesn't live in town.

1006
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:42,242
Technically.

1007
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:46,786
He's right outside.

1008
01:17:47,191 --> 01:17:48,624
He is?

1009
01:17:48,624 --> 01:17:51,662
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.

1010
01:17:53,932 --> 01:17:56,196
All right. Bring him in.

1011
01:17:58,236 --> 01:17:59,931
Could you be nice?

1012
01:18:01,072 --> 01:18:02,733
He's important.

1013
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:15,843
Chief Swan.

1014
01:18:15,843 --> 01:18:19,287
I want to formally introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

1015
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:20,824
Hi, Edward.

1016
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:22,955
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

1017
01:18:22,955 --> 01:18:25,393
She's just gonna play baseball
with my family.

1018
01:18:25,393 --> 01:18:26,452
Baseball?

1019
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,431
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

1020
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:30,694
Bella's gonna play baseball.

1021
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,531
Well, good luck with that.

1022
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:36,402
I'll take good care of her. I promise.

1023
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:40,775
Hey.

1024
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:43,713
Still got that pepper spray?

1025
01:18:43,713 --> 01:18:45,214
Yeah, Dad.

1026
01:18:50,455 --> 01:18:53,185
And since when do vampires like baseball?

1027
01:18:53,185 --> 01:18:55,987
Well, it's the American pastime,

1028
01:18:55,987 --> 01:18:58,620
and there's a thunderstorm coming.

1029
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,290
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.

1030
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:15,703
Hey.

1031
01:19:15,703 --> 01:19:17,771
Glad you're here. We need an umpire.

1032
01:19:17,771 --> 01:19:19,373
She thinks we cheat.

1033
01:19:19,373 --> 01:19:21,111
I know you cheat.

1034
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,855
Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.

1035
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,924
It's time.

1036
01:19:45,143 --> 01:19:48,112
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.

1037
01:19:52,617 --> 01:19:55,313
That's gotta be a home run, right?

1038
01:19:55,313 --> 01:19:57,251
Edward's very fast.

1039
01:19:58,056 --> 01:20:01,992
<i> Ooh, baby,
don't you know I suffer?</i>

1040
01:20:01,992 --> 01:20:05,496
<i>Ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you</i>

1041
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:07,360
Come home, Rosalie!

1042
01:20:10,334 --> 01:20:12,131
You're out.
- Out!

1043
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:15,670
Babe, come on. It's just a game.

1044
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:21,442
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1045
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,979
Nice kitty.

1046
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:23,729
<i>Ooh</i>

1047
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:29,514
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1048
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:30,264
<i>Ooh</i>

1049
01:20:34,358 --> 01:20:37,452
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1050
01:20:37,452 --> 01:20:38,202
<i>Ooh</i>

1051
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,565
<i>You set my soul alight</i>

1052
01:20:43,565 --> 01:20:45,795
What are you doing?

1053
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:51,497
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1054
01:20:51,497 --> 01:20:55,535
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1055
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:59,447
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1056
01:20:59,447 --> 01:21:03,248
<i>Super massive black hole</i>

1057
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:04,948
My monkey man.

1058
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:20,835
Stop!

1059
01:21:37,121 --> 01:21:39,851
They were leaving. Then they heard us.

1060
01:21:39,851 --> 01:21:42,017
Let's go.
- It's too late.

1061
01:21:43,427 --> 01:21:45,224
Get your hair down.

1062
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:50,059
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.

1063
01:21:56,107 --> 01:21:58,075
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

1064
01:21:58,075 --> 01:22:01,908
What? What are you...
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.

1065
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,658
I believe this belongs to you.

1066
01:22:28,673 --> 01:22:29,731
Thank you.

1067
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:31,399
I am Laurent.

1068
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:33,801
And this is Victoria

1069
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,873
and James.

1070
01:22:37,715 --> 01:22:40,206
I'm Carlisle. This is my family.

1071
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:43,315
Hello.

1072
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:47,221
I'm afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us.

1073
01:22:47,221 --> 01:22:49,122
Our apologies.

1074
01:22:49,122 --> 01:22:51,889
We didn't realize the territory
had been claimed.

1075
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:55,455
Yes, well, we maintain
a permanent residence nearby.

1076
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,496
Really?

1077
01:23:00,504 --> 01:23:03,598
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.

1078
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:06,476
We were just passing through.

1079
01:23:06,476 --> 01:23:09,377
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

1080
01:23:09,377 --> 01:23:11,244
You should be safe.

1081
01:23:11,782 --> 01:23:13,409
Excellent.

1082
01:23:14,118 --> 01:23:15,312
So,

1083
01:23:15,786 --> 01:23:18,254
could you use three more players?

1084
01:23:20,024 --> 01:23:22,254
Come on. Just one game.

1085
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:25,094
Sure. Why not?

1086
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:27,630
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

1087
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,359
We'll bat first.

1088
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:32,599
I'm the one with the wicked curveball.

1089
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:35,104
Well, I think we can handle that.

1090
01:23:36,574 --> 01:23:38,064
We shall see.

1091
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:00,264
You brought a snack.

1092
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:04,064
A human?

1093
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:09,269
The girl is with us.

1094
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:11,672
I think it best if you leave.

1095
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:17,304
I can see the game is over.

1096
01:24:17,304 --> 01:24:18,905
We'll go now.

1097
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:23,552
James.

1098
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,827
Get Bella out of here.

1099
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:39,164
Go.

1100
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,440
Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I'm all right!

1101
01:24:54,085 --> 01:24:56,553
What, now he's coming after me?

1102
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:09,230
Listen to me. James is a tracker.
The hunt is his obsession.

1103
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,201
I read his mind.
My reaction on the field set him off.

1104
01:25:12,201 --> 01:25:15,602
I just made this his most exciting game ever.

1105
01:25:15,602 --> 01:25:17,231
He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?

1106
01:25:17,231 --> 01:25:21,074
We have to kill him.
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.

1107
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,840
Where we going?
- Away from Forks.

1108
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,814
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
- I have to go home. Now.

1109
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:29,284
You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.

1110
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:32,288
He's just gonna trace your scent there.
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1111
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,415
But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter!

1112
01:25:34,415 --> 01:25:37,757
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!

1113
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:40,594
Just let me get you out of here first,
all right?

1114
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:43,394
It's my dad! We have to go back!

1115
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,230
We'll figure a way
to lead the tracker away somehow.

1116
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:48,169
I don't know. But we have to do something.

1117
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:55,839
Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella, don't do this, please.

1118
01:25:55,839 --> 01:25:57,471
It's over! Get out!

1119
01:25:57,471 --> 01:25:59,072
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1120
01:25:59,072 --> 01:26:01,209
Bella? What's going on?

1121
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:05,013
I just gotta get out of here. I'm leaving now.

1122
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:08,151
Hey.

1123
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:12,493
Bella?

1124
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,421
What am I gonna say to him?

1125
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,194
I can't hurt him.

1126
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:20,502
Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.

1127
01:26:21,172 --> 01:26:23,197
I'll be down at the truck.

1128
01:26:28,512 --> 01:26:30,275
Did he hurt you?

1129
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,179
No.

1130
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:36,615
Break up with you or something?

1131
01:26:36,615 --> 01:26:38,746
No, I broke up with him.

1132
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:43,285
I thought you liked him.

1133
01:26:45,696 --> 01:26:47,596
Yeah, that's why I have to leave.

1134
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:50,361
I don't want this. I have to go home.

1135
01:26:52,169 --> 01:26:53,602
Home? Your...

1136
01:26:53,602 --> 01:26:56,105
Your mom's not even in Phoenix.

1137
01:26:56,105 --> 01:26:57,834
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1138
01:26:57,834 --> 01:27:00,206
You're not gonna drive home right now.

1139
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:03,576
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,

1140
01:27:03,576 --> 01:27:06,275
I'll take you to the airport.
- No. I want to drive.

1141
01:27:06,275 --> 01:27:08,215
It'll give me more time to think.

1142
01:27:08,215 --> 01:27:11,118
I mean, if I get really tired,
I'll pull into a motel. I promise.

1143
01:27:11,118 --> 01:27:14,157
Look, Bella, I know I'm not
that much fun to be around,

1144
01:27:14,157 --> 01:27:18,525
but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.

1145
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:23,130
Like what?

1146
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:25,930
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?

1147
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:28,767
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?

1148
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:31,239
Dad, that's you. That's not me.

1149
01:27:34,678 --> 01:27:36,407
Bella, come on, I just...

1150
01:27:36,407 --> 01:27:38,778
I just got you back.

1151
01:27:41,452 --> 01:27:43,613
Yeah, and, you know, if I don't get out now,

1152
01:27:43,613 --> 01:27:46,781
then I'm just gonna be stuck here like Mom.

1153
01:28:11,081 --> 01:28:13,447
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1154
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:17,150
Why don't you let me drive?

1155
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:24,259
He won't.

1156
01:28:25,362 --> 01:28:27,523
You should've seen his face.

1157
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,096
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him

1158
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:32,795
when she was leaving him.

1159
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:35,464
It's the only way he'd let you go.

1160
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:42,577
Just don't worry about him now.
He's safe. The tracker's following us.

1161
01:28:45,349 --> 01:28:47,544
Oh, God.
- It's just Emmett.

1162
01:28:49,687 --> 01:28:52,019
Alice is in the car behind us.

1163
01:29:13,677 --> 01:29:14,905
Wait.

1164
01:29:15,913 --> 01:29:18,381
He came to warn us about James.

1165
01:29:18,749 --> 01:29:22,742
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,

1166
01:29:22,742 --> 01:29:25,755
but he's got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1167
01:29:25,755 --> 01:29:28,815
I've never seen anything like him
in my 300 years.

1168
01:29:28,815 --> 01:29:32,760
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1169
01:29:37,735 --> 01:29:38,929
I've had to fight our kind before.

1170
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:42,029
They're not easy to kill.
- But not impossible.

1171
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:44,532
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.

1172
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:46,508
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1173
01:29:46,508 --> 01:29:49,102
even a sadistic one like James.

1174
01:29:49,102 --> 01:29:52,478
What if he kills one of us first?
- I'm gonna run Bella south.

1175
01:29:52,478 --> 01:29:53,709
Can you lead the tracker away from here?

1176
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:55,718
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.

1177
01:29:55,718 --> 01:29:57,811
He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.

1178
01:29:57,811 --> 01:29:59,981
Jasper and I will drive her south.

1179
01:29:59,981 --> 01:30:01,388
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1180
01:30:01,388 --> 01:30:04,586
Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.

1181
01:30:08,365 --> 01:30:10,299
Rosalie, Esme,

1182
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:15,396
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1183
01:30:17,675 --> 01:30:20,041
Why? What is she to me?

1184
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:22,977
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.

1185
01:30:22,977 --> 01:30:25,413
She's part of this family now,

1186
01:30:26,784 --> 01:30:29,082
and we protect our family.

1187
01:30:46,437 --> 01:30:48,564
Oh, God. If anything...

1188
01:30:48,564 --> 01:30:49,867
What if...

1189
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:51,737
If anything happens, I swear to God...

1190
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:53,777
Nothing's gonna happen.

1191
01:30:53,777 --> 01:30:56,540
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1192
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:00,276
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1193
01:31:00,276 --> 01:31:01,510
Yeah.

1194
01:31:02,252 --> 01:31:04,379
Bella, you are my life now.

1195
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:23,836
Hey, Mom. It's me again.

1196
01:31:23,836 --> 01:31:25,841
You must have let your phone die
or something.

1197
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:30,073
I'm not in Forks, but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1198
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:39,378
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1199
01:31:41,558 --> 01:31:43,355
That's good.

1200
01:32:30,107 --> 01:32:32,268
What is it? What do you see?

1201
01:32:44,354 --> 01:32:45,912
He's figured it out.

1202
01:32:45,912 --> 01:32:48,787
The tracker, he just changed course.

1203
01:32:50,594 --> 01:32:52,255
Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.

1204
01:32:52,255 --> 01:32:54,320
A room full of mirrors.

1205
01:32:58,602 --> 01:33:01,696
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1206
01:33:01,696 --> 01:33:04,070
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1207
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:06,234
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1208
01:33:06,234 --> 01:33:08,540
Okay, so the course that
the tracker's on now

1209
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,206
is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?

1210
01:33:12,015 --> 01:33:15,007
You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.

1211
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:17,684
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1212
01:33:17,684 --> 01:33:18,982
Was your school here in Phoenix?

1213
01:33:18,982 --> 01:33:20,318
Yeah.

1214
01:33:22,059 --> 01:33:23,959
Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.

1215
01:33:23,959 --> 01:33:25,585
The woman's still in the area.

1216
01:33:25,585 --> 01:33:28,256
Rosalie and Esme are going back
to Forks to protect your father.

1217
01:33:28,256 --> 01:33:34,293
I'm coming to get you. Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1218
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:36,032
<i>And the others will keep hunting.</i>

1219
01:33:36,032 --> 01:33:39,303
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1220
01:33:51,121 --> 01:33:53,385
Hey, Mom, I'm glad you got my message.

1221
01:33:53,385 --> 01:33:54,651
What are you doing home?

1222
01:33:54,651 --> 01:33:57,353
<i>Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?</i>

1223
01:33:58,328 --> 01:34:01,297
<i>Calm down, everything's fine.
- Bella? Bella?</i>

1224
01:34:01,297 --> 01:34:03,799
I'll explain everything later.

1225
01:34:03,799 --> 01:34:04,925
Mom, are you there?

1226
01:34:04,925 --> 01:34:09,063
<i>Forks High School doesn't protect
its students' privacy very well.</i>

1227
01:34:09,063 --> 01:34:13,439
It was just too easy for Victoria
to find your previous address.

1228
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,944
<i>It's a nice house you have here.</i>

1229
01:34:15,944 --> 01:34:18,277
<i>I was prepared to wait for you,</i>

1230
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:22,978
<i>but then Mom came home after she received
a very worried call from your dad,</i>

1231
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:26,121
<i>and it all worked out quite well.</i>

1232
01:34:26,823 --> 01:34:27,949
<i>Wait, wait...</i>

1233
01:34:27,949 --> 01:34:29,322
Don't touch her! Don't...

1234
01:34:29,322 --> 01:34:31,725
<i>You can still save her.
- Don't!</i>

1235
01:34:31,725 --> 01:34:33,990
<i>But you're gonna have to get away
from your friends.</i>

1236
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:37,192
<i>Can you handle that?
- Where should I meet you?</i>

1237
01:34:39,202 --> 01:34:41,693
How about your old ballet studio?

1238
01:34:42,339 --> 01:34:45,240
<i>And I'll know if you bring anyone along.</i>

1239
01:34:47,177 --> 01:34:50,476
<i>Poor Mommy would
pay the price for that mistake.</i>

1240
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:10,696
<i>I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.</i>

1241
01:35:11,268 --> 01:35:15,671
<i>But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.</i>

1242
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:28,344
<i>I can't bring myself to regret the decisions
that brought me face-to-face with death.</i>

1243
01:35:28,344 --> 01:35:30,784
<i>They also brought me to Edward.</i>

1244
01:35:59,683 --> 01:36:02,914
Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?

1245
01:36:02,914 --> 01:36:04,248
Mom?
- Bella?

1246
01:36:04,248 --> 01:36:05,845
Mom?
- There you are.

1247
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:07,389
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

1248
01:36:07,389 --> 01:36:09,516
<i>Everyone makes fun of me.</i>

1249
01:36:10,193 --> 01:36:12,787
<i>Come on, you're a wonderful dancer.</i>

1250
01:36:12,787 --> 01:36:14,922
<i>Mom, I suck.</i>

1251
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:18,028
<i>You do not suck.</i>

1252
01:36:28,045 --> 01:36:30,138
That's my favorite part.

1253
01:36:31,048 --> 01:36:33,846
You were a stubborn child, weren't you?

1254
01:36:35,786 --> 01:36:37,947
She's not even here.
- No.

1255
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:41,588
Sorry.

1256
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:45,085
You know, but you really made it too easy.

1257
01:36:45,085 --> 01:36:48,461
So to make things more entertaining,

1258
01:36:49,066 --> 01:36:52,297
I'm gonna make a little film
of our time together.

1259
01:36:53,904 --> 01:36:57,305
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you don't mind.

1260
01:36:57,305 --> 01:36:58,534
Good.

1261
01:36:58,534 --> 01:36:59,284
And

1262
01:37:01,111 --> 01:37:02,442
action.

1263
01:37:04,848 --> 01:37:06,577
That'll break Edward's little heart.

1264
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:09,016
You have...
Edward has nothing to do with this!

1265
01:37:09,016 --> 01:37:10,747
But he does.

1266
01:37:11,788 --> 01:37:14,450
His rage will make for more interesting sport

1267
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:17,982
than his feeble attempt to protect you.

1268
01:37:19,296 --> 01:37:21,127
And let's continue.

1269
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:39,578
Beautiful. Very visually dynamic.

1270
01:37:42,586 --> 01:37:44,645
I chose my stage well.

1271
01:37:49,826 --> 01:37:53,318
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1272
01:37:53,663 --> 01:37:56,393
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1273
01:37:56,393 --> 01:37:58,400
It's cruel, really.

1274
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:05,438
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1275
01:38:05,438 --> 01:38:07,101
Tell him to avenge you. Tell him!

1276
01:38:07,101 --> 01:38:09,975
No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him! Tell him!

1277
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:26,184
You're alone
Because you're faster than the others.

1278
01:38:28,498 --> 01:38:30,159
But not stronger.

1279
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:34,169
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1280
01:38:40,944 --> 01:38:42,502
I'm sorry.

1281
01:39:46,443 --> 01:39:47,501
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1282
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:50,011
Son. Enough.

1283
01:39:50,814 --> 01:39:52,748
Remember who you are.

1284
01:39:57,621 --> 01:39:58,849
Bella, you're okay.

1285
01:39:58,849 --> 01:40:00,583
Bella needs you.

1286
01:40:00,991 --> 01:40:02,686
It's okay.

1287
01:40:02,686 --> 01:40:04,124
Oh, God.

1288
01:40:07,897 --> 01:40:09,797
Carlisle? Her blood.

1289
01:40:09,797 --> 01:40:11,458
Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.

1290
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:12,796
Carlisle!
- Start the fire.

1291
01:40:12,796 --> 01:40:15,599
Get the floorboards.

1292
01:40:15,805 --> 01:40:17,898
Alice!
- Alice, go.

1293
01:40:27,884 --> 01:40:29,909
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1294
01:40:29,909 --> 01:40:32,216
No, no, my head is burning!

1295
01:40:33,723 --> 01:40:35,452
It's the venom.

1296
01:40:36,326 --> 01:40:40,092
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.

1297
01:40:40,092 --> 01:40:40,842
No.

1298
01:40:42,165 --> 01:40:43,359
No.

1299
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:48,432
It's gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

1300
01:40:48,432 --> 01:40:51,474
She's still hemorrhaging.
Alice, make me a tourniquet. Your belt.

1301
01:40:51,474 --> 01:40:53,839
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1302
01:40:55,111 --> 01:40:57,238
Tie it above my hands.

1303
01:40:57,238 --> 01:40:58,713
Carlisle!

1304
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:01,914
Go.

1305
01:41:06,456 --> 01:41:09,289
We could try to suck the venom out.
- You know I won't be able to stop.

1306
01:41:09,289 --> 01:41:11,554
Then find the will to stop.

1307
01:41:12,495 --> 01:41:13,928
But choose.

1308
01:41:13,928 --> 01:41:16,192
She only has minutes left.

1309
01:41:18,368 --> 01:41:20,893
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.

1310
01:41:23,239 --> 01:41:25,264
I'm gonna make it go away.

1311
01:41:43,626 --> 01:41:47,084
Edward, stop.
Her blood is clean. You're killing her.

1312
01:41:47,831 --> 01:41:49,162
Edward.

1313
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:50,792
Stop.

1314
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:53,161
Stop.

1315
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:56,296
Find the will.

1316
01:42:20,864 --> 01:42:24,061
<i>Death is peaceful, easy.</i>

1317
01:42:31,474 --> 01:42:33,203
<i>Life is harder.</i>

1318
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:40,012
Bella?

1319
01:42:41,985 --> 01:42:43,179
Baby?

1320
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:46,049
Bella.

1321
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:49,324
Mom?
- Hey.

1322
01:42:50,059 --> 01:42:51,583
Where is he?

1323
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:53,128
Where's...

1324
01:42:53,596 --> 01:42:55,086
Where's Edward?

1325
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,689
He's asleep.

1326
01:42:57,867 --> 01:42:59,129
He never leaves.

1327
01:42:59,129 --> 01:43:02,228
And your dad, he's down at the cafeteria.

1328
01:43:02,739 --> 01:43:04,366
What happened?

1329
01:43:04,941 --> 01:43:07,808
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg,

1330
01:43:08,812 --> 01:43:11,337
and you lost a lot of blood.

1331
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:14,178
You don't remember any of this, do you?

1332
01:43:15,752 --> 01:43:17,447
Edward came down with his dad

1333
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:19,954
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.

1334
01:43:19,954 --> 01:43:23,390
So you went over to their hotel,
then you tripped,

1335
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:26,224
and you fell down two flights of stairs.

1336
01:43:26,896 --> 01:43:28,864
Went through a window.

1337
01:43:35,004 --> 01:43:36,869
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1338
01:43:36,869 --> 01:43:39,067
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1339
01:43:43,012 --> 01:43:44,502
It's Phil.

1340
01:43:45,014 --> 01:43:47,073
He's so worried about you.

1341
01:43:48,485 --> 01:43:49,884
You're texting.

1342
01:43:49,884 --> 01:43:51,784
Finally, yeah.

1343
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:55,683
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1344
01:43:55,683 --> 01:43:59,819
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
It's sunny every day,

1345
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:02,694
and we found the cutest little house,
and you've got your own bathroom.

1346
01:44:02,694 --> 01:44:05,359
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.

1347
01:44:05,969 --> 01:44:07,163
What?

1348
01:44:07,604 --> 01:44:09,595
I want to live in Forks.

1349
01:44:09,973 --> 01:44:12,601
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.

1350
01:44:14,077 --> 01:44:16,068
Do you mind getting Dad?

1351
01:44:16,779 --> 01:44:19,771
I have to talk to him. Apologize.

1352
01:44:20,383 --> 01:44:22,613
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.

1353
01:44:23,553 --> 01:44:26,386
And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.

1354
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:40,135
So what happened?

1355
01:44:40,135 --> 01:44:41,795
Where's James?

1356
01:44:42,939 --> 01:44:44,907
We took care of it.

1357
01:44:51,414 --> 01:44:54,042
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.

1358
01:44:54,584 --> 01:44:56,552
I'm alive because of you.

1359
01:44:56,552 --> 01:44:59,087
No, you're in here because of me.

1360
01:45:00,757 --> 01:45:03,521
The worst part of it was that

1361
01:45:04,627 --> 01:45:07,357
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1362
01:45:07,357 --> 01:45:08,988
You did stop.

1363
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,932
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1364
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:17,833
What?

1365
01:45:20,977 --> 01:45:23,070
Are you... No!

1366
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:24,272
No!

1367
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:27,944
I don't even know what you're... How...

1368
01:45:27,944 --> 01:45:30,850
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away? I can't...

1369
01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:33,445
No, I can't... I can't just leave you...

1370
01:45:33,445 --> 01:45:34,854
I know.

1371
01:45:36,759 --> 01:45:38,386
We can't be apart.

1372
01:45:38,386 --> 01:45:40,326
You can't leave me.

1373
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:42,229
I'm here.

1374
01:45:45,702 --> 01:45:47,533
Okay, just don't...

1375
01:45:47,533 --> 01:45:50,835
You just can't say stuff like that to me. Ever.

1376
01:45:55,345 --> 01:45:57,836
Where else am I gonna go?

1377
01:46:47,597 --> 01:46:50,259
Alice lent me the dress.

1378
01:46:50,259 --> 01:46:51,960
The cast is...

1379
01:46:52,902 --> 01:46:54,597
You're perfect.

1380
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,538
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.

1381
01:47:00,443 --> 01:47:02,377
I've heard that before.

1382
01:47:06,549 --> 01:47:08,210
All right, Bells.

1383
01:47:10,453 --> 01:47:13,081
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.

1384
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:14,350
Dad.

1385
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,053
And...

1386
01:47:18,094 --> 01:47:20,528
Well, you look beautiful.

1387
01:47:22,665 --> 01:47:23,962
Thanks.

1388
01:47:25,668 --> 01:47:26,999
See you.

1389
01:47:34,043 --> 01:47:37,035
Hey. I'll be right back.

1390
01:47:39,549 --> 01:47:41,244
Bella.
- Jacob.

1391
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:43,413
Hey.

1392
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,415
Nice.
- You, too.

1393
01:47:47,156 --> 01:47:50,751
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1394
01:47:50,751 --> 01:47:52,089
No.

1395
01:47:55,932 --> 01:47:58,526
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1396
01:47:59,135 --> 01:48:00,796
Twenty bucks.

1397
01:48:00,796 --> 01:48:02,565
Let's hear it.

1398
01:48:03,372 --> 01:48:05,397
Just don't get mad, okay?

1399
01:48:06,976 --> 01:48:09,968
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1400
01:48:10,313 --> 01:48:13,976
It's just, he said, quote,

1401
01:48:14,817 --> 01:48:16,808
"We'll be watching you."

1402
01:48:18,387 --> 01:48:21,049
Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."
- Okay.

1403
01:48:21,524 --> 01:48:24,618
And to pay up.
- Okay. Let me help you.

1404
01:48:24,618 --> 01:48:25,922
Jacob.

1405
01:48:26,596 --> 01:48:28,587
I'll take it from here.

1406
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:34,158
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1407
01:48:35,905 --> 01:48:37,236
All right.

1408
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,943
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1409
01:48:54,957 --> 01:48:57,755
I can't believe you're making me do this.
- Just smile.

1410
01:49:04,033 --> 01:49:05,383
<i>Tonight! Lightning Strikes!</i>

1411
01:49:12,074 --> 01:49:13,174
<i>Don't go stay tonight!</i>

1412
01:49:18,447 --> 01:49:21,439
Wow. You are really trying to kill me.

1413
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:26,045
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I didn't want you to miss anything.

1414
01:49:26,045 --> 01:49:27,111
Oh.

1415
01:49:42,138 --> 01:49:45,005
<i>Everyday we're going all the way</i>

1416
01:49:45,005 --> 01:49:51,775
<i>Everyday, everyday, everyday
we're going all the way</i>

1417
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:54,180
<i>Tonight! Lightning Strikes!</i>

1418
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,740
Bella, hey!

1419
01:49:58,788 --> 01:50:00,756
Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

1420
01:50:00,957 --> 01:50:03,255
All right, slowing it down.

1421
01:50:09,232 --> 01:50:10,756
Shall we?

1422
01:50:11,901 --> 01:50:13,493
You're serious?

1423
01:50:14,637 --> 01:50:16,264
Why not.

1424
01:50:16,472 --> 01:50:19,839
<i> Wide on my plastic toys</i>

1425
01:50:19,839 --> 01:50:24,676
<i>Then when the cops closed the fair</i>

1426
01:50:24,676 --> 01:50:28,911
<i>I cut my long baby hair</i>

1427
01:50:28,911 --> 01:50:31,545
<i>Stole me a dog-eared map</i>

1428
01:50:31,545 --> 01:50:33,418
See, you're dancing.

1429
01:50:34,924 --> 01:50:36,323
At prom.

1430
01:50:39,328 --> 01:50:40,128
<i>Have I found you</i>

1431
01:50:44,467 --> 01:50:49,063
<i>Flightless bird</i>

1432
01:50:49,063 --> 01:50:49,903
<i>Jealous</i>

1433
01:50:53,776 --> 01:50:54,616
<i>Weeping</i>

1434
01:50:57,313 --> 01:50:59,747
Edward, why did you save me?

1435
01:50:59,747 --> 01:51:02,283
If you just let the venom spread,

1436
01:51:02,852 --> 01:51:05,047
I could be like you by now.

1437
01:51:06,856 --> 01:51:09,381
You don't know what you're saying.

1438
01:51:10,259 --> 01:51:12,659
You don't want this.
- I want you.

1439
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:14,093
Always.

1440
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:22,263
I'm not gonna end your life for you.

1441
01:51:22,263 --> 01:51:24,829
I'm dying already.

1442
01:51:26,742 --> 01:51:28,972
Every second, I get closer.

1443
01:51:29,612 --> 01:51:30,943
Older.

1444
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,971
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1445
01:51:34,884 --> 01:51:37,375
Alice said that she saw me like you.

1446
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:39,785
I heard her.
- Her visions change.

1447
01:51:39,785 --> 01:51:42,346
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1448
01:51:43,092 --> 01:51:44,684
I've decided.

1449
01:51:48,064 --> 01:51:50,555
So that's what you dream about.

1450
01:51:50,555 --> 01:51:52,430
Becoming a monster.

1451
01:51:55,972 --> 01:51:58,873
I dream about being with you forever.

1452
01:51:58,873 --> 01:52:00,272
Forever?

1453
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:07,541
And you're ready right now?

1454
01:52:09,585 --> 01:52:10,779
Yes.

1455
01:52:10,779 --> 01:52:11,779
<i>Bleeding or lost you</i>

1456
01:52:17,893 --> 01:52:19,573
<i>American mouth</i>

1457
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:23,491
<i>Big pill</i>

1458
01:52:27,837 --> 01:52:32,331
Is it not enough
just to have a long and happy life with me?

1459
01:52:39,949 --> 01:52:41,211
Yeah.

1460
01:52:42,651 --> 01:52:44,016
For now.

1461
01:53:12,548 --> 01:53:14,914
<i>No one will surrender tonight,</i>

1462
01:53:16,018 --> 01:53:17,883
<i>but I won't give in.</i>

1463
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:21,088
<i>I know what I want.</i>

1464
01:53:27,163 --> 01:53:27,963
<i>Have I found you</i>

1465
01:53:32,334 --> 01:53:36,862
<i>Flightless bird</i>

1466
01:53:36,862 --> 01:53:37,822
<i>Grounded</i>

1467
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:42,610
<i>Bleeding or lost you</i>

1468
01:53:52,354 --> 01:53:54,549
<i>American mouth</i>

1469
01:54:03,766 --> 01:54:06,963
<i> How come I end up where I started</i>

1470
01:54:06,963 --> 01:54:10,062
<i>How come I end up where I went wrong</i>

1471
01:54:10,062 --> 01:54:13,336
<i>Won't take my eyes off the ball again</i>

1472
01:54:13,336 --> 01:54:16,606
<i>You reel me out then you cut the string</i>

1473
01:54:22,785 --> 01:54:25,879
<i>How come I end up where I started</i>

1474
01:54:25,879 --> 01:54:28,924
<i>How come I end up where I went wrong</i>

1475
01:54:28,924 --> 01:54:31,926
<i>Won't take my eyes off the ball again</i>

1476
01:54:31,926 --> 01:54:35,828
<i>First you reel me out
and then you cut the string</i>

1477
01:54:47,877 --> 01:54:51,074
<i>You used to be all right</i>

1478
01:54:51,074 --> 01:54:53,809
<i>What happened?</i>

1479
01:54:53,809 --> 01:55:00,152
<i>Did the cat get your tongue</i>

1480
01:55:00,152 --> 01:55:01,502
<i>Did your string come undone</i>

1481
01:55:07,062 --> 01:55:08,262
<i>One by one</i>

1482
01:55:13,369 --> 01:55:14,569
<i>One by one</i>

1483
01:55:18,807 --> 01:55:19,707
<i>It comes to us all</i>

1484
01:55:25,414 --> 01:55:26,764
<i>It's as soft as your pillow</i>

1485
01:56:15,831 --> 01:56:18,459
<i> I dreamed I was missing</i>

1486
01:56:18,459 --> 01:56:21,594
<i>You were so scared</i>

1487
01:56:21,594 --> 01:56:24,434
<i>But no one would listen</i>

1488
01:56:24,434 --> 01:56:27,942
<i>Because no one else cared</i>

1489
01:56:27,942 --> 01:56:30,501
<i>After my dreaming</i>

1490
01:56:30,501 --> 01:56:33,946
<i>I woke with this fear</i>

1491
01:56:33,946 --> 01:56:36,416
<i>What am I leaving</i>

1492
01:56:36,416 --> 01:56:39,613
<i>When I'm done here?</i>

1493
01:56:39,613 --> 01:56:42,122
<i>So if you're asking me</i>

1494
01:56:42,122 --> 01:56:46,025
<i>I want you to know</i>

1495
01:56:46,025 --> 01:56:48,154
<i>When my time comes</i>

1496
01:56:48,154 --> 01:56:51,324
<i>Forget the wrong that I've done</i>

1497
01:56:51,324 --> 01:56:54,198
<i>Help me leave behind some</i>

1498
01:56:54,198 --> 01:56:58,036
<i>Reasons to be missed</i>

1499
01:56:58,036 --> 01:57:00,234
<i>Don't resent me</i>

1500
01:57:00,234 --> 01:57:03,244
<i>And when you're feeling empty</i>

1501
01:57:03,244 --> 01:57:06,179
<i>Keep me in your memory</i>

1502
01:57:06,179 --> 01:57:09,342
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1503
01:57:09,342 --> 01:57:11,943
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1504
01:57:11,943 --> 01:57:14,888
<i>Forgetting all the hurt inside</i>

1505
01:57:14,888 --> 01:57:17,892
<i>You've learned to hide so well</i>

1506
01:57:17,892 --> 01:57:20,793
<i>Pretending someone else can come</i>

1507
01:57:20,793 --> 01:57:23,923
<i>And save me from myself</i>

1508
01:57:23,923 --> 01:57:27,992
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1509
01:57:27,992 --> 01:57:30,163
<i>When my time comes</i>

1510
01:57:30,163 --> 01:57:33,265
<i>Forget the wrong that I've done</i>

1511
01:57:33,265 --> 01:57:36,311
<i>Help me leave behind some</i>

1512
01:57:36,311 --> 01:57:40,041
<i>Reasons to be missed</i>

1513
01:57:40,041 --> 01:57:42,083
<i>Don't resent me</i>

1514
01:57:42,083 --> 01:57:45,279
<i>And when you're feeling empty</i>

1515
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:48,016
<i>Keep me in your memory</i>

1516
01:57:48,016 --> 01:57:51,287
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1517
01:57:51,287 --> 01:57:53,920
<i>Leave out all the rest</i>

1518
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,760
<i>Forgetting all the hurt inside</i>

1519
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:59,892
<i>You've learned to hide so well</i>

1520

<i>Pretending someone else can come</i>

1521
01:58:02,664 --> 01:58:05,935
<i>And save me from myself</i>

1522
01:58:05,935 --> 01:58:07,035
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1523
01:58:11,947 --> 01:58:16,384
<i>I can't be who you are</i>

1524
01:58:24,293 --> 01:58:27,126
<i> How can I decide what's right</i>

1525
01:58:27,126 --> 01:58:30,393
<i>When you're clouding up my mind</i>

1526
01:58:30,393 --> 01:58:33,629
<i>I can't win your losing fight</i>

1527
01:58:33,629 --> 01:58:35,693
<i>All the time</i>

1528
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:38,865
<i>How can I ever own what's mine</i>

1529
01:58:38,865 --> 01:58:41,967
<i>When you're always taking sides</i>

1530
01:58:41,967 --> 01:58:44,979
<i>But you won't take away my pride</i>

1531
01:58:44,979 --> 01:58:45,829
<i>No, not this time</i>

1532
01:58:51,353 --> 01:58:52,203
<i>No, not this time</i>

1533
01:58:59,094 --> 01:59:01,756
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1534
01:59:01,756 --> 01:59:08,793
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1535
01:59:10,739 --> 01:59:13,640
<i>But how did we get here?</i>

1536
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,320
<i>I think I know</i>

1537
01:59:28,524 --> 01:59:31,652
<i>The truth is hiding in your eyes</i>

1538
01:59:31,652 --> 01:59:34,787
<i>And its hanging on your tongue</i>

1539
01:59:34,787 --> 01:59:37,229
<i>Just boiling in my blood</i>

1540
01:59:37,229 --> 01:59:39,961
<i>But you think that I can't see</i>

1541
01:59:39,961 --> 01:59:43,334
<i>What kind of man that you are</i>

1542
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:46,431
<i>If you're a man at all</i>

1543
01:59:46,431 --> 01:59:53,414
<i>Well, I will figure this one out on my own</i>

1544
01:59:54,850 --> 02:00:00,288
<i>I'm screaming I love you so</i>

1545
02:00:00,288 --> 02:00:03,290
<i>My thoughts you can't decode</i>

1546
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:06,293
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1547
02:00:06,293 --> 02:00:13,324
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1548
02:00:13,324 --> 02:00:17,668
<i>Yeah
But how did we get here?</i>

1549
02:00:17,668 --> 02:00:18,868
<i>Well, I think I know how</i>

1550
02:00:37,192 --> 02:00:42,858
<i>Do you see what we've done</i>

1551
02:00:42,858 --> 02:00:48,733
<i>We're gonna make such fools of ourselves</i>

1552
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:53,106
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1553
02:00:53,106 --> 02:00:57,737
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1554
02:00:57,737 --> 02:00:58,537
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1555
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:04,717
<i>How did we get here?</i>

1556
02:01:04,717 --> 02:01:11,749
<i>When I used to know you so well</i>

1557
02:01:11,749 --> 02:01:15,991
<i>I think I know</i>

1558
02:01:19,234 --> 02:01:25,036
<i>There is something I see in you</i>

1559
02:01:25,036 --> 02:01:27,803
<i>It might kill me</i>

1560
02:01:27,803 --> 02:01:28,803
<i>I want it to be true</i>

1561
