1
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:06,387
Are you really that surprised?

2
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,439
Well, yeah, I mean--
Yeah, I'm-I'm honestly--

3
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,966
I'm more than surprised.
I'm sort of shocked.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,279
I mean-- Yeah.

5
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:17,078
Katie, when was the last time
you saw me really happy?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,306
Well, I don't know. You know?

7
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:23,786
Nobody's happy all the time, right?

8
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:26,751
I mean, it sort of, you know,
comes and it goes and...

9
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:32,347
Rita, have you hormones checked?
Because I know that sounds crazy

10
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,275
but women have killed their own
children in hormonal rages.

11
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,777
- You know, maybe that's a part of this.
- Katie, listen.

12
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,086
There's nothing wrong with me.

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,962
Just like there is
nothing wrong with you.

14
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,704
You're in the same situation.
It may be your version of it, but--

15
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,098
No, I'm not.

16
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,461
No, I'm not. I would--
I would never leave Dave.

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,210
I've never wanted to leave Dave

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,653
and, you know, he doesn't
wanna leave me, so...

19
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,530
You haven't had sex in a year.

20
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:58,023
Well, so what?

21
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,966
So what?

22
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,058
I mean, we love each other.
You know?

23
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,232
If-if-if his legs fell off
I wouldn't leave him.

24
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:06,912
What does that mean?

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,631
It means,
sex isn't everything, you know?

26
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,058
No, it isn't.
It's only a part of it.

27
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,232
- I know that.
- So fix the other parts, Rita.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,614
- I mean, come on.
- I can't.

29
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:17,789
I tried. And now I just
don't want to.

30
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,317
I'm just trying to get out
of what we have been

31
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:23,155
complaining about to each other
for the last 10 years.

32
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:25,602
Yeah, I, uh...

33
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,407
I just don't remember
complaining though, you know?

34
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,219
It was fun. I mean, I just, I th--

35
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,337
You know, we were complaining
so that this wouldn't happen.

36
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,985
Right? I mean...

37
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:38,791
Do you remember a couple years ago

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,213
when Dan and I were thinking
about having another kid?

39
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:44,511
Well, if we did, right now
that kid would be 3 years old.

40
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,025
I wouldn't be able to leave.

41
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:47,887
It would've been
the worst mistake ever.

42
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:50,424
Okay, Rita. You know what?
I'm not you. All right, Rita?

43
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:52,103
You don't need to warn me.

44
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:53,336
And you know what I think?

45
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,686
I think that you are making
a huge mistake right now.

46
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,067
I think you are about to
destroy your life,

47
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,129
and you're gonna come to me
in a year from now

48
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:02,691
and you're gonna ask me
why I let you do this.

49
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:05,659
Jesus Christ, Katie.
You'd think I'm leaving you.

50
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,488
No, come on. I understand
what you're talking about--

51
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:09,885
No, you don't.

52
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,379
No, you don't.

53
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,554
I thought you would, but you don't.

54
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:18,814
There's the yolk sac,

55
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,376
and...

56
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,570
there's the heartbeat.

57
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,486
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,748
It has a long way to go.

59
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:39,273
It does.

60
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:40,937
But it happens fast.

61
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,108
Uh, how fast?

62
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,844
Well, by your next ultrasound

63
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:47,087
you'll see the beginnings
of arms, and legs,

64
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,224
and the heart,
and before you know it,

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,117
it will be keeping you up at night.

66
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,770
It's pretty incredible.

67
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:57,765
That's why they call it
the miracle of life.

68
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,266
Do you guys want a picture?

69
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,837
Start showing off?

70
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,411
No, that's all right.

71
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,494
Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do.

72
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,758
Yes. Definitely.

73
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,301
There you go.

74
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,582
I'll see you both in six weeks.

75
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,778
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

76
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,812
That's unbelievable,
that that, uh...

77
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,827
will be us one day.

78
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,296
It's okay.

79
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:46,338
It's okay. No one expects you to fall
in love with a grain of rice.

80
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,264
Hon, just

81
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,223
give it some time.

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,402
Oh, give it time.

83
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,705
- Oh, okay.
- Come on.

84
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:57,863
No, I know.

85
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,237
- I just-- I mean, you know.
- I know.

86
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,769
We'll get through this together.

87
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,881
I'll get us through it.

88
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,335
Hi.

89
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,479
- <i>Hey, babe. How ya doin'?</i>
- Good. How you doin'?

90
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,270
<i>Good. Just tryin'
to figure out my night.</i>

91
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:30,969
<i>Did you get my text?</i>

92
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:33,809
Yeah. I'm sorry, I got busy.

93
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,375
<i>So we're still meeting up?</i>

94
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,574
I already ate but I'll meet up
with you afterward.

95
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,217
<i>All right. All right, well,
I'm gonna go out</i>

96
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:47,451
<i>so I'll just meet you
back at your place.</i>

97
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:48,613
<i>I love you.</i>

98
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,385
<i>Anyway...</i>

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,642
- I'll see you later.
- <i>Okay. Bye.</i>

100
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,679
What?

101
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,321
I'm just not ready to tell her.

102
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,683
I don't think we should.
I-I think it's too early.

103
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,257
She's your mother, Palek.

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,618
Since when do you give a shit
about my mother?

105
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:32,332
Since she became
our baby's grandmother.

106
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:40,112
I just don't want her fuckin' drama.

107
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,216
I don't wanna deal with
her hugging, kissing bullshit.

108
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,601
We'll throw it in the middle
of one of her stories.

109
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,067
- She'll barely notice.
- Hon, she'll notice.

110
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,819
Look, if I had a mother, I'd want her
to know, even if I hated her.

111
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:55,761
Don't pull

112
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,487
the dead-mother card. It's not fair.

113
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,223
I-I'm just saying,
I would want to tell her.

114
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,863
Just like I wanna tell your mother.
I just wanna tell family.

115
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,444
All right, all right, all right.

116
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:10,534
Are you okay?

117
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,044
And I wanted to tell her
that she was out of line

118
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,704
but I didn't feel that I could.

119
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,338
We've known each other
for so many years

120
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,217
and it just seemed
inappropriate and rude,

121
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,040
to tell her what I really felt.

122
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,408
Th-there's rudeness
attached to this movement

123
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:37,363
that seems to be going around.
People tell each other,

124
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,285
you know, what they want
and feel and need.

125
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:42,980
Don't-don't you think?

126
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,424
We're pregnant.

127
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,304
So...

128
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,546
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,577
- What?
- What?

130
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,490
- Why say it like that?
- Why? Why not?

131
00:06:58,803 --> 00:06:59,972
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,639
Oh, my God.

133
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,988
Oh, Carolyn,
I don't know what to say.

134
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,703
- I love you.
- Oh, well. I love you.

135
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,930
God, could the, um...?

136
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:21,815
Uh, I'll be right back.

137
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,455
What is it with you
and the heat in this place, Mom?

138
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,570
I'm cold.

139
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,865
Carolyn,
I can-- I can finally tell you.

140
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,312
Now, I did my very best
not to say anything. No to--

141
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,801
Palek's not happy.

142
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,634
And I don't know what to do.

143
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,678
Oh, he's...

144
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,491
- Well, he's-he's happy.
- No.

145
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,305
He isn't?

146
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,849
He doesn't want this baby.

147
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,395
He doesn't wanna be a dad.

148
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:10,145
Did-did he tell you this?

149
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,968
Well, he-he doesn't
have a choice, does he?

150
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:20,555
No.

151
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,262
He'll come around.

152
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,319
Oh, sweetheart, it's wonderful news.

153
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,928
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:34,866
Thank you.

155
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,230
Maybe Isabella can read to Josh.

156
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,431
We could pay her.

157
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,520
I wanna watch my show.

158
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,229
How was your day?

159
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,280
Oh, you know. Good.

160
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,200
Same as it was yesterday.

161
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,163
- How was your day?
- It was good.

162
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:06,035
And, um, I got a lot of stuff done.

163
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,353
Went over to Rita's
for a while, hung out.

164
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,292
Yeah? How's she doin'?

165
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,243
How's she doin'? She's, um...

166
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,242
She's good.

167
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,241
Have you talked to Dan lately?

168
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,873
Well, you guys don't really
talk very much, do you?

169
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,656
No. Only when you girls
are together.

170
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,238
Well, Rita was telling me how,

171
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:33,056
a few years ago,
Dan wanted to have another baby

172
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,005
but she didn't want to.

173
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:37,172
She's smart.

174
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:41,612
I think that your reasons
for not wanting to have a baby

175
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:44,670
and her reasons are probably
different though, you know?

176
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,832
I'm tryin' to watch this.

177
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:50,391
What are you reasons, Dave?

178
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:55,993
I don't know. I-- I mean, you--

179
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:59,514
Honey, you don't really
want a baby, do you?

180
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,684
That's not what I'm asking.
You know, I just--

181
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:03,636
I would like to know
what your reasons are.

182
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:06,142
It's-it's-it's not that
I don't want one,

183
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,110
I just, I just, you know--

184
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,676
We're gettin' old.

185
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,709
Not really. I mean, there was
that woman in the Philippines.

186
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,363
What was she? Like, she was 62
and she had a kid?

187
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,423
W-what am I supposed to say to that?

188
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:19,562
I mean--

189
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:21,839
Look, I-I-I don't know
what's goin' on here

190
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,281
but I feel like
there's this weird trap

191
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:27,251
and I'm afraid to take a step
'cause my foot's gonna get cut off.

192
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:28,997
You know what?
Maybe that's the problem.

193
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,641
You know that? Maybe we're just--
We're just afraid.

194
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:37,407
I don't know. I don't know.
We can't redo the patio every year.

195
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,077
Yeah, well,
I-I-I never wanted to redo it.

196
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:43,437
You're the one who wants to redo it.
I-I'm fine with the way it is.

197
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:44,781
I always have been.

198
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,805
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,980
So how have you been?

200
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,791
Good.

201
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,715
Have you talked to Hugo
since our session?

202
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,261
He'll never talk to me again.

203
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,094
How's it going with Nick?

204
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,077
Fine.

205
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:11,488
We had shitty sex,
and then we had good sex,

206
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:14,540
and then he told me he loved me.

207
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,613
And, um...

208
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,951
And, um, what?

209
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,941
Now, every time we leave each other,

210
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,826
he says, "I love you."

211
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,797
When Nick tells you
he loves you, what do you say?

212
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,357
I kiss him,
and then change the subject.

213
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,530
Well, that's a tried
and true method.

214
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,303
Yeah, but not for me.

215
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,141
I mean, usually when a guy
tells me he loves me--

216
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,383
Which happens a lot.

217
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,723
--I just say it right back
even if it's not true, you know?

218
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,698
Just seeing it in their face, and...

219
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,318
feeling all that stuff,
you just feel is worth it.

220
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,076
And then what happens?

221
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,096
I usually fuck around on them,

222
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,138
try to figure out
a way to leave them,

223
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:13,228
usually blame them for something,
and then get into another relationship.

224
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,962
But this time
you said was different.

225
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,711
This time you said
you weren't doing that.

226
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,056
Tell me why you think
you weren't doing it.

227
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:22,801
I don't know.

228
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,962
I mean, I can't tell him
I love him back.

229
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,746
I don't want to.
And I wish that I could

230
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,673
because it would just make it
a lot easier to lie about it.

231
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,800
You know, he's not upset,
I'm not upset.

232
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,800
There's not that, you know,

233
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:41,266
weird moment or that awkward space
that just kinda sits there

234
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,208
wherein I'm not saying
I don't love you.

235
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,421
I don't think that's a bad thing.

236
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:48,372
Yeah, well, it makes me feel shitty.

237
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,465
I mean, what if he's the guy,
you know?

238
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,117
What if I'm so fucked up
that the right guy is standing

239
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,230
right in front of me
and I can't say it?

240
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:00,305
And what if I can only say it
to the wrong people?

241
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,847
Well, I don't think that's the case.

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,934
I think you're examining
some very valid issues.

243
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:12,919
You know, I've spent so long
in relationships that I don't know...

244
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:19,020
It's like, I have no lines,
no boundaries.

245
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:23,194
And it never used to bother me before
and now it drives me crazy.

246
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:24,930
Now I wanna run.

247
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:26,380
But I'm afraid to run

248
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,813
because I'm afraid
to be alone, so I stay.

249
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,856
Only now, I'm like this

250
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,369
blob who can really fuck,

251
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:35,822
and there's no--

252
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,961
There's nothing.

253
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,946
Well, the obvious answer
is of course

254
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:45,360
to spend some time,
a decent amount of time, alone.

255
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:49,311
Changing who you're with
obviously doesn't work.

256
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:52,574
Unless you change,
the issues will remain the same.

257
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,434
You know, part of me just wants
to run off an marry him.

258
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,624
I mean, he's a great guy.

259
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,143
So what am I doing?

260
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,398
Jaime, if you really
find it difficult to be alone

261
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:07,266
it seems to me you have few choices.

262
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:09,018
One.

263
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,467
You can tell him you love him,
see what happens.

264
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:19,249
Or you can keep on kissing him
and changing the subject,

265
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,731
which doesn't come
without its own challenges

266
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,523
but you seem to be up to it.

267
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:25,779
Or you can tell him the truth.

268
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,881
You can tell him how you feel,

269
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,789
that you need some time.

270
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,505
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes.

271
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:12,865
I'm calling about the job
for the digital artist.

272
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,882
- <i>Do you have experience?</i>
- Yes I did. I mean, I do.

273
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,635
<i>How much, about?</i>

274
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,513
It was-- It was a few years go, but--

275
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:20,989
- <i>Do you have a portfolio?</i>
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:22,755
- <i>References?</i>
- Both.

277
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:24,980
<i>Could you come in tomorrow?</i>

278
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:26,373
Tomorrow?

279
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,127
- <i>About 2:00?</i>
- Sure, I can.

280
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:31,195
<i>Great. E-mail your résumé</i>
<i>and I'll see you then.</i>

281
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,320
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay, I'll see you then.

282
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,624
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Okay.

283
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,056
- <i>Bye</i>
- Thank you.

284
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,118
The client is not happy,

285
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,896
and I can't say I blame them.

286
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:47,056
Hinton was a dropped ball,

287
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,779
and I would never say this to them,

288
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,494
but that was a fuckup.

289
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:56,214
And that was our fuckup
because due diligence wasn't.

290
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:00,624
Carolyn, I want you to go back
over all the documents.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,968
All four contracts.
Go over it with a fine-toothed comb,

292
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,879
make sure we're protected.

293
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,391
And then, tomorrow
you'll review it with Philip.

294
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,186
What?

295
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:13,911
I need more time.

296
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,574
You don't have more time.

297
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,249
I need it tomorrow.

298
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:23,096
Then get somebody else.

299
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:54,955
I don't know what to tell you
about the cement.

300
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,341
We're gonna do what we need to do.

301
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:57,723
Okay?

302
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,827
Hey. I don't have
any more time, okay?

303
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:02,973
That's it. I--

304
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,906
Okay, I gotta call you back.

305
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,891
- <i>How are you?</i>
- Fine.

306
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,586
Where are you?

307
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,428
Uh, at work. W-what's up?

308
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:21,074
Well, I-- I think I just quit.

309
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
What?

310
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,218
I just walked out.

311
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,372
Well, are you gonna walk back in?

312
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:30,598
No.

313
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,098
No, I'm not.

314
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:35,867
We're doing fine.

315
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,128
And you know how I feel,

316
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,836
I don't wanna work
once the baby's born, so...

317
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,942
<i>I think I'm done.</i>

318
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,068
You're done?

319
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,630
Palek, you know, honestly,
I don't think I could go back in there.

320
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,592
I mean, I--

321
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:55,140
Shoulter has probably
cleaned out my office.

322
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,687
I mean, I just walked out on her.

323
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,543
You know, I gotta go, and, uh,

324
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,697
maybe we can talk about this later.

325
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,002
- Okay.
- <i>Bye.</i>

326
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,490
Bye.

327
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,427
- How are you today?
- I'm fine, thank you.

328
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,249
Could I get a room started for you?

329
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,473
No thanks. I think I'm
just gonna keep looking.

330
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,537
Thanks.

331
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,332
Hi, it's Katie Walker
and I'm sorry this is so last minute

332
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:45,768
<i>but we're not gonna
make therapy today, it's just--</i>

333
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,310
<i>It's been a crazy day
and so I'll just, um--</i>

334
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,829
<i>I'll just-- I'll-I'll talk to you soon.
Okay.</i>

335
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,001
I'm-I'm sorry about that.
Okay, bye-bye.

336
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:02,535
Dave?

337
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:06,247
Katie's not here yet.

338
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,018
No, I just got a message
from Katie, cancelling therapy.

339
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:11,403
Yeah, I--
I must've just missed her call.

340
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:13,659
Well, you're here.

341
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,832
We have the hour
and it's already paid for.

342
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,312
Why don't you come in?

343
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,396
Sally, you're doin' pickup, right?

344
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,580
Do you think you could
get Isabella and Josh?

345
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,623
<i>Sure. Everything okay?</i>

346
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,446
Yeah, I just got tied up.

347
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,961
I'll have Dave come and get him
before dinner, okay?

348
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,158
<i>Rita called. She said you guys got
in a fight. She's really upset.</i>

349
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,575
Well, so am I.

350
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:44,163
<i>Why?</i>

351
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,755
You know what? Let's just
talk about it later, okay Sally?

352
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,514
Thanks for gettin' the kids.

353
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,365
So...

354
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,221
I-I don't-- What am I doin' here?

355
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,350
Dave, a few minutes ago
you made choice.

356
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,130
I think it was a good one.

357
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,661
You chose to stay.

358
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:23,258
I imagine there's a reason why.

359
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:38,260
There are a number of ways
I can get you to talk.

360
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:41,865
- Are they all painful?
- Yes, most of them.

361
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,142
Katie wants another baby.

362
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,719
Do you?

363
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:04,999
No.

364
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,934
- Why not?
- Too old.

365
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:12,736
And to tell you the truth,
as-as much as I love my kids,

366
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,993
I wouldn't mind having my wife back.

367
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,696
So you miss her?

368
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,245
Every day.

369
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,897
Many couples come to me
because they think they've,

370
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,696
grown distant.

371
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,529
Yeah, we really have.

372
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,728
Well, I think
it's just the opposite.

373
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,133
Sometimes,

374
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,431
there's no passion left when,

375
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:42,537
when the space is so small
you can't reach across it.

376
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,517
But all there is, is space.

377
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,126
There-there is so much space,
I can't--

378
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,399
I-I don't even know
how to get to her.

379
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,460
I don't know how to get to her.

380
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,613
I don't even know where she is.

381
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:13,223
What about you?
Tell me where you've been.

382
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:19,868
I didn't go anywhere. I, I just--

383
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,655
I mean, life--

384
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:26,282
Things...

385
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
changed.

386
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,698
Some of these guys
I sell steel to, they--

387
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:40,942
They're builders.

388
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:43,062
They're young, no kids.

389
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,567
I always wanted to build things.

390
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,130
And I look at them and then I think,
"Why isn't that me?"

391
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:54,284
"Why am I who I am?"

392
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,540
And then I go home,

393
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,528
and then there's Katie.

394
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,296
I love her, I-I--

395
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:08,671
I never even knew what love was
until I met Katie,

396
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,648
but sometimes I hate her.

397
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,641
I know that's wrong.
I know I shouldn't blame her.

398
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:15,158
But I do.

399
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:21,107
And you still think we're too close?

400
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:26,679
I think all of your resentment,

401
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:30,743
your disappointment and your regret,
is all mixed up with Katie's.

402
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,432
That's a difficult knot to untangle.

403
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,447
It's more than that. It's...

404
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,958
like something came in one day,

405
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,041
and took it.

406
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,882
One night I looked over
and I didn't want her.

407
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,596
And I didn't know why.

408
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,614
And I didn't know what to do.

409
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,503
You know, that's something
you should share with Katie.

410
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,802
You can't tell your wife
you don't want her anymore,

411
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,023
and recover.

412
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,412
No, but you can tell her
that you're lost

413
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:22,353
and you don't know what to do.

414
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,434
Does it come back?

415
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,659
I mean, does it?

416
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:32,666
Once you've gotten to the point
where we are?

417
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:34,983
Can it come back?

418
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,192
Can we reverse time? No.

419
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:43,229
But sometimes
there can be something else.

420
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:47,653
And sometimes that something
else can be better.

421
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:52,703
What?

422
00:24:57,993 --> 00:24:59,308
Something better.

423
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,991
- Love Crush.
* I'm sorry?

424
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:45,886
That's what it's called.
It's pretty silly, huh?

425
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:50,209
You know, it would look good
on you though. Would you like to see?

426
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:52,636
- No, that's okay.
- Sit.

427
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,968
Sit down.

428
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,751
This looks good. You know,
I'm gonna grab some shadow.

429
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:09,932
Sure, okay.

430
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:13,799
Close?

431
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:26,415
Other eye.

432
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,012
Well, so we had the, uh,

433
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,979
the first inspector out to the house,
the guy that you suggested.

434
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:50,761
- Kurt.
- Yeah, Kurt's a good guy.

435
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:54,996
Well, he was tryin' to put
a happy face on, but...

436
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:58,015
I could tell there was something
he wasn't saying.

437
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:03,016
So I had another inspector
come out to the house.

438
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,186
This guy Mike.

439
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,262
Former Marine.

440
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:07,958
Tells it like it is.

441
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,326
Mold.

442
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,259
Mold?

443
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:20,030
It's everywhere. It's, uh--
It's all over your house.

444
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,882
Wait. No it's not.
We never saw any mold.

445
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,498
No, of course you didn't see it.

446
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:29,526
That's the whole thing, it's mold.

447
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,702
It's the silent killer.

448
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:34,749
All right.

449
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:40,829
I'm still gonna buy it.

450
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,652
Clean up's gonna cost

451
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:49,414
at least 50,000.

452
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,581
- Sure, of course.
- Maybe more.

453
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:54,758
So...

454
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,811
It's your choice.

455
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,043
- You all right?
- Am I all right? What is that?

456
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:13,981
Some kind of trick question?
What is that?

457
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,278
You look pale.

458
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,008
I'm fine.

459
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:37,259
Jesus.

460
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,421
Fuck.

461
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:54,386
Fuck.

462
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:55,948
Oh, fuck.

463
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,190
So where is Mom anyway?

464
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,080
On her way, honey.

465
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,923
She-she called and she's on her way.

466
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:28,659
She gained like 400 pounds

467
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,477
and then blew up in the parking lot.

468
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,953
When's she gonna get here?

469
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:34,188
Soon.

470
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:35,270
Soon.

471
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,325
See?

472
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:43,721
Hey, what happened?

473
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:47,058
Uh, I just, um--
I lost track of time.

474
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,983
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetie.

475
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,634
- Hey, you look pretty.
- Thank you.

476
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,488
And-and this morning,
I mean, what happened with therapy?

477
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,740
Well, I, uh-- I got busy, you know?

478
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:01,888
I thought--
I thought you would be relieved.

479
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,623
Uh, I-I would've been if I had
gotten a message sooner.

480
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:06,166
Oh, so you went?

481
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:11,328
- How was it?
- It was, uh--

482
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:12,913
It-it was irritating.

483
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,527
- You want some chicken?
- Sure, okay.

484
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,693
How was everybody's day?

485
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,149
- Fine.
- Good day.

486
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,942
Did you go to--? Thanks.

487
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,653
- Did you go to baseball today?
- Yeah.

488
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:33,441
- Hey.
- Hi.

489
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,553
You know what? What?

490
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,463
I think we're moving too fast.

491
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:56,103
Look, I wanna be with you. I just--

492
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:59,748
I mean, it's not us,
I just wanna slow down.

493
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:03,155
Right.

494
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:08,861
I went to the shrink and-and

495
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:11,908
I'm just trying
to deal with my shit and

496
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:14,202
I'm trying to do something
right for a change.

497
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:20,519
I'm tired of this shit.

498
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,928
Maybe we should just
talk about this later.

499
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,977
There's nothing to--

500
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,962
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm falling in love with you

501
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:28,442
and you're not
falling in love with me.

502
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:29,719
But I am in love with you.

503
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,387
No, you're not.

504
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,839
I want to be.

505
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:37,221
You're everything that I want.

506
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:38,844
Oh, fuck you.

507
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,070
I had a session with a patient.

508
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,026
A man, 40 years old.
He'd never been there alone.

509
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,660
He always comes with his wife.

510
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:59,205
And he's not comfortable in therapy.

511
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,620
And for the first time
in a long time,

512
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:03,425
I wasn't comfortable either.

513
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:05,168
He...

514
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,752
I was stumped
by something he asked me.

515
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:10,590
I can't imagine you stumped
about anything.

516
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,880
Unless it's about building a house.

517
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:17,136
It was about marriage
and I think I let him down.

518
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:18,156
Really?

519
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:19,855
How?

520
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:24,521
He and his wife
have been struggling.

521
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,472
And I told him to stick it out,

522
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,488
that there was something
at the other end of it.

523
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:33,913
And then when he asked me
what it was, I c--

524
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,869
I didn't know what to tell him.

525
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:44,328
Tell him it's the same thing
he has now, only he loves it.

526
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,791
He wouldn't change a thing about it.

527
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,380
How can I explain that to him?

528
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,419
You can't.

529
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:56,536
You didn't fail him.

530
00:32:57,003 --> 00:33:00,420
He just can't grasp what we have
from his point of view.

531
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,151
<i>Hey, Jaime, it's Nick.</i>

532
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,363
<i>I left some softball stuff over there,</i>

533
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:14,821
<i>and a pair of shoes, I think.</i>

534
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:17,105
<i>So if you could
leave 'em by your door</i>

535
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,031
<i>I'll grab 'em some time tomorrow.</i>

536
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,513
<i>I think you're right.
I think we need a break.</i>

537
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,489
<i>Well, I mean, I know I need to.</i>

538
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:27,809
<i>So take care.</i>

539
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,177
So what did you do all day?

540
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:52,606
Can you just give me the run down?

541
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:55,928
- Just. You know, I was running errands.
- All day?

542
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,694
No, I was-- I went shopping.

543
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,107
You know, it's--

544
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:05,064
It's not like I disappeared,
like I hopped a plane to Vegas.

545
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,459
I just-- I, um...

546
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:11,618
I had an interview and I didn't have
anything to wear so I went to the mall.

547
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,414
What do you mean, you had an interview?
What-what kind?

548
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,333
For what?

549
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,139
For a job, Dave.

550
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:24,522
What?

551
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,850
Why are you laughing?

552
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:29,130
It's just-- This is a job job?

553
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,066
Full-time?

554
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:35,853
Yeah, full-time.

555
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,886
Why is this so funny?

556
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:42,456
No, it's funny because it's-it's--

557
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,947
It's not like, hah-hah funny.

558
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:47,342
It's more like, funny hah-hah.

559
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:48,753
I mean...

560
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:53,244
You know, first you want a baby
and now you want a job.

561
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:55,498
You want to go to therapy,
you don't want to go.

562
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:58,002
You don't answer your phone,
your eyelids are blue.

563
00:34:58,143 --> 00:34:59,676
- You noticed.
- Well, of course.

564
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:02,761
Who wouldn't notice? I mean,
you wanted to get a pass for the day?

565
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:04,917
Fine. Who doesn't wanna
get a pass for the day?

566
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:08,195
I do, but I busted my butt
to get to that appointment.

567
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:10,173
I left work early
to pick up the kids,

568
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:12,914
I looked like an idiot because
I didn't know where you were.

569
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,966
You don't even tell me
about Rita and Dan,

570
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:16,728
I have to hear it from Sally.

571
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,157
I mean, come on.

572
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:28,179
I'm sorry, I should've told you.

573
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,318
- Why didn't you?
- Because, because--

574
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,820
Because it's Rita and Dan.

575
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,226
It's Rita and Dan, Dave. Okay?

576
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,105
She can do that, I mean, if-if--

577
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:44,516
If they can do that then, I don't know,
anyone can do it. And I just, I--

578
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,491
You know, it just threw me, okay?

579
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,921
I just-- I'm confused
right now, and I just--

580
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,033
- Well, me fucking too.
- Don't swear, okay?

581
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:53,536
Let's not do that.

582
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:56,732
Let's just...

583
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,678
Tell me what to do, Katie.

584
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:06,635
I've done everything
you asked me to do.

585
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:09,716
So tell me what to do now.

586
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,461
I don't know.

587
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,101
- We're fine, Dave.
- No.

588
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,058
- No, no, no.
- We'll be fine.

589
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:29,435
Stop doing that.

590
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,676
Just-just make it-- Just cm down.

591
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:47,570
You know what I was
gonna tell you tonight?

592
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:50,561
That I changed my mind.

593
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:53,781
What?

594
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,462
I think we should have a baby.

595
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:09,355
What?

596
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:11,885
I'm just--

597
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,937
I'm saying you were right.

598
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:21,975
No, I wasn't.

599
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:32,276
Okay, I'm beat. I'm goin' to bed.

600
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,126
I had a panic attack?

601
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,476
You'll be fine, just take it easy.

602
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,169
I thought I was dying.

603
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,929
You know, I'm not
a hypochondriac or anything.

604
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,066
I've never even been
to an emergency room.

605
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:57,544
No, babe, they ran the tests.
I mean, you're fine.

606
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:58,895
It's a physical thing.

607
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:01,311
You know, it's just like a physical
thing in your head.

608
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,378
I guess.

609
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,945
I can't believe I quit my job.

610
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:24,979
What?

611
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:30,088
It is always about you,
isn't it, Carolyn?

612
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,142
Good job gettin' us through this.

613
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,380
You know what, Palek? Grow up. Okay?

614
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:38,058
You're gonna be a father,
'cause we're having a baby.

615
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,838
He said to reduce my stress level.

616
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,031
Do you think that
is reducing my stress level?

617
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:46,235
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

618
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:49,319
I got scared.

619
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:53,317
I never get scared--
This was really scary.

620
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:32,238
...just sitting there.
I mean, like, fuck.

621
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:34,695
What do you expect him to do?

622
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:36,844
I don't ca-- I don't--
You know, I don't care.

623
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,447
I don't care. Whatever.

624
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,927
- You so fuckin' care.
- I don't.

625
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:44,490
I mean, what kind
of a name is Anya, anyway?

626
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,093
I don't know. Who cares?
Sounds like a industrial cleaner.

627
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:54,912
Fuck, I don't know, man.

628
00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:00,437
I don't know. He kinda
looks like a girl, anyway.

629
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:01,835
What?

630
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,774
- I don't know.
- What?

631
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,317
How do I make you
feel better about it?

632
00:41:09,273 --> 00:41:10,273
We drink.

633
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:12,499
Right. That's what I do,

634
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:14,800
is I get you hammered.

635
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,838
- That's what you do.
- You know, I don't--

636
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:19,397
That's what I do,
I pay for the alcohol.

637
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,385
Have we not established this?
This is how I roll.

638
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,228
I roll big. I roll big.

639
00:41:25,531 --> 00:41:26,952
We'll do this, okay?

640
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,292
Awesome.

641
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,239
You. You wanna

642
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:47,846
go out?

643
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,410
Yeah. Pick the place.

644
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,286
Do you have a, um, number?

645
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:54,900
- Got a pen?
- A pen?

646
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,372
How old are you, man?

647
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:58,969
I got this phone.

648
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,662
Hello.

649
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:04,899
Morning.

650
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,974
- <i>What happened?</i>
- What do you mean, what happened?

651
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,424
I took the kids to school.

652
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:11,002
Well, why didn't you wake me?

653
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:14,370
You were out.
I figured, let you sleep.

654
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:16,881
Well, what'd you tell the kids?

655
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:19,459
- You were tired.
- <i>What'd they say?</i>

656
00:43:20,268 --> 00:43:22,252
They didn't say anything.

657
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:24,894
Good.

658
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:27,766
I'm sorry you had to
do the morning alone.

659
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:31,474
It's okay. It's fine.

660
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:33,489
Yeah, it sounds like it.

661
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:38,776
Katie, you oversleeping
is the least of our problems.

662
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:43,948
Bye.

663
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,950
Bye.

664
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,735
A panic attack?

665
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:51,543
Yeah. It was scary.

666
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,385
Have you had one before?

667
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,418
No, why?
Am I gonna have another one?

668
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,313
Probably not, but

669
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,007
a panic attack is a warning sign.

670
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,075
It's the body's alarm system
going off.

671
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:06,100
That's a good description.

672
00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:12,010
Anyway, it's over now, so...

673
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:14,098
Good.

674
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:25,202
I quit my job.

675
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:31,434
- Yeah, the day of his attack.
- That's not why I had it.

676
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,994
No, I'm not saying that's why
you had it. I'm just saying,

677
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:38,419
the day I quit my job,
when I needed you,

678
00:44:38,618 --> 00:44:40,138
you had a panic attack.

679
00:44:40,993 --> 00:44:41,993
Yeah, I did.

680
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:45,863
Well, that's fucking scary.

681
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,014
We're pregnant, I don't have a job,

682
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,021
and you're disappearing
in front of my eyes.

683
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,264
You quit your job
without even telling me.

684
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:02,852
It's the first time in my life I depend
on someone, and now I find I can't.

685
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,427
And that's, just hard.

686
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:09,745
I'm sorry, have I not been clear?

687
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:13,107
I mean, you know how I feel
about all this.

688
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,501
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

689
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,236
Carolyn, how does he feel?

690
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,181
Scared?

691
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:35,953
I wanna get us back
to where we were, you know?

692
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:39,770
I-I know that I may have been
too focused on getting pregnant,

693
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,398
and maybe I stopped listening

694
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,038
but I'm here now
and I want to now, so...

695
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:48,685
Good.

696
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:58,560
You lost faith that you were

697
00:45:59,475 --> 00:46:00,920
gonna get pregnant.

698
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:10,371
I lost faith that we should.

699
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:23,517
Yeah, I want to be a good husband,

700
00:46:23,682 --> 00:46:25,619
I can be a good husband, but...

701
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:29,866
I don't think I can

702
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,890
be a good husband and a father.

703
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,047
I don't have it in me.

704
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,187
What do you need me to do?

705
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:51,748
I've said I'll wait,
I've said I'll stay,

706
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:52,997
I've said--

707
00:46:53,298 --> 00:46:56,127
What do you need from me?
What do you need me to do?

708
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:07,048
I think it might be too late f--

709
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:15,665
I think we should spit up.

710
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:22,370
Why?

711
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm not happy.

712
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,687
I've been for a long time.
