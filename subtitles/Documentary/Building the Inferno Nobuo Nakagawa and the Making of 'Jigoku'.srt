{\a6}Episode 31 {Final}

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,770
Mom.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,320
What?
Bring forward the wedding?

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,140
Maybe tomorrow,

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,890
let's get their wedding done.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,650
Why?
Why are you doing this?

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,350
Ah, that is...

9
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:41,351
We won't be the only ones
keeping Sang Eun with us,

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,580
I want Yeo Jun to be with her
as soon as possible.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,390
It's good to add one more to our family.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,940
Yes, I see, that's why Yeo Jun says
he wants to go to America?

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,550
Yes, that seems to be the case.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,220
What should we do, Mother?

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,530
What else can we do?

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's do according to the children's wishes.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,130
I have already given approval to the wedding.

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,620
Yes, Mother,
I approve of their wedding too.

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,660
Why are you looking at me?

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,720
Now, Noona, you are the problem.

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,400
Don't you know?

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,840
What illness is Sang Eun's mother having?

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,700
Why do you have to know that?

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,510
Are you going to object to their
wedding because of this illness?

25
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,860
Honey!

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,280
Hey, if you dare speak nonsense
again then I'll really...

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,000
divorce you, do you understand?

28
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,201
{\a6}Final Episode

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,980
Here, cappuccino.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,700
Do you think I can swallow this now?

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,380
At such a time, you must keep your spirits up,
your sister's fighting it too.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,240
Is there really no other solution?

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,960
Aren't you a doctor too?

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,600
Well, I don't know of a solution.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,630
I knew it.

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,000
You're just useless.

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not that I'm useless,

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,700
but this surgery is tough for anyone.

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,820
Then what's going to happen to my unni?

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
Hey,

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,290
if I can heal your unni's mother,

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,540
can you not go to America and marry me here?

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,360
What did you say?

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,550
Marry me!

45
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,020
If I settled this matter,

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,730
let's get married.

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,540
<i>Your call cannot be connected right now...</i>

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,560
Doctor,

49
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,770
who will do this operation?

50
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,370
Why do you care about this matter?

51
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,800
Sang Eun is your wife, isn't she?
Of course I care.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,390
My wife!
Are you out talking nonsense again?

53
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,580
If only the director can do the operation.

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,610
No matter how I look,
no one else can replace him.

55
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,600
The director is at Seattle right now.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,910
How did you know that?

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,220
Don't I have ears?

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,680
That's the problem.

59
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,700
Looks like we have to transfer her
to another hospital.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Director's on the plane, coming back now.

61
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,480
Oh, you don't have to get up.

62
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,220
No, I should.

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,380
My heart was worried so I came.

64
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,500
Since I know about it,
I can't just let it be.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,320
This is not something for you to worry about,
Yeo Jun's mom.

66
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,780
My health has always been like this.

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,960
But why aren't you agreeing to do the surgery?

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,790
When I first heard the hospital telling me
it's cancer and a difficult operation,

69
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,350
I thought it was a justified punishment
for my abandoning Sang Eun.

70
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,840
How can you say that?

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,220
It's not like you did it purposely,

72
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
you didn't even know she was alive,

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,010
others who are worse than
you are still living happily.

74
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,430
<i>I too,</i>

75
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,440
said horrible things,
from my perspective for my child's sake.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,440
So I feel a little guilty.

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,180
I mentioned things I shouldn't have said.

78
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,150
I'm sorry, Sang Eun's mother.

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,830
No,

80
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,310
please show favor to my Sang Eun.

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,090
That's the only wish I have.

82
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,960
Dad, I want this one.

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,420
Let me see.

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,740
Isn't this a little heavy?
What do you think?

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,690
It's pretty and looks sturdy too.

86
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,120
Jin Ju, you want this one?
You like it?

87
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,450
We'll take this and those other stuff too.

88
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,300
What do we buy next?

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,700
I need stationery too, over there.

90
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,730
Now, everything's ready, right?

91
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,610
But what about a lunch box,
don't we need that too?

92
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,370
Not sure. It's such a rush,
does she need a water bottle too?

93
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,550
Jin Ju's really starting school now.

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,100
Yes, I was so excited when I received
the school's notification of acceptance.

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,250
It was just a piece of paper.

96
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,100
Now, being with Jin Ju is so great.

97
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,620
I lost out so much in the past,

98
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,120
I'd never thought I'd be a father myself.

99
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes.

100
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,301
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,230
She's still so young, will she do well?

102
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,880
No problem, she's our daughter, you know.

103
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,381
Dr. Kim.

104
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,170
Director, I thought you were
on your way to Seattle?

105
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,690
I heard there was a difficult operation
waiting for me so I came back.

106
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,560
I tried so hard to reach you but in vain,

107
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,740
how did you find out?

108
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,390
Well, because this fella called me.

109
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,200
How exactly are you related to the patient?

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,690
I told you she's a family member.

111
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,130
If this surgery fails,

112
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,400
I won't get to marry, Father.

113
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,801
Father?

114
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,390
I didn't ask you.

115
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,680
Dr. Kim, is she a parent to you?

116
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,100
What? Ah, yeah.

117
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,670
She's my future mother-in-law.

118
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,200
I've looked at her medical reports,

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,000
it's not easy.

120
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,400
You know that, right?

121
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes, I know.

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Let's make all the preparation,

123
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,730
and decide on the surgery schedule.

124
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,231
Yes.

125
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,990
Your mom wants you to call.

126
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,120
All this time, thank you
for watching over this stupid fella.

127
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,621
Get busy now.

128
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,770
What's this?
Professor Min is your father?

129
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,071
Yes.

130
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,190
Impossible. How can you...?

131
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,440
Who do you take after?

132
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,370
Why can't you believe I'm his son?

133
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,640
So why did you hide it from me?

134
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,370
My father refused to let me reveal it.

135
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,700
If I'm not careful,
the whole hospital might find out.

136
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,300
But since I'm showing some result now,

137
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,800
I guess it's alright.

138
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,100
That's true,

139
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,000
I think I can appreciate
the director's sentiments.

140
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,500
How he must have been so burdened,
not to be able to reveal this in public!

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,530
Doctor!

142
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,610
No matter what you say, Hyo Eun is out!

143
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,400
- Hyungnim!
- Hyo Eun is out!

144
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,600
Now,

145
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,300
did you tell him I keep hitting your head?

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,610
I'm going to tell him now.

147
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,350
Doctor! Hyungnim!

148
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,830
Stay lying down.

149
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,030
I heard the surgery has been scheduled.

150
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,710
Dr. Min told you?

151
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,200
Yes.

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,670
He chats with me occasionally,

153
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,310
I think he likes Hyo Eun.

154
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,280
He's so impulsive.

155
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,100
But don't count on him too much,

156
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,170
Hyo Eun will be wasted on him.

157
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,200
When will your family
members come from America?

158
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,770
They must be very worried too.

159
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,570
They will arrive before the surgery.

160
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,080
They were shocked about
why I changed my mind.

161
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,170
I really wanted to attend
your wedding before the surgery.

162
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,570
We plan to get married after your surgery.

163
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,080
So if you want to attend the wedding,

164
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,360
recover well from the surgery then.

165
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,150
I want to show you something.

166
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:53,351
What is it?

167
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,300
It's one month after the surgery.

168
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,760
It's held at the hospital here so
you can attend it without any worry.

169
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,930
When did you get that ready?

170
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,820
You fixed the date yourself too.

171
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,200
I told you, I can't wait any longer.

172
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,070
Hesitating, going back and forth like this.

173
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,000
Why? Aren't you happy with it?

174
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,900
It's not about whether I'm happy or not,

175
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,850
Grandfather and Grandmother will
surely blow their top about this.

176
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,340
No matter what,

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,320
the date cannot be changed.

178
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,470
I've made arrangements for everything.

179
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,700
It's still a little tight on time,

180
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
how can we get everything ready?

181
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,900
That's why our honeymoon has to wait,

182
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,710
I can't get away from work.

183
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,100
And Mother-in-law will
still be warded here too.

184
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,000
You're really thorough in your planning.

185
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,030
Of course, I've always been very meticulous.

186
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,410
But Mother's surgery will be fine, right?

187
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,410
Yes, don't worry.

188
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,300
I can't help worrying.

189
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,580
I really hate hospitals.

190
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,970
What can you do?

191
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,680
Now, your husband is a doctor too.

192
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:34,281
That's right.

193
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes, I mentioned this the last time,

194
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
marriage is out.

195
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,400
This marriage is detrimental to us.

196
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,300
I never ever make such a bad deal.

197
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,450
Dad!

198
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,530
Am I some product?
What deal are you making?

199
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,180
Can you explain why it is a bad deal to you?

200
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,500
What is it you can do for our Hye Rim?

201
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,840
It seems nothing at all.

202
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,700
Well...

203
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,850
<i>I heard you're so busy with work,</i>

204
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,010
so you have no time to
take care of our Hye Rim, do you?

205
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,850
And the elders in your family is a problem too.

206
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,240
We can handle it well.

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,685
<i>What's the use of just talk?</i>

208
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,000
His family member even left home,

209
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,850
why must you find your way in then?

210
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,100
That's exactly what I mean.

211
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,350
There might be a chance
if you leave home like your brother,

212
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,480
otherwise no way.

213
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:33,781
Of course.

214
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,150
Since we're done talking, you may leave.

215
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,700
I have to make a trip to the beauty salon.

216
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,930
Stepmother!

217
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,900
I'll come on time to get you.

218
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,800
If your mother doesn't feel well, just call me.

219
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,050
- I'll come right away.
- I know.

220
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,900
Thank you.

221
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,350
Mother-in-law, don't tire yourself out
before the surgery, alright?

222
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,100
I know, my son.

223
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,500
Yeo Jun is such a good man.

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,280
That's him now, he wasn't
like this at the beginning.

225
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,100
I know.
I heard you guys quarreled a lot.

226
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,600
Quite a lot, all right.

227
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:48,750
If I stayed with you for good,
what is it you most wanted us to do?

228
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,080
Nothing special to others, I guess,

229
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,500
like picking out your clothes,

230
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,580
tying up your hair,

231
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,030
my daughter linking arms with
me on a walk, things like that.

232
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,730
I have such memories actually.

233
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,010
Yes, that's great.

234
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,200
In Australia,

235
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
on weekends when my friends and their moms,

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,770
go to museum galleries or amusement parks,

237
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,510
Hyo Eun and I only get to go to the park.

238
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,470
I didn't get to appreciate paintings,

239
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,770
so I've always been envious.

240
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,890
I don't know how to appreciate paintings too.

241
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:40,491
Even so,

242
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,740
just looking at you is good enough for me.

243
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,141
Shall we sit?

244
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,800
After the surgery,
I think I can call you 'Mom'.

245
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,100
Hyo Eun already calls you 'Mom',
did you know?

246
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,340
Yes, I know.

247
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,690
That you're not all alone,
I'm so grateful there's Hyo Eun with you.

248
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:02,040
I've always been so curious about
how and who you grew up with.

249
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,440
I was too ashamed.

250
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:10,941
Just once before I died,

251
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:18,940
just look at you from afar and leave.

252
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,310
But I got greedy when I saw you.

253
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,100
To fill my eyes with you,

254
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,601
to talk to you

255
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:37,802
and to hold you.

256
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,720
I will wait for you so be well.

257
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,080
If you left me again this time,

258
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,781
I'd really get angry with you.

259
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,800
The surgery's tomorrow?

260
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:23,270
Yes, Sang Eun is with her mother right now.

261
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:33,500
Have you heard from
Yeo Jun about the wedding?

262
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,260
Did he say he wanted to marry right away
and gave you the invitation card too?

263
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,580
Yes, too soon,
it's ridiculous to marry right away.

264
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,900
There's nothing we can do,
Yeo Jun already fixed the date.

265
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,700
Whether we're there or not,
they will get married.

266
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,700
Yes, no matter how much they want it,
what are we doing to do?

267
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,350
What else can we do?
Let them marry then.

268
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,900
We need to make preparations,
we can't skip that.

269
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,600
Where to live?
She can just move in here.

270
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,470
What else is there to prepare for?

271
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,550
Let them live apart,
why must they live here?

272
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,050
Daughter-in-law!

273
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:27,500
- If you hate Sang Eun that much, let's just...
- No, it's not like that.

274
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,300
<i>Yeo Jun and Sang Eun both
have their own jobs,</i>

275
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,000
if they lived here, it'll be tough on them.

276
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,060
I don't want to bring other people's
daughter in here to suffer.

277
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,450
So have you been suffering all this while?

278
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,540
Yes, Mother-in-law, it's tough.

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,550
Since we're on this topic,

280
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
of course it's better for two persons
to live alone.

281
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,140
Also I heard from Yeo Jun that Sang Eun's
mother can't go to America right away,

282
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,450
so Sang Eun will be kept busy.

283
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,620
Just let them live apart, Mother-in-law.

284
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
Did you have fun?

285
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,230
Long overdue.

286
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,231
Well done.

287
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:36,232
What?

288
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,730
Everything.

289
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,331
Yeo Jun.

290
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,050
Yes, Mother-in-law?

291
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,050
There's something else I want to do
before I go back.

292
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,270
Kyu Han, no single shots.

293
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,600
No need for that yet.

294
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,900
Yes, no single shot
but we'll do family shots then.

295
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,850
<i>What are you doing?</i>

296
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,480
Yes, Yeo Jun should be in the picture too.

297
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,430
Alright.

298
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,850
When you get married,
I won't be in the picture.

299
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,460
Mother-in-law.

300
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,000
With cancer treatment, I'd lose my hair.

301
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,420
I'd look terrible.

302
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,500
Before that, I'd take a picture with
my son-in-law looking good like this.

303
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,010
<i>Ready, 1... 2... 3!</i>

304
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,120
- Oh my.
- Aigoo.

305
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,030
What brings you here?

306
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,850
Am I not supposed to come here?

307
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,610
This is my daughter-in-law's house.

308
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,080
Who is your daughter-in-law?

309
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,500
Since my granddaughter is here,
of course this is my in-law's house.

310
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,530
How can you act as you wish?

311
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,270
I've always been an unreasonable man.

312
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm going to have my way again
this time so I came.

313
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,800
<i>I already told Yun Hee
but there was no response.</i>

314
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,200
So I thought maybe there was
family objections.

315
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:38,500
Well, it's not that we object,
Yun Hee hasn't decided yet.

316
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,960
Then the elders should chase her,
what are elders for?

317
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,410
<i>Please give Yun Hee to us.</i>

318
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,010
It wasn't so long ago he objected
to her now he wants her.

319
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,860
That was then, it's been so long
after that now.

320
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,470
You have your grandson, granddaughter
and even a great-grandchild in your house,

321
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,600
don't you feel sorry
for my son who lives alone?

322
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,660
And I who live in a big house alone,
don't you feel sorry for me?

323
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,020
- Ah, really.
- What?

324
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,300
So you want them with you after marriage?

325
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,600
Can't I?

326
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,370
No, you can't.
Definitely not.

327
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,800
Then I will lie down right here in this house,

328
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,730
no matter how, I won't leave
without my daughter-in-law.

329
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,731
Let's go.

330
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,300
Oh, Father.

331
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,010
This stupid kid, let's go.

332
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,850
Father.

333
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,300
So, you will be getting married?
Is that true?

334
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,000
Not right away but we will in future.

335
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm sorry.
I should have informed you earlier.

336
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,730
Sorry.

337
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,800
Why wait for later?

338
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,801
Just get married now.

339
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,700
Yes, isn't it better to do it
before Jin Ju starts school?

340
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,990
We should let Yeo Jun get married first.
Can we do it at the same time?

341
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,480
You can sure do so.

342
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,450
Mom,

343
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,751
I'm finally getting married for the first time,

344
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,690
unlike someone who's
doing it second time round,

345
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,130
am I adopted so I do it in a hurry?

346
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,250
I want my second marriage
to be a good one with smiles.

347
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,010
And I'm busy currently,

348
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,890
orders for new products
have risen significantly,

349
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,610
Uncle can't manage by himself.

350
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,900
Yes, do things appropriately.

351
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,001
Earning money is good,

352
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,130
but to neglect the family while
earning money, that's not good.

353
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,000
I understand.
I will never make this mistake again.

354
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,370
And once the current things are all done,

355
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,950
I will take care of Jin Ju and Yun Hee
for the rest of my life.

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,680
To me, nothing is more
important than the family.

357
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,180
Alright, that's good.

358
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,850
Now I can trust you and give Yun Hee to you.

359
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,980
Thank you, Father-in-law.

360
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:28,800
But about this marriage thing,
it is her decision,

361
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,800
I have no power over her.

362
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,260
Mother-in-law, I will be good
to Jin Ju and Yun Hee too.

363
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,500
Of course, what else will you say?

364
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,500
But will you move home after the marriage?

365
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,990
Will you be living with your father?

366
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,810
Stay calm, you will collapse
if you go on like this.

367
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,950
Why hasn't the surgery ended yet?

368
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,670
I shouldn't have been stubborn
and just followed her to America.

369
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,040
I still don't know what she likes,

370
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,310
we have yet to go traveling hand-in-hand,

371
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,060
we haven't slept together neither,

372
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,320
nor have I told her I love her.

373
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,110
You can still do all that, surely.

374
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,580
Everything you want to do,
your mother will be able to do it.

375
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,940
Sang Eun, your mother is fighting hard
in there by herself,

376
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,890
you mustn't waver out here.

377
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,860
We can't give up yet.

378
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,100
I made a mistake,
I should have called her 'Mom' everyday,

379
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,240
I should have called her that.

380
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,900
How's my mom?

381
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,650
The surgery went well.

382
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,800
The parts it spread to, have been removed,

383
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,300
the cancerous parts have been
taken out successfully too.

384
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,700
Her condition is good,
you can expect a good recovery.

385
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,600
Thank you very much, Director.

386
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,520
Thank you, thank you.

387
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,820
Are you awake?

388
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,421
Mother-in-law.

389
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,222
Mother-in-law.

390
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,410
Can you hear me?

391
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:33,611
<i>That's good.</i>

392
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,950
Sang Eun was so anxious.

393
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,570
Mom.

394
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,300
You've worked hard.

395
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,100
I didn't do anything,
Director, you did the surgery.

396
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,380
You knew how risky the surgery was, right?

397
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,960
Without God's help,
she may not have survived.

398
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,200
You and your fiancé must have moved God.

399
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh yes, I heard you're getting
married soon, congratulations!

400
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,870
Thank you, for everything.

401
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,210
[3 months later]

402
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:42,311
<i>{\a6}You are my love</i>

403
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,002
<i>{\a6}Open your heart</i>

404
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:49,213
<i>{\a6}and let me shine in you</i>

405
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:56,014
<i>{\a6}So that my heart towards you can grow</i>

406
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,360
What time is it?

407
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,240
Oh dear! We're late.

408
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,241
Mother.

409
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,200
Hey, you're leaving without breakfast again?

410
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,080
Yes, we're late.

411
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,910
Why are you late everyday?

412
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,790
The two of you work so hard,
are you taking care of yourselves?

413
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,630
We're leaving now, Mother.

414
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,931
Sang Eun...

415
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,910
- I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.
- Come over here for a minute.

416
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,800
- Drink this.
- What?

417
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,420
You skip breakfast therefore
you must at least drink this.

418
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:49,121
And mine?

419
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,600
You're late, right?
Go get the car first.

420
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,140
Sang Eun, drink slowly.

421
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,541
Alright.

422
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,300
This is the x-ray for a typical case
of rheumatoid arthritis in the knee.

423
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,690
Different from osteoarthritis,
the bones aren't eroded

424
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,391
and the bone around the joint...

425
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,500
You look very busy.

426
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,510
Not just look like, I'm really very busy.

427
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,400
I've drafted out the contract,

428
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,910
and I've prepared the materials for
the special lawsuit case, alright?

429
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:29,011
<i>Okay.</i>

430
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,700
But don't perform too well,

431
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,200
recently there's been rumors that
you're working so hard,

432
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
while I'm enjoying the fruit of your labor.

433
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,160
Performing well as a newly-wed too.

434
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,061
Yeo Jun?

435
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes, this cake is good.
Oh honey, the phone's ringing.

436
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,900
Hello, this is the rice cake shop.

437
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,020
Welcome.

438
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,321
Ah, yes. Yes.

439
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,710
Noona is inside.

440
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,380
- I know.
- Welcome.

441
00:30:58,381 --> 00:30:59,381
<i>- Yes, thank you.
- Yes.</i>

442
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,800
- Yes.
- Please look around.

443
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,000
Why come back so early?

444
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,200
Take Sang Eun out to a restaurant,

445
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,750
then go visit her family.

446
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,110
You're really... treat your wife better!

447
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,090
- Was that Yeo Jun?
- Yeah.

448
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,790
You're too nice to
your daughter-in-law, aren't you?

449
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,200
That child is so well-mannered and obedient,
at times she's closer to me than a daughter.

450
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,700
Why are you laughing?

451
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,900
They say when people change, they die.

452
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,430
Don't you remember not too long
ago you objected to this marriage?

453
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,530
After she became family, I realized
there are no others better than her.

454
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,070
Is that why you don't bother
about the rice cake shop anymore?

455
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,300
I saw Bok Man having a good time there.

456
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,900
I've been doing it for 30 years,
I'm sick of it already.

457
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,900
Luckily, Bok Man and his wife reconciled too.

458
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,500
I decided to spend time at home instead.

459
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,100
Without ordering
your daughter-in-law around?

460
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,600
You're really... she's so busy,
why get her to do housework?

461
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,500
She's so busy that
my heart's already aching for her,

462
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,650
told her to live apart but she wouldn't.

463
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,230
You're so lucky.

464
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,200
The rice cake shop's doing well
and you got yourself a smart daughter-in-law.

465
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,490
What else is there to worry about?

466
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:17,191
Why?

467
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,700
Kyu Han's not intending to settle down?

468
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,170
Well...

469
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:25,001
Ah, what time is it now?

470
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,400
- It's past 3pm already.
- Oh my.

471
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,500
Hey, you just came, you're leaving already?

472
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,500
Hey Jin Hee!

473
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,700
Kyu Han, Kyu Han!

474
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,900
I thought so.

475
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,100
You didn't go again?
Oh, what wrong with you!

476
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,630
Aigoo, I forgot.

477
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,300
There are some things you shouldn't forget.

478
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,900
You know how hard it was for me
to fix up this matchmaking session?

479
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,950
You know how good a woman she is?

480
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,000
But you stood her up!

481
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,900
I was busy.

482
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,100
I won't forget next time, I'll show up.

483
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,500
How can you be so laid back?

484
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,370
Your sister's about to marry
into a rich family, you know.

485
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,700
Hye Rim is going to marry that man?

486
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,900
I don't know.

487
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,700
No matter how much we object,
she insists on marrying him.

488
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,200
That's worrying.

489
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,050
What will happen to her
if she marries into that family?

490
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,900
Thank you so much.

491
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,270
- Have a good day.
- You too. Bye.

492
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm not late, am I?

493
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,250
Earlier than I expected.

494
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,650
I didn't want you to wait,

495
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,430
so I dashed over like the wind.

496
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,031
Really?

497
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,450
Let's go eat.

498
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,850
Mother wants me to take you out.

499
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,150
Kalgooksoo*?
(*knife-cut noodle soup)

500
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,440
Am I being punished again?

501
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:57,801
No,

502
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,800
I just feel like eating this today.

503
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,600
Is it true you just feel like eating this?

504
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,591
That's what I said.

505
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,500
If there's anything you're
upset about, just tell me.

506
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,340
I will apologize or explain for it.

507
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,560
I feel like eating this, that's all.

508
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,800
But I feel like eating soojaebi* too.
(*dough soup)

509
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,300
Whether it's kalgooksoo or soojaebi,

510
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,300
I can have it for one meal.

511
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,100
Wow, you can really eat.

512
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,810
For dessert, would you like
red bean bread and cake also?

513
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:31,811
Cake...

514
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,720
Shall we?

515
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,800
Please give your approval, Father.

516
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,850
But Hyo Eun doesn't want to,
what am I to do?

517
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,300
You ridiculous man.

518
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,070
Really.

519
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,010
Hyo Eun, what do you think
of this young man?

520
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,640
What can I think about?
Just so-so.

521
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,600
She thinks you're so-so.

522
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
So you'll get just 71 points, dang!

523
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,500
Grandfather!

524
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,300
If there's anyone else
who's better qualified than me,

525
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,990
So what kind of qualifications have you got?

526
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,380
The one who did the surgery for
that aunt was my father, right?

527
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,500
Then we should just thank your father.
Why must I marry you, Chul Ho?

528
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,250
Yes, that's true.

529
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,700
That makes sense, that's right.

530
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,990
<i>Hey, so are you going to marry my father?</i>

531
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,791
You should marry me, of course.

532
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,200
Ah, that sounds correct too.

533
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,020
But I...

534
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,300
- We're here.
- Yes.

535
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,900
Sang Eun, you're here.

536
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,390
Sang Eun,

537
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,800
hey Yeo Jun,

538
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,080
why did you come along?
Just let Sang Eun come on her own.

539
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,200
Father-in-law, that's too much.

540
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,200
Have you eaten?

541
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,770
Yes, we have.

542
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,500
Why do you keep bothering
my sister-in-law?

543
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,620
Brother-in-law, settle it for me quickly.

544
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,330
It must be really quiet at that health center.

545
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,230
I'm busy, you know.

546
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,500
Doctor, the rest won't help me
but you ought to help me, right?

547
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,350
Whether you want to marry or to date,

548
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,090
finish your studies first
then I'll think about it.

549
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,650
But what do you possess that
I will give my sister-in-law to you?

550
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,660
Doctor...
Hyungnim!

551
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,340
Aigoo.

552
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,000
This is my room, how dare you enter!

553
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,700
Hyo Eun, let's get married.

554
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,500
Didn't you hear Yeo Jun oppa?

555
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,800
He told you to finish up
at the health center first.

556
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,900
I have to stay there for some years,
you know. How can it wait till then?

557
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,250
That's what I mean.
So how long must I wait for you?

558
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,140
Why wait? You just have to leave
and go somewhere, that'll work.

559
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,450
The air in my hometown is really good.

560
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,700
Hey, let's get married, alright?
Han Hyo Eun!

561
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,700
- I told you no!
- Why not!

562
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,750
Ah, really! Ah! Ah, really!

563
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,750
We have to check it out.
Two of them in there alone.

564
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,250
Don't bother, every month
they put on the same show.

565
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,950
Sang Eun,

566
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,100
does Grandmother mistreat you at all?

567
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,280
Aigoo, Father-in-law, really.

568
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:12,081
- Really!
- Nothing like that,

569
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,260
she treats me so well.

570
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,350
I don't think so.

571
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,100
The grandmother at your in-laws
doesn't have such a nice personality.

572
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,200
<i>Although I approved because your mother was
sick and we got your wedding done in a hurry,</i>

573
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,900
<i>I will still keep an eye in future.</i>

574
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:33,900
If ever one drop of tear flows out of
my Sang Eun's eyes,

575
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,930
you will cry 100 drops of tears of regret,
do you understand?

576
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,300
Sang Eun is not one to just cry, you know.

577
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,080
Yes, my daughter sure has a violent temper.

578
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,800
Oh yes, have you seen your mother?

579
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,050
Of course, whenever I have the time I go.

580
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,400
- What? What?
- What?

581
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,250
Father, Hyo Eun is violent enough,
why do you teach her Judo too?

582
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,500
My arm's about to break.

583
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,400
I haven't used all my strength yet.

584
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,250
Yes, you haven't used all your strength yet.

585
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,330
That's why I'm never worried
about my granddaughters.

586
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,000
You learn Judo too?

587
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,210
I'm at a higher level than Hyo Eun too.

588
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,900
What's wrong with our family
that you have to keep objecting?

589
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,200
Well...

590
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,020
Your family is not the usual family, right?

591
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,550
I'm not sure what you may have heard,

592
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,190
it's all in the past.

593
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,000
Actually we're hoping for a son-in-law
who will marry into our family.

594
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,270
This man has only Hye Rim, one child.

595
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,600
That's fine.

596
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,750
I have one other son,
although he keeps me worried,

597
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,210
we've decided to live together.

598
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,100
Really?

599
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,490
So you mean it's not a problem?

600
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,040
Yes, just one daughter-in-law
is good enough for me.

601
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,350
Ah, Yun Hee?

602
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,000
Is it true they're getting married next month?

603
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,250
Well, that's good.

604
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,900
For the sake of Yun Hee,
it's better not to have Hye Rim around.

605
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,710
- Honey!
- You scared me.

606
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,750
But is it alright for you to approve so easily?

607
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,950
It's all the same,

608
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:44,200
people think they're the most special in the
world but the world revolves without them,

609
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,400
and they think money solves all
the problems but it's not true.

610
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,700
I know I've done too many things
I shouldn't have.

611
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:58,200
<i>So I've told my younger son that
he should do whatever he likes.</i>

612
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,700
I didn't expect that he
likes working in the company.

613
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,487
Do you mind that?

614
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,467
The most important thing is that he likes it.

615
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
If he likes it, he should continue to do it.

616
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,950
So I'll take him as my son-in-law then.

617
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,170
But do you quarrel like this everyday?

618
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,580
Father says I can go back to school.

619
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,030
So?

620
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,500
But I don't want that,

621
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,500
I'd like to work in the company.

622
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,000
That's fine.

623
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,410
Do the work which you like to do.

624
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,030
Then I'll be really busy.

625
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,140
Is that alright with you?

626
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,400
We'll just be busy together.

627
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,580
I'm confident I can be a good wife to you.

628
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,200
You will do very well,

629
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,790
you always try your best.

630
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,900
I like busy men,

631
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,800
I like ambitious men too.

632
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,700
But if you should stray,

633
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,370
I will make you disappear
without anyone knowing.

634
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,100
To keep my life,
I mustn't go astray then.

635
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,200
So about your mother-in-law,

636
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,320
there's nothing to worry about, right?

637
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,700
Of course she has to continue with her treatment,
this is only the start of the treatment.

638
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,200
- You must spend some effort.
- That's right.

639
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,200
Your mother-in-law is family too, understand?

640
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,290
Yes, I understand.

641
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,650
Sang Eun, are you not feeling well?

642
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,460
You don't look too good.

643
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,900
I don't think my stomach's
agreeing with the kalgooksoo.

644
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,600
Kalgooksoo?!

645
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:32,110
I told you to take her out to a nice restaurant,
and you got her noodles instead!

646
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:36,550
It wasn't me,
Sang Eun insisted on having it so we went.

647
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,850
Why are you looking at me like that?

648
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,950
If you must find me guilty,
I'm only guilty of eating it with her, that's all.

649
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,350
It's alright, I'm fine.

650
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,750
Aigoo, oh dear.

651
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,300
Go on up and rest.

652
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,040
- Why do you still sit here? Go on up.
- Yes, go.

653
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:55,341
Alright.

654
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,600
Aren't you going with her?
She's not feeling well as it is.

655
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,700
Do you know how uncomfortable
an upset stomach feels?

656
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,260
<i>Aren't you a doctor?
You don't know anything.</i>

657
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,470
<i>Who does he take after?</i>

658
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,350
Why? Are you still feeling sick?

659
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,712
I should have guessed.

660
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,000
You ate so much noodles,
of course you'll get indigestion.

661
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,500
This won't do, take some medication.

662
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,898
Forget it.

663
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,250
I'll just drink some plum tea.

664
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,020
Strange, why is my stomach
so uncomfortable?

665
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,221
What?

666
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,722
Strange.

667
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,720
Pregnant?

668
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,500
Aren't you?

669
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,540
Of course not,
it's only been a few days.

670
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,500
It can't be!

671
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,080
You're too slow as usual!

672
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,150
Where are you going?

673
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:07,451
Hospital!

674
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,350
Look at the time.

675
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,400
What's wrong with now?

676
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,520
It's already 11pm. You can't be telling me
to go to the ER for being pregnant, right?

677
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,090
But what if you're really pregnant?

678
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,640
Why? You don't like children?

679
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,900
No, I like children.

680
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,970
I'm the only son in 5 generations, you know.

681
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,800
Then what's wrong?

682
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,100
Of all the cuisines,

683
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,650
why must it be noodles?

684
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,200
That's true.

685
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,230
So for the next 10 months,
you'll just eat noodles?

686
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,000
Judging from today,

687
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,470
I think so.

688
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,600
What? You hate it?

689
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,690
No, I like it.

690
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,100
When did you get here?

691
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,470
Have you settled all the problems?

692
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,100
Yes, all settled.

693
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,200
Since I was in LA,
I bought the master franchise for America.

694
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,890
Now you, I and Jin Ju,
our family can truly be together now.

695
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,300
Even though your father said
I don't have to get anything,

696
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,310
I'd like to get the bed,
study table and wardrobe changed.

697
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,440
And the sofa at the upstairs
lounge has lost its bounce too,

698
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,070
can you pass the message to him for me?

699
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,240
You went to our place?

700
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,760
Yes.

701
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,330
Yun Hee!

702
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,010
What?

703
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,560
So you're really going to live at our place?

704
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,550
You don't have money, right?

705
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,100
No matter what, I'm the elder
daughter-in-law in your family, right?

706
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,850
Moreover, what if that cunning
Hye Rim changes her mind?

707
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,060
I'm afraid if I don't move in there,
Hye Rim will do so.

708
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,061
What?

709
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,820
I'm so moved.

710
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,100
I... I'm eyeing your family assets,

711
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
since my husband himself is so poor.

712
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,650
No, I mean this feels like
we're back to old times,

713
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,400
like how naggy you were years ago...

714
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,700
Naggy?

715
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,900
it's how sweet and happy,
always with a smile on your face,

716
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,487
everything's good about you.

717
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:33,201
Is that true?

718
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,250
It must be, except for those 6 years
I suffered because of someone.

719
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,000
Sorry, sorry.

720
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,100
Yun Hee! Yun Hee!

721
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,580
Mother's birthday cake...

722
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,630
Uh, that... that...

723
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:47,131
Uh... come downstairs.

724
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:48,932
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

725
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,580
That's right,
today is my grandmother's birthday.

726
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,900
That's why they say daughters are useless.
I didn't help my mother with anything.

727
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,050
Then our next child should be a son,
no, we should have twins.

728
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,300
You! Go on!

729
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,450
I know. Oh, more patrons here now.

730
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,350
Welcome!

731
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,090
Yeah, please sit over there.

732
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,240
So my great-grandchild will be born soon.

733
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,800
What do you mean by your great-grandchild?
That's my great-grandchild too.

734
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,520
Sang Eun's child is my great-grandchild,
of course.

735
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,600
Mother, Father-in-law,

736
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,150
who cares whose great-grandchild that is?

737
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,340
Anyhow, it's good news for our family.

738
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,910
Sang Eun's mother, how do you
feel being a grandmother now?

739
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,900
I'm already very happy as it is.

740
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,700
In-law, you must look after yourself.

741
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,920
Then you can see how
grandchild will act coy to you.

742
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,470
<i>Have some tea.</i>

743
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:53,171
- Does it taste good?
- Yup.

744
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,993
Go sit down.
You're pregnant now, you know.

745
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,450
You can't be doing so much.

746
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,650
I'm fine, Mother-in-law.

747
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,500
Who says you're fine? Go and rest.

748
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,760
Everyone's so busy and I have to lie down,
I won't feel good, Mother-in-law.

749
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,990
I told you to live apart but you won't listen.
It's better two of you live apart, right?

750
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,450
It's better to live with the elders.

751
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,770
And Yeo Jun says that
we move to America next year,

752
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,970
he will serve my mother too.

753
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,600
Yes, that's fair.
Only daughters-in-law should suffer?

754
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,000
As a daughter-in-law, I never suffered,

755
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,450
but Yeo Jun may have
to marry into my family.

756
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,850
Aigoo, let him suffer it out over there.

757
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,850
You, make sure you have full control,
don't be like me.

758
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,540
She's already got her hold on me.

759
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,000
Really?

760
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,600
So you think that's not enough?

761
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,650
Be good to your wife.

762
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,400
So that you'll live a good life.

763
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,800
Yes, Mother.

764
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,350
Yes, my honorable wife.
Will that do?

765
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:51,751
<i>We're here!</i>

766
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,430
See, they're always late.

767
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,980
Can't they be here earlier?

768
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,370
But why must I sit here with this old man?

769
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,150
Aigoo, did you think
I like sitting here with you?

770
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,800
Our birthdays are a week apart,

771
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,200
I didn't want to trouble the kids,

772
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,650
so I'll just celebrate my birthday with yours.

773
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,510
Anyhow, I just don't like it with this old man.

774
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,440
Old...?

775
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,700
If I ever step into this house again,

776
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,170
Sang Eun, let's go.

777
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,660
Father-in-law, be nice.

778
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,350
You guys keep this up,
we'll head straight to America

779
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,791
and you both won't get to
see your great-grandchild.

780
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,870
<i>Oh this...</i>

781
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:37,751
- Ah, Please bear with it.
- Mother-in-law.

782
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,100
Aigoo, Father-in-law!

783
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,940
That's nothing to me but
a big problem for your grandmother.

784
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,887
What's a problem for me?

785
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,950
I believe I'll get to see
my great-grandchild get married,

786
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,200
but that's going to be impossible for you, right?

787
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,900
Gosh, aren't you naggy?
You want to live till then?

788
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,370
This world is so good, why should I leave?

789
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,900
Pretty old ladies everywhere here.

790
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,830
<i>What I'm trying to say is,</i>

791
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,100
how about we share the rest of our lives?

792
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,830
I'll introduce to you a stylish
and handsome old man too.

793
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,950
Aigoo, stop saying such stupid things.
Blow out the candles.

794
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,810
It's traditional cakes, you see.

795
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,590
But why didn't we use cakes from our shop?

796
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:33,040
Ah yea yeah...
The next birthday, we'll use western cakes.

797
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:39,400
The combined age of you two is 150 years,
happy birthday.
