[RADIO CHATTER]

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,100
Give 'em room!

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Hold the line, gentlemen! Look left, look right!

6
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Hold the line!

7
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,600
It's here. It's here.

8
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,600
Calm down, buddy!

9
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Let him go!

10
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Let him go! Let him go!

11
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,600
Easy. Easy. Let him go! Let him go!

12
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Here!

13
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Here! It's here!

14
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
It's here!

15
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,800
I've gone over the charts you've sent...

16
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,700
... and consulted another neurologist, who works with me here. We are alarmed by two things.

17
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,500


18
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,800
The deificiency in lipid metabolism and severely diminished enzyme output.

19
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Right. That's exactly right.

20
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,800
Both indicate Lysosomal Storage Illness

21
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Are you the boy's primary physician, Doctor...?

22
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,100
Scully. Dana Scully.

23
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,500
And you tested his lysosome function?

24
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,100
I think you have all my results there, doctor.

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,500
My fear is that it's a Type-2 degenerative brain disease like...

26
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,500
...Sandhoff Disease. That his enzymes aren't clearing the lypids from his brain, causing atrophy.

27
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,900
If you suspect Sandhoff Disease, I'd test the boy's levels of hexasaminidase.

28
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,700
I've done that. What I am looking for here, doctor, is a course of treatment.

29
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,900
There is no treatment for Sandhoff.

30
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
If there were, I'm sure you'd tell me.

31
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Hi, Christian. How are you feeling?

32
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Okay, Dr. Scully. How about you?

33
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Me? I'm doing just fine, thank you

34
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
You get some outside opinions?

35
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,800
Yes.

36
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
We're gonna do some more tests.

37
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,700
Dana Scully?

38
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,700
Doctor Scully, I'm looking for Fox Mulder.

39
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,600
- Special Agent Drummer. I'm with...
- I can guess who you're with.

40
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
The FBI urgently needs to speak with Fox Mulder.

41
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300
I don't work with Fox Mulder any longer. I don't work with the FBI...

42
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,700
If you could contact him...

43
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
... it might just save the life of an FBI agent.

44
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,300
What's up, Doc?

45
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,600
You've become awfully trusting, Mulder...

46
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
... for a man wanted by the FBI.

47
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Eyes in the back of my head, Scully. "Auf einer Wellenlange" the Germans say.

48
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,200
It's a precognitive state often confused with simple human intuition...

49
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,100
... in which the brain perceives deep logic, underlying transitory human existence, unaided by the conscious mind,...

50
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
... materializing much as you did just now.

51
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Although if you'd actually materialized, you'd be rapidly dematerializing.

52
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
But who believes that crap anymore?

53
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,100
Well, they do at the FBI, apparently. I had a visitor today, Mulder.

54
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,700
THE FBI wants your help finding a missing agent.

55
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,800
I hope you told them to go screw themselves?

56
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
They say 'all is forgiven'.

57
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,300
That they'll drop all charges against you if you come in and help them solve this case.

58
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
The FBI will forgive me?

59
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,300
They put me on trial on bogus charges and tried to discredit ...

60
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,100
... a decade of my work. They should be asking me for my forgiveness, Scully.

61
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,900
I think they are. Desperately.

62
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,700
How can I possibly help these people?

63
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,700
Someone's come forward with some promising evidence.

64
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,600
A psychic, he claims.

65
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
It's a trick, Scully, to smoke me out.

66
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,100
If the FBI wanted to get you, I've no doubt that they could.

67
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,200
I think they'd just be happy to have you out of their hair.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Good, because I'd be just as happy having them out of mine.

69
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,000
A young agent's life is at stake.

70
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,100
Mulder, I know I don't have to say this, but it could have been you once.

71
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,500
Or me.

72
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,300
You know, the truth is, I worry about you...

73
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,000
... and the effects of long-term isolation.

74
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,700
I'm fine here.

75
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm happy as a clam.

76
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,500
I'll tell them your answer.

77
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
(Whispers) Shit.

78
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,700
Okay, I'll go...

79
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,600
... under one condition.

80
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
Thanks for the lift!

81
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,300
Don't thank me! I didn't send it!

82
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,100
Wait here.

83
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Come in.

84
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Excuse me. They're here.

85
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Thanks for making this happen. I am special agent in charge Whitney.

86
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Dana Scully

87.
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,800
Fox Mulder, I believe?

88
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,700
I know this is awkward, but welcome back. My team and I appreciate your trust.

89
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,900
Well, trust being what it is, what if I can't help you? Or your agent turns up dead?

90
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,400
The past is the past.

91
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,100
I know your work on X-Files cases here and believe you to be the best chance Monica Bannan has now.

92
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
How long has she been missing?

93
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,300
Since Sunday evening.

94
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Almost three days.

95
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,500
I know you know this, but, after 72 hours, there's slim chance she's still alive.

96
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
We have some reason to believe that she is.

97
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,300
There so far, we have no evidence to the contrary. And the facts give us hope.

98
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,400
Soon after she goes missing, we find this. A severed arm.

99
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,100
- Where? 
- About ten miles from her home.

100
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,100
I don't understand. It's a man's arm.

101
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,100
It's a match for evidence found at or near the crime scene. Blood or tissue?

102
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,600
Blood. Found in her garage and on the tool that matches the wound.

103
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
- I take it you were led to it?
- Like a needle in a haystack.

104
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
By someone claiming psychic powers.

105
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,300
Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman.

106
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,600
- And you think he's full of shit. 
- What makes you say that?

107
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm psychic!

108
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
- Father Joe was... 
- Father?

109
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,800
- he was a priest? 
- Catholic.

110
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,300
He cold-called six hours after Monica Bannan was reported missing...

111
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
... claiming a vision of her. A psychic connection.

112
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,800
- And she tells you she's alive? 
- That's right.

113
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Have you found any other connection?

114
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,400
- To Monica Bannan?
- No. That's why I sent for you.

115
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
I need to know we're not wasting time.

116
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, he's a religious man, clearly. Educated man.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,900
He took right action. Said nothing to cast doubt upon himself. He has no material connection to the crime.

118
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
You are wasting time, only it's mine and your agents.

119
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
There is a question of credibility.

120
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,400
If you have no reason to doubt the man, why doubt the man's visions?

121
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Can he lead us to Monica Bannan? He gave us a man's bloody arm in the snow.

122
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,800
This is not an exact science. If it were me, I'd be on the guy 24/7. I'd be in bed with him...

123
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,600
... kissing his holy ass.

124
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,300
Father Joe is a convicted paedophile.

125
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe I'd stay out of bed with him.

126
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
What is this?

127
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
Dorms for habitual sex offenders.

128
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,200
Dorms?

129
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,200
They manage the complex and police themselves.

130
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Father Joe lives here voluntarily with his room-mate.

131
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,500
Just avoid the Activities Room.

132
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Joe?

133
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- Tell them to come in.

134
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Father Joe?

135
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Excuse the mess. I haven't been sleeping.

136
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
- Father Joe, this is Fox Mulder.
- Okay.

137
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,900
He'd like to ask some questions.

138
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,400
Actually, I'd like to ask something.

139
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
What was it you were praying for in there, sir?

140
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,000
For the salvation of my immortal soul.

141
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
And do you think God hears your prayers?

142
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,300
- Do you think He hears yours? 
- I didn't bugger thirty-seven altar boys.

143
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,600
That's a colorful way of putting it.

144
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,100
- I have another word, if you'd like.
- I'm sure you do.

145
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,800
I have to believe He does hear me. Or why would He send these visions?

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
Maybe it's not God doing the sending.

147
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
You call them visions.

148
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,300
Do you see them?

149
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
With what you might call 'my mind's eye'.

150
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
What do you see?

151
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
I see the poor girl being assaulted.

152
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,200
I see her putting up a fight.

153
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
I hear dogs barking.

154
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,900
Where?

155
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,700
Can't tell.

156
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600
But you see her alive?

157
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,300
No, but I...

158
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
... I feel that she is.

159
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,500
Can you show us how you do it?

160
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,800
I don't know if I can do this right now.

161
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,300
Maybe it would be better if she wasn't here.

162
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Maybe what you see is a way to try to make people forget what it is you really are.

163
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,900
Jesus, Mulder!

164
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,200
So much for kissing his holy ass.

165
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
I'm sorry.

166
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,800
I've been too long away from this business, or not long enough.

167
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
No, you were good in there.

168
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,900
All I had were questions.

169
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,200
But you pushed him, challenged him. Like old times.

170
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, he's a creep and a liar.

171
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
He knows who did this, and they're supplying him with information. Look where he lives!

172
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,700
And this arm they found?

173
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,100
This wasn't severed in any fight. It was cut cleanly, chopped off.

174
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,700
And tell me how he's been able to lead them straight to it...

175
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
... and not even muster a guess as to where the victim is.

176
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,600
And two things you're gonna find in the next 24 hours:

177
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,300
A dead agent and that this Father Joe is a big, fat fraud.

178
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,900
You could be right, Scully.

179
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,900
You could be right.

180
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,600
But what if you're wrong?

181
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,700
What are you doing?

182
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Gonna take him for a ride. See just how psychic this Father Joe really is.

183
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, well, have some fun.

184
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,300
Scully, it's gonna be me sitting next to him.

185
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,100
Thanks, but I've already been taken for a ride. Anyway, he doesn't want me there.

186
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,600
I want you here.

187
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,900
This isn't my life any more, Mulder.

188
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm done chasing monsters in the dark. I think you've done all they've asked of you here too.

189
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
You know, no-one says you have to stay here.

190
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,100
These people need my help.

191
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
And I could really use yours.

192
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
Are we getting warm?

193
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
You tell us.

194
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,900
I don't have a clue where we are.

195
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,500
That's all right. Everybody works differently.

196
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Are you the Good Cop?

197
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm a non-cop.

198
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
This girl...

199
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,000
... this agent Bannan of yours...

200
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,100
... I haven't a clue of the connection.

201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
There's always something, however small.

202
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,800
And who made you the expert?

203
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,900
I once investigated a series of cases involving unexplained phenomena for the FBI.

204
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,400
So you believe in these sort of things?

205
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,900
Let's just say I want to believe.

206
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,700
And his sister was abducted by E.T.

207
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Is that true?

208
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,100
It was a long time ago.

209
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,300
She's dead...

210
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,200
... Isn't she? Your sister.

211
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,600
This is where she was taken.

212
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Your agent.

213
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,000
This is where she was attacked.

214
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,600
I want him to see the crime scene.

215
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,800
No, it's...

216
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,800
This isn't right.

217
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,600
You've brought me to the wrong house.

218
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,200
Pulled that right out of his ass.

219
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,100
There were news crews out here, covering the scene. Maybe he recognized it from TV.

220
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,900
Yes, but why?

221
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
- Why? 
- Why do it?

222
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,000
Why go to such great lengths to create such an elaborate fiction?

223
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Expiation. Forgiveness of his sins.

224
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,600
He's written dozens of letters to the Vatican pleading re-engagement with the Church.

225
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,300
It's an odd way to impress the Holy See.

226
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,100
Voice of God speaking through a man? I think that's been a winner a few times.

227
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,000
So you think he's guilty too, huh?

228
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
We have to consider him a suspect.

229
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
But you've found no connection to the crime.

230
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Don't think my guys have stopped looking. And they think they're gonna find one.

231
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, but you don't, or I wouldn't be here.

232
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm not the most popular girl in the FBI right now for pulling you in here, believe me.

233
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,800
I wasn't exactly Miss Popularity at the FBI myself.

234
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,700
But you've dealt with psychics before.

235
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
Luther Lee Boggs, Clyde Bruckman, Gerald Schnauzer.

236
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I went through those cases. That work was extremely impressive.

237
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah well, I'm only half the team.

238
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
But it's your insights I need.

239
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,600
She ran way. She tried to escape.

240
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,100
There were two men. But she couldn't... He pushed her down.

241
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,000
It was here. It was right here.

242
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,000
And then they put her in. In the back.

243
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,500
- Where? 
- The car. No!

244
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,700
It was a truck, a truck with something on.

245
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,100
We have to find her!

246
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,300
She's in pain, great, great pain.

247
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,700
- Tell me Where! 
- I don't know. I can't see!

248
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,000
We need to find her!

249
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
I can't see!

250
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,600
'Cause he's pulling it out of his ass.

251
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Father Joe?

252
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,600
Hi, Christian.

253
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
You're looking very bright-eyed this morning.

254
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,300
I was thinking.

255
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,100
Yeah? What were you thinking?

256
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,900
How I'm going to get out of here.

257
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
Well, you know, I'm thinking exactly the same thing.

258
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
Can I get out of here soon?

259
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,900
What's wrong? Has something scared you?

260
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,900
The way the man is looking at me.

261
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,800
What man?

262
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't be afraid.

263
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,300
I was just looking for those.

264
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,500
I wanted to go over them myself and the results of new tests that you ordered.

265
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,800
That isn't really your purview, father. It's his primary physician's.

266
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,100
It is in my purview to see that all of my physicians are making the right choices.

267
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,100
For their patients and for the hospital.

268
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
Can I have the test results, please?

269
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,800
We are here to heal the sick...

270
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,900
... not prolong the ordeal of the dying.

271
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,700
There are other, better facilities for the boy.

272
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,500


273
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,300
I'm okay!

274
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm fine.

275
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,800
I can feel you thinking.

276
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,000
Sorry. I can't sleep.

277
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,100
I think I have a little something for that.

278
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
Just a little something?

279
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,500
Thank you.

280
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,300
What's the matter?

281
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,900
I have a patient. A young boy with a rare brain disease.

282
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
And he's very, very sick

283
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,100
Why haven't you told me about this before?

284
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
I thought there was something I could do.

285
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,100
There's not?

286
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,600
There's radical treatments, but nobody wants to talk about those.

287
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Even the experts say that nothing to be done.

288
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Nothing, but...

289
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,600
Nothing, but let him die.

290
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,100
So I'm lying here, cursing God for all His cruelties.

291
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,300
Do you think God is losing any sleep?

292
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,700
Why bring a kid into the world just to make him suffer?

293
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,100
I don't know, Mulder. I've got such a connection with this boy.

294
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,500
How old is he?

295
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,100
You think it's because of William?

296
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,000
I think our son left us both with an emptiness that can't be filled.

297
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,900
Just go to sleep.

298
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,100
Let me curse God for a while.

299
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,100
Thank you.

300
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
Scratchy beard.

301
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,000
- Oh, there was something weird on the toxicology report of the severed arm.
- What?

302
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
I looked over the FBI evidence reports again.

303
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
In the tissue there were traces of a drug ...

304
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,900
... that's commonly given to patients who've been injured by radiation...

305
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,500
... and traces of a drug called acepromazine.

306
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,500
Why is that weird?

307
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,900
Acepromazine is an animal tranquilizer.

308
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,900
Now I can't sleep.

309
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,800
Mulder?

310
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,000
What is animal tranquilizer doing in the tissue sample of a man's severed arm?

311
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,200
I can't even begin to speculate.

312
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,900
He said he heard barking dogs.

313
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,400
Who?

314
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,500
Father Joe.

315
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,800
Mulder, what are you doing?

316
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,600
Is this a tranquilizer you might give a dog?

317
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,500
He's a phoney, Mulder.

318
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
He pulls these so-called visions out of thin air and now he's got you straining to connect them.

319
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,900
When I see a man cry tears of blood at a crime scene he recognises without ever having visited...

320
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,300
... I need to go out on a limb. You know what I'm saying?

321
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,300
Tears of blood?

322
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,400
Some trick, huh? How do you fake that?

323
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,400
- Hello? 
- Doctor Scully?

324
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
I have Dakota Whitney for you.

325
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
Can you hold on a second?

326
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,500
I'm sorry to call at this hour.

327
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,800
- Has there been a break? 
- Dod they find her?

328
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,400
We're pursuing another lead.

329
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,000
The same source?

330
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Same source, new news.

331
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
It's here.

332
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,700
It's here. Turn up ahead. At the barn.

333
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,800


334
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,300
One more time. Ten minutes!

335
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,400
- Did you find her? 
- No.

336
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,800
What did you do?

337
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
You said there was news.

338
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,300
The news is our psychic led us the exact same site he led us to before.

339
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,900
We're gonna find it.

340
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
That's what you keep saying.

341
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,200
We're going to find the body.

342
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,600
- You keep telling us she's alive. 
- She is.

343
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,700
We can do this all night.

344
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,400
These guys are running on empty.

345
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm sorry for bringing you out here.

346
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,700
Hey! Let's go fellas!

347
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,500
Bring it in! Let's go! Bring it in, gentlemen!

348
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,100
It's time to go home!

349
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,900
Tell me.

350
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,700
Tell me what you see.

351
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
I see a face.

352
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,100
I see eyes staring out.

353
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,100
Who?

354
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Who is it?

355
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,600
It's unclear.

356
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,400
Like through dirty glass.

357
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
It's out there.

358
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,300
I know it.

359
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Scully, what does he mean "like through dirty glass"?

360
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,800
- Mulder
- What?

361
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,300
Stop!

362
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay, just feel free to give up like everybody else.

363
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
This is not my job any more, Mulder.

364
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,100
That's right. You're just like my booking agent now. Right?

365
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,700
You're right.

366
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,500
This is my fault.

367
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,200
What do you mean, it's your fault?

368
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,100
For getting you involved in this.

369
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,600
No. No. It was the right thing to do, Scully.

370
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
This is not about finding an FBI agent. 
This is about you trying to save your sister.

371
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,200
My sister is dead

372
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,100
it hasn't stopped you from looking for her.

373
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Mulder, I have been through this too many years with you believing you can save her.

374
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,500
You can not save her, not now, not ever.

375
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm gonna need those men back!

376
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,700
- What are you doing? 
- I'm trying to ignore you.

377
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,900
This it! here it is!

378
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,600
This is it.

379
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,100
We need shovels.

380
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,500
It's solid ice.

381
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,700
No. It's dirty glass.

382
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,400
Flashlight?

383
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,500
You're gonna need resources.

384
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,700
We need equipment! Concrete stays and a back hoe!

385
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
You two get on the line. You two, come with me.

386
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,200
Don't give up.

387
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,100
Please!

388
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,500
Get me out of here!

389
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Help!

390
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,900
Help!

391
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Let me out of here!

392
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Please. I won't tell anyone.

393
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,000
I won't tell anybody. Just let me go.

394
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,000
I just want to go home.

395
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,600
I did not mean to hit his truck.

396
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,500
I didn't mean to do it. I didn.t mean to hit your truck.

397
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
Wait, wait!

398
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,100
Where? Wait! No!

399
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,700
What is this place? Who are you?

400
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,200
Please! Just get me outta here.

401
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
Get up.

402
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,800
I can help you get outta here.

403
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,400
HELP!

404
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,000
I think we can resolve, then, in good conscience and without objection...

405
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,900
... to relocate the patient to a facility suited and more...

406
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,400
... humane to his condition.

407
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,200
As you and I discussed, Doctor Scully...

408
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,300
... I was just informing the staff and doctors of the hospital's decision on Christian Fearon.

409
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,700
I'm sorry? What decision?

410
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,300
To relocate the patient to a hospice who will manage his palliative care.

411
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,100
That was a discussion, not a decision.

412
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,900
Well, it's been discussed here at length with no objection from your colleagues.

413
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,100
I have an objection.

414
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,200
You, Doctor Scully, have a patient with an untreatable condition.

415
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,600
Now that's very sad and unfortunate and nobody disagrees with that.

416
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,800
But he is my patient.

417
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,600
Unless you've come here today with a cure for Sandhoff Disease...

418
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,900
... we all ask that you let the boy go in peace.

419
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,000
Thank you.

420
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,300
I'd like to wrap up, so that we can get on to today's good work.

421
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
We have the final matter of a patient in intensive care, Doctor Willar's patient, I believe. 

422
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,700
Admitted after suffering myocardial infarction.

423
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,900
There is a treatment.

424
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,300
The matter is resolved, Doctor Scully.

425
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,600
No, it's not.

426
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,100
The disease can be treated with interthecal stem cell therapy.

427
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,800
You're not serious? Don't put the boy through hell.

428
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,000
Would you do it if it was your son?

429
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,100
It's not her son and he's not yours.

430
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,400
And it's not an decision for hospital administration. It's his doctor's.

431
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,300
If you want to challenge that, you can take up the matter with a higher authority.

432
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,400
I have taken it up with the highest authority, Doctor Scully.

433
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,800
As should you.

434
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,700
Come on, pick up.

435
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,000
Come on!

436
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Come on, answer!

437
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500


438
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
"This Dana Scully. Please leave a message."

439
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,300
Hey Scully, it's me. I keep leaving you messages. Here's what I wanna tell you.

440
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,200
The woman's head in the ice, it's not the agent's. It's not Monica Bannan's.

441
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,000
We don't know who she is or why she's there, but so far...

442
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,100
... we have pulled eleven discrete human limbs from the ice and we're not even done yet.

443
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,600
Each one a clean cut, too. An exact match to the previous amputation you noted, Scully.

444
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,900
It looks like somebody's been dumping body parts in the ice for months, possibly years.

445
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,800


446
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,600
And there appears to be no pattern to the limbs. Men and women, all with healthy, undiseased tissue...

447
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,500
... according to forensics.

448
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,400
Which suggests to me that they are victims.

449
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,700
But here's the thing. What I need you to know.

450
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,400
We found more traces of your animal tranquilizer.

451
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,500
I do not know what the hell that means, but hopefully you cam make sense of it.

452
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,800
- Anything? 
- No, I can't reach her, but this is going to make sense, this is a break. I can feel it.

453
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,700
Your feeling it, Father Joe's feeling it. All I'm feeling is my head spinning.

454
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,500
It is a serial case you've uncovered. You're gonna solve a dozen murders here.

455
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,700
Yes, but I'm no closer to finding my agent.

456
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,300
We're gonna find her. I know it.

457
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,400
Well, she may have to stand in line.

458
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
I see a woman's face.

459
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,400
Another woman, taken from a car.

460
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,500
She's being held...

461
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,800
... in a box, I think.

462
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Is she with Monica Bannan?

463
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,300
I don't know.

464
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,400
Is it the same men that took her?

465
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,600
I think so.

466
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,600
Yes, it's the same men.

467
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Do you see this or are you just telling these people what they want to hear?

468
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,600
- No! 
- No, you don't see it?

469
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,500
No, it's the same men.

470
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,500
I want a car ready.

471
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,200
- To go where? 
- I don't know yet.

472
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,700
- I don't believe this. 
- That's been your problem from the start.

473
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,900
I can get you a car.

474
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,400
And a list of missing persons in the greater area for the last 48 to 72 hours.

475
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

476
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,300
Cheryl Cunningham, 34, never made it to work last night, no-show at home either.

477
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,100
There's no blood on the air bags. Driver's side window knocked out.

478
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,300
Keys in the ignition. Surviveable crash with a seat belt.

479
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,700
She sets off, take a shortcut.

480
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Gets tired. Sits down and falls asleep. Happens all the time.

481
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,600
Pretty hard left turn for such a long, straight stretch of country road, don't you think?

482
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
But why settle for my opinion?

483
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,500
I'm sorry. I'm not getting anything.

484
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,200
What a  surprise!

485
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,200
What a  surprise.

486
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,100
I think we're done with Father Joe.

487
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
- We're not quite finished. 
- What is that?

488
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,000
It's a medical ID bracelet. I noticed your missing agent wore one too.

489
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
- What are you thinking? 
- Pop the trunk.

490
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,700
This isn't gonna do her much good.

491
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,300
Gym bag.

492
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,200
It's a bathing suit. It's frozen stiff.

493
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,200
- Chlorine 
- Where's the nearest public pool?

494
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,900
Hi. We're hoping you can help us.

495
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,500
Would y'all like lockers?

496
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,600
No, we're with the FBI. We'd like to show you a photo, sir, if you don't mind.

497
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,000
Why would I mind?

498
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,100
Do you know this person?

499
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,500
Let me see.

500
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,000
These young people look so much the same.

501
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,400
- Do you have a sign-in register? 
- Yes, I keep one every day.

502
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,400
- I'd like to see yesterday's. - I threw yesterday's away.

503
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,700
Excuse me. sir.

504
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,200
Doesn't he know that's the women's side?

505
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Hi Christian.

506
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,100
You've got a whole bunch of people taking really good care of you today, okay?

507
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,600
What?

508
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,100
Now you look scared.

509
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,300
People say I went underground!

510
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,200
I'm sorry, Mulder.

511
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,300
I've got to keep my focus here.

512
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
It's the boy, isn't it?

513
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,200
Yeah.

514
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,700
I thought there was nothing to be done.

515
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm taking a big chance on something.

516
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,100
A radical and extremely painful new procedure.

517
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
Last night you said that wasn't an option.

518
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,600
It wasn't last night.

519
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,400
What changed your mind?

520
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,300
When will you know if it's working?

521
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:17,200
- There's a series of these procedures and I won't know until they're all done.
But that's not what you came to talk about.
- There's another woman missing.

522
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,700
She and the missing agent swam at the same pool.

523
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,900
We found that the agent kept a locker there. We think they were stalked there, both of them.

524
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,300
The women had medical ID bracelets and they both had the same rare blood type, AB negative.

525
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,000
Organs harvested for transplant. That's how they were targeted.

526
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,800
Donors and recipients need match types. Someone using that pool knows that.

527
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,900
Black market. Somebody filling orders.

528
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,300
Would they have access, recipients, hospitals?

529
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,200
That's your world, Scully. Your knowledge of it will save time and time is our enemy.

530
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,000
You can start with the transporters. Call the Richmond DA.

531
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,800
No. I need you on this with me.

532
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,900
No. No, Mulder.

533
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,600
You asked for me to get involved, Scully. Now I'm asking for you to stay involved.

534
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,200
Oh, Mulder.

535
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,000
You helped them already. You broke the case for them. Why don't you just let the FBI pursue it?

536
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,400
We are so close now.

537
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,100
- I'm asking you to let it go. 
- It is not that simple.

538
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
No. It's complicated.

539
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,200
What's this supposed to mean?

540
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,800
Something that I knew would happen, that I've been afraid of and haven't had to face until now.

541
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,500
What? Just say it.

542
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,100
I am a doctor, Mulder.

543
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,400
- That's not my life any more. 
- I know that.

544
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,400
You're not understanding me.

545
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,800
I can't look into the darkness with you any more, Mulder.

546
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,400
I cannot stand what it does to you or to me.

547
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm fine with it. Scully, I'm actually okay. I'm good.

548
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,900
Yeah. That's what scares me.

549
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,300
Where else would you want me to look of you want me to find these women alive?

550
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,500
I'm asking you that you look at yourself.

551
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,400
Why?

552
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
I don't think I'm the one who has changed.

553
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,100
We're not FBI any more, Mulder.

554
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,700
We are two people who come home at night.

555
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,600
To a home now.

556
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
I don't want that darkness in my home.

557
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,300
Scully, this is who I am.

558
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,600
It's who I've always been. This is who I was before I met you. It's what I do. It's everything I know.

559
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,000
Write it down. Put it in a book.

560
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,300
Are you asking me to give up?

561
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,900
No.

562
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,500
I can't tell you to do that, Mulder.

563
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,900
But I can tell you that...

564
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,600
... I won't be coming home.

565
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,100
Scully.

566
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
Mulder, I've got my own battles to fight.

567
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
Don't do this.

568
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,300
- Please don't argue with me. 
- Don't do this now.

569
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,400
I don't know what else to do.

570
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,300
Good luck, then.

571
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,400
You too.

572
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,800
Doctor Scully?

573
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,500
We would like to speak with you if we may...

574
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,500
... about Christian.

575
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,400
- Have you been in to see him? 
- Yes. He was sleeping.

576
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
But...

577
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,300
We've change our minds -  about going forward with this new treatment.

578
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,400
But you don't even know if it's working yet.

579
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,300
We think Christian's been through enough.

580
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,300
We want to put our faith in God now.

581
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,500
I see.

582
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,300
- It's nothing against you.
- No.

583
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,400
If you were a mother, you'd understand.

584
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,000
Have you spoken to Father Ybarra?

585
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,800
Yes. But the decision is ours.

586
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,100
What if it did work?

587
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,300
What if we found we'd made the wrong choice by stopping?

588
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,300
Are you saying you can save my son?

589
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,400
I'm saying I don't want to give up now.

590
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,300
All of a sudden, the plane gears up and we're back up in  the air again.

591
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,200
I say, "Honey, isn't this fantastic? We're gonna die together."

592
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,900
It turns out that there was a plane on the tarmac...

593
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,100
... and we missed colliding with it by seconds.

594
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000


595
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,100
We were in love and it was romantic.

596
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,600
Sir? Excuse me, sir. Can we talk with you a minute?

597
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
I'm transporting vital organ.

598
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,600
That's what we'd like to talk to you about.

599
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,600
This is my job. I move very quickly. I don't have much time.

600
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,200
Please, sir. Step over here.

601
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,700
My name is Robert Koell, I'm with the District Attorney's office in Richmond. May I see your paperwork and license?

602
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,500
I have green card.

603
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,800
- What are you transporting? 
- human liver for transplantation.

604
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,900
Paperwork and license, please.

605
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,000
Where are you delivering it?

606
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,400
Willow's Memorial Hospital.

607
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,900
There is patient wait for it.

608
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,500
Have you ever procured or delivered an organ outside of normal or lawful channels?

609
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,900
No.

610
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,300
You're an employee of this company. How would your employer answer this question?

611
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,100
Is sick, has cancer.

612
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,700
That's not what I asked you..

613
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,600
Am I under some kind of suspicion?

614
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,400
A vision if ever I had one.

615
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,600
Can I speak with you?

616
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,700
Would you like to come in?

617
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Make yourself comfortable.

618
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,500
I won't be staying long.

619
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Have you come here by yourself?

620
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes.

621
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Sit.

622
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,500
Please, I insist.

623
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,300
Now, you came to ask me something.

624
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,200
We are alone. Free to speak in confidence.

625
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,700
You said something to me the other night in the snow.

626
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,100
Yes, I said, "Don't give up."

627
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,900
I need to know why you said that.

628
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,500
I haven't the faintest idea.

629
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,000
Were you hoping for another answer?

630
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,700
Do you know anything about me?

631
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,300
Other than that you loathe me?

632
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,400
Do you know what it is that I do?

633
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
No. I can see that you are a woman of faith.

634
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,000
- But not in the same things as your husband. 
- he's not my husband.

635
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,900
- Do you care to tell me about yourself?
- No!

636
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,700
Do you care to offer a confession?

637
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,500
- I don't think you're... 
- What?

638
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,000
In a position to judge? And yet you've judged me, haven't you?

639
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,200
You deserve to be judged!

640
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,300
Do you know why we live here, the men who call this vile box of monsters home?

641
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,100
Because we hate each even as we hate ourselves. For our sickening appetites.

642
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,100
That doesn't make it any less sickening.

643
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,400
And where do they come from, these sickening appetites, these uncontrollable urges?

644
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,600
Not from God!

645
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,100
Not from me. I castrated myself when I was 26.

646
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,400
And the visions weren't my idea either.

647
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,400
Proverbs 25:2.

648
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
"God's glory to conceal a thing...

649
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,300
... but the honor of kings to search out a matter."

650
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,300
Don't you quote Scripture to me!

651
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,400
What are you doing here? What are you afraid of?

652
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,100
"Don't give up!" What was that for?

653
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,000
- I don't Know. 
- I don't believe you!

654
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,400
I'm telling you the truth!

655
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,500
- They were your words!
- I don;t know why I said them!

656
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,700
You said them to my face!

657
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,700
All I ever wanted was to serve Him. All I've ever wanted was to serve God.

658
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,000
Ask for His pity, but don't expect mine.

659
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,000
You can stop the act any time!

660
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,100
Look at me!

661
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,400
The paramedics have been in with him for about seven minutes.

662
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,400
He has stabilized. Blood pressure's normal.

663
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,500
- They are loading him in now.
- What happened?

664
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,400
He had a seizure.

665
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,400
- Who called you? 
- No-one.

666
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,100
What are you doing here?

667
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,000
We need to talk to Father Joe?

668
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,200
Well, that's not going to happen.

669
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,400
We've got a suspect. A Russian immigrant working as an organ transporter.

670
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,000
In custody?

671
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,900
No. The Richmond DA questioned him about trafficking black market human organs this afternoon, but he was released.

672
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,700
They had no evidence to hold him.

673
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
We've got a fairly credible witneses who says he swam with the women at the pool.

674
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,900
ASAC Whitney?

675
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,500
What's that got to do with Father Joe?

676
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,500
- He's the man in his visions, Scully. 
- Who?

677
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
The suspect. The man in this photo.

678
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,100
Mulder, now you're wasting their time.

679
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,600
Tell me again what you're doing here.

680
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,000
Here's a vision for you. A couple of my guys just had it.

681
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,200
Who's this?

682
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,800
That's our suspect's employer. An old friend of Father Joe's, we just learned.

683
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,200
- Known him for over twenty years. 
- Known him how?

684
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,300
That's one of his 37 altar boys.

685
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,100
Three guesses who he's married to in the state of Massachusetts?

686
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,500
Our suspect.

687
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,200
We got a warrant to search their offices.

688
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,800
Mulder.

689
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,700
It's over.

690
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,300
Why don't you hold up?

691
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,900
Let these men do their jobs.

692
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,000
Clear this bottom floor.

693
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,000
We were all fooled on this. I wanted to believe as bad as anyone.

694
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,700
Look, I don't need the sweet-talk.

695
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,100
- You led us here. 
- Father Joe led us here.

696
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,000
This is Special Agent Drummy with the FBI. We have warrants to search these offices.

697
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,300
Anyone inside, identify yourself and unlock the door now.

698
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,400
I called you because I thought I could help with this case. Because I valued your belief in these phenomena.

699
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,100
And now what do you think?

700
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,500
I think that this is a longer conversation.

701
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,200
Down on the floor! Everybody in here I want down on the floor.

702
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,600


703
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,500
Somebody find the lights.

704
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,800
We were at a complete standstill and you pushed us forward in a direction or two.

705
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,500
What are you, nuts?

706
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,900
Stop him!

707
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
Stop him!

708
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,700
Hey! You can't go there.

709
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,000
- Which way did they go? 
- That way.

710
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,400
Mulder!

711
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,500
Up here!

712
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,300
Mulder!

713
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,700
He's coming at you!

714
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,800
Mulder.

715
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
- Where are you? 
- Right here.

716
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,600
Where?

717
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Fox?

718
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,900
Where is he? Do you have gim?

719
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,400
No, I lost him.

720
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,400
- I saw him. 
- Where?

721
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,300
They're both dead.

722
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,200
Monica Bannan and Dakota Whitney.

723
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,500
I heard.

724
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,200
I'm sorry.

725
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,200
I thought we were winning, Scully.

726
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,200
I know you did, Mulder.

727
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,900
I'm here to see Father Joe.

728
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,400
I want to show him these photographs. These men.

729
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,700
You still want to believe him.

730
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,400
I think you should know that he's been diagnosed with a terminal illness.

731
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,300
He has advanced stage lung cancer.

732
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,200
I just want to be sure.

733
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,500
Then let me ask him.

734
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,500
You wouldn't believe...

735
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,500
... I was thinking of you.

736
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,400
I had a vision...

737
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,000
... you might find interesting.

738
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,300
Of a man speaking in a foreign language.

739
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,600
Did he happen to look like this?

740
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,300
Yeah, that's the man.

741
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
How did you know?

742
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,700
We think he's the man that abducted the FBI agent...

743
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,800
... and the second woman you say you saw and possibly many more.

744
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,400
And we think that he was helped...

745
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,800
... by this man.

746
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,500
I don't know who that is.

747
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,400
Are you sure?

748
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,400
I'm failry certain. I don't know him.

749
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,800
I'm fairly certain that you do.

750
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,400
And that you've known him since he was a boy.

751
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,200
Oh, no.

752
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,900
It cannot be true.

753
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,300
I don't believe this.

754
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,400
He was my connection to the girl.

755
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,200
My visions were to save her from him.

756
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,400
This is God's work.

757
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,800
This is God's work.

758
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,600
Let me ask one more question, Father Joe.

759
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,500
The FBI agent...

760
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,600
... the first woman that you saw, Monica Bannnan.

761
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,600
Is she still alive?

762
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,700
I feel her.

763
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,000
Yes.

764
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,000
She's still alive.

765
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,200
That second victim may be alive. Everybody's given up on her, but I'm not going to.

766
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,100
Mulder, you think that I don't understand but I do.

767
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,400
This stubbornness of yours.

768
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,500
It's why I fell in love with you.

769
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,300
It's like you said.

770
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,100
It's why we can't be together.

771
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,300


772
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,800
Hold on.

773
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,200
- I'm sorry to bother you. 
- I'm closed

774
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,700
I just need a moment of your time.

775
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,900
We got some bad weather coming in. You'd better get where you're goin' fast.

776
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,800
So, what do you need?

777
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,700
Is was wondering if you carry an animal tranquilizer called acepromazine?

778
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,700
You got a prescription for it?

779
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,100
No, I don't.

780
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,700
Well, I can't sell it to you then.

781
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,300
can you tell me if you've ever sold any to this man?

782
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,700
I am never getting out of here.

783
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,600
- Nutter's Feed.

784
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,100
Yep, I was just closing up and I'm gonna pick him up.

785
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yes, goodbye.

786
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,200
What happened to the othe guy?

787
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,300
Who?

788
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
The guy who was standing right here.

789
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,900
- I need to refill this now.
- Okay.

790
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,100
"... in laboratory animals, particularly dogs."

791
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,500
"... fused at the neck."

792
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,100
"... survive for periods of several weeks."

793
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,600


794
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,000
Yeah, it's me.

795
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,300
I must be busy right now. Leave a message.

796
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,000
Mulder, I just found something in my stem cell research.

797
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,900
Experiments being done in Russia on dogs. I think that's what...

798
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,600
... your suspects have been doing, only on humans.

799
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,400
Those women who have been abducted. You've got to call me.

800
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,900
Mulder, the FBI agent's alive.

801
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
FBI, Special Agent In Charge Fosse speaking.

802
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,700
It's for you.

803
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,200
This is Special Agent Drummy.

804
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,400
I've been trying to find you for hours.

805
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,500
I can't reach Mulder.

806
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,900
- Is this Doctor Scully? 
- Yes, it's Doctor Scully!.

807
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,900
- Where is he? 
- If I knew that I wouldn't be calling.

808
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,700
Doctor Scully, I'm gonna suggest that you call the police. This is not an FBI matter.

809
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,600
Listen to me!

810
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,500
I need your help!

811
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,200
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

812
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,400
Then let me talk to somebody there with some balls who can!

813
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,400
Don't touch me!

814
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,700
You're going to be right.

815
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,800
I take care of you. You no longer need this body.

816
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,300
Look at me. You are going to live.

817
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,000
You are going to have a fine, strong body.

818
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,900
Excuse me.

819
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,700
I'm Dana Scully and that's my car.

820
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,600
I talked to some bigwig down at the FBI. He called from Washington.

821
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,400
Yeah, that's him. Walter Skinner.

822
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,600
Is there indication what happened? Any footprints?

823
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,100
Nothing. This snow's pretty heavy. But we did find this.

824
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,900
Might want to give it to him. Excuse me.

825
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,100
It's his cellphone. It's got blood on it.

826
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Calm down. Stop and think. He's okay. He climbed out of there somehow...

827
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,800
...and if he climbed out he probably climbed up.

828
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,600
Stop!

829
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,100
Back off!

830
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,600
Back away!

831
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,500
Do you speak English? Does anybody speak English?

832
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,500
I want her out of here! I want those tubes out of her neck and I want her neck sewn up!

833
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,700
Do it!

834
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,800
We will find him.

835
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,100
I know Mulder. He'll get to a phone and he'll call first.

836
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,300
He wouldn't do anything crazy.

837
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,000
Relatively crazy.

838
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,100
Wait a minute. Back up.

839
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,100


840
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,200


841
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,300
What is it?

842
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,300
Proverbs, 25:2.

843
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,400
"The Glory of God to hide a thing."

844
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:27,300
I've got it. An invoice for medical supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoft.

845
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,700
An address in Bellflower Road.

846
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,400
- Listen 
- What?

847
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,500
Dogs. Dogs!

848
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,700
Mulder!

849
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,900
Can you hear me?

850
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,900
Sorry about your car.

851
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,000
The girl. Still inside.

852
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,900
Show me your hands!

853
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,200
Put the scalpel down! Put that scalpel down!

854
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,700
Put that scalpel down or I'll blow your goddamn head off!

855
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,700
Get over there!

856
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
My God! What have you done?

857
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,500
What have you done?

858
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,400
Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids.

859
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,100
Oh God.

860
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,500
I've got work to do here.

861
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,400
Get in! Get in!

862
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,000


863
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,400
The girl ... inside ...

864
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,200
Scully's got her. She's in good hands.

865
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,400
Skinner?

866
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,600
I'm cold.

867
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,400
I gotcha.

868
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,300
I gotcha.

869
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,800


870
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,300
Mulder?

871
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,800
What's up, Doc?

872
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,000
Father Joe is dead.

873
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,000
He was clearly a very sick man.

874
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,200
Did you see this story?

875
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,300
The FBI is claiming that Father Joe was an accomplice.

876
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:48,700
Not a word about his psychic connection.

877
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
He's dead, Mulder.

878
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,300
We'll never know.

879
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,100
I know, Scully, and I can prove it.

880
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,500
Father Joe died of lung cancer, right?

881
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,100
The same as that man that Doctor Frankenstein tried to give a new body.

882
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,800
What time did you pull those tubes from that woman's neck?

883
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,300
What time did you cut off the blood supply to that man's head? That's when Father Joe died.

884
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,000
Get me his death certificate and I'll show it to you and I'll take it to the FBI and I'll show them.

885
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,700
Do you really think they're gonna take your call?

886
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,800
It's an injustice to the man's name.

887
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:23,100
Well, considering his crimes against those young boys...

888
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,100
... Who is really going to care?

889
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,800
I thought you believed him too?

890
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,300
I wanted to believe him.

891
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,100
I did believe him! I acted on that belief!

892
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,900
Why don't you just tell me what he said to you?

893
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,600


894
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,300
He told me:

895
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,000
"Don't give up."

896
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,900
And I didn't. And it saved your life.

897
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,100
But I put that boy through hell.

898
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,400
And I have another surgery scheduled for this morning ...

899
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,600
... because I believed that God was telling me to.

900
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,100
Through a paedophile priest, no less!

901
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:31,700
What if Father Joe's prayers were answered after all?

902
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,800
What if he were forgiven?

903
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,800
Because he didn't give up.

904
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,500
Try proving that one, Mulder.

905
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,600
I'm due at the hospital.

906
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,700
Scully?

907
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,800
Why would he say that?

908
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,200
"Don't gibe up." Why would he say such a thing to you?

909
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,500
I think that was clearly meant for you, Mulder.

910
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,700
He didn't say it to me. He said it to you.

911
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,900
If Father Joe were the Devil, why would he say the opposite of what the Devil might say?

912
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,400
Maybe that's the answer.

913
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,500
The larger answer.

914
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,900
What do you mean?

915
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,300
Don't give up.

916
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,000
Please don't make this any harder than it already is.

917
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,700
Okay.

918
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,600
If you have doubts...

919
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
... any doubts at all...

920
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,200
... just call off that surgery this morning.

921
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,100
And then we'll get out of here.

922
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,800
Just me and you.

923
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,200
As far away from the darkness as we can get?

924
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,600
I'm not sure it works that way.

925
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,800
I think maybe the darkness finds you...

926
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,500
... and me.

927
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,500
I know it does.

928
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,200
But let it try.

929
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,300
Are you ready to begin, Doctor Scully?

930
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,300
Yes.

931
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:40,300
