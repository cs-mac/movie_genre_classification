1
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,764
I kind of have two moons
in my head, I guess,

2
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,894
whereas most people
just have one moon.

3
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:49,969
I look at the Moon just like everybody else
who's never been there

4
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,014
and, you know, there it is and
I've always thought it was interesting...

5
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:57,916
Whether it's full or a sliver,
or what have you.

6
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,385
But every once in a while,
I do think of a second moon,

7
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,651
you know, the one that
I recall from up close

8
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,991
and, yeah, it is kind of hard to believe
that I was actually up there.

9
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,199
I want to promise you, I'm human.

10
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,465
I pinched myself to find out
whether it was really happening.

11
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,870
I called the Moon my home
for three days of my life

12
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,744
and I'm here to tell you about it.

13
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,477
That's science fiction.

14
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,189
My father was born shortly
after the Wright brothers.

15
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:49,297
He could barely believe
that I went to the Moon.

16
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,303
But my son, Tom, was five.

17
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,002
And he didn't think
it was any big deal.

18
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,761
Lift-off, we have a lift-off.

19
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,271
32 minutes past the hour.

20
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,263
The tower is clear.

21
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,583
<i># Woke up this morning #</i>

22
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:26,525
<i># With light in my eyes... #</i>

23
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,790
One day, under secret orders,

24
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:31,593
a group of us at the Test Pilot Center

25
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,101
were ordered to go to Washington
to get a briefing.

26
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:40,369
And they talked about the Atlas booster

27
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:45,037
and putting a capsule on top of that
with a man in it,

28
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:49,014
Uh, to... To try to put a man into space.

29
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,880
And of course, at that time,

30
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:56,253
the Atlas boosters were blowing up
every other day down at Cape Canaveral.

31
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:02,192
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

32
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,628
<i># Won't you please take me along #</i>

33
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,929
<i># I won't do anything wrong #</i>

34
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:12,199
And it looked like a very, you know,
quick way to have a short career.

35
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:14,638
<i># ...Take me along for a ride #</i>

36
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,168
<i># Woke up this morning #</i>

37
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,575
<i># I was feeling quite weird #</i>

38
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,272
<i># I had flies in my beard #</i>

39
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,976
<i># My toothpaste was smeared #</i>

40
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:29,145
<i># Over my window
they'd written my name #</i>

41
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,418
<i># Said, "So long,
we'll see you again" #</i>

42
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:37,861
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

43
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,227
<i># Won't you please take me along #</i>

44
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,664
<i># I won't do anything wrong #</i>

45
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:46,727
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

46
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:51,138
<i># Won't you please take #
me along for a ride</i>

47
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:11,820
Now it is time
to take longer strides,

48
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:15,387
time for a great new
American enterprise,

49
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:19,731
time for this nation
to take a clearly leading role

50
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,566
in space achievement.

51
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,073
Politically, it was about
beating the Russians,

52
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,609
but those of us with a science bent

53
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,611
or a curious bent,
knew it was more than that.

54
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,773
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

55
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:38,320
to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,

56
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:42,152
of landing a man on the Moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.

57
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:44,692
It was beautiful in its simplicity.

58
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:46,694
Do what? Moon!

59
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,456
When? End of decade!

60
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:49,792
He challenged us to do

61
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:53,356
what I think most people
thought was impossible, including me.

62
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:58,839
We go into space because whatever
Mankind must undertake,

63
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,307
free men must fully share.

64
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,610
But in a very real sense,

65
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:08,979
it will not be one man
going to the Moon.

66
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,313
We make this judgment affirmatively;

67
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:13,751
It will be an entire nation.

68
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:16,847
For all of us must work to put him there.

69
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:41,445
I did the usual thing
of making model airplanes.

70
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,210
Most of them,
little balsawood contraptions.

71
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:48,913
Some of them actually flew
and I liked that.

72
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:53,891
So I'd been interested
in mechanical objects in the sky,

73
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,757
I guess, from as long
as I could remember.

74
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:07,566
I was always awed by flight.

75
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:09,971
When I was a young lad,

76
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:14,205
a barnstormer flying
a World War I airplane

77
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:22,584
landed on our farm and Dad
helped him refuel and I got a ride,

78
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:27,715
and he took me for a circle of the field
and that was my first airplane ride,

79
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,190
at about four years of age.

80
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,623
The Mustangs dropped their wing tanks

81
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,721
and plunged into the fight.

82
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:38,233
Maybe it was the movies,
maybe it was the real life news,

83
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:42,432
but I knew that someday, sometime,

84
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,564
that's what I wanted to do.

85
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,276
I knew I wanted to fly airplanes.

86
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:56,308
In '61, I had just graduated
from the Test Pilot School

87
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,517
and I had a job flying fighters
in fighter tests at Edwards.

88
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,684
At the Flight Test Center

89
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,761
is the fastest school in the world:

90
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:09,194
The United States Air Force
Flight Test School,

91
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,858
from whose doors upon graduation

92
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,163
come the men destined to push back

93
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,704
the frontiers
of aeronautical knowledge.

94
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,946
Test pilot experience was critical.

95
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,887
It was a profession with
a lot of esprit de corps

96
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:43,658
and a lot of danger
and a pioneering spirit.

97
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:08,349
And when you're at
supersonic speeds and high altitudes,

98
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:11,891
learning to survive that and bring your
machine back down,

99
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:17,657
it's the fundamental task
and the higher and faster you flew,

100
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:20,198
the more dangerous
and more exciting it became.

101
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,875
I thought I had the
best job in the world

102
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,311
from the day I entered flight training
until I looked on TV

103
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:38,076
one day and Al Shepherd
goes up in a rocket.

104
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,617
The rocket performs perfectly!

105
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:44,746
He's gone higher than I've ever gone
and faster than I've ever gone

106
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,324
and most important,
he's made more noise doing it.

107
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,223
He's even on TV doing it!

108
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:52,320
How do I...
How do I get that job?

109
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,062
"I've Got A Secret!"

110
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,864
Brought to you tonight by...

111
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,336
Dream Whip!

112
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,374
The light, delicious topping

113
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,410
that won't wilt on your desserts.

114
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:08,944
Dream Whip!

115
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,277
Now, if you'll whisper
your secret to me, Mr. And Mrs. Armstrong,

116
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,214
We'll show it at the same time
to our audience at home.

117
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,512
If you'll both lean in and whisper.

118
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:24,721
Everybody put their application
in to every NASA request.

119
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,922
I mean, it was just,
sort of a peer kind of thing.

120
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:33,367
So NASA put out a request
for a third group of astronauts in early '63,

121
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,703
and of course everybody in my test
pilot class put their application in

122
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,402
because it was another opportunity
for a new challenge.

123
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:46,539
It certainly sounded very challenging
and something that if...

124
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,776
if other people wanted to be
a part of this

125
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:54,822
and this was a noble national effort,
why, I wanted to be a part of it.

126
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,084
Now how would you feel,
Mrs. Armstrong,

127
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,022
If it turned out...
Of course, nobody knows;

128
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:02,586
But if it turns out that your son
is first man to land on the Moon,

129
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,632
What... How would you feel?

130
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,333
Well, I guess I'd just say God bless him

131
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,168
and I wish him the best of all good luck.

132
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,366
I'll bet you.

133
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,957
That group of astronauts
was far and away the best group

134
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:33,116
I had ever been associated with.

135
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,222
There weren't any really weak sisters
in the bunch.

136
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,824
They were just an amazingly competent,
hardworking,

137
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:44,836
really good bunch of people.

138
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:49,671
One day... you're just Gene Cernan,

139
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,573
young naval aviator, whatever,

140
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,009
and the next day,
you're an American hero.

141
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:57,139
Literally.
And you have done nothing.

142
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,653
When Tom Wolfe
wrote "The Right Stuff",

143
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,847
I thought,
"Boy! That sounds good.

144
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,390
People are going to think
I have the right stuff!

145
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:11,327
I'm the same guy I always was,
but now, I've got the right stuff!"

146
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,764
It's sort of an unshakeable belief
in your own infallibility.

147
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,994
That's what the right stuff is.

148
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,262
That you're immortal,

149
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,305
that you can do anything
that is thrown at you.

150
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,211
Nobody knew really
how to go to the Moon,

151
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,448
there was a lot on paper.

152
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:42,855
And we didn't know how to do things
and we didn't know how things would work.

153
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,622
It was just a matter of
putting them together,

154
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,959
making them work
and then correcting deficiencies.

155
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,334
And as pilots, astronauts,

156
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:53,596
why, we participated
in all of these things,

157
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:56,571
along with management
and the engineers.

158
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:00,238
What we did in the early days

159
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:03,369
was take the overall spacecraft

160
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,310
and divide it up like a pie.

161
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:10,113
We sliced that pie up
into 10 or 15 different pieces

162
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:13,746
and we handed each slice
to one of the astronauts

163
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:17,451
and said, "This is yours,
we want you to learn that slice."

164
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,364
We shall send to the Moon,

165
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:28,960
240,000 miles away,

166
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,799
a giant rocket

167
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:34,137
more than 300 feet tall,

168
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,733
made of new metal alloys,

169
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:40,906
some of which have
not yet been invented,

170
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,847
fitted together with a precision

171
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,853
better than the finest watch,

172
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,354
on an untried mission

173
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,924
to an unknown celestial body,

174
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:56,190
and then return it safely to Earth,

175
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,026
re-entering the atmosphere

176
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:01,568
at speeds of over
25,000 miles per hour,

177
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,196
causing heat about half that
of the temperature of the Sun,

178
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:07,433
Almost as hot as it is here today.

179
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,305
And do all this...
And do all this

180
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,970
and do it right and do it first,

181
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,104
before this decade is out,

182
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,204
then we must be bold.

183
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,016
I look back at Kennedy,

184
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,452
was he a visionary,
was he a dreamer,

185
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,854
was he politically astute?

186
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,517
The chances are, yes,

187
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,527
he was probably...
probably all three.

188
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,119
We'll never know.

189
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,901
Nor will we ever know
whether he really fully appreciated

190
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,740
The challenge that he had laid down
in front of... the American people.

191
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
And therefore, as we set sail,

192
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,414
we ask God's blessing

193
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:57,817
on the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure

194
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:00,049
on which man has ever embarked.

195
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:25,143
Things were moving very quickly

196
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:29,481
and I was assigned as a back-up crew
to the first Apollo mission.

197
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:34,214
Things were in sort of a turmoil,
there were a lot of problems,

198
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:38,260
and Gus Grissom was
doing the best he could,

199
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:41,660
with his crew of Ed White and Roger Chaffee,
to straighten them out,

200
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:46,098
try to get the spacecraft
ready to fly.

201
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:52,532
We were incredibly intelligent

202
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:56,372
about some of
the hazards that we faced.

203
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:59,208
And we thought long
and hard about them

204
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:02,613
and we did everything we could
to ward them off,

205
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:08,713
but the business of 100% oxygen environment
inside the spacecraft,

206
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:10,814
we really had not thought that through.

207
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,832
And the wires were really bad in there.

208
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,959
I'd asked Gus, I said,

209
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,697
"Gus, why don't you say something
about this wiring?"

210
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:26,638
I said, "It's really terrible,
they ought to do something about this wiring,

211
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,140
it's really bad."
and he said, "I don't..."

212
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:31,801
And he said, "I can't say anything about it
or they'll fire me."

213
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:35,938
That's what he told me.
I couldn't believe it.

214
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:43,180
The crew were conducting
this test on the ground,

215
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,383
they weren't going to fly.

216
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:49,087
I guess we, and I think of all of us
in the NASA family,

217
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:50,719
never gave it a second thought.

218
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,163
what would happen if you got a spark

219
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:59,932
in a 16 psi,
100% oxygen environment?

220
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:12,380
I picked up the phone

221
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:15,851
and they said... "Who's this?"

222
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,114
I told them Alan Bean,

223
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,817
he said, "Well, we're down here,
we're doing this test

224
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,826
and we've lost the crew."

225
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:27,056
And I said...

226
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:30,794
"Where'd they go?
You've lost them?"

227
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,235
Because I thought
they just needed to run the test

228
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:35,999
and they can't find them.

229
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,473
"No" they said,
"We've lost the crew."

230
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,977
I said, "Maybe they're
down at the beach house."

231
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,413
And they said,
"No, there was a fire."

232
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:50,749
And then it dawns on me
that maybe they're talking about

233
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,981
something different than I think.

234
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,081
We interrupt our regular programming

235
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,954
to bring you this special report.

236
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,857
Here's ABC's science editor,
Jules Bergman.

237
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,362
Top space agency officials
are flying to Cape Kennedy tonight

238
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:08,960
to begin the official investigation
into what caused the flash fire

239
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:12,939
that killed the nation's
first three Apollo astronauts earlier tonight.

240
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:18,780
They died at t-minus ten minutes
into a simulated launch countdown,

241
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,372
helplessly trapped inside their spacecraft.

242
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:39,127
The accident occurred in January,

243
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,202
the end of January 27th.

244
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:43,828
And we're burying
our guys at Arlington

245
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:47,169
and I wasn't sure whether we were
burying the entire Apollo program

246
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:49,868
or three... of our buddies.

247
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,954
That was the period, the late '60s,

248
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:12,258
when we were fighting in Vietnam

249
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:16,233
and when a lot of racial
issues were going around.

250
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:22,237
I was not really in tune

251
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,674
with what was going
on in the country.

252
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,745
Our whole culture was changing
markedly in this period.

253
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:40,348
The Civil Rights Movement,

254
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,858
the Women's Movement,

255
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,760
the whole movement
toward a greater openness of society.

256
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:54,298
I think we were very aware
of the situation in Vietnam

257
00:20:54,405 --> 00:21:01,174
because a lot of our friends
were flying airplanes in combat in Vietnam.

258
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:05,580
And there would we have been,

259
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,548
had we not been in
the space program.

260
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,884
I guess I can sort of admit it now,

261
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:18,256
I've admitted it a little
bit to a few friends.

262
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,762
That... I've always had a guilt complex
to some degree.

263
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:29,732
That was my war, good or bad.

264
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,773
Whether it was a good war
or a bad war,

265
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,709
we're not discussing that,
but that was my war, to fight for my country,

266
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:40,146
and my buddies were getting shot at
and shot down

267
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,682
and in some cases captured.

268
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:45,811
And I was getting my picture
on the front page of the paper.

269
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:52,860
And I've always felt
that they fought my war for me.

270
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:57,027
They look at it totally different.

271
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:58,793
They said, "You were
doing something

272
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,267
that this country needed
more than anything else at the time.

273
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,564
You were part of a program,

274
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:07,539
the only thing we had
to hold our head high and be proud of."

275
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:21,116
1968, in this country,

276
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,452
was a disastrous year.

277
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:28,558
We had several assassinations,

278
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,588
Uh, not too good...

279
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,331
So we needed something
really to cap it up that was positive,

280
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:39,872
to give the American people
a sense of... of accomplishment

281
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,804
or at least satisfaction
of something.

282
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:46,908
If you were a scriptwriter
for the movies,

283
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:51,074
you couldn't have picked
a better scenario than Apollo 8!

284
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,558
We hear from the CIA

285
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,286
that the Russians
are going to send a spacecraft

286
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:06,627
around the Moon with a person in it
and upstage us.

287
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:10,259
If they orbit the Moon
before we land on the Moon,

288
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:12,962
then they've gotten there first.

289
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:18,535
We changed our plans on Apollo 8.

290
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:22,340
They changed the mission
from an Earth orbital type

291
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:24,642
to a flight to the Moon.

292
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:31,549
And it was a bold move,
it had some risky aspects to it,

293
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:35,091
but it was a time when
we made bold moves.

294
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,160
The engines are off.

295
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:41,698
Four, three, two, one, zero.

296
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,824
We have commenced...

297
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:13,086
Apollo 8, Houston.

298
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:15,756
Your trajectory and
guidance are go, over.

299
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,298
Thank you, Michael.

300
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,196
Yeah, you're looking real good...

301
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,463
It wasn't until we rolled over

302
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,732
that we actually saw the Moon
for the first time.

303
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,536
We were just 60 miles
above the craters,

304
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,803
and, you know...

305
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:32,539
we were sort of like three school kids
looking in a candy store window,

306
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:36,378
and we forgot the flight plan,
here we are, just 60 miles away.

307
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,714
Oh my God,
look at that picture over there!

308
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:42,789
Wow, is that pretty!

309
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,654
You got a colour film, Jim?

310
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,318
Hand me a roll of colour, quick.

311
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,724
Just grab me a colour.

312
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,301
A colour exterior.

313
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,171
We took photographs
as much as we could

314
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,867
and, of course,
we took the photograph

315
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,967
of the famous
Earth rise around the Moon

316
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:09,811
and I have to credit Bill Anders
for taking the picture.

317
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:12,578
Uh, he claims it
all the time, anyway!

318
00:25:13,653 --> 00:25:15,518
Calm down, Lovell!

319
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:16,714
Well, I got it right...

320
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:18,552
Oh, it's a beautiful shot!

321
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,727
And of course, Christmas Eve,

322
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,524
being around the Moon
on Christmas Eve,

323
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,033
we thought this would be
a very auspicious time to say something.

324
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:32,797
The three of us selected to read
from the Old Testament,

325
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:36,864
and we had it in fireproof paper
in the back of our flight manual.

326
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,207
"In the beginning,

327
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:46,944
God created the Heaven
and the Earth

328
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:50,852
and the Earth was
without form and void.

329
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:53,856
And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

330
00:25:56,627 --> 00:26:01,724
And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters

331
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:05,097
and God said,
'let there be light'.

332
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:10,867
And there was light."

333
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:17,980
I thought it was a very nice touch,

334
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:22,882
it fit very nicely into getting away
from all this machinery,

335
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:25,750
and let's get down into,
sort of, the fundamentals

336
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,983
of what makes all this happen,
why are we here.

337
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,184
I liked it.

338
00:26:31,828 --> 00:26:34,991
We close with
good night, good luck;

339
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:39,329
A merry Christmas and
God bless all of you,

340
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:42,427
all of you on the good Earth.

341
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,970
When we came back,

342
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:48,168
there was a lady in Dallas, Texas,

343
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:50,837
who was an atheist,

344
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,709
and I don't have
anything against atheists,

345
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:56,046
but she sued us.

346
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:02,453
For the mixing of...
Church and State,

347
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:06,015
and she said that
was inappropriate.

348
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:08,923
Maybe it was, I don't know.

349
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,275
At that time, we were all practicing

350
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:33,752
to go to the Apollo 11 site,
Sea of Tranquillity.

351
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,948
Because we had
three different crews training.

352
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,623
Apollo 11
was going to make the try in July

353
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:45,390
and then two months later,
we'd make it if they didn't make it,

354
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,760
and then if we didn't make it,

355
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,357
two months later
in November, Apollo 13.

356
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:53,495
So we had three chances to get to the Moon
by the end of the decade.

357
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:59,945
And so when Neil and Buzz and Mike
were assigned to Apollo 11

358
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,060
we knew they were going to make
the first shot.

359
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,275
They were a really,
really good crew,

360
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,714
they got along really well.

361
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,216
Mike was always the easy-going guy

362
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,586
who brought levity into things.

363
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,788
And I felt kind of bad that he wasn't
going to have the opportunity of being to...

364
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,525
Being able to be in a Lunar Lander
and make a landing,

365
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,191
but that was a decision that...

366
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,735
certainly was way over my head.

367
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,670
One guy had to stay
in the command module

368
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:31,104
and the other two were
going to go to the Moon

369
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,939
and I was... Pigeonholed,
if that's the right word,

370
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,343
as a command module pilot
and so that...

371
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,212
I lost my chance of...
of walking on the Moon

372
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:45,653
but in return for that,
I gained a chance to...

373
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,189
A: Fly to the Moon

374
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:52,422
and perhaps be a member
of the first crew to land on the Moon.

375
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,459
One thing I know about Buzz,

376
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:58,830
he's one of these guys
that's a lot smarter than most of us.

377
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,961
He had a nickname,
Dr. Rendezvous.

378
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:07,065
He loves to talk
about technical stuff,

379
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:08,235
particularly rendezvous.

380
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:10,642
I mean, he'll get this
orbit going this way

381
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:12,681
and that orbit
going the other way

382
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,512
and he really grooved
on those things.

383
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:17,881
You didn't want to sit
near him in a party

384
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:20,580
because he would start
talking about rendezvous.

385
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,350
And you would want to be talking

386
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:24,857
about that good-looking
girl across the room.

387
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,487
He could care less,
he wanted to talk about rendezvous.

388
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:32,124
And he'd been talking
to you about it all... all week long.

389
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:36,192
That's right, that was what
I was really interested in.

390
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:41,736
I always respected
Neil Armstrong highly.

391
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:46,279
He was probably
the coolest under pressure

392
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,680
of anyone that I had
ever had the privilege of flying with.

393
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:57,380
He was just Mr. Coolstone,
if you will.

394
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,955
One of the oddities
in Neil's training

395
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:05,622
was this thing we lovingly called
"the flying bedstead".

396
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:07,825
It was an ungainly-
looking contraption

397
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:11,631
and it was meant to imitate the L.M.,
the Lunar Module.

398
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,047
Neil, he and I were
in adjoining offices, same secretary.

399
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,681
I remember one day I came in
in the morning,

400
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,048
I run into a couple of guys, they say,

401
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:33,819
"Do you know that Neil bailed
out of the LLTV this morning?"

402
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,570
I said, "no way."
He said, whoever it was,

403
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:49,230
Two or three guys said, "Yeah!"

404
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,331
I said, "Okay, I'm going
in there and ask him."

405
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,466
So I go in there and Neil...

406
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:55,307
Neil's fooling around,
nothing going on.

407
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,472
I said, "those guys
out in the office

408
00:30:57,582 --> 00:31:00,415
Said you bailed out of
the LLTV this morning."

409
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:01,712
He said, "Yeah."

410
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,753
That was all he said, "Yeah."

411
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:06,187
I mean this guy had been
a second and a half

412
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,781
from being killed
and that was it.

413
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:11,759
He didn't say,
"I nearly got killed",

414
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,353
"I nearly, you know..."
I don't know what we...

415
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:17,592
"Yeah."
That was it, that was it!

416
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,760
I mean, what was he
supposed to do?

417
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,201
I mean, maybe
he could have gone out

418
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,999
and gotten roaring
drunk or something

419
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:25,267
but that's not Neil, you know?

420
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,173
He went back and shuffled paper.
That's what you had to do.

421
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:31,714
You know, the program goes on!

422
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,200
Tomorrow we, the crew
of Apollo 11, are...

423
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:02,669
privileged to represent
the United States

424
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:06,178
in our first attempt

425
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:10,650
to take Man to another
heavenly body.

426
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:52,591
Um...

427
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:58,820
Well, I'd given up smoking the pipe

428
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,990
maybe three weeks before launch.

429
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:05,903
That's my best recollection,

430
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:09,701
maybe having a drink,
three days before.

431
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,639
I don't think anybody
really slept too well

432
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,215
the night before,
you're just wondering

433
00:33:18,316 --> 00:33:24,448
about whether you can...
get enough rest

434
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:27,319
for what you need
to possibly do.

435
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:43,403
This is CBS News
colour coverage of...

436
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,171
Sponsored by Kellogg's.

437
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,012
Kellogg's puts more
in your morning.

438
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,485
Here from CBS News
Apollo headquarters

439
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:02,251
at Kennedy Space Center,
correspondent Walter Cronkite.

440
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:03,552
Good morning.

441
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,628
It's t-minus one hour,

442
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:09,164
29 minutes and
53 seconds and counting.

443
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,200
In just an hour and a half,
if all goes well,

444
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,929
Apollo 11 astronauts
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins

445
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:19,371
are to lift off from
pad 39-a out there,

446
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,001
on the voyage Man always
has dreamed about.

447
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,545
Next stop for them: The Moon.

448
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:45,829
Well, on launch days, it's kind of strange,

449
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:48,197
you go out in a van to the launch pad,

450
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:50,566
and you're... you're kind of used to that.

451
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,798
Riding in a van is the American way,

452
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,398
so that's not a problem.

453
00:34:55,508 --> 00:35:00,639
When you get out to the base
of this gigantic gantry,

454
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:04,547
it's... it's empty,
there's nobody there, it's deserted.

455
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:09,088
And you're accustomed
to scores of workers,

456
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:12,055
you know, swarming like ants
all up and down and around it,

457
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:15,457
and, you know, you're in
with a crowd of people.

458
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,827
And then suddenly
there's nobody there

459
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,128
and you think, "God, you know,
maybe they know something I don't know!"

460
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:30,568
We got out there
to the launch pad.

461
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:33,907
So I had about ten minutes to look out

462
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:37,140
and see the Sun rise,
see the waves coming in

463
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,016
and see the evidence
of the people out on the side.

464
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,486
Just... And thinking about the fact

465
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,285
that this was something
I wanted to remember.

466
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,620
So it is now, before they go,

467
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,996
as their gleaming vehicle
sits poised and peaceful

468
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,626
out there behind me on pad 39-a,

469
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:03,264
that there is time to
think of those three men

470
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,137
and the burdens and the hopes

471
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:09,143
that they carry on
behalf of all Mankind.

472
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:18,117
I had the feeling
the whole world was watching us.

473
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:25,159
So, not only do I have
a lot of things I can do wrong,

474
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:29,197
but the consequences
should I do them wrong

475
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:33,530
are going to be immediately obvious
to three billion people

476
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:37,128
and... that's
a worrisome thought.

477
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,641
T-minus ten minutes
and counting, t-minus ten.

478
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,643
We're aiming for our planned lift-off

479
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,838
at 32 minutes past the hour.

480
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,710
This is Kennedy launch control.

481
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:49,842
I don't know why
people who have not been on rockets

482
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:53,887
continue to ask
"You were not scared?"

483
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:56,115
No, we were not scared!

484
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:59,556
Until something happens,
then it's time to get scared.

485
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:01,925
We're just past
the two minute mark in the countdown,

486
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,055
t-minus 1 minute, 54 seconds.

487
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:07,361
The countdown
is a very negative thing.

488
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:09,060
You just hope nothing goes wrong.

489
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,070
You think, "oh, whoosh,
we got by that one

490
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,470
and maybe
we'll get by that one..."

491
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,599
and then when you get
very close to launch,

492
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:19,509
suddenly, it's like someone turned on
a big electric light bulb,

493
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:23,105
You think, "You know,
I think we're really going to go, you know,

494
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,980
I think it's going to happen.
We're going to leave!"

495
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,849
30 seconds and counting.

496
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,121
Astronauts report it feels good.

497
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,194
T-minus 25 seconds...

498
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,922
20 seconds and counting.

499
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,728
T-minus 15 seconds.

500
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:44,700
Guidance is internal.

501
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,604
12, 11, 10, 9...

502
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,336
Ignition sequence starts.

503
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:53,571
Six, five, four,

504
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,207
Three, two, one, zero.

505
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,119
At the moment of lift-off,

506
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:09,250
There were numbers
changing on the dashboard,

507
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:13,354
there were sounds
indicating in the voice loop

508
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:18,334
that we'd had lift-off,
but what did we feel?

509
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:22,167
I think we felt,
in those early moments,

510
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:26,004
that we were not attached
to the ground any more,

511
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,568
but there was
a slight hunting, maybe,

512
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,545
of the guidance system.

513
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:35,551
I'd describe it as a nervous novice

514
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:38,383
driving a wide car down a narrow alley.

515
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,889
You know, you've got to make corrections,
you're not quite sure.

516
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:42,515
You zig this way and that way...

517
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,823
And what it is,
it's those big motors underneath

518
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,124
"gimbaling", you know,
swivelling back and forth

519
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:49,323
to keep you in balance.

520
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:52,060
This thing is a pencil as it goes up

521
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:55,934
and it has to be
balanced very precisely.

522
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,770
And the gimbaling of the motors,
you feel in the seat of your pants

523
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:05,337
and thinking, "Gee, that launch tower
is just a few feet off to one side.

524
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:09,043
I hope this sucker ain't gonna gimbal
over in that direction too much."

525
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,951
And then when they tell
you launch tower clear,

526
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:15,580
you kind of say, "Oh, whoosh,

527
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,717
that's good. We don't have to
worry about hitting that moose."

528
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,886
And then off you go from there.

529
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:25,772
Will metal
stand this kind of vibration?

530
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:29,578
Have the engineers realized
how this thing shakes?

531
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:31,880
Because it shakes and vibrates

532
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:34,319
so much more than I ever imagined.

533
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,657
When they open up
the fuel manifolds,

534
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:42,891
we could hear the fuel
rumble down these huge pipes.

535
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:46,092
Then it dawned on me,
from an emotional point of view,

536
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:47,862
that we're going to go to the Moon.

537
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:52,467
The sound and the reverberations

538
00:41:52,574 --> 00:41:53,598
coming from those engines,

539
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,403
those five engines
when they're ignited,

540
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,673
it shakes the whole body,
the reverberations from it.

541
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,906
It's very emotional.

542
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,082
You're not just riding along.

543
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:07,347
A lot of people think
you're just lying on your back

544
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:08,752
waiting for it to happen.

545
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:11,155
But not really,
because every second

546
00:42:11,258 --> 00:42:13,886
is something of significance.

547
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,591
I found out
from the flight surgeon later on

548
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:23,762
that my heartbeat
was a 144 at lift-off.

549
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:27,965
John's was 70.

550
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,975
Yeah, well, I told him.

551
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:32,910
I said mine was too old
to go any faster. Yeah.

552
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:38,113
I was wondering, why did we do
all these launch simulations?

553
00:42:38,218 --> 00:42:41,551
If I had had to reach a switch
with all of that vibration going on

554
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:44,919
I wouldn't have quite been sure
where I was putting my hand.

555
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:53,397
We were on our way.

556
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:55,524
What a ride, babe, what a ride!

557
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:59,331
I had control of that vehicle
right in the palm of my hands.

558
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:02,052
If the guidance failed
or started to stray

559
00:43:02,152 --> 00:43:04,403
or went somewhere we didn't like,
or the Ground didn't like,

560
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:07,774
I could flip a switch
and I could control seven...

561
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:10,040
over seven and a half million pounds

562
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:12,707
of rocket thrust with this handle

563
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:14,114
and fly the thing to the Moon myself.

564
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,778
And I guarantee you, I had practiced it

565
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:20,949
and trained for it so many times,
I almost dared...

566
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:22,889
I almost dared her to quit on me.

567
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:29,124
Every breath she breathed,
I breathed with her.

568
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,260
She was uniquely something special

569
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:35,099
and what a hell of a ride she gave us.

570
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,733
We had been warned
about shutdown with the Saturn

571
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,562
because you go
from four and a half Gs

572
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:08,295
to zero just like that.

573
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,642
And this big fireball

574
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:17,234
comes roaring up
the length of that booster...

575
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:20,782
And just...
Out in front of you

576
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:22,577
then the second stage fires

577
00:44:22,684 --> 00:44:24,208
and you fly right through the fireball

578
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,786
and you're on your way again.

579
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:28,253
Roger, Houston,
you are go for staging.

580
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,696
Houston, thrusters go, all engines.

581
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:43,702
You're looking good.

582
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,738
Roger, hearing you
loud and clear, Houston.

583
00:45:06,593 --> 00:45:07,560
Tower's gone.

584
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:09,060
Roger, tower.

585
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:11,790
Yeah!
They finally gave me a window to look out!

586
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:18,602
You go up into Earth orbit

587
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,434
and you go around the Earth once

588
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,440
and again that's a busy time,

589
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:25,305
because you want to make sure

590
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:28,812
that everything on board
is working properly

591
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:31,610
before you set sail for the Moon.

592
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,612
Apollo 11, this is Houston.

593
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,847
You are go for TLI. Over.

594
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:41,421
Apollo 11, thank you.

595
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:44,757
And then you get
the word you're go for TLI

596
00:45:44,862 --> 00:45:48,127
and that means you can ignite the motor

597
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:50,758
and head on off to
the Moon and you do,

598
00:45:50,868 --> 00:45:53,132
and you go, and that's it!

599
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:06,613
Ignition.

600
00:46:13,056 --> 00:46:16,048
We confirm ignition and the thrust is go.

601
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:18,854
Just a second.

602
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:22,990
Apollo 11, out.

603
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,226
35,000 feet per second.

604
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,136
Get out.

605
00:46:37,513 --> 00:46:42,917
Climb velocity 35,570 feet per second.

606
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:46,476
Altitude, 177 nautical miles.

607
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:51,049
Houston, Apollo 11,

608
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:55,118
that Saturn gave us a magnificent ride.

609
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,357
Uh, roger, 11,
we'll pass that on.

610
00:46:57,465 --> 00:47:00,059
And it kind of looks
like you're on your way now.

611
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:42,104
In Earth orbit, the horizon's
just slightly curved.

612
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:45,473
When you head on out to the Moon,
in very short order,

613
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:47,808
and you get a chance
to look back at the Earth,

614
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:50,849
that horizon slowly curves
around in upon itself

615
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,542
and all of a sudden,
you're looking at something...

616
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:55,814
that's very strange
but yet is very, very familiar

617
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:59,755
because you're beginning
to see the Earth evolve.

618
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:03,216
I was able to look out the window

619
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:06,263
to see this incredible sight

620
00:48:06,364 --> 00:48:08,662
of the whole circle of the Earth.

621
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:12,932
Oceans were crystal blue,

622
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:15,370
the land was brown,

623
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:17,964
and the clouds and the
snow were pure white

624
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:19,474
and that jewel of Earth

625
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:23,274
was just hung up in
the blackness of space.

626
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:31,745
The only people that have seen
the whole circle of the Earth

627
00:48:31,856 --> 00:48:34,689
are the 24 guys that went to the Moon.

628
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:42,925
When you see Earth like that, it's powerful.

629
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:46,399
Not... Not even bigger
than that, way up there.

630
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:55,574
How peaceful and calm
and quiet and serene it looked,

631
00:48:55,678 --> 00:48:57,942
how fragile it appeared.

632
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:00,641
That was the... oddly enough...

633
00:49:00,749 --> 00:49:04,708
the overriding sensation I got
looking at the Earth was,

634
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,314
"My God, that little thing
is so fragile out there."

635
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:14,755
You get to see
the Earth receding,

636
00:49:14,863 --> 00:49:17,798
you get to see the Moon
coming towards you...

637
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,131
And it's awe-inspiring.

638
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:24,671
And you start to identify, "Hey,
we're going to be up there pretty soon,

639
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:27,002
and, bye-bye, back there."

640
00:49:39,654 --> 00:49:41,747
This transmission is coming to you

641
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:45,417
approximately halfway
between the Moon and the Earth.

642
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:49,826
We've been 31 hours,
about 20 minutes into flight.

643
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,693
We have about, uh,

644
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:55,097
less than 40 hours left to go to the Moon.

645
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,998
We journeyed on our way.

646
00:49:57,103 --> 00:49:58,536
We set up a course,

647
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:01,436
we took our suits off
at this point, stowed them,

648
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,443
we ate a meal and then
just went into our flight plan.

649
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,811
You know,
wasn't Grandma's cooking,

650
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:11,177
but it was worth it.

651
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,187
We did have hot water
on the command module

652
00:50:16,288 --> 00:50:17,880
and so we took, uh...

653
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:20,925
a regular little shaving cream

654
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:23,426
and a razor and had a tissue paper,

655
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:25,497
And I can't tell you how good,

656
00:50:25,598 --> 00:50:29,557
after three or four days,
it feels to shave.

657
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:34,968
In our checklist,

658
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:39,009
it turned out that
my little boys and my wife,

659
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,544
had these little
greetings, if you will,

660
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:43,807
were inserted into the flight plan.

661
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:48,242
This one was from my son, Charles.

662
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:52,346
It says, just in crayon,

663
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,687
"From Charles. We love you."

664
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,692
And on the other side,
he sort of had his idea

665
00:50:57,794 --> 00:51:02,322
of what the...
Lunar Module looks like.

666
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:07,262
And Tom, that was not quite five,

667
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:11,933
and he wrote "Dear Daddy,

668
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:18,675
have a safe trip home. Love, Tom."

669
00:51:23,386 --> 00:51:27,152
It's not fear, it's worry.

670
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:31,022
And I think there's a legitimate distinction
between the two.

671
00:51:31,127 --> 00:51:33,652
So, it's not a question
of you're scared all the time,

672
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:37,665
but it is you're mildly worried all the time,
or at least, I was.

673
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,600
You know, you're not sure all these things
are going to work properly,

674
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:45,105
and there's a hell of a lot of them
coming in a very fragile daisy-chain

675
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:48,003
and you don't want any of those links
in the chain to break

676
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:52,375
because downstream from that broken link,
they're all useless.

677
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,142
So yes, you're worried,
you're concerned.

678
00:51:56,351 --> 00:52:00,754
I always thought of myself as one
of the more fearful astronauts, really.

679
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,782
And when I'd look out of the window
of the spacecraft,

680
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,486
I would think,
"If that window blows out,

681
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:10,119
I'm going to die in about a second."

682
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,063
There's death right out
there about an inch away.

683
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:16,829
All your systems are looking good.

684
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:17,926
Going around the corner.

685
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:20,199
We'll see you on the other side, over.

686
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:24,668
Everything looks okay up here.

687
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:27,042
Roger, out.

688
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:30,638
We... We didn't see the Moon
until after we were there.

689
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,843
It's like some of these
science-fiction movies

690
00:52:32,952 --> 00:52:35,944
where you see this big meteorite
just slowly moving.

691
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:37,750
You could feel the Moon's presence.

692
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:39,984
You couldn't see it.

693
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:43,259
We went into darkness,

694
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:47,162
after being in daylight the whole time

695
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:49,598
on the way to the Moon.

696
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:52,135
And then we went into darkness.

697
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:58,743
And we're in the shadow of the Moon.

698
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,144
When the Sun is shining on the surface

699
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,221
at a very shallow angle,

700
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,187
the craters cast long shadows

701
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,124
and the Moon's surface
seems very inhospitable.

702
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,024
Forbidding, almost.

703
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:02,362
I did not sense any great invitation

704
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:06,464
on the part of the Moon
for us to come into its domain.

705
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:10,375
I sensed more, almost a hostile place...

706
00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:12,913
A... a scary place.

707
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:37,264
It was tense,

708
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,932
because even though
they'd practiced it in the simulator cockpit,

709
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:44,102
they didn't always make
a successful landing.

710
00:54:46,046 --> 00:54:49,277
You've got to end up down there
with just the right amount of fuel.

711
00:54:49,382 --> 00:54:52,647
Like, three minutes, you've got to be
at a certain altitude and air speed.

712
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:53,946
It didn't work...

713
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:56,955
Sometimes the update
from the landing radar didn't work,

714
00:54:57,056 --> 00:55:00,617
and this was when
we were trying to do it right,

715
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:02,592
just to find a way to do it right.

716
00:55:02,696 --> 00:55:05,062
This was a big deal.

717
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:06,962
Okay, it's go there, Capcom,

718
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:08,226
on the hot fire, okay?

719
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:09,802
All flight controllers going on the horn.

720
00:55:09,902 --> 00:55:11,597
Go, no-go for undocking!

721
00:55:11,704 --> 00:55:15,037
Retro? Go! Fido? Go! Guidance? Go!

722
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:17,769
Control? Go!
Delcom? Go! GNC? Go!

723
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:19,811
Ecom? Go! Surgeon? Go!

724
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:21,504
Capcom, we're go
for undocking.

725
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:24,339
Apollo 11, Houston,

726
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,678
We're go for undocking, over.

727
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:40,858
Capcom was
the capsule communicator

728
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:43,263
and it was always an astronaut.

729
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,859
and he was the only
one that was allowed

730
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,133
to speak directly to the crew.

731
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:51,537
Tell him to go... over.

732
00:55:51,642 --> 00:55:53,473
And so I was very, very excited

733
00:55:53,577 --> 00:55:57,741
to be part of that historic event.

734
00:55:57,848 --> 00:55:59,247
If... we pulled it off,

735
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:01,943
was going to be
a tremendous honour.

736
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:39,277
Capcom, we're go to continue PDI.

737
00:56:39,387 --> 00:56:41,014
You're go to...

738
00:56:41,122 --> 00:56:42,817
You're go to continue
powered descent.

739
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:44,983
You're go to
continue powered descent.

740
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:49,460
Okay, everybody. Let's hang tight,

741
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:50,690
look for landing radar.

742
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:51,766
Flight guns?

743
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,299
Man 1:

744
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:54,993
We'll meet that landing radar
by 18,000 with this down-track.

745
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:56,136
Rog.

746
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,107
The landing radar
was now beginning to receive signals

747
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:06,168
and being Dr. Rendezvous,
no matter what the checklist said,

748
00:57:06,279 --> 00:57:10,807
I was going to leave
the rendezvous radar on and active

749
00:57:10,918 --> 00:57:14,615
so if we had to abort,
it was on and working

750
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:18,852
and we could reacquire
mic as soon as possible

751
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:20,483
if we had to go back up.

752
00:57:20,594 --> 00:57:21,959
Houston, we got data dropout,

753
00:57:22,062 --> 00:57:23,427
you're still looking good.

754
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:25,861
Then we had a computer alarm.

755
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:28,866
"Computer Problem, 1202".

756
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:30,902
And well, what's 1202?

757
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:38,605
1202, 1202!

758
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:40,702
So when the crew reported this alarm,

759
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:42,178
my heart sank, really.

760
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:46,479
"Oh no, we've got a main,
primary computer problem.

761
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:48,576
1202 alarm.

762
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:53,782
Yeah, and same thing we had.

763
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,097
So the landing radar
is feeding information,

764
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,861
the rendezvous radar is,

765
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:11,432
and evidently that combination
was not anticipated by the guys at M.I.T.

766
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:12,736
They're pretty narrow-minded.

767
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:16,210
You're making a descent,
you need the radar, landing radar!

768
00:58:16,313 --> 00:58:18,110
You're making a rendezvous,
you need the rende...

769
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:19,705
But you don't need to mix the two.

770
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,242
But they didn't think the same way I did.

771
00:58:29,226 --> 00:58:32,684
The guidance guy,
Steve Bales, responded...

772
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,821
We're go on that flight!

773
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:37,161
I heard him say that
to flight control

774
00:58:37,268 --> 00:58:39,702
and I just voiced right up,

775
00:58:39,803 --> 00:58:41,930
"We're go, we're go, Eagle."

776
00:58:42,038 --> 00:58:43,801
And we were go.

777
00:58:43,907 --> 00:58:46,375
Eagle, Houston,
you are go for landing, over.

778
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:47,670
Roger, understand.

779
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,267
Going for landing, 3000 feet.

780
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:51,643
Look out for alarm: 1201.

781
00:58:51,748 --> 00:58:52,806
1201?

782
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:54,144
Roger, 1201.

783
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,274
Same type, we're go, flight.

784
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:56,715
- Okay, we're go.
- We're go.

785
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,286
Same type, we're go.

786
00:58:58,387 --> 00:59:00,014
47 degrees.

787
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:01,646
Roger.

788
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:03,782
Descent, two fuel only.

789
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:06,861
Fuel critical.
They didn't want to say critical.

790
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:08,793
And then it seemed like Neil

791
00:59:08,897 --> 00:59:13,630
was having a difficult time
finding a suitable spot to put it down

792
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:16,602
and I got a little worried then

793
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:18,730
because they didn't have
a lot of extra fuel.

794
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,001
I think we better be quiet, Mike.

795
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:22,736
400 feet, down at 9.

796
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:25,506
Okay, the only call-outs
from now on will be fuel.

797
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:29,208
The guidance system
was carrying them into a big boulder field

798
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,410
and it wasn't suitable to land.

799
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:33,544
So we noticed the trajectory level off

800
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:37,112
and he just started
flying almost horizontal

801
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:40,058
across the Moon at a high rate of speed.

802
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,753
One of the worst things
you can do for gas

803
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:45,491
is stop your rate of descent

804
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,534
because then you have to take time
flying level,

805
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:51,195
then you have to get
your rate of descent built up again.

806
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:53,329
All that takes gas, okay?

807
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,433
So when he levelled off, I thought,
"I wonder if he's going to make it."

808
00:59:57,544 --> 01:00:00,411
If... If there was a
boulder field and a crater

809
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,482
that we wanted to avoid,

810
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:05,380
there are four things you can do.

811
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:06,951
You can land short,

812
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:10,112
you can land left, right, or land long.

813
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:13,055
All right, to land short,
you've got to pitch up like this

814
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:15,684
and you lose sight
of where you're going.

815
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:17,728
And... Either left or right

816
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,094
is also a pretty drastic manoeuvre.

817
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,567
The easiest thing to do
is to just pitch forward a little bit

818
01:00:23,669 --> 01:00:25,227
and fly over and land long.

819
01:00:25,337 --> 01:00:27,965
Some of these boulders
were the size of Volkswagens

820
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:31,041
and you don't want to land
with one gear on top of one

821
01:00:31,142 --> 01:00:32,734
and one gear down in a hole.

822
01:00:32,844 --> 01:00:34,835
That would not have been good.

823
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:39,144
So, it was a little... Iffy
right there at the very end.

824
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:47,318
We had two calls
that we were to give from mission control.

825
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:51,759
The first was "Eagle, 60 seconds",

826
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:54,763
that meant he got
60 more seconds to land

827
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:57,163
and at the end of that 60 seconds,

828
01:00:57,267 --> 01:01:01,101
by mission rule, I would call abort.

829
01:01:01,205 --> 01:01:03,833
I never imagined
that he wasn't going to land by then

830
01:01:03,941 --> 01:01:05,875
because I think he
would have dropped it in

831
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:07,671
from wherever the engine quit.

832
01:01:07,778 --> 01:01:09,473
He wasn't coming home and saying,

833
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:12,879
"I got low on fuel
so I decided to abandon it."

834
01:01:12,982 --> 01:01:14,677
I don't think any
astronaut would do that,

835
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:16,115
that wouldn't be the right stuff!

836
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:19,120
300 feet down.
Three and a half. 47 forward.

837
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:21,850
Neil thinks things through thoroughly

838
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,892
and then does what he thinks is right

839
01:01:23,993 --> 01:01:26,894
and usually it's the right thing to do.

840
01:01:26,996 --> 01:01:29,988
I don't think anybody can come close

841
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:33,000
to touching the skills that he had.

842
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:37,038
75 feet, just down a half. Roger, over.

843
01:01:37,138 --> 01:01:39,470
60. 60 seconds.

844
01:01:39,574 --> 01:01:42,407
The tension mounted in mission control

845
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,775
and it was like you could feel it.

846
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,407
You couldn't see it,
but you could sense the tension.

847
01:01:49,517 --> 01:01:53,783
And it was...
I remember dead silence.

848
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,287
Three feet down, two and a half.

849
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:03,522
Picking up some dust.

850
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:05,496
Three feet, two and a half down.

851
01:02:09,403 --> 01:02:11,200
Pull forward.
Just into the right a little.

852
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:12,829
30 seconds!

853
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:21,905
Contact light.

854
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:27,747
Okay, engines stop.

855
01:02:27,854 --> 01:02:28,821
Descent.

856
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:31,181
Remote control, both on.

857
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,418
Descent engine Command override off.

858
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:35,221
Engine arm off.

859
01:02:35,328 --> 01:02:38,126
413 is in.

860
01:02:38,231 --> 01:02:39,823
We've had shut down.

861
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:41,832
We copy you down, Eagle.

862
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:44,835
Okay, everybody, t-1,
stand by for t-1.

863
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:47,369
Tranquillity Base here.

864
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,837
The Eagle has landed!

865
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,965
Roger, twang... Tranquillity,

866
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:52,236
We copy you on the ground.

867
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:54,244
You've got a bunch of
guys about to turn blue.

868
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:56,007
We're breathing again,
thanks a lot.

869
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,310
Thank you.

870
01:02:58,417 --> 01:02:59,475
I was so excited,

871
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:01,575
I couldn't even get out "Tranquillity".

872
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:04,212
It was "twang-quillity"
or something like that.

873
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:14,993
Whew! Boy!

874
01:03:16,934 --> 01:03:18,697
Special announcement!

875
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:20,668
You will be happy to know

876
01:03:20,771 --> 01:03:25,003
that the Apollo 11 has landed safely.

877
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:38,314
I think it's just wonderful

878
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:41,913
to be on Earth and to live
what's going on on the Moon.

879
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:43,754
It's marvellous!

880
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,953
And as a French woman,
how do you think about it?

881
01:03:46,062 --> 01:03:47,154
Oh, I think it's wonderful.

882
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:50,164
I always trusted America
and I knew they couldn't fail.

883
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:53,928
I think we might have
gone and had a beer.

884
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:56,095
But I...

885
01:03:56,205 --> 01:03:58,173
So we were real happy and it was...

886
01:03:58,273 --> 01:03:59,570
Real pleased we'd done it

887
01:03:59,675 --> 01:04:03,236
and so it was a great feeling
of accomplishment and pride,

888
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:06,803
For the... President Kennedy
and for the nation,

889
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:08,940
we did what we said we were going to do.

890
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:21,524
Roger. We read you five-by, Columbia.

891
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,654
He has landed.
Tranquillity Base.

892
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:26,893
Eagle is at
Tranquillity, over.

893
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,491
Yeah, I heard the whole thing!

894
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,901
Well, it was a good show.

895
01:04:31,005 --> 01:04:32,734
Fantastic.

896
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:38,702
I discovered later

897
01:04:38,812 --> 01:04:43,681
that I was described as
the loneliest man ever

898
01:04:43,784 --> 01:04:48,312
in the universe or something,
which really is a lot of baloney.

899
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:51,585
I mean, I...
I had mission control

900
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:55,752
yakking in my ear half the time.

901
01:04:57,164 --> 01:05:00,258
Columbia, Houston. How did it go? Over.

902
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:01,924
Listen, babe,

903
01:05:02,034 --> 01:05:04,161
everything is going just swimmingly,
it's beautiful.

904
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:06,898
I rather enjoyed it.

905
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:09,372
I certainly was aware of the fact

906
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:11,739
that I was by myself,

907
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:14,938
particularly when I was over
on the back side of the Moon.

908
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:17,880
You know, I can remember
thinking, "God, you look over there

909
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:21,043
and there's 3 billion people,

910
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:24,452
plus two, somewhere down there,

911
01:05:24,556 --> 01:05:28,856
and then over here there's one plus...

912
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,359
God only knows what!"

913
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:33,056
So, I... I know I felt that strongly,

914
01:05:33,164 --> 01:05:36,190
but I didn't feel it as loneliness

915
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:38,132
and I certainly didn't feel it as fear,

916
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,760
I felt it as awareness,

917
01:05:40,872 --> 01:05:42,840
almost a feeling of exaltation.

918
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:44,841
I... I liked it.
It was a good feeling.

919
01:05:46,477 --> 01:05:48,604
Everything was going well
with the command module,

920
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:52,113
I had my happy little home,
I had the bright lights on.

921
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,309
Everything was fine. I enjoyed that time.

922
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:03,450
They're going to probably open
the hatch of the Lunar Module

923
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,653
around 9:00 o'clock
Eastern Daylight time,

924
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:08,390
just two hours from now
and shortly after that,

925
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:11,433
38-year-old Neil Armstrong, civilian,

926
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,001
of Wapakoneta, Ohio,

927
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,570
the Commander of this
successful Moon mission

928
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,471
will begin to step down the nine steps
of the Lunar landing Module

929
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,873
to the surface of the Moon itself.

930
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,639
And what a moment that will be!

931
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,340
And we're getting a picture on the TV.

932
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,917
There's a great deal of contrast in it

933
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,112
and currently,
it's upside down on our monitor

934
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,950
but we can make out a fair amount of detail.

935
01:06:35,056 --> 01:06:37,650
I realised,
of all the science-fiction writers

936
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:39,659
who ever wrote about going to the Moon,

937
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:42,491
I don't believe any of them ever dreamed

938
01:06:42,597 --> 01:06:45,293
about the world watching it on television.

939
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:50,728
Neil, this is Houston,

940
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,672
loud and clear.
Break, break, Buzz, this is Houston,

941
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:56,608
Uh, radio check, and
verify TV circuit breaker.

942
01:06:58,177 --> 01:07:00,111
Roger, TV circuit breaker's in.

943
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:09,981
Okay, Neil,

944
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:11,989
we can see you coming
down the ladder now.

945
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:17,855
Every place I go,
everybody I see, meet,

946
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:21,627
even people who were children,
tiny babies at the time,

947
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:24,498
watched Neil put his
first step on the Moon,

948
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:26,333
the whole world participated.

949
01:07:26,439 --> 01:07:27,770
...Que I'homme pour la premiere fois,

950
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:29,603
prenne pied sur la lune.

951
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,472
Les Russes sont loin...
naturellement.

952
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,481
Stand by.

953
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:56,131
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

954
01:07:56,234 --> 01:08:00,694
The L.M. footpads are only, uh...

955
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:05,106
Depressed in the surface about...
one or two inches,

956
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:09,805
although the surface appears to be

957
01:08:09,914 --> 01:08:13,406
very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.

958
01:08:13,517 --> 01:08:17,180
It's almost like a powder down there.

959
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:18,812
It's very fine.

960
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,757
Okay, I'm going to step off the L.M. now.

961
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:40,905
That's one small step for Man...

962
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:46,576
One giant leap for Mankind.

963
01:08:48,282 --> 01:08:51,376
"That's one small step for Man,

964
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:55,355
One giant leap for Mankind."

965
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,732
It was like Neil,

966
01:09:15,843 --> 01:09:18,403
but deeper than I thought

967
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:21,209
that he would come up with.

968
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:25,308
I wouldn't have had the
self-control to do that.

969
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,478
I'd have...

970
01:09:26,587 --> 01:09:28,316
To me, I'd have been
jumping up and down,

971
01:09:28,423 --> 01:09:30,653
"Yahoo!" You know?
"Man, I'm here!"

972
01:09:30,758 --> 01:09:33,784
It was... That's the kind of response
that I think I would have had.

973
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:38,058
But he was very, very controlled

974
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:40,964
and those words came out

975
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:44,128
and they were very appropriate
and... Perfect.

976
01:09:45,972 --> 01:09:47,701
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.

977
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,969
It has a stark beauty all its own,

978
01:09:50,078 --> 01:09:54,538
it's like much of the high desert
of the United States.

979
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:58,015
It's different
but it's very pretty out here.

980
01:09:58,116 --> 01:10:00,607
We had it in our flight plan

981
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,679
that we'd take the first 10-15 seconds

982
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,382
down at the bottom of the ladder,

983
01:10:06,492 --> 01:10:09,393
sort of hold on to the
edge of the landing gear

984
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:13,192
and just sort of check
our stability and so forth.

985
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,927
Okay, I'm on the top steps

986
01:10:15,034 --> 01:10:17,161
and it's a very simple
matter to hop down

987
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:18,634
from one step to the next.

988
01:10:18,738 --> 01:10:20,501
So that's when I decided

989
01:10:20,605 --> 01:10:23,301
to take that period of time to, ah...

990
01:10:23,408 --> 01:10:26,673
To...

991
01:10:26,778 --> 01:10:28,473
Take care of a bodily function

992
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,447
of slightly filling up the urine bag,

993
01:10:31,549 --> 01:10:35,815
so that I wouldn't be troubled

994
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,979
with having to do that later on.

995
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:40,649
There you go.

996
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:43,853
So, anyway, everybody has
their firsts on the Moon.

997
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:48,989
And that one hasn't been
disputed by anybody.

998
01:10:54,972 --> 01:10:56,940
The only change
that I noticed they made

999
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,407
prior to their flight
was they'd come to them

1000
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:02,706
about a month ahead of time,
as I remember.

1001
01:11:02,813 --> 01:11:04,872
And they said to them,

1002
01:11:04,982 --> 01:11:07,644
"You're going to plant
the American flag."

1003
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:12,653
So, we got the flag out
and put it in the ground

1004
01:11:12,755 --> 01:11:16,657
and we'd never really
practiced that one before.

1005
01:11:33,775 --> 01:11:35,868
Here we were on the surface

1006
01:11:35,977 --> 01:11:40,641
and I knew this was what
people were watching.

1007
01:11:40,749 --> 01:11:42,410
More people were watching us

1008
01:11:42,517 --> 01:11:45,953
than had ever watched two human beings
before in history

1009
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:49,956
and yet we're further away,
not just in distance

1010
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:52,721
but in things we've got to do
to get back home.

1011
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:55,227
We've got to do some difficult things

1012
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:57,627
to get out of this desolate place

1013
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,596
and get back home again.

1014
01:12:25,325 --> 01:12:26,815
Thank you, 13.

1015
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,622
13, we've got one more item for you
when you get a chance.

1016
01:12:29,729 --> 01:12:32,527
We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks.

1017
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:36,461
Stand by.

1018
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:41,128
When the explosion occurred, of course,

1019
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,572
I didn't know what happened.

1020
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:46,735
Houston, we've had a problem.

1021
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,710
Stand by 13, we're looking at it.

1022
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:55,247
We saw the oxygen go to zero

1023
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:57,151
And then come up to the top

1024
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:58,587
and then went down to zero again.

1025
01:13:07,865 --> 01:13:09,457
We were in serious trouble.

1026
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,598
I thought when I saw
that oxygen system leaking down,

1027
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:17,003
I figured we'd lost them.
I really did.

1028
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:18,598
I didn't think we'd make it.

1029
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:22,405
We were as calm as could be.

1030
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:25,606
We didn't panic.
Uh, if we did,

1031
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:27,114
we'd still be up there,

1032
01:13:27,217 --> 01:13:29,811
or we could have
bounced off the walls for ten minutes

1033
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,115
and be back where we started from.

1034
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:34,850
So the first thing
that went through our mind was:

1035
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,256
"What do we have to work with
to get home?"

1036
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,523
And of course,
we had the Lunar Module.

1037
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:43,963
It was like, abandon ship,
get into the lifeboat

1038
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:46,501
and we'll come back in the lifeboat.

1039
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,634
We figure we've got about 15 minutes

1040
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:52,172
worth of power left
in the Command Module

1041
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:55,402
so we want you to start
getting over in the L.M.,

1042
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:57,570
and getting some power in it.

1043
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,648
And you ready to copy your procedure?

1044
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:00,976
Okay.

1045
01:14:07,889 --> 01:14:11,290
I worked on the problem
of using the Lunar Module

1046
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:15,852
as the prime propulsion vehicle,
as a tugboat.

1047
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:19,764
and how they could fly it manually,
stick and rudder stuff,

1048
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:22,802
if they'd lost the prime guidance system.

1049
01:14:23,972 --> 01:14:25,462
John and I, with others,

1050
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:27,905
had worked on this manoeuvre
to get them back

1051
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:30,842
on what was called a
free return trajectory,

1052
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:32,002
so they would come back

1053
01:14:32,112 --> 01:14:35,513
and come right back
into Earth's atmosphere

1054
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:37,845
on the correct angle and velocity.

1055
01:14:39,453 --> 01:14:43,321
Apollo 13, 2 minutes away now
from scheduled time of ignition.

1056
01:14:43,423 --> 01:14:46,153
And so we used the Earth's terminator

1057
01:14:46,259 --> 01:14:47,988
to figure out our attitude,

1058
01:14:48,095 --> 01:14:52,054
we had to get the Earth in the window
of the Lunar Module.

1059
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:54,065
Confirmed ignition.

1060
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:55,894
I knew when that engine went on,

1061
01:14:56,002 --> 01:14:59,995
without an autopilot, I'd never be able
to keep the Earth in the window by myself,

1062
01:15:00,106 --> 01:15:02,370
so Fred-O kept the Earth
from going sideways,

1063
01:15:02,475 --> 01:15:04,136
I kept it from going up and down...

1064
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,575
I had to learn to...
manoeuvre all over again

1065
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:11,240
in a very short period of time.

1066
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,750
But you'd be surprised
how quickly you learn.

1067
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:17,052
Houston, you're looking good.

1068
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:19,645
My attitude went from,
"We ain't going to make it"

1069
01:15:19,758 --> 01:15:22,659
to, "If we don't foul up
and they don't foul up,

1070
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:25,389
and we don't have any other disaster,

1071
01:15:25,497 --> 01:15:26,486
we're going to make it."

1072
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:39,233
It was NASA's greatest moment,
I'm convinced.

1073
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:43,039
And that crew,
to keep calm and responsive

1074
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:45,115
and do things right the first time,

1075
01:15:45,215 --> 01:15:48,776
that's important, it was just great.
They were great.

1076
01:15:48,886 --> 01:15:52,845
It was a case of survival
and certainly landing on the Moon

1077
01:15:52,956 --> 01:15:57,222
and surviving to see the next sunrise
are two different things.

1078
01:15:57,327 --> 01:16:01,161
And it wasn't until I got
comfortably back on Earth

1079
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,825
that I became very much disappointed

1080
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:06,834
in not making a landing on the Moon.

1081
01:16:20,683 --> 01:16:21,843
Boy, that's a big mountain

1082
01:16:21,951 --> 01:16:23,350
when you're down here
looking up, isn't it?

1083
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:24,818
We all of a sudden realized

1084
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,047
that we were below the
tops of the mountains.

1085
01:16:27,155 --> 01:16:29,453
I can't believe it. Amazing!

1086
01:16:29,558 --> 01:16:31,389
And then I look out at the horizon

1087
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:33,085
and I thought to myself,

1088
01:16:33,195 --> 01:16:36,790
"God, I hope Pete doesn't land
over there because we'll tip over."

1089
01:16:36,898 --> 01:16:38,263
Here comes the shadow.

1090
01:16:38,366 --> 01:16:40,857
We were blowing lunar dust everywhere.

1091
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,994
It was like landing through the fog.

1092
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,308
Well, we is here!

1093
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:50,775
Man, is we here!
How's that look?

1094
01:16:50,878 --> 01:16:52,607
And if there's any one moment

1095
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:55,341
in my whole flight when time stood still,

1096
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,010
it was those first few seconds
when we touched down

1097
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,214
and everything came to a screeching halt.

1098
01:17:02,322 --> 01:17:03,812
And there we were.

1099
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,292
The first feelings were,

1100
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:16,095
"Wow, this is, uh...
What am I doing here?

1101
01:17:16,202 --> 01:17:18,329
This is a different world!"

1102
01:17:18,438 --> 01:17:21,066
And, uh, there's a part of it of...

1103
01:17:21,174 --> 01:17:24,610
"You dumb ass... You've really got yourself
into something here!"

1104
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:33,984
When you land
on the Moon and you stop,

1105
01:17:34,086 --> 01:17:36,850
and you get out, nobody's out there.

1106
01:17:36,955 --> 01:17:40,391
This little L.M. and then
the two of you, you're it,

1107
01:17:40,492 --> 01:17:42,926
on this whole big place.

1108
01:17:43,027 --> 01:17:48,226
And that's a weird feeling,
it's a weird feeling to be...

1109
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:50,631
Two people and that's it.

1110
01:17:56,374 --> 01:18:00,970
Oh, my golly. Unbelievable!

1111
01:18:01,078 --> 01:18:02,067
Unbelievable.

1112
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,240
But is it bright in the Sun.

1113
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:07,010
Oh, look at that.

1114
01:18:07,118 --> 01:18:09,086
Isn't that something?

1115
01:18:09,187 --> 01:18:10,779
We're up on a slope, Joe,

1116
01:18:10,888 --> 01:18:12,480
and we're looking back
down into the valley.

1117
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,219
It's beautiful.
That is spectacular.

1118
01:18:25,569 --> 01:18:28,970
Dad, this is really
a rock and rolling ride, isn't it?

1119
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,170
Never been on a ride like this before.

1120
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,302
The Rover was very useful,

1121
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:39,541
very comfortable ride for the most part,

1122
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:42,584
but any time you hit
a bump in one-sixth gravity,

1123
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:44,710
you're going to be off the surface
for a little ways.

1124
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:51,954
I hold the world's speed record
downhill in a Rover.

1125
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:55,497
I think it was
17 kilometres per hour, downhill.

1126
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:02,126
I think even Gene Cernan
with all his test pilot macho

1127
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,206
felt that that was a little fast!

1128
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,671
There are a lot of craters

1129
01:19:05,773 --> 01:19:07,297
and it's just sporty driving.

1130
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:09,535
I've just got to keep my eye
on the road every second.

1131
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,113
What really saves you up there

1132
01:19:12,213 --> 01:19:14,773
is there's nobody coming down the road
from the other way.

1133
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:16,747
Oh, look at this baby climb the hill.

1134
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:28,355
I think the feeling
that I had was the whole time

1135
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:30,692
was the feeling of awe.

1136
01:19:30,797 --> 01:19:36,326
The Moon was the most spectacularly
beautiful desert you can ever imagine.

1137
01:19:36,436 --> 01:19:39,303
Unspoiled, untouched.

1138
01:19:41,475 --> 01:19:44,535
It had a vibrancy about it

1139
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,670
and the contrast between the Moon

1140
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,647
and the black sky was so vivid and...

1141
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,548
It just made this impression, you know,

1142
01:19:52,652 --> 01:19:55,849
of excitement and wonder.

1143
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,953
We were true scientific explorers.

1144
01:20:05,064 --> 01:20:08,090
We were looking at things
that human beings

1145
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,226
had never seen before
or if they had seen them,

1146
01:20:11,336 --> 01:20:13,304
they weren't thinking about them

1147
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:15,100
in terms of understanding our Earth

1148
01:20:15,206 --> 01:20:17,538
and our solar system
and indeed the universe.

1149
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:23,373
And that's what we were.
That's what we were doing.

1150
01:20:23,481 --> 01:20:25,108
We were scientific explorers

1151
01:20:25,216 --> 01:20:28,652
right from the moment
we stepped out of the spacecraft.

1152
01:20:32,357 --> 01:20:35,554
Roger, Dave. Let's do a little geology.

1153
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,151
Going to document the area first here, Joe.

1154
01:20:38,261 --> 01:20:41,059
If you come around there,

1155
01:20:41,165 --> 01:20:42,928
there's a rock in the
near field on this rim...

1156
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:45,399
I'd like you to pick it up as a ground sample.

1157
01:20:46,837 --> 01:20:49,965
I say, John, just look at that footprint.

1158
01:20:50,074 --> 01:20:52,372
Look underneath that
when you picked that up.

1159
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:55,639
...a centimetre or so under, it's white!

1160
01:20:55,746 --> 01:20:57,805
Absolutely white right here.

1161
01:20:57,915 --> 01:20:59,678
Gee, you got a bag?

1162
01:20:59,782 --> 01:21:01,909
All set.

1163
01:21:02,018 --> 01:21:03,485
Okay, I'm going to get the...

1164
01:21:03,586 --> 01:21:07,613
shadowed material...

1165
01:21:07,724 --> 01:21:11,251
Look, this is a real beauty!

1166
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,928
I didn't have any great feeling of...

1167
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,622
"Oh, we've done it!"

1168
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:55,293
I mean, we've done part of it, but, uh...

1169
01:21:55,403 --> 01:21:59,237
I was a lot more worried, I guess,

1170
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,535
about getting them up off the Moon

1171
01:22:01,642 --> 01:22:04,406
than I was about getting
them down onto the Moon.

1172
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:10,775
The motor on the Lunar Module
was one motor

1173
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,546
and if something went wrong with it,

1174
01:22:13,653 --> 01:22:15,621
you know, they were dead men,

1175
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,919
there was no other way
for them to leave.

1176
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:23,053
Ladies and gentlemen,

1177
01:22:23,163 --> 01:22:26,462
the President of the United States.

1178
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:29,535
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

1179
01:22:29,636 --> 01:22:31,365
Tonight, I want to talk to you

1180
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:34,667
on a subject of deep concern
to all Americans

1181
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:37,571
and to many people
in all parts of the world.

1182
01:22:37,676 --> 01:22:38,768
"Fate has ordained

1183
01:22:38,877 --> 01:22:41,778
that the men who went to the Moon
to explore in peace

1184
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,281
will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

1185
01:22:45,384 --> 01:22:49,013
These brave men,
Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

1186
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,021
know that there is no hope
for their recovery,

1187
01:22:52,124 --> 01:22:56,823
but they also know that there is
hope for Mankind In their sacrifice."

1188
01:22:58,696 --> 01:23:00,186
I mean, this is, you know...

1189
01:23:00,298 --> 01:23:03,756
What a public relations
person would have to say.

1190
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:10,366
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1191
01:23:10,475 --> 01:23:13,876
Port stage, engine arm, ascent, proceed.

1192
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:25,119
Beautiful.
26-36 feet per second up.

1193
01:23:25,222 --> 01:23:27,554
Pitchover.

1194
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:29,147
Very smooth.

1195
01:23:30,894 --> 01:23:33,124
Balance couple, off.

1196
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:35,255
Very quiet ride.

1197
01:23:39,835 --> 01:23:42,303
Eagle, Houston request
manual start override.

1198
01:23:45,508 --> 01:23:47,601
2600 feet altitude.

1199
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:52,137
Eagle, Houston,
one minute. You are looking good.

1200
01:23:55,384 --> 01:23:57,375
Oh God, look... It's beautiful.

1201
01:23:57,486 --> 01:23:59,545
It's a beautiful little thing,
you see the L.M., you know,

1202
01:23:59,655 --> 01:24:02,123
a little golden bug down
there among the craters

1203
01:24:02,223 --> 01:24:05,590
and it gets slowly bigger and bigger.

1204
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:09,129
They seem to be, you
know, like riding rails,

1205
01:24:09,231 --> 01:24:12,200
they were very precise.

1206
01:24:12,301 --> 01:24:18,399
And then it got right up next to me
and then it was my job, as before,

1207
01:24:18,506 --> 01:24:21,498
to make the connection
between the two vehicles.

1208
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:37,681
Finally, they got back
into the command module

1209
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:42,091
and I grabbed Buzz by both ears

1210
01:24:42,195 --> 01:24:44,220
and I was going to kiss
him on the forehead,

1211
01:24:44,331 --> 01:24:45,696
I can remember that.

1212
01:24:45,799 --> 01:24:47,562
and I got him to right about here

1213
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,693
and I said, "That's not a very...

1214
01:24:50,803 --> 01:24:53,067
good thing to do somehow,"

1215
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,902
so I forgot,
whether I clapped him on the back

1216
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,635
or shook his hand or did something.

1217
01:24:57,743 --> 01:25:02,806
And again, you don't have time
to sit around and reminisce

1218
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:05,349
because you've got T.E.I. coming up

1219
01:25:05,451 --> 01:25:08,648
in another... little while,

1220
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:12,212
so you've got to get ready for that
and come home.

1221
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,496
The biggest joy
was on the way home.

1222
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:30,871
In my cockpit window, every two minutes,

1223
01:25:30,976 --> 01:25:33,376
the Earth, the Moon, the Sun

1224
01:25:33,477 --> 01:25:37,811
and a whole 360 degree
panorama of the heavens.

1225
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:41,976
And that was a powerful,
overwhelming experience.

1226
01:25:43,687 --> 01:25:47,817
And suddenly I realized
that the molecules of my body

1227
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:49,654
and the molecules of the spacecraft

1228
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,456
and the molecules in the bodies
of my partners

1229
01:25:52,563 --> 01:25:56,192
were prototyped and manufactured

1230
01:25:56,299 --> 01:25:58,824
in some ancient generation of stars.

1231
01:26:03,006 --> 01:26:07,568
And that was an overwhelming sense
of oneness, of connectedness.

1232
01:26:07,677 --> 01:26:11,545
It wasn't them and us,
it was, "that's me, that's all of it,

1233
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:14,139
it's one thing."

1234
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,980
And it was accompanied by an ecstasy,

1235
01:26:17,086 --> 01:26:21,989
a sense of, "oh my God. wow, yes,"
an insight, an epiphany.

1236
01:26:45,178 --> 01:26:48,045
Re-entry is very critical on Apollo.

1237
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:51,209
The last time I looked at my computer,

1238
01:26:51,318 --> 01:26:56,779
we were accelerating
through 39,000 feet per second,

1239
01:26:56,891 --> 01:27:01,726
which is... uh, translates
to over 26,000 miles an hour.

1240
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:04,354
A rifle bullet only
goes 2000 miles an hour.

1241
01:27:07,634 --> 01:27:09,727
You are literally on fire.

1242
01:27:09,836 --> 01:27:13,237
Your heat shield is on fire
and it's streaming...

1243
01:27:13,338 --> 01:27:15,636
Its fragments are
streaming out behind you.

1244
01:27:17,477 --> 01:27:20,241
It's like being inside a gigantic light bulb.

1245
01:27:27,886 --> 01:27:30,821
The re-entry started at 400,000 feet,

1246
01:27:30,923 --> 01:27:32,982
and by the time you've got to 90,000 feet,

1247
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:36,550
you're basically coming
straight down, freefall.

1248
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:45,426
Well, then the final link
in the daisy chain is the...

1249
01:27:45,537 --> 01:27:47,027
is, well, there... Actually,

1250
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:49,073
I guess I'd have to say
there may be two more,

1251
01:27:49,174 --> 01:27:52,143
but, uh... the important one
is that the parachutes open.

1252
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:58,377
Mains coming out,
huge explosion again

1253
01:27:58,483 --> 01:27:59,916
and these three
chutes come out.

1254
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,329
The three orange and
white spheres of reassurance.

1255
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:24,998
That was the end.

1256
01:28:25,108 --> 01:28:26,336
That was the last of the daisy...

1257
01:28:26,443 --> 01:28:27,808
Well, then we had to get out.

1258
01:28:30,947 --> 01:28:33,040
I can remember the beautiful water.

1259
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:36,313
You know, we were out in the deep
ocean in the Pacific.

1260
01:28:36,418 --> 01:28:39,876
It was such a startling violet colour.

1261
01:28:39,989 --> 01:28:42,014
I remember looking at
the ocean and admiring,

1262
01:28:42,124 --> 01:28:44,957
"Nice ocean you got here,
planet Earth."

1263
01:28:53,769 --> 01:28:55,566
To me, the marvel of it

1264
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:59,573
is that it all worked like clockwork,

1265
01:28:59,674 --> 01:29:01,335
I almost said like magic.

1266
01:29:01,442 --> 01:29:06,004
There might be a little magic mixed up

1267
01:29:06,114 --> 01:29:07,945
in the back of that big clock somewhere...

1268
01:29:10,919 --> 01:29:14,320
Because everything worked
as it was supposed to.

1269
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:15,787
Nobody messed up.

1270
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:18,017
Even I didn't make mistakes.

1271
01:29:35,108 --> 01:29:39,010
I knew that anyone
who was on the first lunar landing

1272
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:41,444
was certainly going to be propelled

1273
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:44,312
into the public view in an enormous way.

1274
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:48,543
That awareness was troublesome

1275
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:50,622
and interfered during the mission.

1276
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,625
But it's nothing like what happens
after the mission

1277
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:00,426
and for the rest of your life.

1278
01:30:00,533 --> 01:30:02,763
You are the person now,

1279
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:05,337
not just an average fighter pilot,

1280
01:30:05,438 --> 01:30:08,839
who did this and that pretty well,

1281
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,204
but, "This guy walked on the Moon."

1282
01:30:11,309 --> 01:30:16,076
And now I have to sort of uphold that image

1283
01:30:16,181 --> 01:30:20,311
for the rest of my life, no matter what I do.

1284
01:30:23,788 --> 01:30:26,916
Can't think of a negative thing
about Neil Armstrong.

1285
01:30:27,025 --> 01:30:30,017
I think it's wonderful
that he's been the first man on the Moon.

1286
01:30:31,362 --> 01:30:33,353
Even though
he's somewhat reclusive,

1287
01:30:33,464 --> 01:30:36,228
then that helps to preserve the image.

1288
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,891
That's a tough role.

1289
01:30:38,002 --> 01:30:40,061
I'm glad... I'd love to do that,

1290
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:42,229
but I'd hate to try to fill that role.

1291
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:43,806
That's a tough role.

1292
01:30:43,908 --> 01:30:45,933
Yeah... Boy!

1293
01:30:54,584 --> 01:30:56,484
After the flight of Apollo 11,

1294
01:30:56,586 --> 01:30:59,316
the three of us went
on an around-the-world trip.

1295
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,720
Wherever we went,

1296
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:06,090
people, instead of saying,
"Well, you Americans did it,"

1297
01:31:06,195 --> 01:31:07,856
Everywhere, they said, "We did it.

1298
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:11,092
We Humankind, we the Human race,

1299
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,690
we, people, did it."

1300
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:17,000
And, I had never heard of, um...

1301
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:21,303
people in different countries
use this word "We, we, we"

1302
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:25,346
as emphatically as we were hearing

1303
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:29,440
from Europeans, Asians, Africans...

1304
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:32,019
Wherever we went,
it was, "We finally did it!"

1305
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,951
And I thought that
was a wonderful thing.

1306
01:31:34,056 --> 01:31:36,547
Ephemeral, but wonderful.

1307
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:10,581
I felt that I was
literally standing on a plateau

1308
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:11,884
somewhere out there in space,

1309
01:32:11,992 --> 01:32:16,622
a plateau that science and technology
had allowed me to get to.

1310
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:20,029
But now, what I was seeing
and even more important,

1311
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,534
what I was feeling at
that moment in time,

1312
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:26,764
science and technology
had no answers for.

1313
01:32:26,872 --> 01:32:28,032
Literally no answers,

1314
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:32,736
because there I was
and there you are...

1315
01:32:33,912 --> 01:32:37,871
there you are,
the Earth, dynamic, overwhelming

1316
01:32:37,983 --> 01:32:41,441
and I felt that the world...
there's just too much purpose,

1317
01:32:41,553 --> 01:32:43,612
too much logic
and it was just too beautiful

1318
01:32:43,722 --> 01:32:45,349
to have happened by accident.

1319
01:32:45,457 --> 01:32:48,017
There has to be
somebody bigger than you

1320
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:49,753
and bigger than me

1321
01:32:49,861 --> 01:32:53,456
and I mean this in a spiritual sense
not a religious sense.

1322
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:56,192
There has to be
a creator of the universe

1323
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,359
who stands above the religions

1324
01:32:58,469 --> 01:33:01,870
that we ourselves create to govern our lives.

1325
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:13,810
A friend of ours got us
to go to a Bible study at a tennis club.

1326
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:19,355
And after that weekend, I said to Jesus,
I said, "I give you my life

1327
01:33:19,456 --> 01:33:22,152
and if you're real, come into my life."

1328
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:26,060
And I believe and he did and I had...

1329
01:33:26,162 --> 01:33:29,097
I had this sense of peace

1330
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:33,397
that was... that was hard to describe.

1331
01:33:35,438 --> 01:33:38,930
It was so dramatic
that we started sharing our story.

1332
01:33:42,044 --> 01:33:44,638
I say, my walk
on the Moon lasted three days

1333
01:33:44,747 --> 01:33:46,647
and it was a great adventure,

1334
01:33:46,749 --> 01:33:49,809
but my walk with God lasts forever.

1335
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:56,824
I think if you do something

1336
01:33:56,925 --> 01:33:59,758
that's drastically different

1337
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:02,921
like flying to the Moon
and coming back again,

1338
01:34:03,031 --> 01:34:05,499
everyone tells you how important it is,
how wonderful it is

1339
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,568
and how important,
important, important.

1340
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:11,036
Then by comparison a lot of other things

1341
01:34:11,139 --> 01:34:15,269
that used to seem important
don't seem quite as much so.

1342
01:34:15,376 --> 01:34:20,712
And I'm not saying that I'm able to face life

1343
01:34:20,814 --> 01:34:22,679
with greater equanimity

1344
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:26,480
because I've flown to the Moon, but I try to.

1345
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:30,417
And maybe some of our
terrestrial squabbles

1346
01:34:30,524 --> 01:34:33,789
don't seem as important
after having flown to the Moon

1347
01:34:33,894 --> 01:34:35,885
than they did before.

1348
01:34:38,665 --> 01:34:40,155
We learned a lot about the Moon

1349
01:34:40,267 --> 01:34:44,670
but what we really learned
was about the Earth.

1350
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,968
The fact that just from
the distance of the Moon

1351
01:34:49,075 --> 01:34:50,599
you could put your thumb up,

1352
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:53,372
and you can hide the
Earth behind your thumb.

1353
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,175
Everything that you have ever known...

1354
01:34:56,282 --> 01:35:00,651
Your loved ones, your business,
the problems of the Earth itself,

1355
01:35:00,753 --> 01:35:03,347
all behind your thumb.

1356
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:07,256
And how insignificant we really all are.

1357
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,693
But then how fortunate we are
to have this body

1358
01:35:11,796 --> 01:35:15,755
and to be able to enjoy living here

1359
01:35:15,867 --> 01:35:21,362
amongst the beauty of the Earth itself.

1360
01:35:25,343 --> 01:35:27,174
It truly is an oasis

1361
01:35:27,278 --> 01:35:29,712
and we don't take very good care of it.

1362
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:32,873
And I think the elevation of that awareness

1363
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:37,079
is a real contribution to, you know,
saving the Earth, if you will.

1364
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:43,926
Earth has changed a lot
since we started flying in Gemini.

1365
01:35:44,028 --> 01:35:46,724
There's a lot of things like urban pollution

1366
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:49,230
and you can see that when you hit orbit now.

1367
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,960
You can see the big cities

1368
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:55,367
all have their own set of unique atmospheres,

1369
01:35:55,471 --> 01:35:56,597
They really do.

1370
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:01,169
We ought to be looking out for our kids
and our grandkids

1371
01:36:01,278 --> 01:36:03,246
and what are we worried about?

1372
01:36:03,346 --> 01:36:06,109
The price of a gallon of gasoline,

1373
01:36:06,215 --> 01:36:09,776
you know, in the United States,
they're worried about $3 a gallon gas.

1374
01:36:09,886 --> 01:36:11,513
I said, that's awful, you know?

1375
01:36:14,389 --> 01:36:16,050
Since that time,

1376
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:20,788
I have not complained
about the weather one single time.

1377
01:36:20,896 --> 01:36:22,796
I'm glad there is weather.

1378
01:36:22,898 --> 01:36:24,957
I've not complained about traffic,

1379
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:26,659
I'm glad there's people around.

1380
01:36:26,768 --> 01:36:28,793
One of the things that I did when I got home,

1381
01:36:28,904 --> 01:36:32,670
I went down to shopping centres
and I'd just go around there,

1382
01:36:32,774 --> 01:36:36,232
get an ice cream cone or something
and just watch the people go by

1383
01:36:36,344 --> 01:36:39,336
and think, "Boy, we're lucky to be here,

1384
01:36:39,447 --> 01:36:42,348
why do people complain about the Earth?"

1385
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:44,782
We are living in the Garden of Eden!

1386
01:36:48,456 --> 01:36:50,788
As I look back, if I use one word,

1387
01:36:50,891 --> 01:36:52,290
I would use the word "luck".

1388
01:36:52,393 --> 01:36:54,759
I just feel very lucky.

1389
01:36:54,862 --> 01:36:57,695
You know, Neil Armstrong
was born in 1930,

1390
01:36:57,798 --> 01:37:00,062
Buzz Aldrin was born in 1930,

1391
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:02,657
Mike Collins was born in 1930.

1392
01:37:02,769 --> 01:37:04,737
I mean how lucky can you get?

1393
01:37:04,838 --> 01:37:08,706
We just happened along at the right time.

1394
01:37:08,808 --> 01:37:12,369
I feel blessed every single day.

1395
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:16,973
Not a day goes by
that I don't think, "This is great,

1396
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:20,484
this was wonderful..."

1397
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:24,455
Somebody had to go
and they happened to pick me,

1398
01:37:24,556 --> 01:37:25,853
so it is great.

1399
01:37:54,519 --> 01:37:56,953
You know, some of the tabloids

1400
01:37:57,055 --> 01:38:00,786
are saying that we did this
In a hanger in Arizona.

1401
01:38:00,892 --> 01:38:02,792
Maybe that would have been a good idea!

1402
01:38:02,894 --> 01:38:04,521
I don't know how I would...

1403
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:07,120
grab someone by the collar
who didn't believe,

1404
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:08,924
and shake them
and somehow change their mind.

1405
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:11,023
Any significant event in history,

1406
01:38:11,133 --> 01:38:14,034
somebody's had a conspiracy theory
one way or the other.

1407
01:38:14,137 --> 01:38:17,937
I don't know two Americans
who have a fantastic secret

1408
01:38:18,041 --> 01:38:20,271
without one of them
blurting it out to the Press!

1409
01:38:20,377 --> 01:38:25,007
Can you imagine thousands of people
able to keep this secret?

1410
01:38:25,115 --> 01:38:27,845
We've been to the Moon nine times.

1411
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:32,081
I mean, why did we fake it nine times...

1412
01:38:32,188 --> 01:38:33,553
If we faked it?

1413
01:38:33,656 --> 01:38:37,615
Truth needs no defence.

1414
01:38:37,727 --> 01:38:40,821
Nobody, nobody...

1415
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:45,890
Can ever take those footsteps I made
on the surface of the Moon away from me.
