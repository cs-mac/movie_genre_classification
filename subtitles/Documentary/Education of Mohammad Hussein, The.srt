1
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,610
4, 5, 6 ...

2
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,119
7, 8. Now, girls ...

3
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:39,651
Come on, girls. Anybody?

4
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,949
Anybody else?

5
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,078
Jenny, again.

6
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,905
Isn't it because 
Mr. Rochester is blind?

7
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,864
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,703
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

9
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:58,332
Right. So the only sound I want to
hear coming through the ceiling ...

10
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:01,462
is the sound of sweat
dripping onto textbooks.

11
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,677
- Cello?
- No cello.

12
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,762
I thought we agreed that
cello was my interest or hobby.

13
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,424
Well, it already is
your interest or hobby.

14
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,643
So when they ask you
at the Oxford interview,

15
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,225
"What is your interest or hobby?"

16
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,522
you can say the cello
and you won't be lying.

17
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,982
But you don't have 
to practice a hobby.

18
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,988
A hobby is a hobby.

19
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,279
Can I stop going
to the youth orchestra, then?

20
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,984
No! No, no, the youth orchestra's
a good thing.

21
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:30,906
- That shows you're a joiner-inner.
- Yes, but I've already joined in.

22
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,119
So now I can stop.

23
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:39,298
No! No, that just shows 
the opposite. Don't you see?

24
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:42,595
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

25
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,003
No. They don't want people
who can think for themselves.

26
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:46,675
No, of course they don't.

27
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,884
- See you Wednesday.
- All right, okay. Bye.

28
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:37,348
Jenny? Should I wear, 
like, Sunday best?

29
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,103
Better, I'm afraid.

30
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:44,021
Just to show my father you're
'un jeune homme sérieux', not a Teddy Boy.

31
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,234
God. Right.

32
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,826
I'm going to go. It's going 
to bucket down in a minute.

33
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:55,035
- Okay, right.
- I'll see you at the weekend.

34
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,793
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

35
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,337
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

36
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,750
Goodbye, my love!

37
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,550
Come on, come on.

38
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,926
- No!
- Stop it now, stop it. That's enough.

39
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,478
Now look what you've done.

40
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,309
Come here.
The nice man's waiting for us.

41
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,310
- It fell off!
- No, it didn't fall off.

42
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:26,151
- You kicked it off. Now, come on.
- But my sock's all wet!

43
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,085
Hello. Look, if you had any sense,

44
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,582
you wouldn't take a lift
from a strange man,

45
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:45,294
but I'm a music lover
and I'm worried about your cello,

46
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:50,086
so what I propose is you put it
in my car and walk alongside me.

47
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,257
How do I know you won't just 
drive off with the cello?

48
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,048
Good point.

49
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:04,026
How much does a new cello cost?
£10, £15? I don't know.

50
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,518
Let's say 15.

51
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,240
No? All right.

52
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,403
Up to you.

53
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,169
- And that.
- Right.

54
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,296
- I'm David, by the way.
- Jenny.

55
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:31,881
Very good.

56
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,774
- How did the concert go?
- It was a rehearsal.

57
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,399
- The concert's next Thursday.
- What are you playing?

58
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,321
Elgar.

59
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,361
I think it's a shame he spent so 
much time in Worcester, don't you?

60
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:57,489
Because Worcester's too near Birmingham,
and you can hear that in the music.

61
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:00,666
There's a terrible Brummy accent
in there, if you listen hard enough.

62
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,996
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

63
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,091
- I'm not a Jew.
- No, I am.

64
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,250
I wasn't accusing you.

65
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:19,179
Can I sit in the car 
with my cello?

66
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,103
Jump in.

67
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,073
I've never seen a car like 
this before. C'est très chic.

68
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,034
It's a Bristol. 
Not many of them made.

69
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,701
- Where to, madam?
- I only live round the corner.

70
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:46,833
- Worse luck.
- I'll see what I can do.

71
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,347
I suppose cellists must go
to a lot of concerts.

72
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:10,523
We don't go to any concerts.
We don't believe in them.

73
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,862
- They're real.
- So people say.

74
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,024
- Smoke?
- I'd better not.

75
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,787
I live just up there.

76
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,994
- Why don't we believe in them?
- He'd say there's no point to them.

77
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,247
- Your father, this is?
- Yes.

78
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,751
They're just for fun.

79
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:36,383
Apart from school concerts, which are
no fun at all, so we go to those.

80
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:39,714
- They don't help you get on.
- Which, of course,

81
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,599
is what's so wonderful about them.

82
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:45,394
- Anyway, you'll go one day.
- I know. I will.

83
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,100
If I go to university, I'm 
going to read what I want ...

84
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:52,435
and listen to what I want,

85
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,063
and I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films ...

86
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,695
and I'm going to talk to people
who know lots about lots.

87
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,326
- Good for you.
- Yes.

88
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:06,370
- Which university?
- Oxford. If I'm lucky.

89
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,329
Did you go anywhere?

90
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:12,414
I studied what I believe they 
call "the university of life".

91
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:15,249
I didn't get a 
very good degree, though.

92
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,719
Well, thank you 
for driving me home.

93
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:32,193
- Are you all right? Have you got it?
- Yes, it's fine.

94
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,564
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

I don't want to hear
any French singing!

101
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:21,900
French singing wasn't on the 
syllabus last time I looked!

102
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,201
- Battenberg?
- Thank you.

103
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:29,158
I actually like the crust.

104
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,452
So where are you applying, Graham?

105
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,830
- I'm not sure yet.
- Well! When will you be sure?

106
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,301
You can't let the grass grow
under your feet, young man.

107
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:42,303
- I might take a year off.
- What for?

108
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,304
I don't know,
maybe do some travelling.

109
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,518
That sort of thing.

110
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,765
Travelling?

111
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,024
What are you, a Teddy Boy?

112
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:59,487
You know she's going to Oxford,
don't you?

113
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,447
If we get her Latin up to scratch.

114
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,068
So while she's studying English
at Oxford,

115
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,904
you'll be the wandering Jew.

116
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:11,500
Mr. Mellor, I'm not a Teddy Boy.

117
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:16,667
I'm an homme sérieux jeune.

118
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,166
No. Yeah!

119
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,923
I'm a homme jeune sérieux. 
A homme ...

120
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,980
- They're for me.
- Who are they from?

121
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,108
- Gosh. Him.
- What's this?

122
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,447
Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been sent
some flowers from a chap.

123
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,745
- A chap? What kind of chap?
- He's wishing me luck for tonight.

124
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,502
Is that all he's wishing you?
Where'd he get the money from?

125
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:57,788
- He earns it, I expect.
- Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

126
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,374
Can we just go?

127
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,292
Otherwise the good luck flowers
will actually be responsible ...

128
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:04,918
for me actually missing the concert,
which would be ironic, n'est-ce pas?

129
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:12,636
- I don't ... I don't like it.
- Objection noted. Jenny?

130
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,637
- Noted.
- Yeah, well ...

131
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,268
There's got to be 10 bob's worth
of luck here. I mean ...

132
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,267
That's a bit much for a schoolgirl,
isn't it?

133
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:20,979
Well, we can't leave it here!

134
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,443
I mean, even I'd burgle a house
with flowers left outside.

135
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,274
They'll think we're made of money.

136
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,192
Thank you, Marjorie.

137
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:32,653
Camus doesn't want you to like him.
Feeling is bourgeois.

138
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:35,204
Being engagée is bourgeois.

139
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,956
He kills someone,
and he doesn't feel anything.

140
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:41,999
His mother dies,
and he doesn't feel anything.

141
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:44,798
I wouldn't feel anything
if my mother died.

142
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,842
Does that make me 
an existentialist?

143
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,506
No. That makes you a cow.

144
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:50,598
Une vache.

145
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:56,889
Well, after I've been to university,
I'm going to be French,

146
00:12:57,106 --> 00:13:02,100
and I'm going to Paris, and I'm 
going to smoke and wear black ...

147
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,688
and listen to Jacques Brel,

148
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,563
and I won't speak, ever.
C'est plus chic comme ça.

149
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,693
- Crikey!
- What?

150
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,832
Wait here.

151
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,870
Hello!

152
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,838
Hello.

153
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,629
Hello.
Thank you.

154
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:32,679
- How did it go?
- Fine, I think.

155
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,676
I didn't mess my bit up.

156
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,185
Nobody got thrown out
of the orchestra afterwards.

157
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:41,978
Always the mark of a cultural triumph.
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.

158
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,439
- What are you doing on Friday?
- Going to school.

159
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:46,522
I meant in the evening.

160
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,568
Of course. Nothing.

161
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:53,703
Because I'm going to listen to some
Ravel in St. John's Smith Square.

162
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,823
My friends Danny and Helen would be
coming, too, so it wouldn't be ...

163
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,664
I'll tell you what,
I'll come and pick you up,

164
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:03,117
and if your mother and father
disapprove,

165
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,873
then you can have the tickets
and go with one of them.

166
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,839
- How does that sound?
- Thank you.

167
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:10,842
- And I'd like to go with you.
- 7:00?

168
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,007
What are they saying?

169
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:19,388
And, probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards.

170
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,887
- Supper?
- If you want to.

171
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:27,692
Well the thing is,
we'll probably have eaten.

172
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,566
Well, if you'd like supper,

173
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:34,655
then perhaps on Friday
you could not eat?

174
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,619
Yes. Of course.

175
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:51,209
- A spot of supper?
- You've heard of supper.

176
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:52,927
We've heard of it,
but we've never eaten it.

177
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,881
So you're going to have
to tell us everything.

178
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,764
Otherwise it's not fair.

179
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:00,218
- I won't allow it!
- Fine! He's more than happy ...

180
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:02,269
for you to take me.
- Fine, I will.

181
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,231
- Good!
- Well, where is it?

182
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,144
- St. John's Smith Square.
- Where's that?

183
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,693
I don't know.
I'm sure we could find out.

184
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:10,315
It's in Westminster.
Right next door to the Abbey.

185
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,528
- How do you know that?
- I had a life ...

186
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,107
before we were married, you know.
You soon put a stop to that.

187
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:17,236
- Well, there you are.
- Where are we?

188
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,199
We're near Westminster Abbey.
I'm not going all the way over there.

189
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,579
The trouble is that's where
St. John's Smith Square is.

190
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,123
Well, there must be something on
locally. Where's the paper?

191
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,080
She wants to see 
someone who can play.

192
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:30,707
She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland
scratching away. I'll take her.

193
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,338
And how do you propose to 
get there? RAF helicopter?

194
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,794
- That's him.
- Bloody hell!

195
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,683
- Jack!
- By the way, David's a Jew.

196
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:42,556
A wandering Jew. 
So watch yourself.

197
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:47,106
What does she mean by that?
I've never said anything like that!

198
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:50,312
It's just an expression.
I've got nothing against the Jews ...

199
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,480
Glad to hear it. Hello.

200
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,278
I didn't mean I've got nothing against
you. No, of course I do mean that.

201
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:00,453
- Dad.
- No. It's ... Sorry, it's just that ...

202
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:05,450
You're not the sort of person
that I would be against.

203
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,995
Well, I wouldn't, because I'm not
the kind of person who would be against ...

204
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,959
people.

205
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:16,340
I'm Jack. This is my wife, Marjorie.

206
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,923
You didn't tell me
you had a sister, Jenny.

207
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,096
Please.

208
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:27,855
You're a lucky man, Jack.

209
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,769
Yes, I suppose I am.

210
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:42,574
- This is lovely.
- Thank you.

211
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,492
I'm sorry, David.
Would you like a drink?

212
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,671
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

213
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:52,828
If Jenny's ready,
perhaps we'll shoot off?

214
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:58,294
Actually, David, Dad has 
something he has to tell you.

215
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:04,676
No, no. Really. Well, it was just
a question, a point of reference.

216
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:09,431
What's the best way to get to
St. John's Smith Square from here?

217
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,814
It's a straight run, really.
Up to Hammersmith,

218
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,858
take the A4 through Kensington,
you're there.

219
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,902
- As simple as that?
- As simple as that.

220
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:19,492
- Shall I book us some tickets?
- No.

221
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:23,281
Well, have her back by 10:00, David.

222
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,081
Well, I was hoping she might 
come with me afterwards ...

223
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,791
for a spot of supper 
with my Aunt Helen.

224
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,129
Well ...

225
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,414
No, no, well ...

226
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:37,050
She's usually in bed by then.

227
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,711
What if I promise
to have her back by 11:30?

228
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:44,383
Well, it's Friday night,

229
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,844
and you are going all the way
to the West End.

230
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,595
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

231
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,565
All right.

232
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,062
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

233
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,897
Have a nice time.

234
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,364
Come on.

235
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,265
Hello, hello!

236
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,460
Are we late?

237
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:18,292
No, I thought we were going 
to miss the beginning,

238
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:19,547
and then it wouldn't 
be worth going in ...

239
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,343
and we could all go off dancing
or something.

240
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:22,888
Helen is one of the more
reluctant members ...

241
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,799
of tonight's audience.
- Hello.

242
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:28,260
Jenny, these are my friends,
Helen and Danny. Shall we?

243
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,844
- Hello.
- All right?

244
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:35,140
- 4, please.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,523
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

246
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,772
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

247
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,156
- Where did you get it from?
- I don't know. Chelsea somewhere.

248
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:53,500
Yours is ... Well, good for
this sort of concert, isn't it?

249
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:55,706
Thank you.

250
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,038
We should go shopping together 
one day, you and I, if you want.

251
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,711
That would be nice.

252
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:04,926
But Chelsea,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

253
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,682
Sorry?

254
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,846
I just said,
"It's too expensive for me."

255
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:14,096
No, you didn't. You said 
something completely different.

256
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:15,732
No, well ...

257
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,730
- I said it in French.
- In French? Why?

258
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:21,946
I don't know.

259
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,738
Well, Chelsea's too expensive
for me, too, really,

260
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:27,985
but we don't have 
to worry about that.

261
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,115
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

262
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,032
Why would David want
to take me shopping?

263
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,502
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you think?

264
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:33,010
I hope so! God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral ...

265
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:35,557
when I listen to classical music.

266
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:39,141
- That was classical, wasn't it?
- Yes. Very classical.

267
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,314
- As classical as you can get.
- Juliette's it is, then.

268
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:45,020
Heaven forbid we should end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

269
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:56,239
♪ I want a Sunday kind of love ♪

270
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,917
♪ A love to last past Saturday night ♪

271
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,043
Miles Davis, Sartre ...

272
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:12,423
Extraordinary woman, Gréco.
Just like you, Helen.

273
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,685
What about Chante Françoise Sagan?
Have you heard that one?

274
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:19,556
- It's wonderful.
- I've only got ...

275
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,353
I think it's just 
called Juliette Gréco.

276
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:24,815
The one with the eyes 
on the sleeve? I saved up ...

277
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:27,608
and got my French Conversation teacher
to bring it back after Christmas.

278
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:30,367
- You have a French Conversation teacher?
- Yes.

279
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:33,024
Is that why you suddenly speak 
French for no reason?

280
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,071
Have you never heard her sing?
She's marvellous.

281
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,999
You should see her in Paris,
though, not here.

282
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:41,245
David will take you.

283
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,413
- I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
- Better than here, really.

284
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:48,631
Isn't it wonderful
to find a young person ...

285
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,755
who wants to know things?
There's so much I want you to see.

286
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:58,884
Are you all right
to come and have a look ...

287
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:01,137
at that Pembroke Villas place 
with me on Friday, Danny?

288
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,307
No, I can't. There's a Burne-Jones
coming up at Christie's on Friday.

289
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:06,861
Desperate to get my hands on it.

290
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:08,653
You're thinking of 
buying a Burne-Jones?

291
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,612
A real one?

292
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,608
I just have a feeling the
Pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

293
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:15,493
I love the Pre-Raphaelites!

294
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,697
- Do you?
- Yes, of course!

295
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,198
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.
Not Holman Hunt so much,

296
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,368
he's so garish.
- Absolutely.

297
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:25,831
Well, why don't we all go
to the auction together?

298
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:29,541
- Auction! Gosh, how exciting.
- It's Friday morning.

299
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,182
Friday.

300
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:39,514
- You're busy?
- Well, yes.

301
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:41,228
Tant pis.

302
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:43,721
Quel dommage.
C'est pas de problème. C'est ...

303
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:49,860
- Are you sure you're busy?
- No. I'm sure I could rearrange.

304
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:52,656

- What are you doing?
- I can't get this casserole dish clean,

315
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,569
it's all burned around the ...

316
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,566
It's 25 to 12:00.

317
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,493
- We finished tea at 7:00.
- I know what time it is.

318
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:24,325
How was your evening?

319
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,582
Best night of my life.

320
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:37,338
Night, Mum.

321
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:49,187
I think there were 1 violins,
1 cello, 2 violas, a harp ...

322
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:50,851
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

323
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:52,769
I want to know
what else was on the programme.

324
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:55,400
It was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

325
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:57,777
He just said he wanted to take 
me places and show me things.

326
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,321
- "Things"?
- Plural? My God!

327
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,948
I knew that Jane Eyre would
eventually work its magic on you.

328
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,322
I'm assuming that's what 
you're all so animated about.

329
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,159
- Of course.
- Jane Eyre ...

330
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:10,956
and Jenny's new boyfriend.
- He's not my new boyfriend.

331
00:25:11,254 --> 00:25:13,045
That's true. He's more 
of a man friend, actually.

332
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,167
- He's got a sports car, Miss Stubbs!
- It's maroon.

333
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,880
So could we call him
a Mr. Rochester figure?

334
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:21,633
I think he must be as blind
as Mr. Rochester.

335
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,513
You may or may not have noticed I'm 
trying to steer the subject away ...

336
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,973
from Jenny's lurid love life
into the matter in hand.

337
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:28,979
And it is clear from this evidence ...

338
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,807
that most of you know far too 
much about the former ...

339
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,606
and next to nothing 
about the latter.

340
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,602
Reluctantly, I have to admit that 
Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

341
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,063
Excellent as always, Jenny.

342
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,579
Hello.

343
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:55,666
Hello.

344
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,148
Any further bids?

345
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:18,274
- Sold, then, for 60 guineas.
- Hello.

346
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:20,898
You're late.

347
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:25,198
We now turn to Lot 41.

348
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:28,702
The Tree of Forgiveness
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

349
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:33,873
This is a rare opportunity to purchase a
key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

350
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:37,046
- Who will start me off at 100 guineas?
- Is it that one?

351
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,756
Yes, that's the one.

352
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:41,257
15 guineas?

353
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:43,970
20 guineas?

354
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:48,595
Thank you. 40? Thank you, sir.

355
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,720
Do I hear 60?

356
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:54,599
80 guineas? Thank you, sir.

357
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,730
Another one, madam? 100 guineas?

358
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,902
120?

359
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,734
No further bids?

360
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:06,862
- Your turn.
- What?

361
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:08,613
- Any further bids?
- Your turn.

362
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:10,742
- Any more?
- Quick!

363
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,868
120 guineas from the
very eager new bidder.

364
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:15,621
140, madam?

365
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,922
Thank you. 160 guineas?

366
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,998
180? Thank you.

367
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,296
200 guineas?

368
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,054
220?

369
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,767
Another one, madam?

370
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:40,232
Sold for 200 guineas. Thank you.

371
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:44,031
- Your name, please?
- Mellor.

372
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:49,365
Now we move on to Lot 42 ...

373
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,944
Thank you very much. I couldn't 
possibly have bought it without you.

374
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,162
Just a couple of years ago,

375
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,955
you could pick one of them up 
for 50 quid. No one was interested.

376
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,329
I would have been so interested.

377
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:04,301
As you can see, I just love things.

378
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:10,381
That's not a Lockey-Hill!

379
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,350
There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

380
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:14,550
No, certainly not me.

381
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,562
- It's beautiful! Do you play?
- Thank you.

382
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:20,435
I used to. I vowed to myself
that one day I'd own one of these ...

383
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,353
and now I do own one,
I don't touch the bugger.

384
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:25,060
It's vulgar, really,
putting it on display.

385
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,650
Give it to Jenny.

386
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:30,201
- I think that would be even more vulgar.
- Play for us, Jenny.

387
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:34,153
- No, one day, when I'm good enough.
- She's good enough now.

388
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,537
David, you've never seen me play.

389
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,831
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

390
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:41,747
We should all go
and spend a weekend in Oxford.

391
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,043
Straw boaters, 
punting, cream teas ...

392
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:47,340
- Boats.
... antiquarian book shops.

393
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,506
Bit of business, if we can find it.

394
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,172
What about next weekend?

395
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:54,183
Yes.

396
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,060
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

397
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,435
- I'll talk to them.
- You're going to ask my father ...

398
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,649
if you can take me 
away for the weekend?

399
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:07,062
- He'd have you arrested.
- We'll see.

400
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:10,449
- I bet you can't.
- How much?

401
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:14,033
I'd be careful if I were you, Jenny.
You don't know who you're dealing with.

402
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:15,872
Half a crown.

403
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,124
You're on.

404
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:22,247
How do you know Danny?

405
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:26,501
You know.
We kept bumping into each other,

406
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,335
then we became pals,

407
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:31,966
and we've ended up doing a bit
of business together when it suits us.

408
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:35,721
- What kind of business?
- Property, a bit of art dealing.

409
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:40,438
Some buying and selling. 
This and that.

410
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:51,441
- Right. I'll just be 2 ticks.
- Okay.

411
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:05,538
- Mr. Goldman, good to see you.
- Jolly good. Madam.

412
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:07,959
All right.

413
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:15,965
- All right, I've got this one. And ...
- Put me down!

414
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:19,935
Go on, then.

415
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:01,636
Sorry about that.

416
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:06,014
How do you know those negro people?

417
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:08,433
- They're clients.
- Clients?

418
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:11,896
Schvartzers have to live somewhere.

419
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:14,740
It's not as if they can rent
off their own kind, is it?

420
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:26,074
Test results for the Virgil translation.
We'll start from the bottom.

421
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,413
Patricia.

422
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:30,130
Absent.

423
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:34,214
Margaret, 48%.

424
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,012
Jenny!

425
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,967
52%.

426
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:45,771
That would just about scrape 
a pass in the exam proper.

427
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,856
Not good enough 
for Oxford candidates.

428
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:58,570
- It's her Latin, isn't it?
- Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

429
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:02,660
But what if everyone's best isn't 
good enough? What do we do then?

430
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:06,367
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money, anyway.

431
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:08,535
- You don't mean that.
- Well, what's she going to do ...

432
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:10,170
with an English degree?

433
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:13,090
If she's going to spend 3 years
playing that bloody cello,

434
00:32:13,174 --> 00:32:15,547
talking in French
to a bunch of beatniks,

435
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:18,672
well, I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

436
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,305
Well, she might meet
a nice lawyer there,

437
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,762
but she could do that
at a dinner dance tomorrow!

438
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:25,970
Because that's the point of
an Oxford education, isn't it, Dad?

439
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:28,518
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

440
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:30,815
What about private tuition?

441
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:35,360
Can anybody hear me?
How much is this going to cost me?

442
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,985
5 shillings an hour,
maybe a little more for A-level.

443
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:41,028
5 bob? We spend 5 bob here,
we spend five bob there.

444
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,779
Next thing you know,
that's our savings down the drain.

445
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,579
And what else
are we spending 5 bob on?

446
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:46,372
What else are we 
spending sixpence on?

447
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:50,711
Nothing! No! Nothing. All of 
this is free. This vase is free.

448
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:52,788
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

449
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:56,830
That chair, this sofa, it's all free.
We didn't have to pay for any of it.

450
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:59,464
You see,
that's the beauty of life, Jenny.

451
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,297
You don't have to pay for anything.

452
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:04,390
You know, there's a lovely Oxford 
tree growing in the garden.

453
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:06,967
Lucky for you, because that's 
Oxford taken care of.

454
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:10,768
And there's a whole orchard of 
school trees, so that school is free,

455
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,431
and I think there's even
a private tuition tree in there.

456
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,353
- I'll just go and check, shall I?
- Jack!

457
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:17,603
It's all right, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll only be a second,

458
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:21,481
because I think there's a whole clump of
them surrounding the pocket money tree!

459
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,948
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

460
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:25,412
And by the way, 
you might be lucky.

461
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:28,332
There might be a man with deep 
pockets growing out there,

462
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,325
because God knows
you're going to need one!

463
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:39,833
Well, you can always go to 
secretarial college with Hattie.

464
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,086
- Thanks.
- Charming!

465
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:46,179
- God. No.
- Hello!

466
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:49,094
Hello, Graham.

467
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,938
I haven't seen you in ages.

468
00:33:56,652 --> 00:34:00,021
It went a bit wrong, didn't it?
The tea party, I mean.

469
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:07,777
Was it because of the year 
off thing? Because I ...

470
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,366
No!

471
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:14,835
I just have so much work to do if 
I'm going to get the grades I need.

472
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:18,007
Yeah, she doesn't 
have time for boys.

473
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,718
- Bye, Graham!
- Bye.

474
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:41,193
And I'll tell you 
what the first thing ...

475
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,652
my grandfather did 
when he retired ...

476
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:51,781
was to say to my grandmother
when she expired.

477
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:55,827
- You do all the Goons?
- No, my Eccles is no good.

478
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,327
- No, you've got him.
- No, no.

479
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:01,914
- I can't do it ...
- Hello.

480
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:07,380
Jenny. David does the most
fantastic Bluebottle.

481
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:10,807
- You came to see my parents?
- Why is that so hard to imagine?

482
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,305
Why are you drinking?
It's not Christmas.

483
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:17,020
Well, there's a lot you don't 
know about us, young lady.

484
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:18,566
We had a life before you came along.

485
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:22,020
That's true. I'm only going on what
I've seen for the last 16 years.

486
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:26,573
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

487
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,665
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

488
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,789
But you didn't tell us
David went to Oxford.

489
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:41,248
- No! I didn't.
- For all the good it did me.

490
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,796
- Isn't that funny?
- Extraordinary.

491
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,793
I was just telling Jack
that I'm going back next weekend.

492
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:50,970
I go and visit my old English 
professor every now and again.

493
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,884
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

494
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,888
It's not always what you know,
is it, David?

495
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:59,851
Too true. Have you ever 
come across Clive Lewis?

496
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:02,024
Dad's never come across anyone.

497
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:06,941
He wrote a children's book called
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe ...

498
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:10,318
that did very well, I believe.
- CS Lewis.

499
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:12,984
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval Literature,

500
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,414
but I came to know him very well.
We just ...

501
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,204
got along.

502
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:21,750
Jenny used to devour those books.

503
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:24,374
I'd love to meet him.

504
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,755
I'm sorry,
am I being slow on the uptake?

505
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:34,975
Would Jenny like to 
come at the weekend?

506
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:38,975
Not this weekend,
but sometime, perhaps. Yes.

507
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,565
How often do you see him?

508
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:45,361
Not very often. 
Every couple of years.

509
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:48,983
Maybe next time.

510
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,361
Well, I suppose ...

511
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:55,997
Would she have to stay the night?

512
00:36:56,749 --> 00:37:00,414
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

513
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:06,999
Clive could get her a room
at the college. It's easy enough.

514
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:11,422
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

515
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:15,342
It wouldn't be a bother,
would it, David?

516
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:21,804
Come on!

517
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:24,105
Just putting a few things in a bag!
Don't worry!

518
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:27,779
♪ Yeah, we both understand ♪

519
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:31,110
♪ Ooh, sweet nothin's ♪

520
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:35,530
Come on!

521
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:38,160
We're nearly ready!
Be there in 2 ticks.

522
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:42,243
How can they only be nearly ready?

523
00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:45,495
I wouldn't be surprised
if 3 of them came out of there.

524
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,499
It's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

525
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:51,210
Ladies, come on, let's go!

526
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,177
There, have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

527
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,132
You should keep that one,
if you want it.

528
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:01,603
- One can only wear so many in one day.
- Thank you.

529
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:05,850
What about tonight? Have you 
got a pretty enough nightie?

530
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,195
Won't I be sharing 
a room with you?

531
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,989
You haven't slept with him.

532
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:16,025
- No.
- Good for you.

533
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:19,578
- Really? Do you think so?
- Yes! Well, you're only 16.

534
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,242
- You don't want to get preggers, do you?
- No.

535
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,747
No, I wouldn't let that happen.

536
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,628
I want to wait until I'm 17.

537
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:28,626
- On my 17th birthday, hopefully.
- With David?

538
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:32,001
Golly, it will be 
with David, won't it?

539
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,421
If that's what you want.
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

540
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:43,723
Ta-da!

541
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,944
Shall we make a move?

542
00:38:55,033 --> 00:39:01,652
♪ Got me wrapped around
your little finger ♪

543
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:05,577
♪ If this is love ♪

544
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:10,247
♪ It's everything 
I hoped it would be ♪

545
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:22,476
Can't we get out and 
have a look around?

546
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,385
Later, if we have time.

547
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,015
- Imagine spending 3 years here.
- I know.

548
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:39,279
Why are university girls
so strange-looking?

549
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:41,943
They can't all have started off
that way, can they?

550
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:45,454
I mean, most girls aren't born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be,

551
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,166
so there must be something
about these places ...

552
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:50,585
that make you fat or spotty
or short-sighted.

553
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,547
Well, when you look 
at it like that,

554
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:56,132
I mean, that's proper scientific
analysis. You can't argue with science.

555
00:39:58,054 --> 00:40:00,380
I still don't quite understand
what you want to do when you get here.

556
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:01,932
I want to read English.

557
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:05,143
- Books.
- Sorry?

558
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,429
You want to read English books.

559
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:10,935
"Reading English"
is just another way of saying ...

560
00:40:11,026 --> 00:40:13,599
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

561
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:16,233
Anyway, tomorrow we'll get 
more of a feel for the place.

562
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,108
Absolutely. This place will 
be good for a little business.

563
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,160
All those little old ladies
wandering around.

564
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:24,321
- Old ladies?
- This place is rife with stats.

565
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:27,167
Please explain what stats are.
You're always going on about them.

566
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:31,450
- It isn't very interesting.
- But you two are interested.

567
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:33,455
That's because
we're not very interesting, either.

568
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:35,291
- No, they're not, really.
- It's true.

569
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:38,005
That's why we need you here.
To save us from ourselves.

570
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:41,380
Yeah, to put some intelligence
and culture into our brutal lives.

571
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:44,390
- Sing to us! Sing to us!
- Please don't make me sing for you.

572
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:47,392
Please don't make 
us talk about work.

573
00:40:50,523 --> 00:40:55,648
So, now, is he Clive, 
do you think, or CS?

574
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:57,445
I'm confused now.
I thought you made him up.

575
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,989
No, we ...

576
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,819
Never mind.

577
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:05,947
"To dear Jenny, with the 
pleasure of meeting you.

578
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,952
"Come and see me again soon, Clive."

579
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,877
Dirty old man.

580
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,508
No?

581
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,392
We've got these exact 
same curtains at home.

582
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:33,806
Let's not talk about curtains.

583
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:37,474
You look beautiful.

584
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,616
David.

585
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:44,533
There's something you should know.

586
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,415
I'm a virgin,

587
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,959
and I want to stay that way
until I'm 17.

588
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:58,339
I think that's good.
I think that's right.

589
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,511
We can still be romantic, though,
can't we?

590
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,809
Yes, of course.
As long as it's not actually ...

591
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:19,021
Minnie.

592
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,696
Is that me?

593
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,611
Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse ...

594
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:31,705
and I'm your bubbalub.

595
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,830
Okay. If that's what 
you want to do.

596
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:41,460
- Minnie.
- Yes, David?

597
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,463
Bubbalub.

598
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,632
Bubbalub.

599
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:57,017
May I have a look?

600
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:00,527
Just a peek.

601
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,238
You just want to see them?

602
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:45,822
Thank you.

603
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:05,673
I think there's a house for sale
around here.

604
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,337
Really?

605
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:13,340
Might be worth a look.

606
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:15,637
Right.

607
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:18,140
- Do you want ...
- No.

608
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,195
- Jenny!
- Aren't you coming?

609
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,281
- We don't go in.
- What are you talking about?

610
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,325
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

611
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:33,407
Helen will look after you.

612
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:36,033
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much. David ...

613
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:38,163
I'm not going to 
tell you a second time.

614
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,209
Run along.

615
00:44:49,178 --> 00:44:52,878
- Well, they won't be long, either way.
- Either way?

616
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:56,259
Well, sometimes they find something
and sometimes they don't.

617
00:44:56,352 --> 00:44:59,851
And when they do find something,
we often have to leave quite quickly.

618
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:03,221
They can be quite naughty sometimes.

619
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:05,314
- Thank you!
- Bye!

620
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,273
- Cheerio!
- Catch! Careful. Careful.

621
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:11,616
Come on.

622
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:15,238
- Helen!
- Pass it back. Good!

623
00:45:17,373 --> 00:45:19,910
- Jenny!
- What?

624
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,084
You can stand there if you like,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

625
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:40,555
Coo-ee!

626
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,599
Jenny!

627
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:47,523
Sorry about being
a little brisk back there, Jenny.

628
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,023
It's just the way we do things.
Silly, really.

629
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:08,712
Here, don't forget your case.

630
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:11,832
- Who's coming up for a drink?
- Me!

631
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:14,762
No. You go.
I'll make my own way home.

632
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:19,346
Jenny.

633
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,810
Jenny!

634
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:42,909
It's an old map. A Speed.

635
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:46,284
The poor dear didn't even know
what it was.

636
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:50,376
What a waste! It shouldn't 
spend its life on a wall in ...

637
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,550
wherever the hell we were.

638
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:56,172
It should be with us.
We know how to look after it properly.

639
00:46:56,304 --> 00:46:58,178
- We liberated it.
- "Liberated"?

640
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,849
- Yeah!
- That's one word for it.

641
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:02,892
Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that.

642
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:08,305
You drink everything
I put in front of you down in one,

643
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,568
then you slam your glass down 
on the bar and ask for more.

644
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:13,696
It's wonderful.

645
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:17,981
We're not clever like you, so we 
have to be clever in other ways,

646
00:47:18,076 --> 00:47:22,121
because if we weren't,
there would be no fun.

647
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:26,033
We have to be clever 
with maps and ...

648
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,918
You want to know what stats are?

649
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:32,503
Stats are old ladies
who are scared of coloured people.

650
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:36,042
So we move the coloureds in
and the old ladies move out,

651
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:39,464
and I buy their flats cheap.
That's what I do.

652
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:41,515
So now you know.

653
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,898
And if you don't like it,
I'll understand,

654
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:52,477
and you can go back to Twickenham
and listen to the Home Service ...

655
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:56,863
and do your Latin homework,

656
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,858
but these weekends, and the 
restaurants and the concerts,

657
00:48:00,952 --> 00:48:03,028
they don't grow on trees.

658
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,991
This is who we are, Jenny.

659
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,649
That's better.

660
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,117
- Come on, you two!
- Come on up!

661
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:54,664
You can have my olive!

662
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:57,831
Come on.

663
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:15,817
I suppose you have homework to do?

664
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:27,787
You have no idea how boring
everything was before I met you.

665
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:34,000
"Action is character,"
our English teacher says.

666
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:37,590
I think it means
that if we never did anything,

667
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,631
we wouldn't be anybody.

668
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,049
And I never did anything
before I met you.

669
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:48,424
And sometimes I think no one's ever done
anything in this whole stupid country,

670
00:49:49,185 --> 00:49:50,810
apart from you.

671
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:29,218
- Okay.
- Right.

672
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,014
There you are.

673
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:36,391
Night.

674
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:52,662
Marjorie, look at this.

675
00:50:57,211 --> 00:50:59,916
"Clive."
Lucky girl!

676
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:03,080
Never a dull moment with David?

677
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,466
Better than that young man
you brought home for tea.

678
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,504
David's a lot older than Graham.

679
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,432
Graham could live to be 200 years old,
you'll never see him swanning around ...

680
00:51:10,516 --> 00:51:12,425
with famous authors.
Hasn't got it in him.

681
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:14,641
Graham might become a famous author,
for all you know.

682
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:16,970
Becoming one isn't the 
same as knowing one.

683
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:21,276
That shows you're well connected.
Very impressive young man, your David.

684
00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:24,903
I must admit, life's a little 
brighter with him around.

685
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:31,693
Come on, girls, get a move on!

686
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:40,245
- What the hell are those?
- Russian Sobranies.

687
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,078
Where did they come from?

688
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:45,542
Well, she probably bought them
from the Savoy, or Claridge's,

689
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:49,928
or the opera or some fancy nightclub.
Who knows with Jenny?

690
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:52,714
Paris. You can't buy them here.

691
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,223
- You never bought them yourself?
- No, I never.

692
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,434
Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

693
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:02,847
But I'll bring you some back,
if you like.

694
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,319
- You are joking?
- Non.

695
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:08,068
- He's taking you to Paris?
- Oui.

696
00:52:08,365 --> 00:52:10,073
- This term?
- Peut-être.

697
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:15,284
Wait. Isn't it your birthday
next Thursday?

698
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:17,741
Might be.

699
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,585
My God. Your birthday?

700
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,183
I would not like to be you.

701
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:25,161
All those suppers you've 
had off him? Ouch.

702
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:28,552
You've such a Victorian 
attitude to sex, you two.

703
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:31,423
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

704
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,257
Well, we haven't told them yet.

705
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,763
But David will come up with 
some story. He usually does.

706
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:37,262
Yeah, I've noticed that.

707
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:41,512
Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.
Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.

708
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:45,023
Those funny cigarettes you were 
smoking? Sobranies. 10 packets each.

709
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:48,693
How much is the Chanel perfume?

710
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:53,033
Are you the girl going to Paris,
or are you not, because ...

711
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:00,367
Tina, top button.

712
00:53:02,419 --> 00:53:05,539
Jenny, the headmistress
wants a word with you.

713
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:10,426
The legend of Mr. Rochester may have
travelled further than you intended.

714
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:12,261
Come.

715
00:53:14,682 --> 00:53:16,176
Miss Mellor.

716
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:23,679
We're all very excited
about your forthcoming trip to Paris.

717
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:29,983
Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds.
Some of us can talk of little else.

718
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:33,565
An older man, I understand?

719
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:37,693
A word of warning, Miss Mellor.

720
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:44,332
There may well have been the odd 
6th-form girl who has lost ...

721
00:53:45,629 --> 00:53:48,167
an important part of herself,
perhaps the best part,

722
00:53:48,298 --> 00:53:50,587
while under our supervision.
These things happen, regrettably.

723
00:53:50,676 --> 00:53:52,503
If, however,
we are made aware of that loss,

724
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:54,670
then of course
the young lady in question ...

725
00:53:54,763 --> 00:53:56,423
would have to continue
her studies elsewhere.

726
00:53:56,515 --> 00:53:58,840
If, that is, she still 
has any use for A-levels.

727
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:01,266
Do I make myself clear?

728
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:06,020
- Can I go now?
- If you would.

729
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:18,535
What are you doing in there?

730
00:54:18,996 --> 00:54:21,403
Well, I imagine she's lighting 
the candles on my cake.

731
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,699
You're 17, not 250.

732
00:54:27,546 --> 00:54:30,666
- Thanks for inviting me.
- It was Marjorie's idea, not mine.

733
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,259
- Not even Jenny's, for that matter.
- Dad!

734
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:36,626
Ta-da!

735
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:41,764
Well, blow them out before
the house burns down.

736
00:54:42,394 --> 00:54:45,561
- Make a ... Okay, just ... Don't wait.
- Bravo.

737
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:51,600
Who'd like a piece?

738
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:53,522
- Me, please.
- Well, come on, come on. Presents.

739
00:54:54,698 --> 00:54:56,157
It doesn't matter, I'll ...

740
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:02,872
It's a new Latin dictionary.

741
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:09,618
Thank you. I needed a new one.

742
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:14,257
Dear! Got a ... Snap!

743
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:30,939
Good grief!
Jenny, you should see this!

744
00:55:31,026 --> 00:55:33,232
- It's a special day.
- She's a special girl!

745
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,814
I know it.

746
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:38,735
Bit of help!

747
00:55:38,825 --> 00:55:40,901
Makes your dictionary look
a bit feeble, Graham?

748
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:43,200
- Gosh!
- And these are for you.

749
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:45,957
- Hello, young man.
- David!

750
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,448
- David, would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

751
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:53,712
I'd best be going, 'cause I've got
a stack of homework to do, so ...

752
00:55:54,424 --> 00:55:55,835
Well ...

753
00:55:55,926 --> 00:55:58,251
- Thank you. Bye.
- Cheers.

754
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:01,005
- Bye, Mr. Mellor.
- Cheerio, Graham.

755
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:02,640
Thank you.

756
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:05,259
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

757
00:56:06,603 --> 00:56:08,595
- Goodbye, Jenny.
- Bye, Graham.

758
00:56:11,858 --> 00:56:14,431
- A little something warming?
- You know me so well.

759
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:16,437
- Can I open anything yet?
- Wait for me.

760
00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:19,566
Before you open that lot, I've 
got a surprise. Next weekend,

761
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:22,861
we're all going to Café de Flore
to celebrate Jenny's birthday.

762
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,906
- Lovely!
- Café de Flore ...

763
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:28,874
is in the Boulevard St. Germain,
in Paris.

764
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:32,664
- What do you mean, Paris?
- You know the one, Dad.

765
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:36,589
No, no. No, no, no.

766
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,548
No, we don't have 
any French money.

767
00:56:39,636 --> 00:56:41,510
And besides, it's too ...

768
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:44,131
Well, I don't think
it would agree with me.

769
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:46,549
- Dad!
- The French don't like us, Jenny,

770
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:49,679
you know that. John Sutton, from 
work, he went there last year.

771
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:53,056
They were very rude to him.
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun,

772
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:55,766
but it's just not for me, Europe.

773
00:56:56,694 --> 00:56:59,898
- You'll have to go another time.
- You've just said you don't like Europe.

774
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:02,065
So what's going to change?
It'll have to be Europe, won't it,

775
00:57:02,158 --> 00:57:04,732
because it certainly won't be you.
- I'll take her.

776
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:06,488
- To the continent?
- Why not?

777
00:57:06,746 --> 00:57:09,320
- And leave me here on my own?
- For God's sake!

778
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:20,801
What do you think?

779
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:25,468
You know what Jenny's like
about France, Jack.

780
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:29,467
- French films and books and music.
- Of course I do.

781
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:32,597
Sorry, yes. It goes without 
saying. She's your daughter.

782
00:57:36,818 --> 00:57:38,775
Jenny likes to joke about how 
you're a stick-in-the-mud ...

783
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:42,028
and all the rest of it,
but I know that's not who you are.

784
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:45,440
Otherwise, she wouldn't 
be who she is.

785
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:48,074
No.

786
00:57:48,162 --> 00:57:50,998
But I can also see
that I have acted out of turn,

787
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:53,573
and I'm sorry.

788
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:08,555
What about your Aunt Helen?

789
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:20,518
- An hour late.
- We'll make it. I promise.

790
00:58:22,113 --> 00:58:24,438
Okay, there's a flight
at 8:00 in the morning.

791
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:26,283
Good.

792
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:39,587
There's no bed.

793
00:58:39,672 --> 00:58:41,961
I pushed the boat out
and got us a suite.

794
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:44,091
- A suite?
- Yeah.

795
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:47,127
Well, if work stops us from 
getting to Paris until tomorrow,

796
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:50,056
then work can buy 
us a nice hotel room.

797
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:53,930
Anyway, it's a special occasion,
isn't it?

798
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:57,563
I'd have thought tonight, of 
all nights, we'd only need a bed.

799
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:18,286
Hold on, one second. 
I've got something.

800
00:59:31,265 --> 00:59:32,843
I thought ...

801
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,891
I thought we might 
practise with this.

802
00:59:36,187 --> 00:59:37,597
With a banana?

803
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:40,358
I thought we might get the 
messy bit over with first.

804
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,859
What?

805
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:45,236
David!

806
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:48,400
I don't want to lose my virginity
to a piece of fruit!

807
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:52,410
I'm sorry.

808
00:59:55,247 --> 00:59:56,623
Hey.

809
00:59:59,502 --> 01:00:01,827
- I think the moment might have gone.
- Hey, hey ...

810
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:05,100
- I think we should wait until Paris.
- I'm sorry ...

811
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:07,675
Minnie, I ...

812
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:12,510
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

813
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:15,391
David,

814
01:00:15,768 --> 01:00:19,303
if tomorrow night does happen,
it's only ever going to happen once.

815
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,650
Why will it only ever happen once?

816
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:24,934
Because the first time
can only ever happen once.

817
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:30,237
So ...no baby talk.

818
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:33,201
No Minnie.

819
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:42,409
Just treat me like a grown-up.

820
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:45,457
Okay?

821
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:55,054
I know. Let's go and sit 
in our sitting room.

822
01:00:56,267 --> 01:00:57,725
All right.

823
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:00,513
We'll order up some champagne.

824
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:13,616
Room service?

01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:54,124
It wasn't too uncomfortable?

843
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:57,166
Not after the first bit.

844
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:01,881
It's funny, though, isn't it?

845
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:08,473
All that poetry 
and all those songs ...

846
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:11,399
about something
that lasts no time at all.

847
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,314
Yeah.

848
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:21,110
All your exercise books on 
my desk in a pile, please.

849
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,031
I bought this for you.

850
01:03:30,962 --> 01:03:33,038
That's very kind of you.

851
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:37,962
But I can't accept it.

852
01:03:39,513 --> 01:03:40,971
Why not?

853
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:43,761
It's because of people like you ...

854
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:47,718
that I plough through illiterate essays
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

855
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:52,061
But I know where 
this came from, Jenny,

856
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:57,361
and if I took it, I feel
I would be betraying both of us.

857
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,879
Jenny?

858
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:20,213
You can do anything you want.
You know that.

859
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:23,760
You're clever, and you're pretty.

860
01:04:27,102 --> 01:04:30,221
Is your boyfriend interested
in clever, Jenny?

861
01:04:32,065 --> 01:04:33,974
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

862
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:37,317
I'm telling you to go to Oxford,
no matter what.

863
01:04:39,072 --> 01:04:41,563
Because if you don't,
you'll break my heart.

864
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:51,702
- Where did you go?
- Cambridge.

865
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:56,664
Well, you're clever and you're pretty,
so presumably clever Miss Stubbs won ...

866
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:58,464
and here you are with your pony essays.

867
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:02,754
I don't know, these last few months,
I've eaten in wonderful restaurants ...

868
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:07,970
and been to jazz clubs and watched
wonderful films, heard beautiful music.

869
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:13,224
- Jenny, are you taking precautions?
- It's nothing to do with that.

870
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,099
- Isn't it?
- Maybe all our lives are going to end up ...

871
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:18,564
with pony essays, or housework.

872
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:21,237
And, yes, 
maybe we'll go to Oxford,

873
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:22,817
but if we're all going to die
the moment we graduate,

874
01:05:22,907 --> 01:05:25,232
isn't it what we 
do before that counts?

875
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:32,623
I'm sorry you think I'm dead.

876
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:37,038
I don't think you're dead,
I just don't ...

877
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,087
I think you'd better go
to your next class.

878
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:54,938
Go, go, go!

879
01:05:57,942 --> 01:05:59,602
Well done, Jenny!

880
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:02,267
I've never won anything before, not 
even at the Women's Institute raffle.

881
01:06:02,363 --> 01:06:04,652
And I always bet on the sweetest 
looking one and he always comes last.

882
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:06,567
- Let's go. Come on.
- Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky.

883
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:08,362
Come on, let's go,
I don't want to miss him.

884
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:11,822
- Pick up your 10 bob on the way out.
- I won 10 shillings!

885
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:16,038
- Who is this man, anyway?
- Peter Rachman. Complete bastard.

886
01:06:16,878 --> 01:06:19,119
Well, why do we have to see him here?

887
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,420
Because he's not the sort 
of chap with an office.

888
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:27,094
All right.

889
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:29,633
Ladies.

890
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:39,683
A bottle of your 
finest champagne, please.

891
01:06:40,193 --> 01:06:41,651
There he is.

892
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:48,940
Come on, Jenny, tell them
your good news. Don't be bashful.

893
01:06:49,035 --> 01:06:50,778
No, be Sneezy!

894
01:06:51,412 --> 01:06:53,903
Jenny got 2 As and a B
in her mock A-levels.

895
01:06:53,998 --> 01:06:56,204
Like everyone else in this 
sophisticated establishment.

896
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:59,209
- The B was in Latin.
- Seriously, congratulations.

897
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:00,754
Excuse us.

898
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:07,926
Don't worry too much.

899
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:10,805
About what?

900
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,639
Someone told me that in about 50 years,
no one will speak Latin, probably.

901
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:17,763
Not even Latin people.
So don't worry about your B.

902
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:26,187
He's even more of a bastard
than I thought.

903
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,273
You wouldn't want him
to marry your sister.

904
01:07:28,366 --> 01:07:31,153
You wouldn't want to talk to him
in a club, come to that.

905
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:35,868
You do know what you're doing,
old chap? With Jenny?

906
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:38,408
- This is the one, Danny.
- Right.

907
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,953
That's it!

908
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:46,126
- You can see she's different.
- I just don't want to see her hurt.

909
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:14,782
Have you bought
any more paintings recently?

910
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:20,410
Have I? Yes! Picked up a 
little Piper. Good one, I think.

911
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:23,787
I'm still trying to work out what makes
good things good. It's hard, isn't it?

912
01:08:23,879 --> 01:08:26,714
Well, the thing is, Jenny, you know.

913
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:29,917
Without necessarily being able
to explain why.

914
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:34,429
See, you have taste.
That's not half the battle.

915
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:37,141
That's the whole war.

916
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:01,370
Jenny, we should go. It's late.

917
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:02,787
- Really?
- Yes.

918
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:05,546
Alas. One day school
will be over forever ...

919
01:09:05,629 --> 01:09:07,622
and we can talk 
about art all night.

920
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:12,008
- You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

921
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,837
Let's go. Come on.

922
01:09:15,472 --> 01:09:17,050
Good night.

923
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:25,183
Wait here.

924
01:09:30,904 --> 01:09:34,238
- David, what are you looking for?
- Just ...

925
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:38,744
What are you doing?

926
01:09:40,956 --> 01:09:42,699
Will you marry me?

927
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,585
What were you looking for?

928
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:48,460
I thought I had a ring.

929
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:51,412
It wouldn't have been the right one,
but it would have done for tonight.

930
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:54,051
David.

931
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:57,430
I'm serious.

932
01:10:03,187 --> 01:10:04,930
You're very sweet.

933
01:10:07,232 --> 01:10:08,976
What do you think?

934
01:10:15,824 --> 01:10:17,947
- Take me home.
- All right.

935
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,354
They do need some looking after,

936
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,682
but nothing that will require
too much work.

937
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:53,231
Just leave them in your potting 
shed for a couple of weeks ...

938
01:10:53,445 --> 01:10:54,773
and they'll look after themselves.

939
01:10:54,863 --> 01:10:57,105
Fine, the potting shed.
Who does he think I am,

940
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,942
Prince Rainier of Monaco?

941
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:05,992
What if I got married
instead of going to college?

942
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,291
- Married?
- Married.

943
01:11:10,378 --> 01:11:12,585
Well, it would depend
on who it was, of course.

944
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:16,255
- Would it? That's interesting.
- Well, of course it would.

945
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,585
I wouldn't want you married off
just for the sake of it.

946
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:21,135
- Thanks.
- Has somebody asked you?

947
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:23,215
- Yes.
- Who?

948
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:28,228
- David?
- No. A man I just met walking his dog.

949
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:31,817
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing yet.

950
01:11:33,026 --> 01:11:35,398
Do you have a choice, or is it too late?

951
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,563
Of course she's got a choice!

952
01:11:39,574 --> 01:11:40,903
An interesting one, too?

953
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:44,242
This is where you're supposed 
to say, "But what about Oxford?"

954
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:46,618
Well, look at it another way.

955
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:49,079
You wouldn't really need to 
go now, would you?

956
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:53,750
I wouldn't need to go?
Would you like to expand on that?

957
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:59,088
- You'd be looked after.
- All that Latin. All those essays!

958
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:04,088
What was the point? Why didn't you just
send me prowling round nightclubs?

959
01:12:04,182 --> 01:12:06,341
It would have been less trouble
and I might have had more fun!

960
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:09,554
I don't know about nightclubs,
I know about education.

961
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:11,852
Anyway, looks like
it might have turned out ...

962
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,399
for the best.
- How?

963
01:12:14,776 --> 01:12:17,611
He wouldn't want you if you 
were thick, now, would he?

964
01:12:18,697 --> 01:12:21,697
"May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

965
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:24,239
"Sings: Whoop, Jug! I love thee ..."

966
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:27,328
When it says "sings",

967
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:29,205
it means you sing the line.

968
01:12:31,835 --> 01:12:33,495
Never mind. Right. Lear.

969
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:36,457
"Does any here know me?
This is not Lear.

970
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:41,340
"Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?
Where are his eyes?"

971
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:47,472
"Waking? Who is it that
can tell me who I am?"

972
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,765
Miss! Me. I can.

973
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:54,896
- Jenny.
- What?

974
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,605
Take it off.

975
01:13:01,781 --> 01:13:06,408
My God! Is that what I think it is?
I'm going to be a bridesmaid!

976
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:11,283
You know the school 
rule on jewellery.

977
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,243
Half the girls in this room
are wearing jewellery.

978
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:14,994
Yes, but none of it's going
to ruin their lives.

979
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:19,880
We have a difference of opinion
about that.

980
01:13:24,095 --> 01:13:26,301
How far advanced
are these ridiculous plans?

981
01:13:26,681 --> 01:13:29,254
Have you set a date?
Have you decided on a church?

982
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:33,012
We won't be getting married 
in a church. David's Jewish.

983
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:36,565
Jewish?

984
01:13:38,318 --> 01:13:39,812
He's a Jew?

985
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:44,229
You are aware, I take it,
that the Jews killed our Lord?

986
01:13:44,574 --> 01:13:47,195
And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

987
01:13:49,078 --> 01:13:51,154
I suppose he told you that.

988
01:13:52,874 --> 01:13:55,828
We're all very sorry about what
happened during the war,

989
01:13:55,918 --> 01:13:57,828
but that's absolutely no excuse ...

990
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,874
for that sort of malicious
and untruthful propaganda.

991
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:04,718
Anyway, I can see you're far more
in need of responsible advice ...

992
01:14:04,802 --> 01:14:06,344
than I realised.

993
01:14:07,722 --> 01:14:11,055
Nobody does anything worth doing
without a degree.

994
01:14:11,851 --> 01:14:15,350
Nobody does anything worth doing
with a degree. No woman, anyway.

995
01:14:16,064 --> 01:14:17,937
So what I do isn't worth doing?

996
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:20,941
Or what Miss Stubbs does,
or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?

997
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,902
Because none of us would be here
without a degree.

998
01:14:22,987 --> 01:14:24,695
You do realise that, don't you?
And yes, of course,

999
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:26,898
studying is hard and boring ...
- Boring!

1000
01:14:27,742 --> 01:14:30,280
- I'm sorry?
- Studying is hard and boring.

1001
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:33,703
Teaching is hard and boring. So
what you're telling me is to be bored,

1002
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,912
and then bored and 
finally, bored again ...

1003
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,542
but this time for 
the rest of my life?

1004
01:14:37,835 --> 01:14:40,160
This whole stupid country is bored.

1005
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:44,918
There's no life in it, or colour 
or fun. It's probably just as well ...

1006
01:14:45,009 --> 01:14:47,085
the Russians are going to drop
a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

1007
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:51,341
So my choice is
to do something hard and boring,

1008
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:54,267
or to marry my Jew ...

1009
01:14:54,602 --> 01:14:58,018
and go to Paris and Rome
and listen to jazz ...

1010
01:14:58,105 --> 01:15:01,973
and read and eat good food
in nice restaurants and have fun.

1011
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:04,941
It's not enough to educate us
any more, Mrs. Walters.

1012
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:06,903
You've got to tell us
why you're doing it.

1013
01:15:10,076 --> 01:15:13,990
It doesn't have to be teaching,
you know. There's the Civil Service.

1014
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:21,367
I don't wish to be impertinent,
Mrs. Walters,

1015
01:15:22,255 --> 01:15:24,710
but it is an argument 
worth rehearsing.

1016
01:15:25,424 --> 01:15:29,374
You never know, someone else might want
to know the point of it all one day.

1017
01:16:19,103 --> 01:16:21,510
- Where did you find him?
- I can't tell you that.

1018
01:16:21,605 --> 01:16:23,562
- Why?
- I think he likes you. Do you like her?

1019
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:26,816
"Yes, I do like her."
You do? You don't ...

1020
01:16:26,902 --> 01:16:29,572
You don't remember? It's Jenny.
You remember her from last time.

1021
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:33,320
"No, I don't." Yes, you do!
Naughty thing. You ... Pardon?

1022
01:16:33,409 --> 01:16:36,991
That's revolting!
You stick to your own species.

1023
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:39,950
He wants to kiss you, I think.

1024
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,535
Is that naughty?

1025
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:44,333
- We're engaged.
- Who is?

1026
01:16:44,795 --> 01:16:47,500
- No! Really?
- Yeah.

1027
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,870
- Engaged?
- Show her.

1028
01:16:48,966 --> 01:16:51,124
- Yes! Look.
- Gosh!

1029
01:16:51,802 --> 01:16:54,507
- That's fantastic news!
- Thank you.

1030
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:56,587
Congratulations.

1031
01:16:56,682 --> 01:16:59,766
I knew you'd see sense about 
university. You'll stay pretty now.

1032
01:17:00,102 --> 01:17:01,727
Can I still read?

1033
01:17:01,812 --> 01:17:03,935
Of course. But it doesn't have 
to be books now, does it?

1034
01:17:04,023 --> 01:17:07,226
Magazines will do just as well,
and you learn more from them, anyway.

1035
01:17:07,443 --> 01:17:09,815
- Helen.
- Well you won't be laughing, David,

1036
01:17:09,903 --> 01:17:12,192
when she goes all 
speccy and spotty.

1037
01:17:20,205 --> 01:17:22,827
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.

1038
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:25,787
I noticed that, too.
I thought he might be a bit jealous.

1039
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,420
Jealous?

1040
01:17:28,505 --> 01:17:30,831
We're going to keep 
him away from you.

1041
01:17:37,973 --> 01:17:40,760
I mean, what is one supposed 
to order as a starter, anyway?

1042
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:43,057
And how will I know
what is a starter and what isn't?

1043
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:46,845
We've been through this, Dad. It'll be
quite clearly marked on the menu.

1044
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:50,232
Can't the 3 of you just go
on your own and leave me here?

1045
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:51,861
I'd be perfectly happy
with a tin of salmon.

1046
01:17:56,909 --> 01:17:58,735
- Hello.
- Hello.

1047
01:18:03,665 --> 01:18:05,907
Ready? I think you'll 
like this place, Jack.

1048
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:08,159
Their wine list is as good
as anything I've seen in London.

1049
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:09,913
Yes. Someone told me that.

1050
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:12,414
David, probably.
Who else would it have been?

1051
01:18:15,093 --> 01:18:16,552
Madame.

1052
01:18:16,762 --> 01:18:18,505
I was hoping 
you'd take us in this.

1053
01:18:18,597 --> 01:18:20,636
You won't want to drive in 
anything else after tonight.

1054
01:18:20,974 --> 01:18:23,263
- Mind you, it drinks petrol.
- Yes.

1055
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,134
I'm afraid we'll have to stop
on the way into town.

1056
01:18:26,855 --> 01:18:28,931
I feel like Eamonn Andrews.

1057
01:18:29,024 --> 01:18:30,435
- Is that a good thing?
- Eamonn Andrews

1058
01:18:30,525 --> 01:18:33,313
is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.

1059
01:18:48,502 --> 01:18:52,749
- How are you tonight, sir?
- Very well. Might as well fill her up.

1060
01:18:54,341 --> 01:18:56,832
I'm going to make a quick call.
I'll be 2 ticks.

1061
01:19:04,684 --> 01:19:07,389
Do you think I should offer
to help pay for the petrol?

1062
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:10,064
Would he be insulted, 
do you think?

1063
01:19:11,274 --> 01:19:13,516
I know he said tonight was his treat,

1064
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,935
but does that apply to 
the petrol, do you think?

1065
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:17,986
I'm sure it does, Jack.

1066
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:26,908
- No.
- Jack!

1067
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,034
It just came off.

1068
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:40,335
- Put it on my bill.
- Thank you, sir.

1069
01:19:40,595 --> 01:19:42,137
Cheers.

1070
01:19:45,308 --> 01:19:47,052
Jenny? Jenny.

1071
01:19:48,061 --> 01:19:49,555
Take us home.

1072
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:52,398
- What's wrong?
- I'm afraid there's been ...

1073
01:19:52,482 --> 01:19:54,439
- Jenny's had a bit of a shock.
- What's happened?

1074
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:59,104
It's just another one of David's
little muddles and misunderstandings.

1075
01:20:00,448 --> 01:20:02,406
I don't want to hear another word
from anybody. Take us home.

1076
01:20:02,492 --> 01:20:04,070
- Now.
- All right.

1077
01:20:15,338 --> 01:20:16,963
You can take care of this,
can't you, David?

1078
01:20:17,048 --> 01:20:18,507
Go inside, Dad.

1079
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:27,427
"Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman."

1080
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:30,222
"Mr. and Mrs. David ..." 
You're married!

1081
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:33,354
Legally, yes, but I ...

1082
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:36,263
- When were you going to tell me?
- Soon. It ...

1083
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:39,357
It's just never seemed
like the right time.

1084
01:20:43,241 --> 01:20:45,115
You seemed so happy
and I was happy and ...

1085
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:48,321
You were living with your wife
all this time.

1086
01:20:48,872 --> 01:20:51,197
Round the corner! Byron Avenue!

1087
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:53,414
It's no wonder we kept bumping 
into each other, is it?

1088
01:20:53,501 --> 01:20:56,288
- What number?
- 34.

1089
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:04,300
Don't be like this. Come on.

1090
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:09,801
I have nothing.

1091
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:14,137
I didn't take my exams. I ...

1092
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:15,724
I left school!

1093
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,726
Where's it all gone now?

1094
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,944
I can get a divorce.

1095
01:21:26,117 --> 01:21:27,944
Everything will turn
 out for the best.

1096
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:39,706
Go and tell them.

1097
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,041
Go and tell them,
and then go and tell your wife.

1098
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:47,846
They won't listen now.

1099
01:21:48,765 --> 01:21:54,768
All right? I'll come round tomorrow,
when everyone's feeling a bit calmer.

1100
01:21:55,063 --> 01:21:56,687
Please don't make me ...

1101
01:21:56,773 --> 01:21:58,812
Please don't make me tell them
on my own.

1102
01:21:59,692 --> 01:22:02,100
You owe me that much.
You owe them that much.

1103
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,692
I owe them much more than that.

1104
01:22:11,245 --> 01:22:12,740
Hey.

1105
01:22:27,929 --> 01:22:30,764
2 minutes, and then I'll
come out and drag you in.

1106
01:23:28,823 --> 01:23:30,281
What's going on?

1107
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:37,198
He's helping himself to some 
Dutch courage before facing you.

1108
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:41,372
Stolen Dutch courage,
from the look of it.

1109
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:45,833
He has something 
he has to tell you.

1110
01:23:57,727 --> 01:23:59,221
He just drove off!

1111
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:07,269
Can you tell us?

1112
01:24:09,655 --> 01:24:11,233
Jenny, please!

1113
01:24:17,163 --> 01:24:19,451
I wouldn't worry about it
too much.

1114
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:23,709
- When I found out ...
- Not now, Helen.

1115
01:24:33,637 --> 01:24:35,511
I tried to tell him.

1116
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:40,931
I'm not speaking to him now,
if that's any consolation.

1117
01:24:43,772 --> 01:24:46,560
It's a funny world 
you people live in.

1118
01:24:47,776 --> 01:24:50,065
You both watched me carrying 
on with a married man ...

1119
01:24:50,154 --> 01:24:51,981
and you didn't think it was worth
saying anything about it.

1120
01:24:52,072 --> 01:24:53,732
Yes, well, if you want 
that conversation ...

1121
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,358
You watched David and I
help ourselves to a map ...

1122
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:59,530
and you didn't say much, either.

1123
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:31,059
Come on, you, let's go. Good boy.

1124
01:25:37,993 --> 01:25:39,239
Hello.

1125
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,031
Hello. Sorry, I think I've got the 
wrong number. I was looking for my ...

1126
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,581
I wanted ... For my cello lesson.

1127
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:53,923
No. Don't tell me.

1128
01:25:54,968 --> 01:25:56,511
Good God.

1129
01:25:57,596 --> 01:25:59,055
You're a child.

1130
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,760
You didn't know
about any of this, presumably?

1131
01:26:10,776 --> 01:26:12,484
No. They never do.

1132
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:20,655
You're not in the family way, are you?
Because that's happened before.

1133
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,201
Thank God for that.

1134
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:34,040
No. No. You stay here.

1135
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:48,802
- Did you see her?
- Yes, I saw her.

1136
01:26:49,898 --> 01:26:51,938
I didn't talk to her.
There wasn't any need.

1137
01:26:52,025 --> 01:26:54,148
We have to have this out.

1138
01:26:55,737 --> 01:26:57,777
Well, if you won't do it, I will.
I'm still your father.

1139
01:26:57,864 --> 01:27:00,652
You're my father again now, 
are you? And what were you ...

1140
01:27:00,742 --> 01:27:03,150
when you encouraged me
to throw my life away?

1141
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:06,031
Silly schoolgirls are always
getting seduced ...

1142
01:27:06,123 --> 01:27:08,032
by glamorous older men.
But what about you two?

1143
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:40,316
Jenny?

1144
01:27:46,955 --> 01:27:48,533
Jenny.

1145
01:27:53,086 --> 01:27:54,794
Jenny, I'm sorry.

1146
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:05,889
I know I've made a 
mess of everything.

1147
01:28:13,398 --> 01:28:15,723
All my life I've been scared ...

1148
01:28:17,569 --> 01:28:20,190
and I didn't want 
you to be scared.

1149
01:28:22,657 --> 01:28:24,484
That's why I wanted 
you to go to Oxford.

1150
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:30,991
And then along came David
and he knew famous writers,

1151
01:28:31,082 --> 01:28:33,620
he knew how to get
to classical music concerts ...

1152
01:28:39,007 --> 01:28:41,545
But he wasn't 
who he said he was.

1153
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,972
He wasn't who you 
said he was, either.

1154
01:28:52,562 --> 01:28:57,390
The other day, your mother 
and I were listening ...

1155
01:28:57,484 --> 01:29:00,687
to a programme on the radio
about CS Lewis,

1156
01:29:00,779 --> 01:29:04,942
and they said that he'd moved 
to Cambridge in 1954.

1157
01:29:09,037 --> 01:29:11,824
I said, 
"Well they've got that wrong."

1158
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:17,290
Our Jenny wouldn't have 
his name in her book ...

1159
01:29:19,464 --> 01:29:21,622
if he'd moved to Cambridge.

1160
01:29:31,267 --> 01:29:33,556
There's a cup of tea
and some biscuits out here.

1161
01:30:07,428 --> 01:30:09,717
How do you think we can help?

1162
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:15,973
I want to repeat my last year 
at school and take my exams.

1163
01:30:17,438 --> 01:30:21,816
I got the impression last time we spoke
that you didn't see the point of school,

1164
01:30:21,901 --> 01:30:24,059
or of me, or of any of us here.

1165
01:30:24,654 --> 01:30:26,278
I know. I was stupid.

1166
01:30:27,156 --> 01:30:30,490
The life I want, 
there's no shortcut.

1167
01:30:32,078 --> 01:30:34,913
I know now that I need 
to go to university.

1168
01:30:36,249 --> 01:30:39,166
It gives me absolutely
no pleasure whatsoever ...

1169
01:30:39,252 --> 01:30:42,371
to see our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1170
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:46,126
Although, of course, you are not
one of our schoolgirls any more.

1171
01:30:46,217 --> 01:30:47,676
Through your own volition.

1172
01:30:48,678 --> 01:30:50,717
I suppose you think 
I'm a ruined woman.

1173
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:55,508
You're not a woman.

1174
01:30:57,061 --> 01:30:59,682
No, I'm afraid I think that the 
offer of a place at this school ...

1175
01:30:59,772 --> 01:31:01,765
would be wasted on you.

1176
01:31:27,466 --> 01:31:29,091
Come in.

1177
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:33,592
I didn't expect to see you again.

1178
01:31:41,522 --> 01:31:43,016
This is lovely.

1179
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:46,083
All your books and pictures and ...

1180
01:31:48,237 --> 01:31:50,728
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1181
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:53,450
That's all you need, isn't it?

1182
01:31:56,829 --> 01:31:58,703
Just somewhere to ...

1183
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:11,791
I'm sorry I said those silly things.
I didn't understand.

1184
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:18,174
Let's forget about it.

1185
01:32:26,734 --> 01:32:30,862
- A Burne-Jones.
- Do you like him?

1186
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:33,235
I do. Still.

1187
01:32:35,409 --> 01:32:39,027
"Still"? You sound 
very old and wise.

1188
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:45,624
I feel old, but not very wise.

1189
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:53,086
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

1190
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:02,226
I was so hoping that's what 
you were going to say.

1191
01:33:52,945 --> 01:33:54,736
Thank you, Marjorie.

1192
01:34:10,087 --> 01:34:11,747
It's from Oxford.

1193
01:34:46,957 --> 01:34:49,033
"It is my pleasure to inform you ...

1194
01:34:49,126 --> 01:34:55,081
"that your application to read English
at Oxford has been accepted.

1195
01:34:55,173 --> 01:34:57,332
"On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,

1196
01:34:57,426 --> 01:35:01,506
"the staff of the university
look forward to welcoming you ..."

1197
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:23,160
So I went to read English books,

1198
01:35:23,243 --> 01:35:25,449
and did my best to avoid 
the speccy, spotty fate ...

1199
01:35:25,537 --> 01:35:28,075
that Helen had predicted for me.

1200
01:35:28,165 --> 01:35:33,076
I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless as any other student.

1201
01:35:33,962 --> 01:35:35,456
But I wasn't.

1202
01:35:37,257 --> 01:35:38,882
One of the boys I went out with,

1203
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:40,509
and they really were boys,

1204
01:35:40,886 --> 01:35:43,922
once asked me to go 
to Paris with him.

1205
01:35:44,014 --> 01:35:48,759
And I told him I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris,

1206
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:51,935
as if I'd never been.
