00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,583
        not even knowing
    what you're looking for.

280
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,684
       And you might find
         something that

281
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,387
 you never knew was out there.

283
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:57,135
      The video revolution
began in Japan in the mid-70's,

284
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:03,775
   when the engineers at Sony
began to develop a tape format.

285
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,212
     And at the same time,
     the engineers at JVC,

286
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,680
   they developed their own.

287
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,149
      Back then, you know,
  everything was Betamax/VHS.

288
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:15,720
  And so, you went to a store,
 there was always both formats.

289
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,522
         Ridiculously,
      they used to charge

290
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,157
    $3 more for a VHS tape,

291
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,725
        because you were
      buying more plastic.

292
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,862
    Really nothing happened
   in any numbers until '79,

293
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,697
   when it began to explode.

294
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,567
  Both formats were originally
         head-to-head,

295
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,669
  fighting for the supremacy.

296
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,971
   And it was sort of thought
           that maybe

297
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,373
   both could exist together.

298
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,808
Which proved not to be the case.

299
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,179
   I, of course, bought Beta.
            [laughs]

300
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,816
      So, you know, wasted
 all these zillions of videos,

301
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:48,286
         that I bought
      in the Beta format.

302
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:52,557
   And, of course, Beta went
    bye-bye very soon after.

 Beta was technically superior,

00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,842
   but, it had one huge flaw,

310
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,844
     which was that it was
      only one hour long.

311
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,812
 VHS format was two hours long.

VHS videocassettes play longer,

      the restorationist.

316
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,592
   And he was always talking
 about the latest technologies.

317
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,194
   He was keeping me alerted
         about the war

318
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,230
     between Beta and VHS,

319
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:36,234
    and how the cheaper one
         was gonna win,

320
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,770
       because the public
   just doesn't give a shit.

321
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,638
        He was correct.

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,408
         When I rented
    <i>The Last Unicorn on Beta,</i>

323
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,377
and stuck it in my grandmother's
          VHS player.

324
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,712
       That was not good.

325
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,213
         That's when I
   understood the difference

326
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,349
     between VHS and Beta.

327
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,686
  'cause I didn't get to watch
   <i>The Last Unicorn</i> that night.

328

For any TV show, like, whatever,

329
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,490
          any new show
     that's out right now,

330
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,859
    of course their goal is
 "Well this is gonna be on DVD,

331
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:02,927
     it's gonna be on Hulu,

332
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,228
     it's gonna be watched
       forever and ever."

333
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,898
         But back then,
they didn't really realize that.

347
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,342
       I don't think any
     member of the audience

348
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,377
         actually said,

349
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,446
     "Gee, I need a machine

       that will help me
     control my schedule."

351
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,984
 But once the machine was made,

352
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,286
     then they came up with
   concept of time-shifting,

353
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,156
     and that was a concept
      that really worked.

354
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:09,360
    That you could actually
 shift the TV schedule around.

       <i>Sony C6. So simple,</i>
       <i>the cat can use it.</i>

360
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:28,746
   The TiVo age only exists,
because we were raised with VHS.

361
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,649
        Because we were
the first generation that could

362
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,718
 be sent to bed with a promise,

363
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,054
    "It'll be here tomorrow
       when you get up."

364
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,656
 That changed our relationship
        with television.

365
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:44,562
    I discovered that, uh...
    I could program the VCR.

366
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,166
  That was, like, a big day...
        You know for me,

367
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,300
    Like, as a nine year-old

368
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,536
       to get around the
       parental controls

369
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,671
    and tape R-rated things.

370
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,140
  You can watch your TV shows
    when you wanna watch it.

371
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,543
That's the advertising campaign

372
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,146
   that really pushed Betamax
    to the top of the heap,

373
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,215
     and was a big success
         for two years,

374
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,350
 until VHS caught up with them.

375
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,654
      With an even better
       reason to buy it,

376
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,756
       because they could
         record longer.

377
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,124
 Suppose it's over three hours.

378
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,727
   Relax, Panasonic VHS tapes
        up to four hours

379
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,831
  of sports, movies, specials,
        on one cassette.

380
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,066
         VHS used that
      to actually win out

381
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,102
  in the format war with Sony.

382
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,070
  At a certain moment in time,
       people were like,

383
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:30,208
   "I don't like that you can
 share this thing with people.

384
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,811
        I wanna control
the mechanism of distribution."

385
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,980
   You know, "Only programmed
        on television",

386
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,048
        right, you know.

387
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,983
        "Only available
      in movie theaters."

388
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,719
So when the VHS tape comes out,

389
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,789
for a ton of the people involved
   on the manufacturing side,

390
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,057
       it's a watershed.

391
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,526
       But there's people
  in content and distribution,

392
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,362
   before everyone has decks
   and they can monetize it,

393
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,564
  they're like, "I don't know
if this is a good thing or not."

394
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,868
      So this whole notion
     of selling something,

395
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,904
where you lost control entirely,
       was a new notion.

396
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:03,708
And it made major movie studios
      very, very nervous.

397
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,776
  Box office kept increasing,

398
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,379
        so it's not like
    people are staying home

399
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,515
and avoiding the movie theater.

400
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,849
   It's a new bunch of people

401
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,919
       putting new money
        into home video.

402
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,254
And that's what's really driving

403
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,623
   this incredible explosion

404
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,025
      of the film industry
         in the 1980's.

405
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,162
      The guy who financed
       <i>Brain Damage</i> for me

406
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,763
  was a man named Andre Blay,

407
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,765
       and he's credited
      with starting this.

408
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,868
  He had a company in Michigan
     called Magnetic Video,

409
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,337
    that was dealing mainly
      with 3/4 inch tapes

410
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,006
      for industrial use.

411
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,807
  And he got the idea one day,

412
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,477
      "Wow, I wonder if I
   could put Hollywood movies

413
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,945
         on half inch."

414
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,414
    When I made the decision
      to buy movie rights,

415
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,417
   I said, "Well, I gotta go
 to all the Hollywood studios."

416
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,453
   And I wrote them a letter

417
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,088
        saying that the
     home video revolution

418
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,590
       is about to begin.

419
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,993
     And I could help start
       this new industry.

420
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,896
     So he writes a letter
    to all the major studios

421
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,566
        about, you know,
    "C'mon, give me a film,

422
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,534
      I'll put it on tape,
  and we'll see what happens."

423
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,669
 And no studio was interested.

424
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:05,903
      They thought it was
         a crazy idea,

425
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,338
      they thought it was
         a stupid idea,

426
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,006
     They thought it would
      devalue the films...

427
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,677
    But Fox said, "Eh, fine,
      let this guy do it.

428
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,346
     If he fails, he fails.
      You know, who cares?

429
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,547
We'll get some money out of it."

430
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,917
    This is pre- <i>Star Wars,</i>
      <i>so 20th Century Fox</i>

431
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,253
     is probably a company
  that's not doing that well.

432
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,988
          In any case,
     they hedged their bet.

433
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,924
 They gave him films that were
    at least four years old.

434
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,726
       <i>The Sound of Music,</i>
         <i>and, you know,</i>

435
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,428
   <i>Patton,</i> and all that stuff.

436
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,663
     And, uh, they sold for
      an exorbitant rate.

437
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,298
They were like, 89, 99 dollars.

438
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
          [screaming]

439
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,769
      [maniacal laughter]

440
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,305
  The only world we recognized

441
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,107
     was getting our films
        in the theaters.

442
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,309
      Charlie Band was the
     only one in our circle

443
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,478
    that was thinking about
     the home video market.

444
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,613
  So what I did was I thought,

445
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,349
        "Well, let me go
   find or license the rights

446
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:54,719
      to other successful
       independent films.

447
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,354
Even my lawyer had no real idea

448
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,922
 of how to write the document,

449
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,757
      'cause no documents
     had been written prior

450
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,592
 to license these video rights.

451
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,095
You know, what is the territory,
  what is the price? No idea.

452
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,964
    It was a pioneering time
    because nothing existed.

453
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,833
 Next step, let's not sell them

454
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,067
    the pre-recorded tapes,

455
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,335
let's actually rent it to them.

456
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,904
    Andre never anticipated
       the rental market.

457
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,073
    And he said he remembers
  the day he got a phone call

458
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,875
      from a store saying,
    "Hey, can I rent this?"

459
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,312
     And he went, "... No!"
            [laughs]

460
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,814
      And the store says,
  "Well my lawyer said I can."

461
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,018
   And it was like, "Oh, no."
 You know, so, that started it.

462
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,853
    And, uh, the punch line

463
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,956
        to Andre's story
       was eventually...

464
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,325
    all the studios saw how
   lucrative the market was.

465
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:35,826
       They all came out
        with their own,

466
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,295
        you know, label.

467
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,430
   Except for Fox, of course.

468
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,333
 So, Fox had to buy Andre out.

469
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,503
    They had to buy- So he-
            [laughs]

470
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,140
Whatever he bought it for, boy,
   he quadrupled that, okay?

471
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,109
    The video at that point
    was kind of taking over

472
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,711
   for the drive-in circuit.

473
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,912
    Video was the new market

474
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,381
      for the kids to rent
       the horror films,

475
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,984
and the films they wouldn't see
   at the mainstream theater.

476
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,752
       Well, I definitely
        don't think that

477
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:05,556
   my career would have gone
  where it had, without video.

478
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,792
    My movie was released in
 all kinds of foreign countries

479
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:08,826
           on video.

480
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,761
If it wasn't for video, for me,

481
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:15,833
 I know my popularity would be
 much, much smaller than it is.

482
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,601
      When videocassettes
         first came in,

483
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,437
   we jumped in, we loved it.

484
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:22,106
    We thought it was great.
  And, in fact, it was great.

485
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,008
         And there were
       mom and pop shops,

486
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,609
    there were video stores

487
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,379
opening up all over the country,
     all over the world...

488
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,947
      that needed movies.

489
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:35,152
In the early days, the appetite
  for video was so pervasive,

490
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,756
       people could pick
      the wrong location,

491
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:42,159
        they could pick
the wrong videocassette titles,

492
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,362
  they could hire surly staff,

493
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,232
they could have terrible hours,
     and horrible policies,

494
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,035
     and people were still
  gravitating to these stores.

495
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,337
          It was just-
there was such a hunger for it.

496
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,672
      [speaking Japanese]

497
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,085
  So the idea of having movies
   that were at your disposal

498
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,789
  when you wanted them was...
      kind of remarkable.

499
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,358
    And there was no talk of
picture quality or aspect ratio,

500
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,193
        or any of that.
   It was just availability.

501
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,628
 So you had to kind of be aware

502
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,531
 that as much as you wanna use
 that frame right to the edge,

503
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,132
 you wouldn't. You'd kind of...

504
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,234
     give yourself a little
     cheat on either side,

505
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,703
      'cause you knew that
     when it went to video,

506
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,338
  the edges would be cut off.

507
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,007
   I looked at a few of them,

508
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,578
     I was appalled at the
    improper aspect ratios.

509
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,047
 And the lack of rich contrasts

510
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,483
   and resolution, and, uh...

511
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,385
       never did buy one.

512
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:16,554
         And predicted
    they wouldn't catch on.

513
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,389
     Original aspect ratio
        never caught on

514
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,492
     'cause people thought
    they were being gypped.

515
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:25,629
  "I've got black bars on the
 top and bottom of my picture!"

516
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,565
        Yeah! That's so
       you see the sides!

517
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,366
   They ne- it never sunk in!

518
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,169
     Now I know people that
   have the widescreen TV's,

519
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,306
  so if they watch <i>Casablanca,</i>
       <i>they zoom in on it</i>

520
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,540
    to fill up the picture!

521
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,542
I don't get it, I don't get it.
        I don't get it.

522
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,845
   Sometimes it looks better
      than the widescreen.

523
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,781
     If you get the VHS of
   <i>Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid,</i>

524
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,483
 it's horribly pan and scanned

525
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,718
        and, like, they
       zoom in at times.

526
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,820
       But it's got this
  interesting aesthetic to it,

527
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,722
          which I like
   and actually prefer that.

528
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,124
      You can't make that
 camera movement with a camera,

529
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,392
    like, it only exists in

530
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,461
       however they used
   to make the pan and scan.

531
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,129
So when you saw stuff like that,
    you just thought, like,

532
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,698
       "That was a weird
       camera movement."

533
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,032
         I don't know,
    I- I enjoy pan and scan.

534
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,300
     It doesn't bother me.

535
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,103
   I don't like it when it's
     completely cropped...

536
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,738
     Like, where they just
          cut it off.

537
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,206
        Where they just
       don't give a shit.

538
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,508
         They just cut
    the left and right off,

539
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,876
   and then stuff is missing.

540
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,644
    Or when they smoosh it,
       I don't like that.

541
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:16,514
 But I like that weird... the-
         the weird ones

542
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,749
 where it moves back and forth.
  I think that's pretty good.

543
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,821
 Oh, fantastic! Closer, closer.

544
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,290
    The warmth, the wetness.
         Unbelievable!

545
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,592
  This is what it's all about!
         This is heat.

546
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,594
    This'll make me famous!

547
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,730
         We gotta talk
    about the VHS movement.

548
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:33,631
      And I've been lucky.

549
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,199
        I've been there
    at all the innovations.

550
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,967
         I've been here
      at all the changes.

551
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,869
         We went from a
       qualitative media,

552
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,905
    to a quantitative media.

553
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,774
       The video concept
        made it easier,

554
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,543
   but did it make it better?

555
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,911
         I don't know.

556
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,078
      [speaking Japanese]

557
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,481
    It was the very tail-end
of the theatrical distribution,

558
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,817
    and it was more of, um,

559
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,219
     video stores were just
      popping up all over.

560
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:33,190
So you had a lot of independent,
       adult bookstores,

561
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,492
   and business was thriving.

562
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:39,163
         The video boom
    came out of the facility

563
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,998
to watch this material at home,

564
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,601
    and no longer have to be
    ashamed, theoretically,

565
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,002
      to go to a theater.

566
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,972
        And I knew that
    once this door was open

567
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,506
   it would never be closed.

568
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,575
         Why don't you
      move the teddy bear

569
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,044
      and come sit by me.

570
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:58,882
   Nah, I got a better idea,
 why don't you come over here.

571
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,584
       Pardon me, Teddy.

572
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,561
      [speaking Japanese]

573
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:32,816
       Any major consumer
     electronics medium...

574
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,118
    it's success or failure
         in the market

575
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,285
  will be determined based on

576
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,721
it's relationship with the adult
    entertainment business.

577
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,790
       And I think VHS is
     where we learned that.

578
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,191
      [speaking Japanese]

579
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,682
  I like the way a film looks,

580
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,851
     but I think that video
probably makes the end consumer

581
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,320
         feel like he's
   a part of the experience.

582
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,755
      [speaking Japanese]

583
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,784
     What video did change
    about the porn industry

584
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:45,322
    was the idea that since
  we're distributing on video,

585
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,124
     we can shoot on video.

586
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,926
     Changed the economics
       of that business.

587
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,694
     And made the business
         so much bigger

588
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,229
 than it had ever been before.

589
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:57,634
What if we took these big boxes
    you know, in their trays

590
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,436
     and made them smaller,

591
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,006
       and maybe even we
   could attempt to sell them

592
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:07,644
    in alternative markets,
  like airports or bookstores.

593
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,213
     And they were selling
        like hot cakes.

594
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,215
   And the business took off.

595
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:14,051
   And that's how we created
    the sell-through title.

596
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:20,491
   Media had this crazy idea
       of releasing tapes

597
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:24,161
         at the, then,
   shocking price of $19.95.

598
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,729
      They were calling it
         sell-through.

599
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,864
 Every other company was going,

600
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,532
   "Oh that's a stupid idea,
       it's ridiculous."

601
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,000
 You know, 'cause they thought
    the more money it cost,

602
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,001
   the more money you'd make.

603
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,338
    "Gee, I wish they'd sell
      <i>Basket Case</i> for that."

604
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,207
      Because it would be
    the only film like that.

605
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,778
    A disreputable, unrated,
      blood and gore film,

606
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,579
   out on the market. And...

607
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,916
     teenagers, which were
       my core audience,

608
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,751
  they couldn't afford $49.95,

609
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,686
       but they could all
        afford 20 bucks.

610
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,421
      Media thought it was
        a terrible idea.

611
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,323
      They thought it was
  such a bad idea, they said,

612
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,893
       "We'll do it, but,
      if it doesn't move,

613
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,060
   we're gonna go right back

614
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,796
     to the regular price."

615
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,634
          [screaming]

616
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,738
     By the time Halloween
      came around, my god,

617
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,306
   <i>Basket Case</i> was everywhere.

618
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,275
       We made a fortune.

619
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,211
  It did spectacular. I mean,
    I bought this apartment.

620
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,947
    This was my down payment
  that I needed from the bank

621
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,148
     to buy this apartment.

622
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,584
   Suddenly the sell-through
        market was born.

623
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,787
 I'd like to think <i>Basket Case</i>
   <i>had a lot to do with that.</i>

624
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,723
          [screaming]

625
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,528
 It was great for independents
   because, the major studios

626
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,865
 really caught on very slowly,
           to video.

627
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:38,669
     And there were so many
 examples of independent films,

628
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,671
      that were brand new
       to that audience,

629
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,974
    that were more desirable
   than the big studio films.

630
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:48,045
  So, many times, those little
  pictures would out-perform,

631
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:52,382
Not theatrical, on TV and other
   deals that were happening.

632
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,851
      But when it came to
       the video market,

633
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,852
      in those early days,

634
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,553
       it was incredible.

635
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,690
   <i>It's the return of cult hero</i>
         <i>Freddie Krueger!</i>

636
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,925
  <i>And for the past two summers,</i>
       <i>Freddie's nightmares</i>

637
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,461
    <i>have been the nation's top</i>
       <i>video rental titles.</i>

638
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,997
       <i>Now, it's Freddie's</i>
        <i>third time around,</i>

639
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,799
       <i>and he's all set to</i>
           <i>claw his way</i>

640
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,500
            <i>beyond the</i>
          <i>200,000 mark!</i>

641
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,270
 The advent of home video also
made companies very successful.

642
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,239
      Very small companies
        very successful.

643
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,607
   And I think that's largely

644
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,210
      why we have so many
    insane VHS oddities now,

645
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,312
is because there would be a huge
Hollywood movie that would hit,

646
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,581
     like <i>Indiana Jones</i> or
         <i>Friday the 13th,</i>

647
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,118
   and you would get a whole
       plethora of films

648
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,087
     that were aping that,
       made for 12 cents.

649
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,689
Production price tag, you know,
     <i>Terminator,</i> 80 million,

650
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,558
     <i>Puppetmaster,</i> $400,000.

651
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,260
 It's like, you know, it's not
     an even playing field,

652
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,529
    but in the video store,
 they're all on the same shelf,

653
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,265
         they're all in
      the same size boxes.

654
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,867
   Look, if idiots like Troma
    can make a movie that...

655
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,404
   sells million and millions
 of dollars of videocassettes,

656
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,939
 well, then anybody can do it.

657
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,076
          [screaming]

658
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,479
    Distribution was handled
       very differently.

659
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,813
           There were
    a lot more distributers.

660
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,482
  There were people that were
     willing to experiment

661
00:31:58,484 --> 00:31:59,516
         in home video.

662
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,686
It was so new that it felt like
         the wild west.

663
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:03,954
      It felt like anybody
      could get a foothold

664
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,090
     and be a major player
      in VHS distribution.

665
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:12,129
      I was approached by
  a couple of producers who..

666
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:16,934
wanted to produce a video which
would go straight to home video.

667
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,135
  And this was something new.

668
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:22,439
   My idea was I would create
    an electronic aquarium.

669
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,174
 People found this intriguing.

670
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,842
    Here was this new thing

671
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:29,680
   that used this new medium
     that had been created.

672
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,421
  What really, I think, caused
 the early explosion in video,

673
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,523
 was Jane Fonda's workout tape.

674
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,859
     And now count to four.
         Heels forward.

675
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,896
And then, one... two... three...

676
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:49,566
    So, this was a tape that
    did something original,

677
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,768
      which was, gave you
  an opportunity to exercise,

678
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,237
     in your home, in front
    of your TV, by yourself.

679
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,672
   Don't need to go to a gym.

680
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,207
  It was a very good concept.

681
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,775
    And it had never really
       been done before.

682
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:01,211
 Well, the early days of video,
   it was a seller's market.

683
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,913
     It was great. I mean,
   they couldn't get enough.

684
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,949
 This was a worldwide exposure,
     and there was a window

685
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,651
       where if you made
        a clever movie,

686
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,386
and it was relatively well done,

687
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,954
 and it was in the right genre,

688
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,091
you know, it was an action film
     or horror, or sci-fi,

689
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,225
   you would make some money.

690
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,060
        So it was Toei,
     which is one of the...

691
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:19,096
   traditional major studios
           in Japan,

692
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:23,567
   that sort of launched this
   straight-to-video market.

693
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,535
 Whereas, in the U.S., largely,

694
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,571
video was, for a very long time,
       sort of demonized

695
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,239
  by the traditional studios.

00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,574

         Vestron Video,
   they were very aggressive.

700
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:01,298
    If you had a movie, and
you went to some place life AFM,

701
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
   the American Film Market,
           or Cannes,

702
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:07,070
 and the video rights for your
   movie were not locked up,

703
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,638
      almost immediately,
        you'd be visited

704
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,340
 by a salesperson from Vestron,

705
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,876
   saying, "Here... here's a
million dollars right up front,

706
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,077
       give me the movie.

707
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,913
     In the initial stages,
   you would go into a store

708
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,315
       and find something
        that you wanted.

709
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,649
 You wouldn't see a commercial,

710
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,986
   you wouldn't read anything
 in the magazine or newspaper.

711
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,155
 I mean, it was just that new.

712
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,556
All these stores were opening up

713
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:30,293
    and they needed to fill
  the shelves with new titles.

714
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,796
 So there was this huge demand.

715
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,664
        It didn't matter
   if they were good or bad.

716
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,567
       You have a pretty
      flourishing industry

717
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,637
        that's based on
      renting video tapes.

718
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,775
 30 to 35 thousand video rental
   stores across the country.

719
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,211
           Most often
    mom and pop operations.

720
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,914
       Charlie would have
         title contests

721
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,449
       for his employees.

722
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,187
And if you came up with a title
 that he used, you'd get $500.

723
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,123
So everybody would come up with
        10 or 15 titles

724
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,559
and he would narrow it down to,
        like, a hundred,

725
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,561
       and then he would
      commission box art.

726
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,197
  And then Austin Furst would
     come in from Vestron.

727
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,533
He would just come into the room
  and he'd go around, and say,

728
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,268
      "I'll take that one,
         and that one,

729
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,303
  and that one, and that one."

730
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,739
  And then Charlie would bring
  the writers and directors in

731
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,208
   and then say, "I want you
 to do this one and that one."

732

         [synth music]

733
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,432
    That was an era of great
  equivalency at video stores.

734
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,100
         I think people
      would rent anything

735
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,002
          with a cover
     that interested them.

736
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,538
    It wasn't about studio,
  it wasn't about movie star,

737
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,140
    it wasn't about budget.

738
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:53,777
When you're looking at a shelf,
     it's very democratic.

739
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,111
The best cover catches your eye.

740
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:58,481
 One thing I do, is go to video
  stores whenever I'm in them,

741
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,517
      and find the movie,
       and I pick it out,

742
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,553
       and I put it flat
     so it's facing front.

743
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,522
   A little extra advertising
          can't hurt.

744
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:06,990
     [laughs] I really do.

745
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,326
I'm like, looking around to see
       that nobody looks.

746
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,295
     A lot of them I picked
     just on the cover art.

747
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,697
             <i>Malone!</i>

748
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,632
      That's a cover buy.
       Have I watched it?

749
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,567
I'm not gonna lie to you and tell you
I've watched this movie.

750
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,404
 But, if this happens somewhere
 in it, then it's a good movie.

751
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,940
    Also, there's something
           to be said

752
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,076
   about something so large,

753
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,144
         you could kill
    a small child with this.

754
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,247
    Like, you could bludgeon
  somebody to death with this.

755
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,716
  That was a handful, when you
      bought one of those.

756
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,552
 And it left a lot of space for
      a really good artist

757
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,654
  to actually create something

758
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,556
         that in itself
       was a work of art.

759
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,525
   When you did a major film
     it was fun to see it.

760
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,227
   It's the kind of job that

761
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,962
     a lot of illustrators
        really cherish,

762
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,731
        and love to do.

763
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,866
 It used to have a battery and
    you'd press the button,

764
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,902
  and then Frankenhooker says,
         "Wanna date?"

765
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,905
      Um... Because that's
    one of her catchlines...

766
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,008
   catchphrases in the movie.
         "Wanna date?"

767
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,376
     She's a Frankenhooker.

768
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,379
         I have the box
  but it doesn't work anymore.

769
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,649
  But it was this talking box.
     And you'd press here,

770
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,084
   and you'd hear a voice go
         "Wanna date?"

771
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,954
  When you push the button on
the box, she goes, "Wanna date?"

772
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,222
       It was obsessive.
      You just sat there,

773
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,392
  "Wanna date?" "Wanna date?"
   "Wanna date?" Wanna date?"

774
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,928
  When this was in the stores,
 that's all people were doing.

775
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,732
    I think the talking box
   did more to sell the movie

776
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,267
      than the movie did.

777
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,802
        "If you only see
      one movie this year,

778
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,470
  it should be <i>Frankenhooker."</i>

779
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,072
    Of course it should be.

780
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:31,041
     I mean you see things
         that are like,

781
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:34,311
       wow, this box art
        is not selling.

782
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,413
 And, especially being a buyer
     for as long as I have,

783
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:38,848
   I can really look at stuff
            and go,

784
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,884
         "This box art
     will sell this movie."

785
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,853
     Looking at those, like
      <i>2000 Maniacs,</i> just...

786
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,955
        the blood coming
       out of the mouth,

787
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,725
   or the <i>Color Me Blood Red,</i>
     <i>with the woman, like,</i>

788
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,895
     just totally splayed.
       Guts hanging out.

789
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:54,064
        I was just like,
       "That is for me."

790
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,565
  People have a certain amount
          of nostalgia

791
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,300
    for kinda old VHS stuff.

792
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,469
And some of it was pretty great.
     Most of it was awful.

793
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,704
       I mean, if you're
      objective about it.

794
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:05,608
 There are terrible, terrible,
     unspeakably bad movies

795
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,577
     that have some of the
  best covers I've ever seen.

796
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,814
     I admire the fact that
  those companies figured out,

797
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,650
     "Man, all we gotta do
      is wrap it nicely."

798
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:17,954
    This was ultimately used
       as a video cover,

799
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,257
  for Chevy Chase <i>Funny Farm.</i>

800
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:25,595
    Sometimes it's just the
simpler image that read better.

801
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,464
       It was a great way
      for so many artists

802
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,533
       to make a living,

803
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,635
     and there was a lot of
      great art produced,

804
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,071
       especially during
       the 70's and 80's.

805
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:37,207
   We would fight to get our
     name in there, and...

806
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,942
    some would allow it and
   others would take it out.

807
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,111
       And so we'd kinda
     hide it in somewhere.

808
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:43,513
    My name is in the hair.
   If you turn it upside-down

809
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,482
     and have a look at it,
         you'll see it.

810
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:48,284
   When somebody does kind of
    a cheap, fast photoshop,

811
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,286
         here's a bunch
       of floating heads,

812
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,322
    you know, buy it because
    these actors are in it.

813
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,791
 Like, that artwork isn't gonna
    move the needle at all.

814
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:58,261
 I dunno what happened, I mean,
they actually used to use color.

815
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,597
       I don't see color
      all that frequently.

816
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,165
  It's like they're designing
         shit for dogs.

817
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,335
I think that everyone forgot how
  awesome a painted cover is,

818
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:08,304
of a dude with his shirt off...
     holding a machine gun.

819
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,439
         Why would you
      take a photo of that

820
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,409
      when you can paint a
   beautiful portrait of it.

821
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,244
        That's the stuff
      that's gonna keep it

822
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,946
     out of the mainstream.

823
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,617
  You know, the big box stores
don't want that painted artwork.

824
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,019
 The amount of work I was given
     from the movie studios

825
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:27,290
  really started to slow down
       in the early 90's.

826
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,325
Then, all of a sudden, they said

827
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,195
that I had to learn how to do it
         on a computer,

828
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,496
or they couldn't use me anymore.

829
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,865
        Once I mastered
   the tool of the computer,

830
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,034
      I was able to create
       what I did before,

831
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,803
    maybe even a bit better.

832
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:42,038
       Don't give me art.
       I can't stand art.

833
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,007
The worst covers on the planet.
           Criterion.

834
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,074
        I'm sorry, guys.

835
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,244
        They're the most
    boring covers ever made.

836
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,746
       How could you not
        wanna see this?

837
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,615
       How could you not
        wanna own this?

838
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:57,320
  My god... you know, this...
        this is a cover.

839
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,556
             Yeah.
            - Yeah.

840
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:03,893
  Criterion, go fuck yourself.
    This is how you sell it.

841
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,695
    [80's style synth music]

842
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,198
              ♪

843
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,577
          So by 1986,

844
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,279
      home video is giving
   as much money to Hollywood

845
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,048
       as the box office.

846
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,349
    And it's all new money.

847
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,419
 20th Century Fox is bought up
    by the News Corporation.

848
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,255
          Paramount is
      bought up by Viacom.

849
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,892
     because of home video,
    you actually have Sony,

850
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,261
  an electronics manufacturer,

851
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,397
     deciding never to lose
      a format war again.

852
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,801
 And the way to do that was to
     buy up a film studio.

853
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,269
    So they bought Columbia.

854
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:47,971
       So by the 1990's,

855
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,007
    you have a new landscape
    of media conglomerates.

856
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,076
 And they represented that film

857
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:56,446
       was switching over
       to a major brand.

858
00:41:56,448 --> 00:42:00,550
That you can spin-off from film,
  into many different markets

859
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:04,521
with the sales of videos, music,
      toy action figures,

860
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,422
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera...

861
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,792
   You know, we're down now,
 to the same basic five or six

862
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:13,530
corporate pipelines that supply
    almost all of our media,

863
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:17,667
       and unfortunately,
  they're not voracious enough

864
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,270
    to sort of reach outside
     their own catalogues.

865
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,705
       So you don't have
        that sort of...

866
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,275
         hunger in the
      marketplace anymore.

867
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:28,645
      Blockbuster came in
      and they took over.

868
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,948
 And they really got rid of all
    the mom and pop chains.

869
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,551
     It's name says it all.
   It was about blockbusters.

870
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,085
      That's all they were
         interested in.

871
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,955
     Video rental is gone.

872
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:42,692
     You know, that was the
 dominant way of seeing films,

873
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:45,495
    you know, 20 years ago.
         And it's dead.

874
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,230
 Even though we lost all that,
   yes, we have the internet

875
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,400
     I'm not gonna say that
   the internet isn't great.

876
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,704
 It's incredible. In some ways
     it's almost worth it.

877
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,106
Yeah, there's definitely a sense
  of loss, of course, I think.

878
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:58,908
    But, it's awesome to see

879
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,109
        the places that
       are still around,

880
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,245
 like Cinefile, Odd Obsession,

881
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,948
           Scarecrow,
     I Heart Video, Vulcan.

882
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,283
  They're still going strong.

883
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:10,653
This is our video tape costume,
that we have someone who, uh...

884
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:15,658
gets in and jumps around, during
the trivia contests that we do.

885
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,830
And it's pretty easy to get on,
      you just slide it...

886
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,636
        Kinda like this.

887
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:28,404
  And jumps around like that.

888
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:31,608
We were thinking of hiring some
 guy to just be on the sidewalk

889
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,010
        and just waving
       at people. But...

890
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,945
    nobody wants to do that
       for minimum wage.

891
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,314
    What VHS had, because it
     dominated for so long,

892
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,249
     was just an appetite.

893
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,584
They had to fill those shelves.

894
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,252
        They had to have
        new product out.

895
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,822
  And so distributers reached
  deep into their catalogues,

896
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,056
        and they had to.

897
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,627
       That was, I think,
 the greatest era of discovery.

898
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,864
 VHS had an unusually long life
    for a home video format.

899
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:57,333
 And I think that is something
that we'll never see happen again.

900
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:00,970
We'll never see Blu-Ray dominate
    the market for 15 years.

901
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,705
     It just won't happen.

902
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,185
      When I first started
          it was like,

903
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,587
      I'm a college grad,

904
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:20,523
I've had a business, and now I'm
  gonna work in a flea market.

905
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,925
 People would ask me in church,
          or whatever,

906
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,361
         I sell movies
      at the flea market.

907
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,629
     And it's like "Ugghh!"

908
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,432
 The funny thing about digging
  through all of Wayne's stuff

909
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,867
        at the house...

910
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:34,537
 Is that there's no separation
   whatsoever between genres.

911
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,172
  Basically you'll have, like
     <i>The Brave Little Toaster</i>

912
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:40,276
   and then <i>Enormous Wangs of</i>
<i>The Northern Yukon,</i> er whatever,

913
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,344
    and they're just, like,
    right next to each other

914
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,913
      'cause they're both
        oversize boxes.

915
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,015
That's a great film, you should
      check that one out.

916
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,785
    We're The Picture Show.

917
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:51,688
     Been here since 1990.

918
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,590
Got lots of customers that were
      kids, would come in,

919
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,859
      their parents would
      buy 'em kids movies,

920
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,928
  are now married and bringin'
         in their kids.

921
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,864
  So, that's the biggest thing
      that keeps me goin'.

922
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,668
And so I have people comin' in,
  most of them over 55 or 60,

923
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,538
      that still like VHS,
         still buy VHS,

924
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,739
     that's what they want.

925
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:12,742
 And then, young guys like you,
      who are collectors,

926
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,444
  and they want the old stuff,

927
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:16,746
    and they wanna get into
           all that.

928
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:21,017
  This is a typical VHS buyer.

929
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:25,121
    Uh, kind of, low-class.

930
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:28,825
[laughs] Here's a movie about a
       donkey named Paco.

931
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,861
    "He'll steal your heart
       and your wallets."

932
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:35,264
Wayne charges a lot for his VHS.

933
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,767
 Like, you know, way more than
     anyone else in America

934
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,168
probably charges for their VHS.

935
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,904
It's like a flat rate of 9 bucks
        if he likes you,

936
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,473
    10 bucks if he doesn't.

937
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,975
And there's no way on earth that
     Paco is worth 9 bucks.

938
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,610
    He actually is stealing
          my wallets.

939
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,913
     [Jones] You gotta have
     the real movie people.

940
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,582
      The people that know
    you can't get this stuff

941
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,050
    on Netflix, or whatever.
         [Jones] Yeah.

942
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,953
        And those people
      are fewer and fewer.

943
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:58,988
 I've just kept on keepin' on.

944
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,323
     [Carlson] But you have
         a personal...

945
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:01,691
   fondness for VHS I'm sure.

946
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:05,261
     [Jones] Oh sure, Yeah,
       I still watch VHS.

947
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,130
    And if I've got a choice
       to watch somethin'

948
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:10,933
I got all this new stuff around
 here, but I'll end up watchin'

949
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,070
 an old movie. You know to me,
    it's like an old friend.

950
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:19,275
        We display about
     17,000 titles on VHS.

951
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:23,212
        We display about
     12,000 titles on DVD.

952
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,481
       Probably up there,
       I have another...

953
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,784
     15, 20,000 duplicates,

954
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,319
        and around here
       in the two rooms,

955
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:34,390
    I probably have close to
     another 50,000... VHS.

956
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,058
           [Carlson]
    So, that's over 100,000?

957
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,763
       50, 60, 70, yeah,
probably at least 80, 85, maybe.

958
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:43,466
    And I don't really know.
     I'm not countin' 'em.

959
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,402
     This is the video room
     inside Wayne's house,

960
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,138
   which is like total chaos.

961
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,376
 Like the earth has vomited up,
   you know, 12 video stores.

962
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:56,012
        You do the best
      out in the country.

963
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:58,181
  You don't wanna be in town.

964
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:01,017
    You're fightin' all the
           Best Buys

965
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,186
and the Wal-Marts and on and on.

966
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,488
       Up there, I'm the
      biggest movie thing

967
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,989
  to a lot of people comin' in

968
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,125
  from a 40 or 50 mile radius.

969
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:11,027
   We can talk intelligently

970
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,296
        about 90 percent
    of the movies up there,

971
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:16,265
    and we've probably seen
     three percent of 'em.

972
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:19,802
If you don't know, then you go,
  "I hear it's a good movie."

973
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:24,974
Or... "Yeah, that's a real good,
  that's a pretty good movie."

974
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:27,777
  Are you ever honest and say
    "I hear it's terrible"?

975
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,545
      No, no, no no no no.

976
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,415
   That's absolutely a no-no.

977
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,218
And you go, "It's a pretty box,
       look at the box."

978
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,189
 Well, most of it, you've just
heard people tell you it sucks,

979
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,358
     but you don't know it,
   'cause I haven't seen it.

980
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,361
  Nothin' was more depressing,
             to me,

981
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,964
        than to wake up
       on January first,

982
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,833
        and know exactly
   what you're gonna make...

983
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:55,805
    I want to at least have
  the possibility of makin'...

984
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:58,541
   $50,000 or makin' $10,000.

985
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,277
   But at least I don't know.
     It's still out there.

986
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,413
    <i>This VHS home video system</i>

987

   <i>the people who invented VHS.</i>

989
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,455
       <i>A home video system</i>
           <i>so advanced,</i>

990
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,023

996
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:29,338
      VHS came out and the
 rewind button was introduced.

997
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,341
      That was pretty much
 revolutionary for film-makers,

998
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,377
 'cause you could just, easily,
  with the press of a button,

999
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,879
          just go back
    and constantly re-watch

1000
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:40,149
 how Tom Savini stuck an arrow
    through someone's chest.

1001
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:43,719
 You could go back and pause it
    and look at it closely.

1002
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,555
  Also understand and dissect
   the structure of editing.

1003
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:50,226
   Because usually editing is
 designed to be very seamless,

1004
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,296
and you couldn't figure out how
  shots would be put together

1005
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:56,399
to create a flow, and an effect,

1006
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,401
     and a gag especially,
          or a stunt.

1007
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:01,270
     It's really increased
          the ability

1008
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,639
    for people to understand
     the language of film.

1009
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,476
      [speaking Japanese]

1010
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:38,374
  VHS kind of, I think, taught
     a lot of people about

1011
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,543
      the nature of film,
     the nature of editing,

1012
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:41,811
      the nature of sound,

1013
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,079
 and how those things mattered.

1014
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,781
        Not on purpose,
    but on accident, like...

1015
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,683
     "Oh okay, this tape is
         falling apart,

1016
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:51,120
 Oh, 'cause it's a physical medium.
Well, why is that?

1017
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,290
     Oh, because it's just
 magnetic oxide stuck to a tape

1018
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,859
  in a pre-determined pattern.
           Oh, okay."

1019
00:49:56,861 --> 00:50:00,329
  Instead of having stacks of
          film books,

1020
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,332
  we had stacks of VHS tapes.

1021
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,435
 That's what helped us discover
      our love for cinema,

1022
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,070
     it's what inspired us

1023
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:10,272
      to go start shooting
        our own movies.

1024
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,841
      And I remember even

1025
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:14,777
     cutting my first films
      on two VHS players.

1026
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:18,147
    Everyone had a VHS deck
 in their house in the 1980's.

1027
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,383
       That was, I mean,
   everyone that I knew did.

1028
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,819
   So, you record something,
   you put it on a VHS tape,

1029
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:24,987
you can share it with everybody.

1030
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,089
      You could just leave
     the camera running...

1031
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:31,794
  and you were also aware that
  it was easy to record sound.

1032
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:34,663
        Um, so that was
     really revolutionary.

1033
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:38,601
 And for someone who was raised
    on home movies on film,

1034
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,736
       the idea of video
      was almost magical,

1035
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,906
     it felt like this was
      too good to be true.

1036
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:46,609
    Think about film history
       classes. Film 101.

1037
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,878
Whatever university you've been
   in, whatever high school,

1038
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,347
 the first films you looked at
    were the Lumiere films.

1039
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:54,350
       You've got a train
     coming into a station,

1040
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,519
   You've got factory workers
       leaving a factory,

1041
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,487
   and you're feeding a baby.

1042
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,657
 These are the canonical titles
        of early cinema,

1043
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,758
    that every textbook has.

1044
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,960
   And they are home movies.

1045
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:08,264
 I made my first feature on VHS
         when I was 12.

1046
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,366
I would dress up my brothers in,
    like a gorilla costume,

1047
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:13,002
      or we made fake guts
         that came out,

1048
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,438
        or we did a fake
        episode of Cops.

1049
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,341
  It's mostly unwatchable and
it's mostly deeply embarrassing.

1050
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:24,580
  ♪ Papa was a rolling stone,
          Yes he was ♪

1051
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:29,718
  ♪ He was a rolling sto-one

1052
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,487
  Before that it seemed like,
      well, making a movie

1053
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,655
       is like this whole
        different thing.

1054
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,023
    There's no way that you
      could ever do that.

1055
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,524
          That's what
    people in Hollywood do.

1056
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:38,094
 But then, when I figured out,
you can just get a video camera,

1057
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,929
and you make this movie,
and you can show it to your friends,

1058
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,564
      like, the next week,
     that was so exciting.

1059
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,165
  And then I was kinda hooked.

1060
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,733
[on the video] Well, this sucks.

1061
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,771
 Come on let's go have a party
         or something.

1062
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,806
  Eh, this is dumb, I'm bored.

1063
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,810
         Waste of time.

1064
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:57,847
  But I think it was the fact
   that it was so accessible,

1065
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,915
        it was the fact
     that it was universal.

1066
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,884
           It's like,
 "Alright, well let's go skate,

1067
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:03,352
    and I'm just gonna bring
      the camera with me."

1068
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,321
        It wasn't, like,
     this whole production.

1069
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,195
  You know, and I think in the
    grand scheme of things,

1070
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:16,665
we'll understand that there was
     the invention of film,

1071
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,168
 and that that became domestic
         at one point,

1072
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:23,372
  but that distinction between
       what was 8mm film

1073
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:25,741
    and what was home video,

1074
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:29,745
  I think was just this weird,
       you know, maybe...

1075
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,715
 20 year blip in our evolution.

1076
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:36,886
   I was 10. I saw the movie
    when it first came out,

1077
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:40,623
    and really was overcome
     by just Indiana Jones,

1078
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:44,193
     the character himself,
and the world that he inhabited.

1079
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:46,962
 You know, being a single kid,
   and kinda nerdy, you know,

1080
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:48,931
       I wanted to create
       worlds for myself.

1081
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:50,166
    That was my motivation.

1082
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,800
 And then getting together with
      my friend Eric Zala,

1083
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:55,738
     we wanted to recreate
       this Raiders film.

1084
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,307
  And of course, when you have
       a passionate idea,

1085
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,608
  you find the tools to do it.

1086
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,444
Eric had more of a drive to see
     a shot-for-shot remake

1087
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:03,846
  of Raiders in its entirety.

1088
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,615
      I think for myself,
    maybe it was that idea.

1089
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,117
But I think for me it was more,

1090
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,852
         "I just wanna
      play Indiana Jones."

1091
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:13,322
       [boulder rumbling]

1092
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,598
     We worked from memory
   for the first three years.

1093
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,034
    Video stores weren't as
       readily available.

1094
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,402
  You just couldn't get stuff.

1095
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,836
      And so you were left
          to your own

1096
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:28,904
   to go back to the theater

1097
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,005
    and see the film again.

1098
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,441
      we bought the script
      that was published,

1099
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,443
    we bought fan magazines.

1100
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,679
    I snuck a tape recorder
     into the movie theater

1101
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,914
   just to get sound effects,
and ended up getting thrown out.

1102
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:42,284
And then when the film came out
   on laserdisc in '84 or '85

1103
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:44,220
   we watched it and realized
     we were pretty close.

1104
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,088
 The whole seven year project,

1105
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,390
     really we just did it
         for ourselves.

1106
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,825
 But there's a nostalgia there

1107
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:51,894
      for this generation
         of filmmakers

1108
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,331
 that were teaching themselves
          on Betamax.

1109
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,601
     something as simple as
 setting up your Barbie dolls,

1110
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,436
   you know, or that could be
    something as complicated

1111
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,238
      as wanting to remake
     <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

1112
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,672
        in it's entirety

1113
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,574
      VHS will always have
       a historical place

1114
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:11,146
  because it was the first way
in which images were circulated

1115
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,849
        and duplicated,
    in a cost-effective way.

1116
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,252
         There were not
    the economic constraints

1117
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,387
   that were associated with
      image-making before.

1118
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,955
     That's revolutionary.

1119
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,591
   I remember renting some of
those, sort of, low-rent titles

1120
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,193
in the mom and pop video stores.

1121
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:25,194
But then you would get 'em home

1122
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:26,829
      and they would have
        this look, like

1123
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,164
       "This doesn't look
       like a real movie,

1124
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,666
       this doesn't look
       like a real film.

1125
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:33,302
       "Kinda looks like
    TV news, or something."

1126
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:36,038
      And you'd get, like,
     a shot-on-video movie

1127
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,073
that would give every appearance
     of being a real movie,

1128
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,275
      but it wouldn't be.

1129
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,909
        Wake up, bitch!

1130
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:47,750
           No... No!

1131
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,853
        This isn't real!

1132
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,721
 There's something about, like,

1133
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,123
       watching something
         shot-on-video.

1134
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,324
 It makes you feel mo- for me,

1135
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:59,028
like I could-  it feels- 
there's more of, like a voyeuristic thing,

1136
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,196
    'cause you associate it
       with home movies.

1137
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,832
    And so then when you see
     a movie made on video

1138
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,401
you kinda get this feeling like
    you're seeing something

1139
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,369
         that maybe you
      weren't supposed to.

1140
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,338
 Everybody was like, "You know,
  you gotta shoot it on film,

1141
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,840
 what are you doing? You can't
   shoot a feature on video."

1142
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,108
     I'm gonna take my time
           with this,

1143
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,810
     we're gonna treat this
         like a movie.

1144
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,111
       Just the fact that
        it's being shot

1145
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,046
         on Super VHS-C

1146
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:18,781
    is gonna be irrelevant.

1147
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:24,286
     <i>Sledgehammer...</i> they...
    made it on VHS for VHS.

1148
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:25,954
        And I- I think,
       as far as I know,

1149
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,756
 it's the first one like that.

1150
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:31,093
    And made with a sense of
     professionalism, like,

1151
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,528
  "Maybe this is the new way."

1152
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,563
I was here in Ohio doing it and
      guys like Tim Ritter

1153
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:36,732
were down in Florida, you know,
     doing the same thing,

1154
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,701
 and he was going door-to-door
        to video stores,

1155
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,036
But eventually you had guys that
cracked the nut at Blockbuster,

1156
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:43,472
   and were getting stuff on
   Blockbuster store shelves.

1157
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:47,142
 The unprofessional quality of
    the shot-on-video movies

1158
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:50,679
   to me, is what makes them
  beautiful and makes them...

1159
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,282
 I dunno, it's weird, it's like
  they were trashy back then,

1160
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,817
        but now there's
      an artistic quality.

1161
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,420
           Aaaaaaah.

1162
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,090
         Despite being
    an ex-boxer and marine,

1163
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:02,991
   The Rock finally succumbed

1164
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:08,797
  to the vicious, relentless,
         blood-thirsty,

1165
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,633
     unyielding, resilient,
           devil ant!

1166
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:13,836
   [unconvincing dying gasp]

1167
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:16,105
  And have you seen the giant
      horny toad monster?

1168
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:18,006
     Errr, he'll attack ya,
          errrrrrrrrr!

1169
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,742
  And the devil ant! Errrrrr!

1170
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,778
    I make monster comedies,
I've been doin' that since 1990,

1171
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,813
      and I've been makin'
   monster movies ever since.

1172
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,915
        My plot is I got
      a monster out there

1173
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:27,983
  and he has to be destroyed!

1174
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:29,151
     He has to be stopped!

1175
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,486
  That's the plot of my movie.

1176
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,288
    They call Detective Rock
to stop the monster, you know...

1177
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,424
       Who always doesn't
    believe in the monster.

1178
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:36,692
        [imitates sound
       of phone ringing]

1179
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,996
     [muffled voice] Yeah,
        Detective Rock.

1180
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,365
             Hello.
            - Rock.

1181
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,168
              Rock
         - Hello. Yeah.

1182
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,036
             Yeah.
          - Hey, what?

1183
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:49,004
          Ozzy's dead.

1184
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,305
Hey man, I'm tryin' to eat, man.

1185
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,374
   You know you shouldn't be
interrupt- callin' me this time.

1186
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,675
        You shouldn't be
     interruptin' me, man.

1187
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,611
          Ozzy's dead.
            - What?

1188
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:58,580
  Greg 'Ozzy' Ozumeck is dead?

1189
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,648
  Yeah, bitten by a devil ant.

1190
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,817
   Got bitten by a devil ant?
            - Yeah.

1191
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,853
    Oh c'mon, man, that's an
old wives' tale and you know it.

1192
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:07,556
       And it's got a lot
      of comedy in there,

1193
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:08,857
 and it's got a lot of action,

1194
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,959
 like monsters battling people.

1195
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,227
       A lot of victims.

1196
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:14,730
And then at the end of the movie
    the monster gets killed,

1197
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:16,832
or he gets stopped, or whatever.

1198
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,333
  Thrown in jail or somethin'.

1199
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,470
  This is a person who has...

1200
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:24,440
 one day sat down and decided,
"I am going to improve the world

1201
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,608
       with absolutely no
       financial support,

1202
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,844
    and no critical support
         from anybody,

1203
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,712
       and I'm gonna make
    this my life's mission."

1204
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:33,649
   He is- he is like a living
 embodiment of a middle finger

1205
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,617
    in the face of everybody
       who ever told you

1206
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,519
       that you cannot do
       what you wanna do.

1207
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:40,689
  Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome David "The Rock" Nelson.

1208
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,894
           Eeerrrrrr!
             - Ah!

1209
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,198
Errrr eerrrrr I'm gonna get you
       with my devil ant

1210
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,266
 if you don't watch this movie
          by The Rock!

1211
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:55,504
I was a door to door dictionary
   salesman from '87 to '91.

1212
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,806
      So that sorta helped
      my sales, you know.

1213
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,809
 It helped me, it taught me how
       to sell to people.

1214
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,945
        And after that,
      after I was let go,

1215
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:05,380
  I started sellin' my movies
            in '93.

1216
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:07,149
    I went door to door with
       my monster movies.

1217
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,518
       I had interviews,
    I have an introduction,

1218
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,288
so you're getting a full-length
  movie, it's like two hours.

1219
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,824
Plus you get previews, plus you
    get a long intro by me,

1220
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,292
 flexing my muscles and stuff.

1221
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:20,496
    I'm gonna show ya, look!

1222
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,731
  The Rock's got it! Show 'em!

1223
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:28,070
  I drink like four glasses of
  milk a day, and I eat good,

1224
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:30,305
I get my protein, you know, 
a beef patty maybe with some rice

1225
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,708
    and maybe some veggies,
       or a small salad,

1226
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,512
  and I... you know, every day
  I have a banana or an apple.

1227
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:39,581
    You know, get my fiber,
         get my fruit.

1228
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,517
         So, you know,
   all natural body-building,

1229
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,551
    I never took a steroid,

1230
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:44,019
     it's all natural, bud.

1231
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:50,526
        46, 47, 48, 49,

1232
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:55,230
          50, 51, 52!

1233
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:59,334
     Ladies and gentlemen!
    David "The Rock" Nelson!

1234
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,207
  Are you jealous of my body?
        [audience] Yes!

1235
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,310
  Are you jealous of my body?
             Yeah.

1236
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:11,446
The thing is, I got enough footage
for like 100 movies right now.

1237
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:13,115
   I'm always filmin' stuff.

1238
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,584
 And I film so much stuff that
 I forget where everything is.

1239
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:19,154
  So, a lot of times I have to
reshoot something if I want it.

1240
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:20,322
      It takes too long to

1241
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,224
         fast-forward,
      rewind to find that.

1242
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,060
           So I say,
 "I'll just do it over again."

1243
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,229
  And it turns out pretty good
        the second time.

1244
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,736
  Go ahead and stab the knife
      in my chest, Sodom,

1245
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,071
  go ahead, right in my heart.

1246
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,139
            Why not?

1247
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:40,309
    I got ideas comin' outta
     my head, man, I'm 55!

1248
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,311
   What's wrong with you guys
       sayin' you're old,

1249
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,546
    when you're like my age,
  or younger! You're not old!

1250
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,448
  Don't tell me, "Oh, I'm 48,

1251
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,883
 I'm gettin' too old fer this."

1252
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:51,053
    Man, you're just a kid!
         Get motivated!

1253
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:53,789
You know, some of you will say,
"Oh, you gotta do it digitally."

1254
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,357
   Yeah, digital schmidgital!

1255
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,992
    I don't need a computer
        to make a movie,

1256
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,427
         I never have!

1257
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,029
  I just shoot the dang thing.

1258
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,665
If you got a video camera,
stick a blank tape in that machine,

1259
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:04,800
    and film the dang thing!

1260
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,101
      Quit makin' excuses,

1261
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,536
      "Well, I don't have
        all this money.

1262
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:11,006
  I need a budget so I can buy
  all this digital equipment."

1263
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,240
        Use what ya got!

1264
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,709
       "Well I didn't go
        to film school,

1265
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,344
   I don't know if my movies
   are gonna be good er not."

1266
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:16,511
     Don't worry about it!

1267
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,747
   Just listen to your heart
         and you do it!

1268
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:20,749
        You take charge
      of your own vision!

1269
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:23,018
        And don't worry
    what other people think!

1270
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,721
And don't let your mom talk you
  outta makin' monster movies!

1271
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,289
     I told my mom, I said.

1272
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,857
          My mom said,
  "David I wish you'd grow up,

1273
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:31,059
     and do somethin' more
 constructive with your time!"

1274
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,795
I said, "Mom, you can't stop me
      from makin' movies,

1275
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,897
        because you know
    I'm gonna do it anyway!"

     [80's synth pop music]

1277
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,577
  The infamous glitch that all
    video store owners know.

1278
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,313
When you're watching and there's
   a glitch, and you're like,

1279
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,482
    "Oh, it's gonna get nude
        in two seconds."

1280
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:57,452
Here's a news flash, nudity was
  gigantic with teenage boys.

1281
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:00,288
       It was a big thing
       back in the 80's.

1282
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,224
Watching a video tape as a kid,

1283
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:04,126
          when you can
     start to see the lines

1284
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:05,427
  rolling through the picture

1285
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:07,963
you know that someone's watched
    it a lot at that point,

1286
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:10,265
   and you know that there's
 gonna be tits coming on soon.

1287
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,968
   You get ready, you sit up
in your chair, 'cause you think,

1288
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,537
    "Holy shit, some fuckin'
         weird pervert

1289
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:17,973
     has watched this part
         so many times

1290
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:20,642
         that I'm ready
      for the money shot."

1291
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:24,112
   When you watch a VHS tape,
there's almost like a archeology

1292
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:27,883
 Where there's history written
   into the physical material

1293
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:29,451
      of the thing itself.

1294
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,319
 You get to see the parts that
      are really beat up.

1295
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,088
     You know that someone
          rewound that

1296
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,356
 and watched it over and over.

1297
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,624
       It's like the part
      where there's boobs

1298
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:37,059
       or the part where
       the guy explodes.

1299
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,927
       You know that was
    someone's favorite part

1300
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,996
 and they couldn't get enough.

          [screaming]

1302
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:53,275
  That was the first, I think,
     anybody had the power

1303
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:54,910
 over being able to see boobs,

1304
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,012
   again and again and again
      and again and again.

1305
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,414
         Cable had been
    a reality in our lives,

1306
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,818
   so you could see boobs...
    but then they were gone.

1307
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,453
       And they were just
        a golden memory.

1308
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:07,122
     I had a video tape of
       <i>Kentucky Fried Movie</i>

1309
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,623
   and I lent it to a friend.

1310
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,058
   And when he gave it back,
          it was like,

1311
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,727
 every 10 minutes or something,
        it would just go

1312
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:14,663
 And I'd be like, "You watched
     all those nude scenes

1313
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:17,165
      over and over again
        in one weekend!

1314
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,034
 Because now my tape is ruined.

1315
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,002
  But it's also kind of funny.

1316
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:24,039
 And whenever I watch it, I can
  think of you being gross...

1317
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,373
        and hilarious."

1318
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,610
  My <i>Ghostbusters</i> tape, I bet
   people can't even make out

1319
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,045
 the whole scene where he goes,

1320
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,180
        "I came, I saw,
       I kicked some ass"

1321
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,616
   because I thought that was
     the greatest shit ever

1322
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:37,052
     I rewound that scene,
          I was like,

1323
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:40,489
"Whoa, he kicked some ass, that
   is what Ghostbusters do."

1324
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:43,925
   We had a guy at one of our
 video stores that I worked at,

1325
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,128
    where we eventually had
    to cancel his membership

1326
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,662
     because we figured out
          it was him.

1327
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:52,901
   But his hobby was renting
       children's movies,

1328
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:56,505
and then splicing in pornography
     in the middle of them

1329
01:02:56,507 --> 01:02:58,240
   and returning them to us.

1330
01:02:58,242 --> 01:02:59,941
    So they'd go back on our
        rental shelves.

1331
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,977
    I have finished planting
          detonators.

1332
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:04,679
 We have less than two minutes!

1333

           [moaning]

1334
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,688
    It entertained this guy.

1335
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,323
          And with VHS

1336
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,125
   that was a tangible thing
       he could do it to.

1337
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:21,463
 My friend lent me a tape of a
movie he taped for me recently.

1338
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,764
       I went all the way
     to the end of the tape

1339
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,367
  just to see how many layers
  of things has he taped over

1340
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:29,538
And you kinda catch the tail-end
    of a movie from Cinemax

1341
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,907
    or, like, a music video,
        or this TV show,

1342
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,041
  all the way to the something

1343
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:35,544
   that was taped originally
           from 1987.

1344
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:37,612
    And it was really great
          just to see

1345
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:40,816
    who this guy- you know,
     what he was watching,

1346
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,617
     for the past 25 years.

1347
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,920
   <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> is one of
       my favorite films.

1348
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:47,489
   And when I go see a print
    of that in the theater,

1349
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:53,228
  every scratch, every break,
 every place you see a splice,

1350
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,563
  there's a story behind that.

1351
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:56,398
       Something happened
        with that movie,

1352
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,632
       something happened
        with that print

1353
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,634
          when it was
     shown to an audience.

1354
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:02,938
And there's something about that
          that, to me,

1355
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,142
'cause you know that print's had
 some life and some legs on it.

1356
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,376
       VHS could do that.

1357
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,980
   It's almost like VHS has a
     built-in hit counter.

1358
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:15,383
In that, like, you can tell how
  many times it's been copied

1359
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,451
   by the way that it looks.

1360
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:19,387
 And so, you knew that when you
          got a tape,

1361
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,456
  if you were in tape trading,

1362
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,125
  like, the shittier it looked
   and the worse it sounded,

1363
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,927
      you just knew it was
         gonna be gold

1364
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,763
    because that meant that
      10 people before you

1365
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:31,299
had copied it, and thought that
      it was funny enough,

1366
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,002
   or great enough, or weird
     enough, to make a copy

1367
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,937
 and then pass it to their friends,
who thought the same thing.

1368
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:39,307
  So it was like this vetting
  process, you know, where...

1369
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:42,244
 Uh, this distillery of images,
         or something.

1370
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:44,779
So that by the time you got it,
      it was like, potent

1371
01:04:44,781 --> 01:04:46,514
         and, you know,

1372
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,451
  gonna get you high. [laughs]

1373
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:51,486
      Priest is bad, man.

1374
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,788
      Priest is number one
      in heavy metal, man.

1375
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:57,225
    And then who comes next?
       Iron Maiden, man.

1376
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,260
         [Jeff Krulick]
       What would you say

1377
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,528
     if you saw Rob Halford
           right now?

1378
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:03,732
      I'd jump his bones!

1379
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:06,268
[Krulick] What do you think, uh-
  What do you like about him?

1380
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,838
      He's great, man, he
  sings great. Group's great.

1381
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,172
  [Krulick] How 'bout Dokken?

1382
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,308
       Great. Excellent.

1383
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,843
  [Krulick] Are you fucked up?

1384
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:17,712
         The <i>Southpark</i>
        <i>Christmas Special,</i>

1385
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:18,914
   I never had a copy of that

1386
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,182
   and somebody I knew had it
      and they were like,

1387
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:22,851
"Really? You don't have a copy?
         That's crazy.

1388
01:05:22,853 --> 01:05:24,286
 Everybody has a copy of this."

1389
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:26,221
       And so I was like,
     "Well, make me a copy.

1390
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:29,157
  You know, just, come on, if
everybody has it, give me one."

1391
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:32,260
 I remember the guy being like,
"Well, what do you have for me?"

1392
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:33,561
 And that was the first moment
       where I was like,

1393
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:36,865
      "Oh... That's right,
         tape trading."

1394
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:39,734
     The Winnebago concepts
  and engineering departments

1395
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,836
        have developed a
   multi-functional bathroom

1396
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,339
   privacy I don't even know
   what the fuck I'm reading.

1397
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:47,242
     I wonder what the fuck
     the real dialogue is.

1398
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,643
  What the fuck is this thing?

1399
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,212
       Oh, the windshield
        for fuck's sake.

1400
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:55,116
  I gave that guy a collection
I had gotten from somebody else,

1401
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,451
 that had Winnebago Man on it.

1402
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,486
    That had Larry Williams,
         it had Jesco,

1403
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:00,288
   It had the <i>Jackass</i> pilot,

1404
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,123
    The best of the worst of
           <i>Star Search,</i>

1405
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,591
   which was really awesome.

1406
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,393
         And I got the
   <i>Southpark Christmas Special.</i>

1407
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,861
             Dude!
            - What?

1408
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:09,497
    Don't put the magic hat
        on the snowman.

1409
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:13,501
  'Cause if you do he's gonna
         come to life.

1410
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:14,569
             Cool!

1411
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,137
       No it's not cool!

1412
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,008
     My sister in Minnesota
     put a hat on a snowman

1413
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,376
   and it tried to kill her!

1414
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,378
 Fuck him, let's do it anyway.
            - Yeah.

1415
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,281
        I decided to get
       in this business.

1416
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,717
     One, it was economics,
  I didn't have really a job,

1417
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,185
         I was working
      at a porno theater,

1418
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:33,088
      I'd just had a son.
What am I gonna do with my life?

1419
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,323
 So the very first thing I did
        was the obvious.

1420
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,325
    I took out a little ad,
           30 titles.

1421
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,462
     Mexican horror titles
  and some other obscurities.

1422
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,330
         I ran that ad
      for a couple months.

1423
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,300
     The first week I got,
     like $500 in the mail,

1424
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,968
    I was like, "Oh my god."

1425
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,436
 Make my copies, send 'em out.

1426
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,473
 And then the next week $1000,
         the next week,

1427
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,575
  "Oh my god, this is insane."

1428
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:56,211
     So I- I quit my job...

1429
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:58,013
         and I started
      being a bootlegger.

1430
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:02,017
  You'd read someone's ad in a
  magazine and you'd respond,

1431
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,252
 and you would write down what
    you had and what he had,

1432
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,387
      and you would trade.

1433
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,989
     And you'd make a copy
    and it was usually bad,

1434
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,424
four or five generations later,

1435
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:11,659
   but you'd still get to see
     the movie you wanted.

1436
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,894
  And what started happening,

1437
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,329
    as I started to get into
         more and more

1438
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,530
     extreme type of films,

1439
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,832
       is things would be
       taken by customs.

1440
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:20,101
  It was really funny because
  they've got this checklist,

1441
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:23,838
 and it said, "Your product has
been seized by Canada customs."

1442
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,540
     And I remember twice,

1443
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,510
    I ordered tapes that got
     seized at the border.

1444
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:29,844
      and one of them was
           <i>Nekromantik.</i>

1445
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,580
   The "necrophilia" box was
       checked. [laughs]

1446
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:34,983
  If you were ordering a movie
 that was banned or prohibited,

1447
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:38,420
 you'd have the guy tape, like,
an episode of All in the Family

1448
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:40,021
       for like the first
      five or ten minutes.

1449
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,589
  Of course, you're not gonna
     have the tape labeled

1450
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:42,557
     <i>Degradation of the Shit</i>
        <i>Eaters, Volume 6,</i>

1451
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,894
   He's gonna put, you know,
   <i>"All in the Family Reruns,"</i>

1452
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:46,728
    or something like that.

1453
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,496
 That was a pretty solid trick.

1454
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,965
   To me, it wasn't offensive
           in any way

1455
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:52,767
    because these films were
      impossible to find.

1456
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,969
  And what they were doing was
  helping spread these movies

1457
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,305
 and getting them out to people
     to actually see them.

1458
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,707
   I think that's why in the
 DVD market, in the beginning,

1459
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:02,077
  you were seeing large units
        of things move,

1460
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,546
    because they could go to
    a convention like this,

1461
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:08,616
 and say, "Oh, okay, those guys
were moving that many bootlegs,

1462
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,418
      or that many trades
         amongst them.

1463
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,755
  It's a safe bet to put out a
     nice remastered copy."

1464
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,590
       But I think it was
       an important time,

1465
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,726
    and a lot of movies were
     discovered by trading.

1466
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,895
And in the case, specifically of
         <i>Dead Next Door,</i>

1467
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:22,530
     there was such a long
        window of time,

1468
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:25,200
from the time it was made to the
   time it actually came out,

1469
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,801
 that it was bootlegged a lot.

1470
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,002
  But it benefitted the movie

1471
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:29,938
       because everybody
  found out about it that way.

1472
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,040
We didn't have to go out and do
     a bunch of publicity,

1473
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:33,408
   the publicity came to us.

1474
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,076
      [speaking Japanese]

1475
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,659
It's kinda funny, you know, I'm
dealing with these companies...

1476
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,060
       I think they know,
       maybe they don't,

1477
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,662
 but I feel kinda g- you know,

1478
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,098
       I maybe bootlegged
some of their stuff in the past,

1479
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,033
 and now I'm dealing with them
    on a professional level,

1480
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:33,301
      playing their movies
        in the theater,

1481
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:35,203
  but... these guys all know.

1482
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:38,106
I mean, any guy that's gonna be
hypocritical and say, you know,

1483
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:40,942
  well the first time you saw
        <i>Cannibal Holocaust</i>

1484
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,143
    was via a pirated tape.

1485
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,412
         And talk about
      cruelty to animals,

1486
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,514
      McDonald's has to be
      on top of the list.

1487
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,217
  I mean, when you think about
  those poor little McChickens

1488
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:52,086
  walking around without their
     McNuggets. [laughter]

1489
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,857
     I think the appeal of
     this type of material

1490
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,527
 that VHS definitely encouraged
       and helped spread,

1491
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,229
      these viral videos,

1492
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:04,499
     are that they capture
      something authentic

1493
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,268
       that wasn't meant
        to be captured.

1494
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,938
  We finally go to the point,
I think in the last five years,

1495
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,374
     where just everything
       truly is ours now.

1496
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,578
 Where, when you put something
     out there, I'm sorry,

1497
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,681
   it's just- it's not yours
   anymore. It's everyone's.

1498
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,650
    Before, you would have-
and in a way it was patriarchal,

1499
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,085
    and it was problematic,

1500
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,320
 'cause you would have to wait
        for someone else

1501
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:27,922
  to approve of what you were
     saying and presenting,

1502
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,958
     and have to go through
       that whole dance.

1503
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,360
  But, in that there was a pre
       selection process,

1504
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:35,163
 so that, by the time something
       got to the screen,

1505
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:37,765
 you knew that someone thought
  that it was worth something.

1506
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:40,034
 You look at YouTube and you're
   like, "I love cat videos."

1507
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,570
I could spend a good portion of-
        and perhaps I do

1508
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,372
 spend a good portion of my day
      watching cat videos.

1509
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:46,074
        Cat videos have
     always been important.

1510
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:52,013
If you look at what people were
shooting on film for home movies

1511
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,448
     in the 50's and 60's,

1512
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,149
 they were filming their cats.

1513
01:10:55,151 --> 01:11:00,221
   But I think the incredible
 pressure now is to understand

1514
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,823
 what it is you need to watch.

1515
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,058
       And the orthodoxy
       comes really from

1516
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,593
     what other people are
         clicking into.

1517
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,528
   And then the question is,
 "Well, how do they find that?

1518
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,364
  And how is that discovered?

1519
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:10,965
      [speaking Japanese]

1520
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,352
  Duane, I was wondering, what
 fashion trends do you follow?

1521
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,755
      Well I usually look
       in magazines or...

1522
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,089
       see what the kids
     at school are wearing.

1523
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,191
             Duane!

1524
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,596
      Already you can see
        a remix culture

1525
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,732
 appropriating different clips
 to do different things with it

1526
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:47,969
besides just what the producers
   in a centralized industry,

1527
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,404
       such as Hollywood,

1528
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:52,840
   or the New York television
      networks do with it.

1529
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:56,344
I don't watch stuff that I hate
   and then put it on there,

1530
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,112
which I think a lot of people think,
for Everything is Terrible!

1531
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:00,815
  They think, "Oh, it sucks so
  you gotta put it up there."

1532
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,850
  It's like, no, I don't wanna
        put anything up

1533
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:03,885
    unless it's incredible.

1534
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:05,486
         Crack cocaine.
            - Coke!

1535
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,055
          And this is
     what you smoke it in.

1536
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:07,989
         It's awesome!

1537
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:11,859
 Makes you feel good all over.

1538
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,261
  Yes, some of the stuff we do

1539
01:12:13,263 --> 01:12:15,063
     doesn't show people in
      the best light ever.

1540
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:18,566
    But... they did produce
   that stuff to begin with,

1541
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,201
we're just spitting it back out.

1542
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:22,103
           I'm Fabio.
      - I'm Micky Dolenz.

1543
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,105
        I'm Al Michaels.
        - I'm retarded.

1544
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:26,040
     Hey Toby, you da man.

1545
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,509
Oh, Mr. White, I'm just a tire.

1546
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,678
        There's so much
   undiscovered stuff still.

1547
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,280
     How can we share that
        with everybody?

1548
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:34,949
    Let's just organize this
        as best we can,

1549
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,351
because that's really all it is,

1550
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:39,187
 is just kind of taking control
       over those tapes.

1551
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:45,059
   [cartoon punching sounds]

1552
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,261
          [explosion]

1553
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:48,796
             Whoo!
 - That's right, little buddy.

1554
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:51,399
           Get away!
          - Oh my god!

1555
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:55,870
    So it's fascinating that
      these technologies,

1556
01:12:55,872 --> 01:13:00,341
 you know, leapfrog each other,
       building new uses.

1557
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,477
 And none of this is driven by

1558
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,480
people really anticipating what
      the new use will be.

1559
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:07,815
  It's almost like you have to
        build a machine

1560
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:10,451
          and then see
    what people do with it.

1561
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:13,121
     There's really no need
       for archaic things

1562
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,689
      like cable anymore.

1563
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:17,692
  Stuff like that. It's like,
    "Why would you do that,

1564
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:21,863
  when you can literally watch
whatever you want at any time."

1565
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,065
    I guess there are people
      that are collectors,

1566
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:27,368
and put things on their shelves,
 and it reflects who they are,

1567
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,404
and I think that that's a loss.

1568
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,906
           But I, um,

1569
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:35,009
    I think that there'll be
virtual ways for us to collect,

1570
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,411
and we're gonna figure that out.

1571
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,880
        I'm sure studios
       are really excited

1572
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:40,381
about the way things are going,

1573
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:43,451
about the fact that there's not
  going to be physical media.

1574
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,820
    I mean, the Walt Disney
     corporation, you know,

1575
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:47,088
  is made up of lovely people,

1576
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,257
     but that whole idea of
       The Disney Vault,

1577
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,527
  "We're putting <i>The Lion King</i>
 <i>back in the Disney Video Vault</i>

1578
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,762
   so you can't buy it again
         for a while."

1579
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,131
  It's a completely artificial
       sense of scarcity,

1580
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,534
designed to create a completely
  artificial sense of demand.

1581
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:04,439
        Studios are now
     completely dominating

1582
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:05,840
   what is available to you.

1583
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:08,342
   And they are completely in
 control of what you can have.

1584
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:11,045
 And they can give that to you
  and they can take that away,

1585
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,847
     like a malevolent god.

1586
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:16,684
It infuriates me. The notion of
  somebody else having control

1587
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:19,153
   over my access to media in
      general bothers me.

1588
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,823
     When I read the story
        about the Kindle

1589
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:24,759
   and how all the people who
         had purchased,

1590
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,360
     it couldn't have been
      a more ironic title,

1591
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,396
     George Orwell's <i>1984,</i>

1592
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:31,232
woke up one morning, because of
   a licensing disagreement,

1593
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:34,535
  it was gone. It just wasn't
    on their Kindle anymore.

1594
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,837
       That's terrifying.

1595
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,539
     That is absolutely not

1596
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,175
        in the spirit of
     purchasing something.

1597
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:43,711
       That word becomes
   meaningless at that point.

1598
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:47,215
       You don't purchase
  digital media. You rent it.

1599
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:48,616
  And it's at their pleasure.

1600
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:52,820
  The reality is all physical
media is going away. All of it.

1601
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:57,091
On a business standpoint, if it
takes off, it'll be good for us,

1602
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:59,660
        because we won't
      have manufacturing.

1603
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:03,798
 We won't have to do all those
  extras and the supplements,

1604
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,766
      and the interviews,
     and the documentaries

1605
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:09,804
    and the paper labeling,
       and the shipping.

1606
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:13,508
 So you think about it, and it
   sounds like a great idea.

1607
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,477
But then, it kinda goes against
          what I like.

1608
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,212
   And, you know, collecting.

1609
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:20,481
 With Netflix, with torrenting,

1610
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,517
  it's hard to want to go out
       to a video store.

1611
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:23,985
         Like its hard
     for me at this point.

1612
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:26,220
I don't really go to the video store
as much as I'd like to anymore.

1613
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:29,457
     This is where we keep
    most of our video tapes.

1614
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:32,994
Sadly, I had to, the other day,
         move them all

1615
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:36,531
  to make room for Blu-Ray...
            boo ray.

1616
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:39,367
  If DVD was a short lifespan,

1617
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:42,036
   Blu-Ray's gonna be, like,
    gone before you know it.

1618
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:45,373
  Honestly the primary reason
   to keep something physical

1619
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,974
         is nostalgia.

1620
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:49,110
   We'll continue to put out
         physical media

1621
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:51,078
    until the plants close.

1622
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,948
  My 18, 19 year old students,

1623
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,250
         who love film,
   are passionate about film,

1624
01:15:56,252 --> 01:16:00,855
    seem to have no interest
 in having a video collection.

1625
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:03,758
       You can't begrudge
        this generation

1626
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,493
  not wanting to collect this,

1627
01:16:05,495 --> 01:16:07,228
  because it's too accessible.

1628
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,397
    It seems to be splitting
        down the middle,

1629
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:13,334
 to people who are going to go
    to the ends of the earth

1630
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:17,138
     to keep the old stuff,
         the old ways.

1631
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,340
  And then it's the other side
         that are just-

1632
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,309
        they don't want
       anything anymore.

1633
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:23,311
It's gotta be non-physical media

1634
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:25,546
       that they can keep
        on a hard drive

1635
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:27,648
or just have it streamed to 'em
      and forget about it.

1636
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:30,785
And then the other guys that are
    going to build a shrine.

1637
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:35,690
I have more than enough to keep
 me busy for 10,000 lifetimes.

1638
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:37,658
  Um, for future generations,

1639
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,293
      I don't give a fuck
      about those people.

1640
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,829
        I love streaming
       as a technology...

1641
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,598
 I'm gonna hang on to my DVDs,

1642
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,166
      I'm gonna hang on to
          my Blu-Rays.

1643
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:48,569
   Just as as much as I love
      iTunes and Spotify,

1644
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:50,838
 I still have a record player,
       because I like it.

1645
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,373
      [speaking Japanese]

1646
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,319
  People stopped buying video

1647
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,688
     as soon as the content
          was cheaper

1648
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,590
  and even easier to consume.

1649
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,692
   And then we found out that
     the masses don't care

1650
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:13,894
      about bonus features
      or optimum quality.

1651
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:15,296
 It's only the collector market
           that does.

1652
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:18,332
      Netflix Instant is a
     really important step

1653
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,401
 towards what the studios want.

1654
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:21,736
    And I think what you'll
        eventually do is

1655
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,472
       you'll have a pipe
  that comes into your house,

1656
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:27,708
   and you will subscribe to
 whichever libraries you want.

1657
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,311
        The MGM library,
  the Warner Brothers library,

1658
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,146
       the Sony library.

1659
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,049
   That's where we're headed,
    we're headed towards...

1660
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:38,552
     no money on their end,
  in terms of physical units.

1661
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:42,923
I mean, I imagine it's just all
 gonna be on access eventually.

1662
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,558
Well technically, it already is,

1663
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,360
     but people some people
     don't wanna admit it.

1664
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,895
      [speaking Japanese]

1665
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,631
 We're talking about VHS, but I
     only have video tapes

1666
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:26,267
  because that's the way that
     I can find that movie.

1667
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,136
      And if that came out
     in a different manner,

1668
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:32,506
like, if that was available on a
    DVD, or only on Blu-Ray,

1669
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:33,507
         I'd watch it.

1670
01:18:33,509 --> 01:18:36,110
     I mean now that I'm a
        film programmer,

1671
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:37,645
  I'm more aware there's films

1672
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,214
where the filmmaker doesn't have
      any other materials.

1673
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:44,685
 So essentially, until somebody
finds a negative, finds a print,

1674
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:47,822
  the best source in the world
           is a VHS.

1675
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,290
    Which is a little scary.

1676
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,159
   Video preservation is the
    nightmare in the closet

1677
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,861
 that no one is talking about.

1678
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,496
 Everybody likes to talk about
       film preservation.

1679
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,565
 Martin Scorsese is out there,
           you know,

1680
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,568
  proclaiming the love of film
         and all this,

1681
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,736
      but in actual fact,

1682
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,938
    everybody knows that in
     Scorsese's back closet

1683
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,640
    he's got a lot of videos
   that are just a hot mess.

1684
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:08,142
    I think that most people

1685
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:10,311
 that really started collecting
          in the 80's

1686
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:12,012
   are probably going to see,
           at least,

1687
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:14,648
two out of ten tapes begin now,

1688
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:19,487
   30 years on, 20 years on,
   to really not be playable.

1689
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:20,855
  And maybe that's one of the
            reasons

1690
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,490
  that nostalgia for video is

1691
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:24,325
         going to be so
      incredibly poignant,

1692
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:25,960
    I think, going forward,

1693
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:29,964
is that we're gonna have such a
great, great statistic of loss.

1694
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,099
         It seems like
      with each iteration

1695
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,135
    in home video technology

1696
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,103
 we lose a chunk of the library

1697
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,339
        of amazing films
      that are out there.

1698
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:40,608
       I don't understand
   how people can ignore VHS

1699
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:44,445
  because there's such a huge,
   huge percentage of movies

1700
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,247
      that never came out
         any other way.

1701
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:51,452
    So if you're even, like,
 a casual fan of movies at all,

1702
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:52,887
     you should have a VCR.

1703
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:54,955
     You should be actively
     watching stuff on VHS.

1704
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:58,125
     There are hundreds of
thousands of thousands of movies

1705
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,261
that never made the jump to DVD.

1706
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:03,197
    think that the fact that
     it never jumped to DVD

1707
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:06,400
  that they were poor quality
         to begin with.

1708
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,603
    No matter what genre of
   film you're interested in,

1709
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,573
  you're going to find things
      that are only on VHS

1710
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,008
 within that realm of interest.

1711
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,843
  So if you like silent film,

1712
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:18,879
     there's gonna be some
     obscure Russian short

1713
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:22,082
  that's only on some tape on
 a back shelf of a video store.

1714
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:24,185
   If you like 80's comedies,

1715
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:26,253
        there's gonna be
     hundreds and hundreds

1716
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,656
  of just the most ridiculous
           boner jams

1717
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:30,925
that you can only watch on tape.

1718
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:35,462
    To select what you love
       by it's format...

1719
01:20:35,464 --> 01:20:38,399
cuts you off from something that
       you might enjoy...

1720
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:40,734
 more than anything you've ever
   seen in your entire life.

1721
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:44,672
   I think that stuff is the-
stands outside of my objections.

1722
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:48,676
     That's very important
    that there is a document

1723
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:52,346
  of all those countless hours
         of rare stuff.

1724
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,850
   In any form whatsoever...
           even VHS.

1725
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:58,219
     When it struck us that
  other people could have fun

1726
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:00,421
        watching movies
    that were only on video,

1727
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:01,956
  we started Video Hate Squad.

1728
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,524
   And we had our first show,

1729
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:04,725
         and we got the
     whole audience there,

1730
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:06,393
   we have a VCR on the stage

1731
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:09,463
so we always put the tape in the
  VCR in front of the audience

1732
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:10,631
         so they're all
      part of that moment.

1733
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,666
     Even better than that,
  is that all over the world,

1734
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:14,101
 there's other people
that did the same thing

1735
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,069
       at the same time,

1736
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:16,270
  'cause there's this kind of
          a zeitgeist

1737
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:17,438
  where people are realizing,

1738
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,306
  "Hey, there's a lot of value
         in this stuff

1739
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:21,342
   that we've been ignoring."

1740
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,751
      I mean, for example,
   a movie like <i>Deadly Prey.</i>

1741
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:32,386
 I don't think anyone ever knew
       it even came out.

1742
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,221
    It was meant to be this
        fleeting thing.

1743
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,890
  Let's just fill these stores
         with content.

1744
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,192
We don't have to worry about
if there's theatrical releases or not.

1745
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,560
    What they didn't realize
       is that there were

1746
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,595
     so many works of art.

1747
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,166
            Grrrrrr!

1748
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:47,968
           Aaaaaaah!

1749
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,971
That's an incredible, incredible
film, and we played a VHS copy,

1750
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:54,541
   'cause it's not available
  on film or DVD or anything.

1751
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:55,876
        No other format.

1752
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,012
     We had Ted Prior come
  and we had a talk with him,

1753
01:21:58,014 --> 01:21:59,780
   and it was just incredible

1754
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,515
       to see this movie
    with a bunch of people,

1755
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,851
 and just realize no one knows
   what's gonna happen next,

1756
01:22:03,853 --> 01:22:05,653
       this is completely
         unpredictable.

1757
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,723
            [scream]

1758
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,494
 I knew that VHS collecting was
kind of becoming popular again,

1759
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,729
   <i>The House of the Devil,</i> you
gotta give a lot of due to that,

1760
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:18,565
 just the fact that a new movie
      was released on VHS,

1761
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:21,101
it started making me think about
  a lot other films like this.

1762
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,037
    You know I had a modest
        VHS collection,

1763
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,505
 but this kinda kick started it
         for me a lot.

1764
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:28,175
  "Okay, well, there's people
who have this kind of interest,

1765
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,210
        so let's market
       to them as well."

1766
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,446
         The revolution
       is still evolving.

1767
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:35,582
      Um, I think, I mean
  you're making a documentary

1768
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:36,717
  about video tapes right now.

1769
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,787
  I think that there's a huge
        VHS resurgence.

1770
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:42,990
 For example Mondo putting out
   all these new video tapes,

1771
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:45,793
        that are selling
   through hundreds of copies

1772
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,828
     in a two hour period.

1773
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,431
 Clearly there's still a market
   out there for video tapes.

1774
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:52,333
 The boom that's going on today
        with the tapes,

1775
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:55,102
      I'm going on 40 now,
 I'm seeing these tape prices,

1776
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,570
        going for $400.

1777
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:58,305
 It makes me regret getting rid
      of some of the stuff

1778
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,541
    that I had at one time,
           you know.

1779
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:03,043
   I could be putting my kids
 through college, I don't know.

1780
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:06,213
   When LP's had a resurgence
          in the 90's,

1781
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:08,315
 what was amazing about that is
    that it didn't go away.

1782
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,684
   Like, there's still stores
          that really

1783
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:13,253
  just exist to sell records.

1784
01:23:13,255 --> 01:23:16,423
  But, I don't think that VHS
        is going to have

1785
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,459
that same permanent resurgence.

1786
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:22,930
   We can make arguments for
     the quality of a vinyl

1787
01:23:22,932 --> 01:23:26,800
    and why that presents a
better experience of the music.

1788
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:29,937
But VHS, it's never going to be
      a better experience

1789
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:33,674
     of the raw materials,
          it's just...

1790
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:36,110
    the qualities associated
           around it.

1791
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:39,980
I think that there's a nostalgic
    need to sort of go back

1792
01:23:39,982 --> 01:23:41,682
     and also re-evaluate.

1793
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:43,017
         It was in 2006

1794
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,852
    when <i>History of Violence</i>
        <i>came out on VHS</i>

1795
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:46,387
       and kind of marked
     the end of everything.

1796
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:49,189
    That was the last widely
    distributed film on VHS.

1797
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,925
    My friend Zack called me
         and was like,

1798
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:55,829
   "Hey, we're thinking about
   getting some VHS tattoos,

1799
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,732
        'cause they just
      stopped making VHS."

1800
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,367
         And I'd never
      had a tattoo before

1801
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,236
    but it took me less than
    two seconds to be like,

1802
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,205
    "Yep, I'm with you guys.
 I'm gettin' that right there."

1803
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,041
      And we all got ours
     a little differently,

1804
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:08,776
      like some got, like
     "never forget" on it,

1805
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,045
       some got the year
   that it started and ended.

1806
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,981
       I just wanted just
     the video on it's own,

1807
01:24:13,983 --> 01:24:19,486
just like the cold- just the nice-
 It looks so strong and great.

1808
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,488
And people ask me all the time,
        they'll be like,

1809
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:23,290
  "What is that on your arm?"

1810
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,658
   I'll just show it to them
      and they'll be like,

1811
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:28,095
         and I'm like,
    "You forgot, obviously"

1812
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:30,030
         When you find
      some of these stores

1813
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:32,232
 that have big box video tapes,

1814
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,501
   you know they're gonna be
         mutant owners

1815
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:39,606
  who have been surrounded by
these relics for so many years.

1816
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:42,276
      And they are part of
        their life story

1817
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:46,447
     and I am slowly trying
     to drain them of them.

1818
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:48,482
    And like an archeologist
     every once in a while

1819
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:50,818
 you'd pull all these tapes out
    and at the very bottom,

1820
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,252
        covered in dust,
       I mean literally,

1821
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,054
    your hands would be just
      caked in this dust,

1822
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:57,724
      you pull out a video
       that's pure gold.

1823
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:00,227
    If I see a flea market,
          a swap meet,

1824
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,930
 an antique store, a Goodwill,

1825
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:04,932
      It's getting stopped
   and it's getting pillaged.

1826
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,900
      That entails looking
       in the phone book,

1827
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,202
    looking on the internet.

1828
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:11,772
 Literally driving up and down
every single street that I see.

1829
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:15,042
      I've driven probably
   a three hour drive radius

1830
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:17,111
        every direction.

1831
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:30,190
      And honestly I think

1832
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,960
    that is what the legacy
       of the VHS era is,

1833
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:36,163
        it's made us all
     much more film savvy.

1834
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:40,467
    It's kind of made people
     much more aware of...

1835
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,136
          other movies
   beyond the ones that were

1836
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,638
 fed by the richest companies.

1837
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,939
      [speaking Japanese]

1838
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:07,327
        The fact that it
        made accessible,

1839
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,229
 all these generations of films

1840
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,698
    which were utterly gone.
       I mean just gone.

1841
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,033
     No one could see them.

1842
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:15,502
      You know the studios
    kept them in the vaults,

1843
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,937
         sometimes they
   got rid of the negatives,

1844
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:18,639
          didn't think
      it mattered anymore.

1845
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,976
 You know, home video restored
   all that for us, you know,

1846
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,413
 and perhaps not always in the
     greatest looking form.

1847
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,515
   I mean perhaps not always
   the way we remembered it,

1848
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,917
     but it was accessible.

1849
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:32,219
     I don't think there's
      any lasting impact.

1850
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:35,255
     I think it's been just
       a passing parade.

1851
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:38,525
     It's like, what's the
    lasting impact of radio?

1852
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,327
        Right? ... Eh...

1853
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:42,896
   You know, it got us to the
  next step, the next step...

1854
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:44,565
         These are not
      just entertainment,

1855
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:51,305
and they're also indications of
what life was like, and is like,

1856
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:53,373
        and is possibly
    going to be like again.

1857
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:57,711
These movies, by being, in a way
   the record of our dreams,

1858
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:03,350
are a way to look at our culture
       and say, "Ahhh...

1859
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:08,589
  that's why that civilization
   ate itself spectacularly.

1860
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:11,058
       That's why it all
       fell apart. Hmm."

1861
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,360
      Or, "That's what it
        could have been,

1862
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:15,329
     that's where the dream
       could have gone."

1863
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:16,430
    When you look at a tape,

1864
01:27:16,432 --> 01:27:19,066
    and it has the "be kind,
    rewind" sticker, on it,

1865
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:21,435
    there's something deeply
       moving about that.

1866
01:27:21,437 --> 01:27:24,004
   It's such a call to arms,

1867
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:28,008
 and a suggestion or an imperative
about a way to live your life.

1868
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:30,444
     To be kind and rewind.

1869
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:31,945
       Go back and like,

1870
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:34,214
    hang on to these things
   that are important to you,

1871
01:27:34,216 --> 01:27:35,515
  and not let them disappear,

1872
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:37,684
    and not let other people
   take them a way from you.

1873
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:40,654
   But find what's important
       and preserve that

1874
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:42,756
     and help it to endure.
