1
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,633
COMOROS ISLANDS
East Africa, July 1983

2
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,070
(in Swahili) Omouri, what's happening?

3
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,154
(in Swahili) Which hand, Lorenzo?

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,956
(in Swahili) It's superb.

5
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,991
- It's yours.
- Then it's even better.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,397
- One orange.
- (class) One orange.

7
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,637
- Chungwa moja.
- (class) Chungwa moja.

8
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,797
- Two oranges.
- Two oranges.

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,515
- Machungwa mawili.
- Machungwa mawili.

10
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,189
- One pineapple.
- One pineapple.

11
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,832
(in Swahili) This is my mother.
All her sisters have red hair.

12
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,030
They call it "Murphy" hair.

13
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,872
This is Papa. He's Italian.
He wants to go home to Italy...

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,039
..because the tomatoes in America
taste like cardboard.

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,156
But the World Bank wants him
back in Washington.

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,271
(in Swahili) And what's this?

17
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,911
This one is me -
Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

18
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,235
But why paint all this on a kite?

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,796
So Omouri won't forget
what we were like.

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,070
What a lovely "goodbye" gift.

21
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,276
(Lorenzo) Omouri! Omouri!

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,756
(in Swahili) Guess which hand.

23
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,590
Omouri, get ready.

24
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,436
WASHINGTON DC

25
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,313
Here he is,
the cleverest boy in the world.

26
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,596
Three Months Later

27
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,837
- Hi, Mom.
- What's this?

28
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,315
- It's a picture.
- Oh, my goodness.

29
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,159
- And there's the Comoros.
- Of course it is.

30
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,352
- Mrs Odone, may I have a word?
- Very skilful, sweetheart.

31
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,199
- And Jupiter.
- Jupiter next to the Comoros?

32
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,392
- I'll be right there, Lorenzo.
- OK, Mommy.

33
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,274
- Is Lorenzo having problems at home?
- Not that I know of. Why?

34
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,110
Today he started throwing paints around.
He went wild, destroying other paintings.

35
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,357
- He must have been provoked.
- No, it came out of the blue.

36
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,835
He's normally such a terrific kid.

37
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,839
- Darling, were they teasing you?
- No.

38
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,428
- Were they touching your paints?
- No.

39
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,915
- How were they annoying you?
- They just were.

40
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,712
- Doing what?
- Things.

41
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,879
- What kind of things?
- Things that make me feel annoyed.

42
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,956
(bell rings)

43
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,793
- Mrs Odone...
- Another incident?

44
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,753
Yes, and today it was much worse.

45
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,190
Mrs Odone, is there
some trouble at home?

46
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,276
Why do you assume
the trouble's at home?

47
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,838
Because there's nothing here that
explains his behaviour. It's... disturbed.

48
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,916
(# Italian opera on radio)

49
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,396
(Lorenzo screaming indoors)

50
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,670
He does present as a hyperactive.

51
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,952
- But don't they repeat tasks endlessly?
- They perseverate, yes.

52
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,789
Lorenzo's activities all have a structure:
beginning, middle and end.

53
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,833
My gosh, he's learned three languages.
How could he be hyperactive?

54
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,429
I know it's hard to accept that
a gifted child may also be disturbed.

55
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,518
(woman) Lorenzo needs to be
referred to an IDP committee.

56
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,437
- What's that?
- For what?

57
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,199
Individual Disability Placement.

58
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,630
Lorenzo needs to be
in a special ed class.

59
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,548
Any special ed our son needs
will be provided at home.

60
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,389
Anyhow, it was snowing and he began
to rub my hands to warm them.

61
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,077
Uh-oh.

62
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,998
No, he then produced photos
of his wife and children.

63
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,873
- That old routine!
- Oh, Deirdre!

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,719
Had I known this was the man
I would wait ten years for,...

65
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,354
- ..I'd have let you pick up the cheque.
- I did.

66
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,436
Excuse me! You did not!

67
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,516
(guests continue chattering)

68
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,679
Lorenzo's fallen off his bike
and he is really bleeding.

69
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,519
Sh. That's a boy.

70
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,074
Oh, such a brave boy.

71
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,156
Doing just fine, here.

72
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,840
(Mr Odone) You're going to be OK.

73
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,837
It's Christmas Day, you know.

74
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,112
All across the country
little boys are trying out their new bikes.

75
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,474
Hey, champ. I think you'd better
tell your folks to lighten up.

76
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,637
What are they gonna do when
you're playing for the Redskins?

77
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,678
The EEG is normal, the skull x-ray
is normal and the CT scan is normal.

78
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,190
I don't know what to tell you.
This boy is neurologically intact.

79
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,198
Doctor, we spent
three years in East Africa.

80
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,788
- In the Comoros.
- We were wondering...

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,196
Well, if he might have
picked up some rare parasite.

82
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,911
It's possible.

83
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,636
(sudden loud classical music)

84
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,676
Lorenzo, what are you doing?

85
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,236
Lorenzo!

86
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,908
Sweetie? Can you hear Mommy?

87
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,476
This may be an auditory
processing difficulty.

88
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,515
The ears hear all right,
but the brain has trouble listening.

89
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,553
So, this means something
is affecting his brain.

90
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,116
But what? A tumour? Multiple sclerosis?

91
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,276
It could be any one of a dozen things.

92
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,113
WASHINGTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

93
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,196
Easter Weekend 1984

94
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,036
Listen, my friend. I'd like you to come
and stay in the hospital for three days.

95
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,991
Your mom and dad can come too.

96
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,032
We're gonna run some tests
and get to the bottom of this.

97
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,351
Can you hear the sound?

98
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,554
Keep your eyes right on that spot
for me. That helps me out.

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,711
All right. Now close your eyes.

100
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,196
Keep your eyes closed, buddy.
Stay nice and still.

101
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,236
(choir singing hymn)

102
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,037
Of course, Easter festivals
existed long before baby Jesus.

103
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,152
In pagan times, they marked
the beginning of Spring.

104
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,229
The egg tells us that the earth is going
to be reborn, just like a little baby chick.

105
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,999
- I get it.
- Mrs Odone. Mr Odone.

106
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,470
Dr Judalon is ready now.

107
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,149
Hey, Lorenzo, would you like
to go feed the goldfish?

108
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,836
It's all right, sweetheart. Go ahead.

109
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,794
We'll be right back
in just a few minutes. Go ahead.

110
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,876
This way, please.

111
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,796
Please, have a seat.

112
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,916
(air conditioning rattles)

113
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,791
Well, we certainly don't need
that noise, do we?

114
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,750
So...

115
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,556
Please, Doctor, without equivocation.

116
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,036
There is a family of diseases.
It's quite rare.

117
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,435
The leukodystrophies.

118
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,711
Lorenzo has one of them.
It's called ALD.

119
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,355
ALD is an inborn error of metabolism
that causes a degeneration of the brain.

120
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,037
It only affects males, usually
between the ages of five and ten.

121
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,839
Its progress is relentless.
The end is inevitable.

122
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,357
All boys with ALD die, usually
within two years of diagnosis.

123
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,910
And there are no exceptions?

124
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,996
I am so sorry.

125
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,435
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.

126
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,795
Lorenzo shows the definitive sign:

127
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,870
..an abnormally high level of fat in his
blood, certain long-chain saturated fats.

128
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,392
Oh.

129
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,512
Uh...

130
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,516
These fats... destroy his brain?

131
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,716
But how?

132
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,518
There is an enzyme
that should metabolise these fats,...

133
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,790
..but in ALD boys it's defective.

134
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,597
So they collect in the nerve cells,
a little bit like a cluster on the arteries.

135
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,508
And... in some way...

136
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,432
..this liquefies
the white matter of the brain.

137
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,075
"Some way liquefies"?
Could you be more specific?

138
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,352
Well, to be honest, we're not
quite certain just how it works.

139
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,875
- You know what myelin is?
- No.

140
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,634
Myelin is the fatty... sheath
that insulates the nerves.

141
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,991
It's a little bit like plastic
around electrical wires.

142
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,510
Without it, the nerves
cannot conduct an impulse.

143
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,589
What ALD does is strip away the myelin.
It corrodes it, if you like.

144
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,271
This causes degeneration of the brain
and the body loses its functions.

145
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,869
But surely someone, somewhere,
must be working on this, no?

146
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,150
- We would go anywhere.
- Yes.

147
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,633
Ten years ago the disease
hadn't even been identified.

148
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,196
We're still trying to
understand just what it is.

149
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,635
I would like to
offer you some hope, but...

150
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,077
Then there's absolutely no treatment?

151
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,318
Normally at this point
we try to be constructive.

152
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,477
We try to focus on what can be done.

153
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,556
But in this case...

154
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,878
When we get home, can we read a story?

155
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,956
Of course, my darling.

156
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
Lorenzino, let's go home.

157
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,716
(sobs)

158
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,958
(phone rings)

159
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,548
(woman) Mr Odone? I have
a Dr Judalon on line three.

160
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,956
- Good. Put him through.
- They're waiting for you in the meeting.

161
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,832
All right, thank you.

162
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,188
- Hello?
- Augusto?

163
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,754
I just got off the phone to Gus Nikolais,...

164
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,156
..a professor of neurology at
the Institute of Childhood Diseases.

165
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,469
If there is a so-called "world expert"
on the leukodystrophies, Nikolais is it.

166
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,875
- Ah, good.
- I don't want to raise false hopes,...

167
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,516
..but he's working on
an experimental protocol based on a diet.

168
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,073
Wonderful.

169
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,910
(Lorenzo breathes with difficulty)

170
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,911
Peanut butter, red meat, cheese...

171
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,589
Unpeeled fruit, spinach, olive oil...
But these are healthy foods.

172
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,713
Yes, but they contain
very long- chain saturated fats.

173
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,754
I...

174
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,476
I still do not understand why
they are so harmful to Lorenzo.

175
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,354
- Why are they so destructive?
- How can spinach make the difference?

176
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,871
The human body needs these fats
in order to create cells,...

177
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,675
..and the excess is burned off.
That's normally, of course.

178
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,759
But in the case of an ALD boy,
these saturates can't be broken down...

179
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,836
..and they build up in the brain.

180
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,193
And somehow this build-up
strips the myelin covering.

181
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,312
Yes, exactly. And, for the moment,
we don't know why this is.

182
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,399
But we feel that, by withdrawing
the saturated fats from the diet,...

183
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,909
..we will prevent them
accumulating in the brain.

184
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,473
And if we could?

185
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,433
There's no way to reverse
neurological damage.

186
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,519
All we can hope for is
to slow the cascade of symptoms.

187
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,791
But if it's any consolation to you,
you'll be helping us...

188
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,072
..understand the biochemistry
of this heartless disease.

189
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,636
So, can we enrol Lorenzo in our trial?

190
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,796
I suppose so.

191
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,476
Good. Then I will pass you
over to our dietician...

192
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,196
..and meanwhile we should arrange
some genetic counselling.

193
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,915
Oh, Dr Nikolais, it's highly unlikely
that we will have another child.

194
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,237
No, but your sisters and their daughters
may all be carriers.

195
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,670
- We need to test them.
- Only my family? What about his?

196
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,112
No, no. ALD is passed
only through the mother.

197
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,156
But I thought you understood all this.

198
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,229
We knew it was inborn, but...

199
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,230
..we assumed that meant
a combination of our genes.

200
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,715
That's true in other inherited diseases,...

201
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,274
..but ALD is only carried
on the female chromosome.

202
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,356
Excuse me.

203
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,672
Are you saying that Lorenzo
got this directly from me?

204
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,112
Well, in the sense that
ALD is sex-linked, yes.

205
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,430
It goes from mother to son.

206
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,317
- And how did I get it?
- The woman gets it from her mother.

207
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,637
And if I inherited the defect,
why don't I have the disease?

208
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,116
No, the woman is only
the carrier, nothing else.

209
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,754
But with each conception, she has
a 50- 50 chance of passing on the defect.

210
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,474
And when that happens...

211
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,751
It's the cruellest kind of genetic lottery.

212
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,317
- Lottery?
- Yes, a clumsy word.

213
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,399
I use it because it's...
so arbitrary, you know.

214
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,670
- No one is to blame.
- Um...

215
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,472
If Michaela's mother had this,...

216
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,955
..and her mother's mother,...

217
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,871
..why was there no warning?

218
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,710
Well, I suppose if you went back
into the family tree, you'd...

219
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,994
But remember, a short time ago
this disease didn't even have a name.

220
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,313
Mrs Odone, you have enough
to put up with without...

221
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,795
You have nothing to blame yourself for.

222
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,556
Thank you.

223
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,079
(Deirdre) It's not a good idea.

224
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,955
All right, so she doesn't want me. What
about Mother? She's packed and ready.

225
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,152
Kenise, Michaela doesn't
want anybody around.

226
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,510
What about Father Killian? He can come.

227
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,870
Hell, no. She's not even
going to Mass now.

228
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,878
- Deirdre, what is happening there?
- Just let it rest, OK?

229
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,275
No. What will they do
for Lorenzo's birthday?

230
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,675
- I'll call you. Bye.
- No. Deirdre!

231
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,275
This is wrong. More than ever
she needs her family here.

232
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,960
She doesn't want nobody.
She's too angry.

233
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,116
We cannot afford the time to be angry.

234
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,356
Come on, look what she's dealing with.

235
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,436
She does not have to deal with it alone.

236
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,509
She feels incredibly alone and unlucky,
like she's been singled out by God.

237
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,598
- Oh, Deirdre!
- Yes! Kenise is a carrier with two girls.

238
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,952
Me, a carrier with no kids at all, and
Mariah has a boy but she's not a carrier.

239
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,116
So only Michaela gets this laid on her.

240
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,314
- This did not happen only to Michaela.
- Sure. You got two kids already, Odone.

241
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,556
Mommy will make you something better:

242
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,036
..a big-boy fruit treat
with five different colours.

243
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,795
She waited all this time to have one
child. She's not gonna have another.

244
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,756
May 29th 1984

245
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,030
Lorenzo's Sixth Birthday

246
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,276
(knock on door)

247
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,998
Francesco! Cristina!

248
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,870
- Ah, buongiorno.
- Oh, Francesco!

249
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,309
(in Italian) Mother sends her regards.

250
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,756
(in Italian) This is for Lorenzo.
We missed you so much.

251
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,678
Francesco and I couldn't wait
to see you again.

252
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,075
Papa, how is Lorenzo?

253
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,760
(in Italian) Today he's OK. Thank God.

254
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,634
Now listen...
Michaela is in a lot of pain.

255
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,955
She may be cold towards you.

256
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,914
(in Italian) Look at the two of you.
More handsome each time I see you.

257
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,155
- Cristina.
- Michaela.

258
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,236
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

259
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,395
Ciao.

260
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,432
Fancy coming all this way
for our Lorenzo. Thank you.

261
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,949
- It's lovely to be here.
- Come with me.

262
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,593
- How is everything?
- Fine.

263
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,676
It's lovely here.

264
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,117
Everyone, this is Lorenzo's sister
and brother, all the way from Rome.

265
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,436
This does not make sense.

266
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,354
Lorenzo's saturated fats have risen.

267
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,429
We eliminate them from his diet,
and in his blood they increase.

268
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,712
If these very long-chain saturated fats
are destroying his mind,...

269
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,274
..then surely we should
take him off the diet.

270
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,630
(Nikolais) Mr Odone, please be patient.

271
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,390
Your son has been on the diet only six
weeks. Wait until the end of the trial.

272
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,150
Dr Nikolais, what about the other boys?
What results are you seeing in them?

273
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,033
As with Lorenzo, it's too early to tell.

274
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,630
We need the study to run
for the full six months.

275
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,069
That will tell you what
is obvious right now,...

276
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,671
..that avoiding apple skins and pizza
has no effect on this brutal disease.

277
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,955
Now, please, Doctor, is there anyone out
there who is chasing a definitive therapy?

278
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,633
You judge us too hastily. The French
have tried bone-marrow transplants,...

279
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,230
..and in Boston we're about
to try immunosuppression.

280
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,194
- Why haven't we heard of these before?
- The transplants were disastrous...

281
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,278
..and the immunosuppression
is highly experimental.

282
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,789
The protocol has been limited
to six boys,...

283
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,196
..all more profoundly
afflicted than your son.

284
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,835
For God's sake! How afflicted
does he need to be?

285
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,997
It's a school, Lorenzo,
like any other school.

286
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,069
- And it's full of doctors?
- Yes. Some of the cleverest in America.

287
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,750
- What colour is that cross?
- Red.

288
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,756
That's right. It's red.

289
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,238
I'll speak to your parents for a second.
Leah's gonna take your blood pressure.

290
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,316
I'll be right back.

291
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,000
(Leah) I'll just put this around your arm.

292
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,833
You've had this done before, haven't you?

293
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,274
Look, it's important you both
know exactly what's going on.

294
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,358
Cyclophosphides are no picnic.
This is chemotherapy.

295
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,519
We're gonna be suppressing
his immune system. It's very high-risk.

296
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,110
We'll need to keep him here
at least three weeks.

297
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,676
Now, Lorenzo is still walking,
talking and communicating.

298
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,950
But that could all change.

299
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,039
Now, knowing all this, do you
still want us to go ahead with it?

300
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,350
Given the alternatives, yes.

301
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,036
One Month Later

302
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,514
The faculty is very grateful
to Lorenzo for doing this.

303
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,111
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lorenzo
Odone, whom I've spoken to you about.

304
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,198
Now, young Mr Odone,
you need to come with me.

305
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,036
You are getting so big!

306
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,595
Now, I'm gonna put you up here
so we can all see you, OK?

307
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,153
Attaboy.

308
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,600
Ten weeks after diagnosis
we observe hemianopia...

309
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,915
..with transient horizontal nystagmus.

310
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,474
The pupillary light reflexes
are still intact,...

311
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,477
..and, as yet, there's no optic atrophy.

312
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,036
However, there is evidence of
early occipital- lobe involvement.

313
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,517
(drawn-out) Why are all
these people here?

314
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,272
- I beg your pardon, Lorenzo?
- Why are all these people here?

315
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,960
He asks why all these people are here.

316
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,237
Well, they're all doctors...

317
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,318
..and they want to learn
how to help other boys in the future.

318
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,829
Other boys with the boo-boo?

319
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,437
- Yes, darling.
- Mm-hm.

320
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,956
Thank you, Lorenzo.

321
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,670
Now, in the scanning speech,
we look for both ends of the pathology:

322
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,952
..centrally for the dysphasia,
and peripherally for the dysarthria.

323
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,317
Now, Lorenzo, would you
walk for me, please?

324
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,472
Attaboy.

325
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,240
That's right. Hold my hands.

326
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,316
That's right.

327
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,231
Two months ago there was simply motor
lag. Now note the characteristic gait.

328
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,912
It's due mostly to hyperreflexia, but
exacerbated by the encroaching paresis.

329
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,711
You're doing very well. Keep coming.

330
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,391
Only if you stop talking like that.

331
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,158
Hello, Mr Odone. Have I got that right?

332
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,919
- (on phone) Odo-ne.
- Odo-ne? I'm sorry.

333
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,759
Ellard Muscatine.
I'm with the ALD Foundation.

334
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,032
We heard about your boy Lorenzo,
and we'd like to offer you some help.

335
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,957
You're a doctor?

336
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,949
Doctor? Heck, no. I'm a machinist from
Allequippa, PA, but I'm an ALD parent.

337
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,438
This is my second time around, so I know
exactly what you're going through.

338
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,075
My wife Loretta and I,
we run the foundation.

339
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,192
We organise counselling,
conduct seminars, fund research.

340
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,709
We have 500 member families,
not only American,...

341
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,879
..but from Portugal,
Israel, Japan, Australia...

342
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,719
And we're growing all the time.

343
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,674
We wanted you and Mrs Odone
to know that you're not alone.

344
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,438
ALD FAMILY CONFERENCE
July 1984

345
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,438
Hi. Ellard Muscatine.
Welcome to the conference.

346
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,869
- Augusto Odone.
- Michaela.

347
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,753
Oh, very nice to meet you.
Please come in.

348
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,713
This is my wife Loretta,
and these are the Odones.

349
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,400
Great. I'm so happy
you were able to come.

350
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,671
Because I think a lot of it is denial.

351
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,839
We don't want to say anything's going
on. We're strong and we can handle it.

352
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,439
But this is the place and
this is the time to let it all out,...

353
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,630
..let the barriers come down...

354
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,877
..and to share your feelings
and get it off your chest.

355
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,549
It's hard to believe that
things can get worse.

356
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,236
But they will.

357
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,313
One thing nobody wants to
talk about is what happens,...

358
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,273
..or does not happen, between
the two of you in the bedroom.

359
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,436
A whole year
we couldn't touch each other.

360
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,516
My husband stood by me all the way
but, oh my, does it test the men!

361
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,677
- And the weak ones just up and go.
- Even the strong ones leave.

362
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,157
My guy hung in there when our first boy
took sick. Then we had little Jake tested.

363
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,477
Arlen wanted a whole bunch of boys,
a whole ball team.

364
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,036
He's gonna have 'em too...
with some other gal.

365
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,396
(Loretta) We'd like to thank the parents...

366
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,399
..who gave so generously to the fund
for the immunosuppression trial.

367
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,751
The doctors have said that
this experiment contributed greatly...

368
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,269
..to the understanding of ALD.

369
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,598
Betty and Tom Knowles,
$250 in memory of Corey.

370
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,633
Dr and Mrs Liebowitz,
$500 in memory of Joel.

371
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,550
Mr and Mrs Higgins,
$1,000 in memory of Adrian and Julian.

372
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,468
26 people have sent in
recipes for the newsletter.

373
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,070
Now, we still need ideas for
snack foods and breakfast treats.

374
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,033
Remember, all recipes should be
low-fat...

375
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,152
..and use only the foods
allowed on the institute diet.

376
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,350
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am?

377
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,550
Our son has complied with this diet,...

378
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,595
..but his levels of saturated C24 and
C26 have risen for two months in a row.

379
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,995
That's exactly what's happened to Jaybird.

380
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,829
Ah, well, perhaps before we talk
about publishing cookbooks,...

381
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,750
..we should ask ourselves
if the diet is working at all.

382
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,120
- Shouldn't we?
- Damn right we should.

383
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,196
This is not the way we do things here.

384
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,030
But there are two families here
with this paradox. Maybe there are more.

385
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,151
Shouldn't we open it for discussion?

386
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,590
- My boy's levels are rising.
- Now there are three families.

387
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,349
So maybe we should...
Could we have a show of hands?

388
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,675
Then we'll see how many
families there are.

389
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,918
You don't understand. This is a formal
pilot study. It has to run for six months.

390
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,838
We're not scientists.
We don't interpret experiments.

391
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,679
That's the solemn
responsibility of the doctors.

392
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,075
Come on, Ellard!
Let's have a show of hands.

393
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,156
No, that would be misleading.

394
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,431
The medical folks call
this kind of evidence anecdotal.

395
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,836
- What's wrong with a show of hands?
- It wouldn't have any meaning.

396
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,599
- Excuse me. May I say something?
- Sure.

397
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,919
The only way that the doctors can get
useful results is with a strict protocol...

398
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,679
..and statistical samples
in a control group.

399
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,439
And a proper time frame.
Doctors have to be careful.

400
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,677
Clinical trials must withstand
a tremendous amount of scrutiny.

401
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,394
This is the way that
medical science works.

402
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,035
That's the only way the scientists
can get the information they need.

403
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,076
So what you're saying is that our children
are in the service of medical science.

404
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,156
How foolish of me. I always assumed...

405
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,989
..that medical science
was in the service of the sufferers.

406
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,076
Yes. Uh, thank you.

407
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,394
Uh, now I think it's time
we get back to our agenda.

408
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,992
Why? So we can discuss further salvaging
our marriages and managing our grief?

409
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,557
What about the children?
No one here is discussing the children.

410
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,955
Thank you.

411
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,392
Now if Mary has nothing further to add,
I would like to introduce Dr Chapel...

412
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,273
..to talk about the nasogastric tube
and suction machine.

413
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,710
Would you all join me
in giving him a very warm welcome?

414
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,796
(applause)

415
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,434
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Ellard. Ladies and gentlemen...

416
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,516
August 1984

417
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,276
(# classical music)

418
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,198
- (Lorenzo) Now hold my hand.
- Yes, sweetie.

419
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,436
- Now the story.
- What story is that, sweetheart?

420
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,717
La notte di San Lorenzo.

421
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,558
San Lorenzo, who is...?

422
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,830
(drawls) My patron saint.

423
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,032
And saint of my father's village.

424
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,799
That's right. And what happened to him?

425
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,275
He was in Rome.

426
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,356
Mm-hm.

427
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,714
And... I forgot.

428
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,309
Well, many years ago...

429
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,833
..the bad guy says to him
"Bring us the riches of your church."

430
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,710
And Lorenzo, he brings them
the beggars and the sick people...

431
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,668
- ..and he says...
- (drawls) "These are our riches."

432
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,153
Yes!

433
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,796
- Bravo, Lorenzo, bravo.
- That's wonderful, sweetheart. So clever.

434
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,559
And tonight, August 10th, is...

435
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,836
La notte di San Lorenzo.

436
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,715
(Michaela) The night
of the shooting stars.

437
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,195
(Augusto) When anything can happen.

438
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,119
Micha...

439
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,196
Sh, sh, sh.

440
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,199
When we first went to the Comoros,
what did we do?

441
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,399
- We got to know the country, right?
- Yes.

442
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,752
We studied. We got to know
the language, resources, its laws.

443
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,836
We studied, right?

444
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,673
We should treat Lorenzo's illness
like another country.

445
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,633
- I don't quite see the analogy.
- All right, all right.

446
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,433
- ALD has many dimensions, right?
- Yes.

447
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,351
So in order to understand it, we need
a command of genetics, biochemistry,...

448
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,552
..microbiology, neurology, ology-ology...

449
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,194
Augusto, we don't have time
to go to medical school.

450
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,359
Michaela, the doctors are in the dark.
They're groping in the dark.

451
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,790
They've got Lorenzo
on a turvy-topsy diet.

452
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,948
And that bloody immunosuppression
is brutal and useless.

453
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,835
Michaela, we should not have
consigned him blindly into their hands.

454
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,917
He should not suffer by our ignorance.

455
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,192
We take responsibility.
So... we read a little.

456
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,680
And we go out and inform ourselves.

457
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,631
But... to miss time with him
while he can still speak to us...

458
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,912
Yes, I know, I know.
But he expects it of us.

459
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,396
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
Bethesda

460
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,636
September 1984
Five Months After Diagnosis

461
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,834
I want to take Lorenzo off the diet.

462
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,475
He's been eating cardboard for 19 weeks,
and what's it getting us?

463
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,878
- And feed him what?
- Normal foods. Things a child likes.

464
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,117
Full of the long-chain fats
that we know destroy his myelin?

465
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,028
Look. On the diet,
his blood fats are still rising.

466
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,674
- Yes, I know, Michaela.
- It doesn't make any sense.

467
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,758
But we don't know enough.
We don't know enough.

468
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,110
We don't know it clearly enough.

469
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,435
Here, Michaela,
let me show you something.

470
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,516
All right, here.

471
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,556
Un piccolo acquaio.

472
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,275
- A kitchen sink?
- Yes, yes. Little kitchen sink.

473
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,597
All right. Now here is the tap. Mm-hm?

474
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,598
And here's the sink basin
and the plughole, right?

475
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,238
All right. Very long-chain saturated fats
are introduced by what we eat, right?

476
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,874
- Yes?
- Now, also produced by the body...

477
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,515
..or manufactured by the body,
these very same fats.

478
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,234
- Biosynthesis.
- Biosynthesis, right.

479
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,510
Now, normally they are not harmful...

480
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,236
..because this enzyme
eliminate the excess, right?

481
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,311
But in Lorenzo, this enzyme
is defective from genetics.

482
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,477
His plughole is blocked, right?

483
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,635
Yes.

484
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,072
We know that very long-chain saturated
fats are made up of carbon atoms.

485
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,272
C2, 4, 6, 8...
all the way up the chain, right?

486
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,355
But in Lorenzo,
the saturated C24 and C26...

487
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,756
..rise to four times the normal level.

488
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,549
OK, now, here's where we have
a little paradox, a mystery, OK?

489
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,709
Why, when we reduce the dietary intake
of saturated fats,...

490
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,789
..does the level in our sink, which
we would expect to go down, go up?

491
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,035
So, logically, we should
take him off the diet.

492
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,310
Well, Michaela,...

493
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,318
..just as logically, we should not.

494
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,829
Because let's not do
what the doctors did.

495
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,633
Let's not act without knowing why.

496
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,635
Why, when we turn off this tap,
does the level in our sink rise?

497
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,918
I married a plumber.

498
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,750
You married a man with a simple mind,
who asks simple questions, that's all.

499
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,916
Here, Michaela. Brain food.

500
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,270
- Come on.
- Oh. Thank you.

501
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,236
October 1984

502
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,799
Polish rats! I think I have
an explanation for the paradox.

503
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,275
Lorenzo, kiss your clever mother.

504
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,392
Polish rats with a fatty-acid storage
disease. Let me use your kitchen sink.

505
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,871
Here's our tap for what we eat.

506
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,155
And here's our tap for biosynthesis.

507
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,430
I see. Biosynthesis. Mm-hm.

508
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,077
When the rats were deprived
of a specific fat in their diet,...

509
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,988
..their body cells compensated
by overproducing it.

510
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,317
- So if this holds true for humans...
- Then the diet is useless...

511
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,399
..unless we can stop it overproducing,
slow down biosynthesis, s ì?

512
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,877
Yes, and there's more. And for this,
I deserve two kisses, my darling.

513
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,189
In the summary, it talks about
the concept of fatty-acid manipulation.

514
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,151
- What's that?
- Well,...

515
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,034
..they stop the rats
producing one kind of fat...

516
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,749
..by loading their diet with another kind.

517
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,590
So maybe we could stop Lorenzo's body
from producing C24 and C26...

518
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,872
..by loading his diet with another kind
of fat, one that's less harmful.

519
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,753
We should have this translated
as soon as possible.

520
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,838
I have some news too.

521
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,076
It's a letter from Omouri.

522
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,317
He wouldn't open it until you got home.

523
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,795
- Omouri.
- Yes.

524
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,516
Michaela, by tomorrow morning,...

525
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,599
..your Polish rats will be
speaking to us in English. Hm?

526
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,276
(Michaela) I've been thinking.

527
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,313
I found that article by accident.
I just as easily could have missed it.

528
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,991
It was written by a Polish biochemist,
who I'm sure knew nothing about ALD.

529
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,075
Well, Michaela, still it gives us
a new line of inquiry.

530
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,031
Yes, but it could take months.

531
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,948
And there will be other leads that take
more time, and it's time we don't have.

532
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:49,553
All these experts, working in isolation,
each one on his own piece of the jigsaw.

533
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,110
Of course, a symposium is the best way
to accelerate the exchange of information.

534
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,232
In that sense,
it's a very good idea, Mr Odone.

535
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,510
Only... May I say something?

536
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,718
Have you any idea how many children
in the United States die every year...

537
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,673
..from choking on French fries?

538
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,078
Many more than from
adrenoleukodystrophy.

539
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,589
Ours is what is known as
an orphan disease.

540
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,508
It's too small to be noticed,
too small to be funded,...

541
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,076
..especially with the iron hand
of Reaganomics.

542
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,399
So while, as I say, this remains a very
good idea, it's a luxury we can't afford.

543
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,718
Well, we appreciate that,
so we have prepared a budget...

544
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,149
..based on 40 participants for two days.

545
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,478
We think it can be done for $35,000.
My wife and I will raise the money.

546
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,797
- We can't ask you to bear the cost.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

547
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,434
That's the least of our concern.

548
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,632
And of course, your institute
will not be at risk...

549
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,311
..because the Odones
will underwrite any shortfall.

550
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,235
And we took the liberty
of drafting an invitation list.

551
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,796
Forgive me, Dr Nikolais.
We wish to make two conditions.

552
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,072
We would like the symposium
to emphasise therapy,...

553
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,149
..and Michaela and myself would like
to participate in the discussion.

554
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,239
Martha, I'm afraid we'll have to
add to your workload,...

555
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,079
..but it's in a very good cause.

556
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,273
We've decided to convene
the first symposium on ALD.

557
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,959
We should notify the Muscatines.

558
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,516
Of course. The foundation could
help with the arrangement.

559
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,918
They could even, perhaps...
find some funds.

560
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,838
How about we hook it to the back of
the next Foundation Family Conference?

561
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,952
- (Michaela) When would that be?
- Next summer. 4th of July.

562
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,913
- That's nine months away!
- It will take us all that time...

563
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,634
..to invite those busy doctors
and raise the money.

564
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,911
- I don't think so.
- What's your time frame, Mrs Odone?

565
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,271
- Five weeks from now. November 10th.
- That's not possible.

566
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,038
Oh, I think it is.

567
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,230
Pardon me,
but what is the point of rushing?

568
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,593
As ALD parents, we both know
the answer to that inane question.

569
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,757
If you want this to happen,
you're going about it the wrong way.

570
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,633
- At least we are going about it.
- (Lorenzo drawls)

571
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,558
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- He wants his diaper changed.

572
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,831
- (dialling tone)
- Mrs Muscatine, look... Hello?

573
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,637
Hello?

574
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,638
They should be hung by their eyelashes.

575
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,149
- They won't help?
- It doesn't look that way.

576
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,236
- Good boy. I'll take him.
- No, I got it.

577
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,158
- What'll you do? Mortgage the house?
- Not until I have to.

578
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,713
Michaela!

579
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,316
I've spent two months pulling
on the heartstrings of Washington...

580
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,877
..to raise money for multiple sclerosis,
sudden infant death and cystic fibrosis.

581
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,150
Then why exclude adrenoleukodystrophy?

582
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,193
Because I also cover politics,
the arts, women's issues and stuff,...

583
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,959
..and my readership likes
to have a little balance.

584
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,631
I cannot do another medical story
right now. Maybe in another month.

585
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,920
Joyce, I think you should meet my son.

586
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,236
My friends...

587
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,389
This is so generous.

588
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,308
You know, Augusto, our wives
are eager to form a committee...

589
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,035
- ..to, perhaps, help with hospitality.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

590
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,315
Not only will we be saving money,
but they'll be extremely well fed.

591
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,274
For breakfast, French pastry, correct?
Lunch, UN finger food.

592
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,392
- (knock on door)
- The British will do afternoon tea.

593
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,956
And for dinner, I know
a marvellous Italian cook.

594
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,998
Are you needin' another pair of hands?
I'll lick envelopes, serve coffee, whatever.

595
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,749
And this is for your boy. I grow
the best organic produce in Virginia.

596
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,599
- Thank you.
- You don't remember me!

597
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,838
Wendy Gimble. Foundation Family
Conference. I yelled louder than you.

598
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,193
- Yes, of course. You have two boys.
- We lost Jaybird, but Jake here is fine.

599
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,311
We think what you're doing is fantastic.

600
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,590
Hello, Jake. Come on in. Thank you.

601
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,555
When I read about what you were doing,
I thought "It's time we did something."

602
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,309
- Please, come in and meet the others.
- Is that Lorenzo?

603
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,479
Yes. Lorenzo, this is Jake.
He's a young man of your age.

604
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,196
Look, Lorenzo, a great big pumpkin.
Let's go down and feel how big it is.

605
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,880
(Lorenzo drawls)

606
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,749
- What, sweetheart?
- (drawls)

607
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,192
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
Let's try that again.

608
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,278
(drawls, shouting)

609
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,948
This morning I could still understand him.

610
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,675
(man) When we can clone the ALD gene,
we can identify the deficient enzyme,...

611
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,031
..mass-produce the gene,
implant it into ALD sufferers...

612
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,119
- ..and normalise their metabolism.
- (Augusto) How long would that take?

613
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,956
FIRST INTERNATIONAL ALD SYMPOSIUM
November 10th 1984

614
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,752
Seven to ten years.

615
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,633
You see, science has its own time,...

616
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,150
..and, very often, any new advance
can be a matter of serendipity.

617
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,909
(Nikolais) For the last six months, all
our ALD boys have been on a regimen...

618
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,079
..which excludes saturated C24 and 26.

619
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,638
But despite this restriction in the diet,...

620
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,799
..these long-chain fatty acids
have remained the same,...

621
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,673
..in some cases even increasing.

622
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,599
Now, this compensating increase
I put down to biosynthesis.

623
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,917
But, Gus, if you could maintain the diet...

624
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,555
..and somehow inhibit biosynthesis,
you'd have a therapy.

625
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,035
No, you wouldn't quite have a therapy.

626
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,073
You would have a way of
lowering the fatty acids to normal.

627
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,156
(speaks Japanese)

628
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,990
If you wish to inhibit biosynthesis,...

629
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,635
..have you considered
fatty-acid manipulation?

630
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,558
(speaks Japanese)

631
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,589
There is some literature,
a rat study, Russian or Polish.

632
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,439
(Michaela) Polish. Straszak.
I have copies right here.

633
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,633
Polish Journal of Biological Sciences
1979, Volume I I.

634
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,833
They loaded the diet with one fat
and decreased biosynthesis of another.

635
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,793
Yes, I remember this article.

636
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,789
And also in Canada, they have seen
the same thing in miniature swine.

637
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,071
(man) As a matter of fact,
I've seen it in human cells.

638
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,156
In human ALD cells.

639
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,831
From patients with ALD,
I took fibroblasts - skin cells, OK?

640
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,076
Each one carries the same genetic defect.

641
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,830
I incubated them with oleic acid and
reduced the saturated C24 and C26...

642
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,428
- ..by more than 50 per cent.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

643
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,154
You said oleic acid?

644
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,757
Yes, monounsaturated C18,
the main component of olive oil.

645
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,077
- Surely this is the basis for a therapy.
- (man) Slow down.

646
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,113
These are studies in cultured cells. We
don't know it'll work in a human being.

647
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,153
Well, then, take the olive oil
and try it in a patient and see...

648
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,910
Augusto, olive oil is forbidden
in the diet: C24, C26.

649
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,715
Yes, but then use whatever
Dr Rizzo fed his fibroblast.

650
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:01,709
Pure oleic acid would be very toxic to
an intact organism, an animal or human.

651
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,470
It would need to be the triglyceride form,
which is edible, but that's not available.

652
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,116
All right, can't you take ordinary
olive oil and extract the C24 and C26?

653
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,995
You could, but it's a very complicated
procedure and would be very expensive,...

654
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,237
..especially to produce the quantities
for a clinical trial.

655
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,476
Have you contacted chemical companies?

656
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,556
No one will tool up for that.

657
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,037
Not for an experiment,
not for something with no market.

658
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,515
- Then you haven't tried?
- No.

659
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:40,434
If we were able to get triglyceride,
then we can change all that, right?

660
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,358
Yes. It has to be triglyceride
to be edible.

661
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,471
(Michaela) Edible form. Triglyceride.

662
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,511
(man on phone)
No one here can help you.

663
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,949
Then do you know anyone else who does?

664
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,196
I'll send you back to the switchboard.

665
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,313
- (telephonist) Which extension, please?
- Research and development.

666
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,395
(woman) R&D.

667
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,637
- I need a triglyceride form of oleic acid.
- Your name, Doctor?

668
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,069
- No, I'm not a doctor.
- Are you with a company?

669
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,431
No, I am not with any company.
I'm the mother of a sick child.

670
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,834
- A mother?
- That's right.

671
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,632
- And you want...?
- Oleic acid.

672
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,352
- The lines are busy.
- I'll wait.

673
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,677
Papa makes you
spaghetti al pomodoro,...

674
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,396
..seasoned with basilico,
the royal herb for our prince.

675
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,954
Badabib, badabab, badaboom.

676
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,155
Come on, Lorenzo, take a little bit.
That's a boy.

677
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,714
(Michaela) The best lead
came from the symposium:

678
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,038
..oleic acid in the triglyceride form.
Now it's our only hope for Lorenzo.

679
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,755
(woman) Don't fret, Mrs Odone.
You will hear from him within the hour.

680
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,474
- You can be sure of it.
- Thank you. That's 301...

681
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,431
Don't worry, I have the number.

682
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,711
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

683
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:55,510
So, as the swallowing reflexes weaken,
he's less able to handle his own saliva.

684
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,149
We'll all have to be pretty vigilant. We
really have to stay on top of this thing.

685
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,956
If we allow any saliva to get down into
his respiratory tract, we block his airway.

686
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,116
- (phone rings)
- We don't wanna do that.

687
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,231
Here we go. Put your
thumb over the valve.

688
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,749
When you don't want suction,
release your thumb.

689
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,237
Hi. It's ProtoChem again.
I'll connect you to our Mr Pellerman.

690
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,115
PROTOCHEM LABORATORIES
Cleveland

691
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,159
- I believe you want some oleic acid.
- Yes, in triglyceride form.

692
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,319
You're lucky. We're testing a glycerol
trioleate here as an industrial lubricant.

693
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,671
Industrial? Then... is it fit
for human consumption?

694
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,916
I don't see why not.
It's a purified olive oil.

695
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,034
Without saturates? Pure monounsaturated
C18 in triglyceride form?

696
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,752
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're sure?

697
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,952
It happens we have one bottle here,
sitting idle on the shelf.

698
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,152
Marvellous! How can we
get our hands on it?

699
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,589
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- How can we get our hands on it?

700
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,956
This is... beautiful.

701
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,309
- And it's entirely harmless?
- Gus, you're talking to an Italian.

702
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,831
- It's only olive oil.
- Yes, that's harmless. It's like... sugar.

703
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,713
And yet, to a diabetic,
sugar can be lethal.

704
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,675
You see, the trouble is we don't know to
what extent Lorenzo can metabolise fats.

705
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,874
Yes, well, Gus, it's been seven months
since Lorenzo was diagnosed.

706
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,560
Now he is silent. He's immobile.

707
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,556
Augusto, I am a scientist,...

708
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,877
..and I'm of absolutely
no use to you whatever...

709
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,309
..unless I can maintain my ob jectivity.

710
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,591
And I am not a scientist. I am a father.

711
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,157
And nobody can tell me what dressing
I put on my kid's salad, OK?

712
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,476
Augusto...

713
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,556
This science of medicine.
You know, it's not like physics.

714
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,797
There's no mathematical certainty.

715
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,552
And because we deal with human beings
who suffer, it can appear heartless.

716
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,636
I know.

717
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,032
You realise that any collaboration
of mine would have to be unofficial?

718
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,392
Sì, s ì, of course. Now, the dose.
We think 40 grams a day.

719
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,432
- That's too much. Say 30.
- 30?

720
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,314
Yes. Any more than that
might damage your son's liver.

721
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,590
Darling, they're about to start.

722
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,438
We're going to send this blood away
to establish a baseline, my brave boy.

723
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,633
Because today we all start
the fight against the boo-boo.

724
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,035
There. All done.

725
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,152
Lorenzino, this year we celebrate
Thanksgiving a little early...

726
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,239
..with a fine barracuda
like we used to eat in the Comoros, huh?

727
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,796
And Papa has cooked it
with the aromatic dill.

728
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,876
And now...

729
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,517
..we add the special olive oil
which Mama found.

730
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,596
Hm? All right?

731
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,391
There we go.

732
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,112
Deirdre.

733
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,118
All right, Lorenzo. Here we go.

734
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,590
November 21st 1984

735
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,356
One Month Later

736
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,789
- There we go.
- You did good, buddy boy. Real good.

737
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,198
Your Aunt Deirdre means "well", darling.
In this house, we cherish our adverbs.

738
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,869
I expect you to do the same
when you get your voice back.

739
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,916
(phone rings)

740
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,878
- Hello?
- Mrs Odone, this is Dr Nikolais's office.

741
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,357
I have Lorenzo's results. There's been a
small drop in the saturated C24 and 26.

742
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,516
- About 15 per cent.
- 15 per cent?

743
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,872
Dr Nikolais said not to get carried away.
It could be a spontaneous variation.

744
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,788
- Am I allowed a tiny squeak of joy?
- We'll know more next month.

745
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,069
Thank you.

746
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,356
(choking)

747
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,071
Michaela!

748
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,956
(Lorenzo gasps for breath)

749
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,594
Augusto! Get something
to hold down his tongue!

750
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,676
- (Lorenzo wails)
- Oh, my baby!

751
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,479
So, this is a kind of seizure,
like epilepsy?

752
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,991
No, not a seizure. It's a paroxysm.
It's triggered by saliva in the windpipe.

753
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,315
- But we suction him.
- Regularly.

754
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,352
I know, but even so, some saliva
gets caught in the trachea.

755
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,233
In any other child,
a cough would get rid of it.

756
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,113
In Lorenzo, it becomes
a scrambled chain of reflexes...

757
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,357
..that amplifies into
what you have just seen.

758
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,153
If this happens again,
what can we do about it?

759
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,430
Just help him try to ride it out.

760
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,716
We're all flying blind here, folks.
The best I can offer is sedation.

761
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:03,392
But if it's not epilepsy, then he's aware
of what's happening while it's going on?

762
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,476
Well, it's possible.

763
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,113
And if he has another episode,
we could talk him through it.

764
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,310
It's possible, Michaela.

765
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,396
It's possible.

766
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,035
- Sì, s ì. A 50 per cent drop, right?
- That's correct.

767
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,991
Thank you very much. Thank you!

768
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,270
Fantastico! Fantastico!

769
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,956
January 1985

770
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,435
I very well understand that we are not
scientists, but we have observed this...

771
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,872
(Nikolais) Let us do it our way,
Augusto. Trust us.

772
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,991
- I've got to go.
- OK. Thank you.

773
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,519
Goodbye.

774
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,758
- Nikolais says it's very interesting.
- Interesting? A 50 per cent drop?

775
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,475
But it's too early to draw a conclusion.
Rizzo might consider a trial.

776
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,717
And he asked us
not to tell the other parents.

777
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,400
- What?!
- It's immoral. Something finally...

778
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,910
- The parents have to know.
- We'll tell them. They can judge.

779
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,476
- The foundation has a mailing list.
- We'll call the Muscatines.

780
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,558
I can eat crow
in the name of a good cause.

781
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,276
Michaela...

782
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,636
Mm! Delicious! That was worth
driving 300 miles for.

783
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,514
- Now, my friends... dessert.
- Here, let me move this.

784
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,313
And Loretta... a little science, hm?

785
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,076
Thank you.

786
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,916
"Dear ALD parents..."

787
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,519
- You want us to send this out?
- Yes. We'll pay for copying and postage.

788
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,116
But you're advocating a therapy.

789
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,552
No, we're merely reporting
a positive advancement in the diet.

790
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,194
It would be wrong to keep it
from the other parents.

791
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,233
Mrs Odone, we have an advisory board
of eminent doctors...

792
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,396
..and we take our guidance from them.

793
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,795
They are the ones
with the medical degrees.

794
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,629
Yes, my dear, but Nikolais
already knows about this...

795
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,038
- ..and the wretched man does nothing.
- Because he is a responsible scientist.

796
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,676
- No, because he has another agenda.
- All right, Michaela. Calmati, calmati.

797
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,155
You know, Loretta, sometimes...

798
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,753
..the interest of the scientists is not
the same as the interest of the parents.

799
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,839
Scientists are human
and sometimes they can be wrong.

800
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,193
As president of the foundation,
you represent us, the families.

801
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:44,075
And you serve the families best
by informing them.

802
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,354
And all we ask is that you please
send this letter to them, that's all.

803
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,077
Our parents suffer enough without
being made the victims of false hopes.

804
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,239
We can't give credence to every jerk
with a pocketful of apricot seeds.

805
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,194
Excuse me, this is not Laetrile. We're
talking about an extract of olive oil,...

806
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,596
..an idea that was put forth
by the scientists at the symposium.

807
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,676
And it works in Lorenzo.

808
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,190
It works in an ALD boy
to a degree that is significant.

809
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,996
- Very significant.
- Other parents have a right to know.

810
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,752
We know that this is a deadly disease,
so they have a right to choice.

811
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,634
And if they feel as we do,
they can put pressure on the doctors.

812
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,356
Because, as parents, we should
challenge these guys. We push them.

813
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,158
Unless someone is willing to question,
to provoke, how would there be progress?

814
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,157
Well, we feel there is progress.

815
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,990
Loretta, we know that, but all we say is
start a dialectic with the doctors.

816
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,917
Are you telling us what to do?

817
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,270
We're asking you
to disseminate information.

818
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,676
You gonna teach the doctors?
Where we come from, that's arrogance.

819
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,030
- Arrogance!
- Yes.

820
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,310
It is... arrogance.

821
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,357
It comes from the Latin word... arrogare.

822
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,358
You know it? You know
the root? What it means?

823
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,950
It means to claim for oneself.

824
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,039
That's the root.
It means to claim for oneself.

825
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,318
And I claim the right
to fight for my kid's life.

826
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,912
And no doctor, no researcher, no bloody
foundation, has the right to stop me...

827
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,157
..from asking questions
which might help me save him!

828
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,672
And you have no right to stop
the sharing of information!

829
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,917
- So you think about it!
- Our job is to be there for the parents.

830
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,349
To comfort them,
not to get them stirred up.

831
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,473
If the doctors think you have something,
they will tell us in their own good time.

832
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,479
- Their own good time is not our time.
- What? They are so powerful...

833
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,751
They are so powerful
that you would be silent?

834
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,598
They are not gods!

835
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,996
Do you know, this acquiescence
is so disgusting!

836
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,554
You think you know so much.
Let me tell you something!

837
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,195
When Michael got sick, we looked for
anything that might help him.

838
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,073
And the best thing that happened?
He was taken quickly.

839
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,715
Now, Tommy... he has lasted three years.

840
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,638
For two of 'em, he's been
without his sight, his mind,...

841
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,719
..everything that makes him
a human being. He's a vegetable!

842
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,510
Oh, boy! If you would stop all this denial,
you wouldn't do a thing...

843
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,395
..to prolong your boy's suffering
and indignity one minute longer.

844
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,389
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he doesn't want to be around any more?

845
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,916
Sì, s ì. Thank you.

846
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,996
February 1985

847
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,391
It has to be a mistake.

848
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,512
No, Nikolais says not.

849
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,790
- Augusto...
- Oh, sorry.

850
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,470
- Should we risk raising the dose?
- No, he's too fragile.

851
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,955
Any more might harm his liver.

852
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,836
(bell rings)

853
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,593
- (Lorenzo screaming)
- Lorenzo, listen to Mommy.

854
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,553
You're going to have to be brave
as only you know how.

855
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,148
We're gonna count together,
you and I, all right?

856
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,590
Listen to Mommy's voice
and the boo-boo will let go of you.

857
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,676
One, two,...

858
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,436
..three, four...

859
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,356
Michaela...

860
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:12,988
You know, I've been a nurse for 18 years,
eight of them spent in ICU paediatrics.

861
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,079
And I know that you can't always
play by the rules, but...

862
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,031
..this boy shouldn't be at home.

863
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,358
He should be placed
in a properly equipped hospital.

864
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,995
Why don't you say what you mean?

865
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,714
I'm not comfortable with this situation.

866
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,635
Well, Lorenzo and I aren't comfortable
with your lack of comfort.

867
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,553
I can't continue to be a party to this.

868
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,554
I gotta give you my notice.
I'll stay until...

869
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,399
- No, you should finish tonight.
- Michaela! Go easy.

870
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,229
Your agency will receive
a cheque in the morning.

871
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,796
Look, Ruth. We're all
a little strung- out here.

872
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,391
She's talking about placement, Deirdre.
It's a euphemism for "hospice".

873
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,513
Lorenzo has enough to endure. We will
not expose ourself to doubt and despair.

874
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,234
She's exhausted. That's all it is.

875
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,353
Look, I don't know.
Somebody had to say something.

876
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,436
Good luck.

877
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,471
March 1985

878
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,715
Buonasera, Odone.

879
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,956
Look what I found.

880
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,514
Look at this. Would you look at this!

881
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,356
Let me show you.

882
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,396
Where are we? Right here.

883
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,876
That was June of '83, just 21 months ago.

884
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,991
You know, it's time you guys
take it easy on yourselves.

885
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,076
Deirdre...

886
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,551
If we knew why it only work halfway,...

887
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,517
..then we might know what to do next.

888
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,872
Augusto, how many mornings
have I found you asleep...

889
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,390
..under a pile of research papers
with the lights still on?

890
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,830
And then you wake up
and drag yourself into the office.

891
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,837
How long can you keep this up?

892
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,077
If you get sick - and you will -
what are you gonna do for money?

893
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,670
What are you telling me?
For God's sake, he is my kid.

894
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,557
Yeah, so are Cristina and Francesco, and
it's been a year since you've seen them.

895
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,636
Listen to me, OK?

896
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,196
There has to be a life beyond Lorenzo.

897
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,357
What are you telling me?
That I should give up on this now?

898
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,029
Oh, man. We both know that even if
you get his levels down to normal,...

899
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,151
..his brain can't fix itself.

900
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,795
How much myelin does he have left?
Do you ever ask yourself that?

901
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,118
- Deirdre, now that's enough.
- No. Don't bullshit me.

902
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,596
I know you do... but she doesn't.

903
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,996
Not ever.

904
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,676
You have to help me with her.
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.

905
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,678
I'm afraid for her.
I think she's losing it.

906
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,319
You've seen how she is with him.
She just can't let him go.

907
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,396
Poor Deirdre.

908
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,430
Spoken as only a woman who's
never had a child could speak.

909
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,393
Michaela, Deirdre was
speaking out of love.

910
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,875
I am only telling you what I see.

911
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,834
For both your sakes,
there has to be life beyond Lorenzo.

912
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,478
Do you think that he has no voice?
No will to live? He asserts it through us!

913
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,114
If you can't see that,
there's no place for you here!

914
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,391
Michaela, for God's sake,
she is your sister!

915
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,230
- And I think you're losing it, Michaela.
- Well, then, I think you should go.

916
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,557
Augusto, help her pack her bags.
I'm going back to our son.

917
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,639
(in Italian) Your sister's right.
You're crazy. Absolutely crazy.

918
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,115
You think I'm crazy
because I speak for our son?!

919
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,708
(in Italian) Yes! Yes! Crazy!

920
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,549
Insane. Demented.
Tainted in the head!

921
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:57,712
Only a crazy woman would shun
her Church, her husband, her family.

922
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,037
I am so sorry.
I never wanted this to happen.

923
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:06,473
How can I? How can I enjoy
anything when he enjoys nothing?

924
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,309
How can you talk to me about loving him
when you trivialise him into...

925
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,955
(in Italian) You blame everybody
but yourself and your poisoned blood!

926
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,036
No! No!

927
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,155
- Mrs Odone!
- Get a tube.

928
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,872
Do you have the tube?

929
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,719
Don't nod, Nancy Jo. Say "yes".
My attention's on Lorenzo.

930
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,150
Darling, look at me. Listen to
Mommy's voice. We're gonna count.

931
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,033
- One, two, three, four...
- (Lorenzo screaming)

932
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,276
(choking and crying)

933
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,279
I'm sedating him as much as I dare.
I don't know what else to do.

934
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,399
How can he endure this
for so many hours?

935
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,796
Augusto...

936
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,474
I don't think he'll have to
endure it much longer.

937
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,598
(screaming)

938
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,276
(choking and panting)

939
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,791
Michaela, let me take him.

940
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,195
- You need rest.
- I'm fine.

941
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,315
I could use a cup of coffee, though.

942
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,554
Lorenzo... Lorenzo, listen to Mama.

943
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,516
Can you hear me, my darling?

944
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,234
If this is too much for you,
my sweetheart,...

945
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,831
..well then you fly, you fly
as fast as you can to baby Jesus.

946
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,556
It's OK.

947
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,590
Mama and Papa will be OK.

948
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,236
(wailing)

949
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,829
I have rarely seen anything
like this boy's tenacity.

950
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,909
They have a bed available upstairs.

951
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,395
No, no, no. In a hospice, no.

952
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,157
It'd be easier. On everybody.

953
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,033
But I would not do honour to Lorenzo.

954
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,076
Michaela. Come.

955
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,589
- What?
- Come. Come on.

956
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,676
- Nurse.
- Yes.

957
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,914
Now, today we eat, moglie mia,
every last mouthful.

958
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,156
- I'm not hungry.
- No, no, no. You eat.

959
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,269
Sit.

960
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,392
Michaela, you sit. Sit.

961
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,752
From tomorrow morning,
the Odones need all their energies.

962
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,237
Now listen. We set out to
normalise Lorenzo's blood, right?

963
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:38,117
And with the oleic oil, we got it
half- right, but that was luck.

964
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,995
- It was rather more than luck.
- No, it was luck. Merely observation.

965
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,998
Rizzo observed something
in a test tube, right?

966
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,190
We tried it on Lorenzo.

967
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,596
Rizzo observed
a 50 per cent drop in fibroblasts.

968
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,678
We observed
a 50 per cent drop in Lorenzo.

969
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:00,113
Michaela, that is luck.
That is observation.

970
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,358
That is all it is.
It is not understanding.

971
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,790
And until we understand
why this work only halfway,...

972
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,708
..how can we expect
to succeed all the way?

973
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,197
I need to understand, Michaela.
You need to understand.

974
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,192
So, tomorrow we go back to the library.

975
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,755
No, no, no. We review all the literature,
everything on fatty-acid metabolism,...

976
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,314
..every word published in the last decade.

977
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,670
So, eat. You eat.

978
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,997
Whatever energy or time I have left
I want to spend with Lorenzo.

979
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,714
You will not have to leave him.
I will go to the library.

980
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,115
I make copies for you,
I bring it home for you.

981
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,835
Augusto, we are on our second mortgage.
You can't afford not to go to work.

982
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,316
Michaela, I will work.
I'll fit it in somehow.

983
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,314
Michaela, this is important. I need you.

984
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,796
I need you, Michaela.

985
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,112
So eat.

986
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,711
Brava! Bravissima! Bravissima!

987
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,918
April 1985
Twelve Months After Diagnosis

988
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,076
(sighs)

989
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,876
Betty! Betty!

990
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,873
All these fatty-acid studies concentrate
on the middle of the chain...

991
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,675
..because the medium-chain saturates
are implicated in cholesterol.

992
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,190
So what do these researchers do?
Think cholesterol, cholesterol.

993
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,312
C12. C14, C-bloody-16!

994
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,637
- Augusto, what are you looking for?
- I am looking...

995
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,912
- ..for the long end of fatty-acid chains!
- All right. Write it down for me.

996
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,077
These researchers should be
doing something about this.

997
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,430
- Write it down.
- Long-chain fatty acids.

998
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,155
C18 through C26.

999
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,518
Saturated.

1000
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,949
Monounsaturated, OK?

1001
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,072
OK. Now I want you to go off to lunch.

1002
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:28,159
Have yourself a good lunch
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

1003
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,515
This is the best I could do
at short notice.

1004
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,076
One article from a veterinary
science journal about pigs.

1005
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,273
- But it's on your long-chain fats.
- Well, thank you, Betty.

1006
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,278
Listen, I am very sorry about...

1007
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,153
Oh, well, you're Italian.

1008
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,357
- (coughing and wheezing)
- (Michaela) ..72, 73, 74...

1009
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,519
That's it. 75, 76,...

1010
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,591
..77, 78...

1011
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,270
Nice going, Mrs Odone.

1012
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,199
That's it, my love. You know
only the strongest, bravest boy,...

1013
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,915
..only a very special person
like you is chosen to fight the boo- boo.

1014
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,508
I'll give him a little water, OK? 20cc's?

1015
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,675
Yes.

1016
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,715
And, Nancy Jo, why don't you tell Lorenzo
what an excellent job he did?

1017
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,115
An excellent job you did, Lorenzo.

1018
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:38,394
Sometimes I wonder, my love, if people
realise how incredible you truly are.

1019
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,876
May 1985

1020
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,114
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

1021
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,835
Is this a new hobby or a nervous tic?

1022
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,671
No, this is a simple mind at work,
that's all.

1023
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,998
See, each paperclip, Deirdre,
is two carbon atom, right?

1024
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,758
- Oh, God!
- No, no, no.

1025
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,155
Really is two carbon atom, all right?

1026
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,909
So we have C2, C4, C6, you know?

1027
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,952
Now, here's what I try to do.
I try to make a chain,...

1028
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,834
..a very long chain
of monounsaturated fats.

1029
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,430
- This is the good guys, right?
- OK, what are these? The bad guys?

1030
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,994
Yes. These here...

1031
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,634
..is the bad guys, all right?

1032
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,796
Now, Deirdre, what I'm trying to do...

1033
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,229
I try to understand the relationship...

1034
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,318
..between the good guys
and the bad guys.

1035
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,478
So, OK, I am the enzyme, right?

1036
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,799
And I reach out and grab a carbon atom
and I put it on my chain, right?

1037
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,353
Here is my chain.

1038
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,119
Now, here, you be
the bad-guy enzyme, OK?

1039
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,835
No, no. Do this for me.
You be bad-guy enzyme, all right?

1040
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,393
Take this, all right?

1041
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,514
Now you reach out and grab a carbon
atom and put it on your bad- guy chain.

1042
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,995
I had enough trouble
with the kitchen sink.

1043
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,716
No, no. You just do this and
then I explain, OK? All right.

1044
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:11,312
So let's each start now
making our chains.

1045
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,797
OK? All right? Do another one.
That's good, Deirdre.

1046
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,956
Good. We put another one on...

1047
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,755
- Here's the stuff on enzyme complexes.
- Ah, thank you. Mille grazie.

1048
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,711
- Prego.
- Prego! Very good.

1049
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,195
- Now, did you make the extra copies?
- Oh, you bet.

1050
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,675
- Thank you very much.
- For Michaela? How is she?

1051
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,199
She's fine.

1052
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,757
So here we are. We're making our chains
more or less the same rate, right?

1053
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,996
That's as one would expect, right?

1054
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,271
But, now, Deirdre, if we were enzymes...

1055
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,870
..in the bodies of little rats
and little pigs and Lorenzo,...

1056
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,754
..then the faster I go,
the more you slow down.

1057
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,835
Now, why would that be?

1058
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,512
Why, the faster I go, would you slow
down, if we are both separate enzymes?

1059
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:01,316
It means that there has to be
some kind of relationship going on.

1060
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,672
We affect each other some way.
There's some kind of interplay.

1061
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,314
But what is it?

1062
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,396
What is it?

1063
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,472
May 29th 1985

1064
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,716
(Michaela) One, two,...

1065
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,749
..three, four,...

1066
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,194
..five, six,...

1067
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,312
..seven candles.

1068
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,159
And Mommy will blow them out for you.

1069
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,236
Make a wish.

1070
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,916
(Lorenzo murmurs)

1071
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,438
(Lorenzo recites random numbers
in Italian)

1072
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,799
Michaela! They are the same enzyme!

1073
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,835
There is one enzyme for both chains.
It's the same bloody enzyme!

1074
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,396
So if we keep the enzyme busy
making monounsaturates...

1075
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,988
It distracts it from
elongating the saturates.

1076
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,680
Right! So we have a way to trick nature.

1077
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,792
Yes, it's a principle called
"competitive inhibition".

1078
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,037
So, Gus, do you think
it's a reasonable hypothesis?

1079
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,392
I think it's more. You've clarified
the biochemical pathway.

1080
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,193
Augusto, I really want
to congratulate you.

1081
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,552
This would explain why oleic acid
is only partly successful.

1082
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,355
Yes, it's C18, you see.
It's too low down in the chain.

1083
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:50,712
So we add a second barrier. We block
the bad guys further up the chain,...

1084
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,958
..the saturates further up the chain,
between C22 and C24.

1085
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,230
There we stop
the bloody things completely.

1086
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,989
- And how would you do that?
- By adding monounsaturated C22.

1087
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,793
- That's erucic acid.
- Yes, exactly.

1088
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,431
Erm...

1089
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,312
- Martha?
- Yes, Doctor?

1090
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:13,468
Among our animal studies,
you will find a file on erucic acid.

1091
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,319
With an e... r-u-c-i-c.

1092
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,396
- OK.
- Thank you.

1093
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,754
You don't believe it will work?

1094
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:27,034
I think what you have done is postulate a
theory that could be of enormous benefit.

1095
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,551
But, as for erucic acid,
it creates cardiac problems in rats.

1096
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,995
If it's not safe for rats, I don't know
what justification there can be...

1097
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,954
..for using it as a therapy on humans.

1098
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,832
But Gus, Gus,...

1099
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,748
..erucic acid is the chief component
in rapeseed oil, right?

1100
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,270
Rapeseed oil is a common food
in China and India.

1101
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,278
And their rate of heart disease
is far lower than here.

1102
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,029
All right, look at these documents.
Cardiac lipidosis,...

1103
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:00,278
..myocardial lesions, cholesterol
deposits in the adrenal gland...

1104
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,278
..and damage to the reproductive system.

1105
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,995
I'm afraid the weight of evidence
is much too great.

1106
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,588
And no human-studies
review committee...

1107
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,793
..will ever do anything but discard
erucic acid out of hand.

1108
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,152
But the human studies
have been accomplished by history.

1109
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:22,592
They have been eating the stuff
in these countries for thousands of years.

1110
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:26,474
You can't expect me to start a protocol
based on that kind of assertion.

1111
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,750
You should examine your protocol...

1112
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,429
..when children are dying and
find a way to research these...

1113
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,348
- It's common sense.
- We simply have a contradiction.

1114
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,268
We seek more information. We do not
dismiss erucic acid out of hand.

1115
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,678
Michaela, if I ignore all this evidence...

1116
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,475
..and we embark on a therapy
based on erucic acid...

1117
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:53,038
Something goes wrong. What then?

1118
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,957
Well, then I suppose the risk-reward
ratio is too unattractive for you.

1119
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,556
I beg your pardon?

1120
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,036
The life of one boy
is not enough reward for you...

1121
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,188
..to risk the reputation of the institution
and the esteem of your peers.

1122
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:17,193
That was uncalled for. Your responsibility
is merely towards your own child.

1123
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:22,155
My responsibility is towards all the boys
that suffer from this disease,...

1124
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,350
..now and in the future.

1125
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,796
Of course I anguish for
the suffering of your boy.

1126
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,037
And of course I applaud you for
the efforts you make on his behalf.

1127
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,838
But I will have nothing to do
with this oil.

1128
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,915
We are not asking, Doctor,
for your anguish or your applause.

1129
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,998
We are asking merely for a little courage.

1130
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,916
OK. All right.

1131
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:04,112
(Augusto) No, whatever the doctors say,
reason tells us it is a risk worth taking.

1132
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,313
But, my friend, we need
a sympathetic collaborator, hm?

1133
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,796
If it was in my hands, I would do
anything I could to help, Mr Odone.

1134
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,876
I have a boy of my own.

1135
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,631
But I don't like our chances.

1136
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:21,470
You know, they said the same thing
about the oleic acid, and here it was,...

1137
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,195
- ..sitting right on the shelf.
- This is a whole other ball game.

1138
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:29,279
Extracting the saturated C24 and 26
from rapeseed oil...

1139
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,517
It's very tricky. It would take
our best chemist at least a year.

1140
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,078
And then you would never get it past the
FDA. Erucic acid for human consumption?

1141
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:42,239
I'm sorry, but no one in the country
is gonna touch it.

1142
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,591
Well, what about
outside this country, hm?

1143
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,756
Uh, I wouldn't know where to send you.

1144
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,590
Oh, Mr Pellerman! We're agents
for over a dozen foreign companies.

1145
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,597
There must be one that could help.

1146
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,871
Maybe all we need to do is look
at the list of the foreign companies.

1147
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,912
No, you and your wife
have enough to do.

1148
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,591
I'm sure Mr Pellerman would be happy
to make the calls for you.

1149
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,238
We'd have to be covered, legally.

1150
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,592
If anything goes wrong, this company
is not going to be held liable.

1151
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,792
Oh, we would not hold you liable. No, no.

1152
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:24,677
And this... It would be greatly
appreciated if we could circulate this.

1153
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:33,915
"The interplay of monounsaturated
and saturated fatty acids:

1154
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,077
..therapeutic application in ALD."

1155
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,679
- Wow.
- You wrote this?

1156
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,315
Yes. We felt that
if we were asking for help,...

1157
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,637
..our rationale needs to be very clear.

1158
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,153
(Yorkshireman) We've all read your paper.
It's a beautiful piece of biochemistry.

1159
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,397
(Augusto) Over a hundred companies
all say "too difficult".

1160
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,956
Well, my first impression
was that it's bloody impossible.

1161
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,755
But I've been doing difficult
fractionations for 40 years...

1162
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,475
- ..and I'd like to have a stab at it.
- How long do you think, Mr Suddaby?

1163
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,309
I've only six months
before I retire, so we'll see.

1164
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:14,389
All right. Then I'll let you get on with it.
Call me if you have any questions.

1165
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,476
Righto. Bye, then.

(knock on door)

1169
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,876
Who could this be?

1170
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,710
Ah, your good friend Wendy...

1171
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,515
..with all sorts of lovely
vegetables and fruits.

1172
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,156
- Hi, Michaela.
- Look what you brought us!

1173
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,111
Hi, Lorenzo.

1174
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,151
Jake's not in school today?

1175
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,236
He's not feeling so good.

1176
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,792
I'm going for a walk with Mrs Gimble
and we shall be back shortly.

1177
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,196
I've given him his oxcarbazepine
and 15ml of water.

1178
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,874
- Do you want me to do anything else?
- I'm sure he would love a story.

1179
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,355
Do you have a problem with this?

1180
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,596
Fine.

1181
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,349
- He's had a couple of tantrums.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1182
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,436
It's OK.

1183
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,239
- Dr Rizzo got him in the oleic acid trial.
- That's good.

1184
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,356
Hi, Jake.

1185
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,837
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you for my potatoes.

1186
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,076
Say hello, son.

1187
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,115
(weakly) Hi, Mrs...

1188
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,198
..Odone.

1189
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:12,198
He saw the way Jaybird went.

1190
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,395
He knows what's in store for him.

1191

1192
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,076
"They came to an opening in the forest."

1193
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:30,398
"Before them was a little cottage,
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun."

1194
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:34,308
"'Look, Gretel' exclaimed Hansel.
'That cottage is made of gingerbread."'

1195
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,671
"'It really is' replied Gretel,
running up and tasting a bit...

1196
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,677
..that she had pulled from the wall."

1197
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,234
"'And the roof is shingled
with butterscotch."'

1198
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,273
"'The windowsills are made of chocolate'
declared Hansel, breaking off a bit."

1199
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,870
"'The windowpanes are clear candy'
said Gretel. At that moment..."

1200
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,470
Nancy Jo, do you think you could muster
just a tad more enthusiasm?

1201
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,433
Lorenzo loves words.
He loves the sound of language.

1202
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,836
Well, I'm paid to nurse,
not read stories.

1203
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,036
You've decided his mind doesn't need
as much nurturing as his body?

1204
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,116
What mind?

1205
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,636
I beg your pardon!

1206
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,115
Nothing.

1207
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,231
Get out.

1208
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,828
- Look, Mrs Odone...
- Just get out.

1209
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,236
I've read up on this disease!
I know what it's done to his brain!

1210
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,955
Sh! Lorenzo doesn't need this from
a subliterate with a double-digit IQ!

1211
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,469
Face it. The lights are out
and nobody's home!

1212
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,989
- Just get out. Go!
- Well, merry Christmas.

1213
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,270
- Get out!
- Happy holidays!

1214
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,036
And a joyous yuletide!

1215
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,029
"Near a great forest
lived a poor woodcutter...

1216
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,197
..with his two children,
Hansel and Gretel."

1217
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,630
"Times were very hard and
a day came when there was no food,...

1218
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,796
..except a little stale bread."

1219
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:56,276
"But Hansel..." was like you, my darling.

1220
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,072
"He was a clever lad who knew
how to solve difficult problems."

1221
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:07,320
"The woodcutter was very sad..."

1222
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:10,754
(Augusto) Are you going to
keep doing this?

1223
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,919
She brought it on herself. She
consigned herself to the outer darkness.

1224
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:19,431
Michaela, Nancy Jo, she was
a good nurse. You train her well.

1225
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,438
Yes, but I want someone
to give him more than medication.

1226
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,996
Someone who will minister
to his mind and his soul.

1227
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,070
- I think I've found him.
- What?

1228
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,392
I wrote to Omouri.
I asked him to come and stay with us.

1229
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,475
- Omouri?
- Yes.

1230
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,559
Lorenzo is surrounded by women all day.
I don't want him to grow up hag- ridden.

1231
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,672
But you cannot take a boy
out of his fishing village...

1232
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,791
..and bring him here to nurse Lorenzo.

1233
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,469
Not to nurse him, to be his friend.
To bring the Comoros into this room.

1234
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:53,596
We cannot uproot this young man
from his family, his way of life.

1235
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,552
- Where will he live?
- Here, in Lorenzo's room.

1236
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:00,638
But... he has no English.

1237
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,392
He's a Muslim. An African.

1238
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:09,753
We cannot bring an African to this racist
country to be a second-class citizen.

1239
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,713
- This is Washington, DC.
- He'll be part of this family.

1240
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,559
I'll teach him English.
There's a lot we can do for him.

1241
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,636
Oh, Michaela...

1242
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,156
Here. Sit down, sit down.

1243
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:26,236
Now, the last time
Omouri saw Lorenzo,...

1244
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,316
..he was climbing trees.

1245
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,876
He was a wild and vibrant boy,
full of life.

1246
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,073
In the letter that you wrote to Omouri,...

1247
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,955
..did you tell him what he will see
when he walks into this room?

1248
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:50,195
I told him he'd see a young man who
was very ill and had need of a friend.

1249
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,518
That is all?

1250
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:56,155
How would you have me describe him?
As a biochemical conundrum?

1251
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,236
Non è vero.

1252
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,038
You know he is not that for me.

1253
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,149
Augusto, when you look at him,
what do you see?

1254
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,035
Tell me the truth.

1255
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,794
(in Italian) It's very difficult...

1256
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,354
..to know for sure...

1257
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:34,319
..what is left of our Lorenzo.

1258
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:39,991
If a person cannot move,...

1259
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,556
..cannot see,...

1260
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,396
..cannot speak,...

1261
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:51,115
..how can we know what is in the soul?

1262
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,076
He is my little boy.

1263
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,634
And my only wish...

1264
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,999
..is to have him back as he was before.

1265
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:18,276
March 1986
Twenty- three Months After Diagnosis

1266
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:45,311
- How do I tell the man to give up?
- Say his health won't take it.

1267
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,149
The hours he's working are daft.
Our expectations were unrealistic.

1268
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:53,592
Look, Don's a man who's been working all
of his life in face creams and cosmetics.

1269
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,110
With this oil, he's having the time
of his life. You tell him. I won't.

1270
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,515
All right. For his own sake, I'll have to.

1271
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:04,077
Then you can call Mrs Odone and
tell her that you've pulled the plug.

1272
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:09,831
- I'd best leave him be.
- I think you're right.

1273
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,236
Omouri!

1274
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,276
(Lorenzo gasping)

1275
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,991
Lorenzo... Omouri is here.

1276
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,916
(sings in Swahili)

1277
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,151
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Suddaby.

1278
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,239
There's a bottle of pure erucic acid
triglyceride on my bench.

1279
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:26,239
Will you see that it gets to young
Mr Odone as soon as possible, please?

1280
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,836
I'm off home now. Bye-bye.

1281
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,398
(woman) Goodbye, Mr Suddaby.

1282
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,714
(man) Well, we'd better get on with it.

1283
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,796
September 1986

1284
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:49,396
Four parts our old friend, the oleic.

1285
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,756
And...

1286
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,357
..one part erucic.

1287
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:01,589
And the journey begins,
and like all good journeys,...

1288
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,280
..with food.

1289
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,870
Where's the wretched nurse?

1290
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,709
I'm gonna take my baseline myself
if she doesn't get here soon.

1291
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,469
A month is much too long.
If we check my blood every week...

1292
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:21,833
..and I have a cardiogram, we should
know enough to start Lorenzo sooner.

1293
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,110
- (knock on door)
- Oh, at last!

1294
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,918
Hi.

1295
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,758
How's the mother tiger?

1296
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,068
Augusto didn't tell you?
I'm here to be Lorenzo's rat.

1297
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,800
That's a very kind offer,
but I can't let you.

1298
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,708
I'm a carrier, just like you. My blood
levels are just as high as yours.

1299
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,594
I've had my baseline taken...
and I'm starving.

1300
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,755
Oh, I have been wanting
to meet Lorenzo's main man.

1301
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,235
(Omouri) I am content
to greet Aunt Deirdre.

1302
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,874
Well, it's good to meet you too.

1303
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,471
Now, now, Michaela. I want no argument.
Michaela, you cannot test it.

1304
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,593
- Lorenzo needs you fit and well.
- So you would put Deirdre at risk...

1305
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:17,998
- ..without even discussing...
- Hey! I backpacked all through India.

1306
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,032
I must have eaten
rapeseed oil up the wazoo.

1307
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:24,516
- Ah, I've been fasting all day.
- All right, go ahead. Try it.

1308
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,596
OK, here goes.

1309
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,555
So... does it taste awful?

1310
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,470
- No? Good.
- It's good.

1311
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,909
Good. Eat, eat.

1312
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,675
(Suddaby) Your sister
had no side effects?

1313
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,078
None at all. If we can normalise the
levels of a carrier so quickly, who knows?

1314
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,112
- We'll start Lorenzo immediately.
- Marvellous.

1315
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,151
- We're all terribly grateful.
- No, no.

1316
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:58,831
- Not to mention Deedee, the family rat.
- (Suddaby laughs)

1317
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,635
- What dosage will you give the lad?
- We don't have time to be conservative.

1318
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,069
We've decided on eight grams.

1319
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,116
September 27th 1986

1320
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,313
(Deirdre) # I ride an old paint

1321
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,795
# And lead on an old Dan

1322
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,434
# I'm goin' to Montana

1323
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,233
- # To throw the Hoolihan
- (phone rings)

1324
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,038
- Hello.
- (man) Mr Odone?

1325
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,513
Odo-ne, yes.

1326
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:19,030
Look, we have a problem
with this blood sample.

1327
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,993
You have a problem?
What is the problem?

1328
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:25,476
Could there have been
a mistake in the labelling?

1329
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,239
No. No mistake. Why?

1330
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:33,912
Well, we ran the assay twice and
the levels of C24 and C26 read normal.

1331
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,836
They read normal?

1332
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,758
Well, uh, I...

1333
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,076
Do you have the sample in front of you?

1334
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,758
Yes.

1335
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,668
- What is the name on the sample?
- Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

1336
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,756
It's Odo-ne.

1337
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,630
No, there's no mistake.

1338
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,353
- But thank you very much.
- OK, bye.

1339
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,799

# Get along, little dogies...

1341
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,959
December 8th 1986
Thirty-two Months After Diagnosis

1342
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,195
- What's going on?
- His levels are normal.

1343
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,880
- Play! Play!
- Oh, that's wonderful!

1344
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,714
(Wendy) Now, drink it up, son.

1345
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,035
Every last drop. Good.

1346
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,752
Mom says this is
the only bottle in the world.

1347
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,198
Now that we have destroyed
Lorenzo's blood fats,...

1348
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:55,279
..I'm sure that Mr Suddaby
will make us plenty more, huh?

1349
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:59,669
Mom says this is bootleg.

1350
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,629
I know this is only
a fraction of what it cost...

1351
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,320
- No, no, no, Wendy.
- You gotta take it.

1352
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,591
No, we work on the barter system.

1353
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,188
Our oil, your produce, huh?

1354
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,551
There aren't that many
potatoes in the world.

1355
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,636
OK. Here you go.

1356
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:20,958
So, when will you tell Nikolais?

1357
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:24,755
Well, we told him and the other doctors
and we sent all the figures.

1358
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,953
- What did they have to say?
- They deliberate. They want more study.

1359
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,277
- Wendy, that's enough.
- So the other kids have to wait?

1360
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,516
We know what to do
about that, don't we?

1361
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:37,712
The doctors had a very hard time
swallowing the first oil.

1362
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,150
They want to see how it goes
with Lorenzo on the second.

1363
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,555
- But we don't have time, do we?
- No.

1364
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:46,831
So we leave science
to its own concerns, huh?

1365
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,835
- Merry Christmas.
- Goodbye, Jake.

1366
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,116
(silence)

1367
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,959
What happened to the suction machine?

1368
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,868
There's no need, Michaela.
Not for four hours.

1369
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,831
I turned the machine off.

1370
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,193
All last night he made
to swallow for himself.

1371
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,879
Augusto! Augusto!

1372
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,556
February 1987

1373
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,433
We hope to make
an announcement quite soon...

1374
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:58,235
..about a new development
in our diet therapy.

1375
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,352
It's expensive but,
with the help of the government...

1376
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:04,040
..and of this wonderful foundation,...

1377
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:08,517
..we are going to start a trial
before the end of the year.

1378
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:11,800
Six Months Later

1379
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,596
I can hear from that
that you wish us Godspeed.

1380
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,152
Excuse me, Doctor!

1381
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,511
Are you referring to the oil
the Odones have invented for Lorenzo?

1382
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,552
- We'll take questions later.
- No, it's a good question.

1383
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,912
I should have mentioned it perhaps but...
The Odones have been extremely active...

1384
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,951
..and we are in their debt.

1385
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,640
Thanks to them,
we are preparing a protocol...

1386
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,832
..for review by
the human-studies committee.

1387
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,077
If then we can persuade
the government to fund us,...

1388
01:52:55,200 --> 01:53:00,672
..then we shall know if this oil is of
more than temporary therapeutic value.

1389
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,951
But it works! Lorenzo's
blood levels are down to normal.

1390
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:08,278
It's precisely for that reason
that we are conducting this trial.

1391
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,630
You don't expect me
to endorse a therapy...

1392
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,832
..just on the basis
of one hopeful observation?

1393
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:17,077
There's two! My boy's been
takin' the oil for six months.

1394
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,317
Yes, Ellard, and his blood levels
are down to normal. He's fine.

1395
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,271
You are playing with people's hopes.

1396
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:27,394
Where do these Odones get off, thinking
they know more than the doctors?

1397
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,796
- Where did you get this oil?
- The Odones. They get it from England.

1398
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:34,993
They don't have approval from the FDA.
It's bootleg. Give the doctors a chance...

1399
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,793
Come on, Ellard!
It's a mixture of two cooking oils.

1400
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,038
Two cooking oils? What's the dosage,
please? What are the side effects of this?

1401
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:45,072
- How would we pay for it?
- There must be a formal protocol...

1402
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:49,671
..before we can raise funds. I understand
it will cost over $1,000 a litre.

1403
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:55,511
And no insurance company or government
will support you without the approval.

1404
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,598
And the only way to get it
is through thorough testing.

1405
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:02,190
That's what they told AIDS people
about AZT, but they fought and got it.

1406
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,835
Because they were dying.
They didn't have time to wait...

1407
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,111
We padded our walls yesterday!
I want that oil!

1408
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,996
May 1988
Lorenzo's Tenth Birthday

1409
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:22,669
There, my darling. That's a sweet boy.

1410
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,476
What a big, strong boy.

1411
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,675
Yes, my darling. Yes.

1412
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,718
You see, Michaela,...

1413
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,038
..it's as though he is trapped
down in some dark cave.

1414
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:13,554
Because he's lost so much myelin,
he can't find his way out.

1415
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:17,309
Now, we know
his simple functions are intact.

1416
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,035
He breathes, he swallows,
his heart beats.

1417
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:26,515
And from the outside world,
he receives sensation.

1418
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,596
A touch,...

1419
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,116
..pain, cold.

1420
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,957
And here are the primal feelings.

1421
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,117
Fear, hunger, desire.

1422
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:46,078
While up here in the neocortex,
the higher brain, locked here,...

1423
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:50,318
..are his reasoning,
imagination, memory.

1424
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:54,193
The things that make us each ourselves.

1425
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,116
So how does he reach us?

1426
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:07,191
When a simple swallow
is such a huge task?

1427
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,596
To find...

1428
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:17,034
To find the way,
the path from his mind...

1429
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,756
..to the outside world...

1430
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:26,116
..is like willing himself
through a brick wall.

1431
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,276
So he waits, huh?

1432
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,196
He waits.

1433
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:41,356
Michaela...

1434
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,476
Do you ever think...

1435
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:53,116
..that...

1436
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,558
..maybe all this struggle,...

1437
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:03,189
..it may have been for
somebody else's kid?

1438
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,276
Yes.

1439
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,313
But I promised... I promised him...

1440
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,395
..his world would never be silent.

1441
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,236
He would never be alone.

1442
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,472
Yes.

1443
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,996
Two Years Later

1444
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,919
(Michaela) "One morning,
a little rabbit sat on a bank."

1445
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:15,192
"He pricked his ears and listened
to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."

1446
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,790
"A gig was coming along the road.
It was driven by Mr McGregor."

1447
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:22,276
"And beside him sat Mrs McGregor
in her best bonnet."

1448
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:25,995
"As soon as they had passed, little
Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road...

1449
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:30,033
..and set off with a hop, skip and a jump
to call upon his relations,...

1450
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:33,709
..who lived in the woods
at the back of Mr McGregor's garden."

1451
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,277
"That wood was full of rabbit holes,
and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all...

1452
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:43,315
..lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins,
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter."

1453
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,637
- "Old Mrs Rabbit was a widow. She..."
- (grunts)

1454
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:50,196
"..earned her living by knitting
rabbit-wool mittens and muffeties."

1455
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,276
"I once bought a pair..."

1456
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:56,678
What's the matter, darling?
You don't like the story?

1457
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,752
Lorenzo...

1458
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,318
You don't like the story?

1459
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,917
He does that a lot lately.

1460
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,190
- When?
- Mainly at story time.

1461
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,316
Sweetheart...

1462
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,756
Listen carefully to Mama.

1463
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,359
Is your middle name Patrick?

1464
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,232
No... Is it Peter?

1465
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,356
No, Mommy.

1466
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:41,199
Is it Michael? Michael Murphy?

1467
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,792
Yes! Yes!

1468
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,876
Only you don't know how to say that.

1469
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,355
Will you teach Mommy how to say no?

1470
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,631
When you close your eyes,
does that mean no?

1471
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,832
Oh, what an idiot!
That was a yes question.

1472
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:01,829
All right. You don't want to hear
any more Benjamin Bunny, do you?

1473
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:07,796
That's an emphatic reply!
Very well, young man.

1474
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:13,834
No more Benjamin Bunny. How could
Mommy have been so thoughtless?

1475
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,431
We're going to take all of these
baby books to the children's hospital.

1476
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,950
It's time for the big stuff.
Something heroic.

1477
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,958
There you go.
You gotta tell us what you want.

1478
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:28,117
The Once and Future King by TH White.

1479
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,151
"The boy slept well in the woodland nest,
where he had laid himself down."

1480
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,238
"At first, he only dipped
below the surface of sleep...

1481
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:41,397
..and skimmed along
like a salmon in shallow water,...

1482
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,877
..so close to the surface
that he fancied himself in air."

1483
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:50,036
"He thought himself awake,
when he was already asleep."

1484
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,832
"He saw the stars above his face,...

1485
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,872
..whirling on their silent
and sleepless axis,...

1486
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,390
..and the leaves of the trees
rustling against them."

1487
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:01,592
"And he heard small changes
in the grass."

1488
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:06,032
"These little noises of footsteps
and soft-fringed wing beats...

1489
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:08,799
..and stealthy bellies
drawn over the grass blades."

1490
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:14,278
"A rattling against the bracken at first
frightened him, but interested him."

1491
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,238
OK. Is it your thumb?

1492
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,876
Is it your index finger?

1493
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,356
Your middle finger?

1494
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,230
Your little finger?

1495
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:38,638
It's your little finger. You think
you can move your little finger.

1496
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:42,389
OK. Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1497
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:45,876
..to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1498
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:51,718
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1499
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,116
..to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1500
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,640
Come on, my friend.
What a wonderful thing. A "yes".

1501
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:01,479
And then there'll be
a "could be" and a "perhaps"...

1502
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,990
..and maybe even a "shut up, Mommy",
but now we just have to get to "yes".

1503
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:08,078
So tell your brain to tell your arm...

1504
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,351
..to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1505
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,995
Come on, my love.
Tell your brain to tell your hand...

1506
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,356
..to move your little finger.

1507
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:26,277
- (Deirdre) Come on, Lorenzo.
- (Omouri) You can do it, my friend.

1508
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,356
You can do it.

1509
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,636
(Augusto) Come on, Lorenzo.

1510
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,636
(all gasp with pleasure)

1511
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,073
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
School of Veterinary Medicine

1512
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,476
(Augusto) And they are born
without myelin, correct?

1513
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:58,559
(man) The only naturally dismyelinated
higher mammals in existence.

1514
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,955
(Augusto) And this is passed
from mother to son?

1515
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:02,991
Yes.

1516
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:06,271
Their mother is from Edinburgh.
That's Jasmine.

1517
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,755
She doesn't shake, but her male pups do.

1518
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:13,592
- You think you can stop them shaking?
- Well, we hope so.

1519
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:17,998
By implanting nerve cells, we expect
to see the growth of new myelin.

1520
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:21,396
We've been partially remyelinating
rats and mice for ten years,...

1521
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,670
..and it's repeatable.

1522
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:29,839
But if we could fund this work,
it could be the first in higher animals.

1523
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,758
And then in human beings, huh?

1524
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,836
Well, in time, yes.

1525
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:38,950
Dr Duncan,
if I help you raise these funds...

1526
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:42,277
..and if we can get the researchers
together to collaborate,...

1527
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:46,598
..I think we can achieve
very much in a very short time.

1528
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,395
Augusto, we scientists
are a very competitive lot.

1529
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,799
Such a collaboration is a lovely idea,
but sadly that is not how science works.

1530
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:00,630
That's not necessarily so, because
remember the Manhattan Project?

1531
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:04,548
28 months. It took them 28 months.

1532
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,832
Now, if scientists can come together
to build the atomic bomb,...

1533
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:13,670
..surely they come together
to remyelinate some puppy dogs?

1534
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:27,268
(Michaela) Papa called from Italy, darling.

1535
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:31,075
He's missing his Lorenzacchio
very, very much.

1536
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:35,113
But he wants me to tell you
he's making a big dinner tonight,...

1537
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:39,199
..a banquet of brain food for
the cleverest doctors in the world...

1538
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:43,313
.. who've gathered together to put the
myelin back in the shaking puppy dogs.

1539
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,908
And if they can achieve that,...

1540
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:50,670
..someday there might be a way to help
all the people who've lost their myelin.

1541
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,713
Not only the boys with ALD,
but the people with multiple sclerosis...

1542
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,400
..and many other diseases, Lorenzo.

1543
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:02,910
And then think, my brave boy, if they
can ever give you back your myelin,...

1544
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:08,990
..you'll be able to tell your brain to tell
your toes, your fingers, your anything,...

1545
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,918
- ..to do what you want them to do.
- (Lorenzo) .. what I want them to do.

1546
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,270
(both) And then, one day,...

1547
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,110
(Lorenzo) ..I'll hear my voice...

1548
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:21,791
..and all these words I'm thinking
will get outside my head.

1549
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:29,830
This film was completed
at the end of 1992 and so far...

1550
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:34,158
Doctors all over the world have
begun to prescribe Lorenzo's Oil.

1551
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:38,637
If a diagnosis is made early enough
the treatment stops the disease.

1552
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:43,197
So there is now a growing army of boys
kept free from the ravages of ALD.

1553
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:48,440
In recognition of this, Augusto Odone
received an honorary medical degree.

1554
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:53,588
He and Michaela continue to raise funds
and drive the scientific task force...

1555
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,915
..known as "The Myelin Project".

1556
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:59,589
The Shaking Pups are
successfully growing new myelin.

1557
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:03,190
This means that human trials
will begin within a year.

1558
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:07,677
There are many waiting to receive
the first brain cell transplants.

1559
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,678
Among them is
Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

1560
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,268
Meanwhile... Lorenzo is 14 years old.

1561
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:17,392
He is now able to move
his head from side to side.

1562
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,798
He has recovered his eyesight
and begun to vocalise simple sounds.

1563
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:25,310
He is learning to communicate
by means of a computer.

1564
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:28,193
And so he waits,
for what will come next...

1565
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,630
Oh! Now it broke!

1566
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:41,280
This is Charles and this is Harry...

1567
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:44,278
..and they've both been on
Lorenzo's Oil for two years.

1568
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,676
My name is Michael Benton
and I'm twelve and a half years old.

1569
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:51,110
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for four and a half years.

1570
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:56,872
I was diagnosed with ALD when I was
13 years old. I'm taking Lorenzo's Oil...

1571
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,798
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for three years.

1572
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,550
Some of the activities I'm involved in
are baseball, basketball...

1573
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,830
(medley of voices continues)
