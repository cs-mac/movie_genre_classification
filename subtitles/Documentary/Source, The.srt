1
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,860
I took your advice. It was
good advice, thank you.

2
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,230
You're pale, everything ok?

3
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,700
Shawn. Shawn!

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,200
Hey!

5
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,470
Anyway listen I wanted to tell you, only
reason why I canceled..

6
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,760
Oh, he's calling me three times a day. I
hear more from him now, than I did when
we were together. What is it with guys?

7
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,900
<i>I gave notice.
- Ticket. -Notice?-</i>

8
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,320
<i>May I see your ticket?
- I ehh...</i>

9
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,200
Hey

10
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,480
You are acting a little strange this morning,
are you ok?

11
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,210
Are we gonna make up the 10 Minutes?
- We gonna try, Sir.-

12
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,670
Hey, grandpa,
what the heck was they delay back there?-

13
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,650
I just punch the tickets, Sir.
- You should punch your face...

14
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,920
Shawn, did I do something?

15
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,260
Look, I can see that you think you know
me but I don't know who you are

16
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,670
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
I fly helicopters for the US Army in Afghanistan.

17
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,010
Shawn, that's .... -Shawn?-

18
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,280
I feel sick.

19
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,110
<i>- Dammit!- Sorry! Let me help with that...</i>

20
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,000
No, it's ok.

21
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,260
Hey Mister! Hey!

22
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,200
Hey, you dropped this!
- Thanks!-

23
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,650
What is that?
- Chicago.-

24
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,750
<i>"All aboard, doors are closing"</i>

25
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,860
"This is a Chicago-down train"
You ok there, Captain?

26
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,180
Did you see that?

27
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,190
You kinda freaking me out.

28
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no....

29
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,240
Are you alright?
- I don't know, what's going on...-

30
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,910
Talk to me Shawn! -Look, I don't know who
Shawn is, and I don't know who you are!-

31
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,420
Ok, we get off at the next stop
and forget whatever is going on here, ok?

32
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,690
This doesn't belong to me.

33
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,190
Look at me,
everything is gonna be ok!

34
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,980
<i>Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.</i>

35
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,520
<i>Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered
Castle, acknowledge transmission.</i>

36
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,720
<i>Captain Stevens, do you copy?</i>

37
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,890
Where am I?

38
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,830
<i>You are with "Beleaguered Castle"
Are you functional?</i>

39
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,840
I am dizzy. Did I ... Did I just a-lock?

40
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,440
<i>Adjusting your rotation.</i>

41
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,580
<i>Can you report this time?</i>

42
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,720
Fuck is this? What this is?

43
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,350
Wher.... who I am talking to?

44
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,560
<i>Captain report what you saw.</i>

45
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,660
<i>What, I don't understand it - Where were
you before you were talking to me?-</i>

46
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,730
<i>There was an explosion.
- Coming from where?-</i>

47
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,710
<i>Some confusion is perfectly
normal at this stage, Captain.</i>

48
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,780
<i>Do you have a visual signal?</i>

49
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Who are you?

50
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,490
You already have that information, Captain.
- I do?

51
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,710
Recall my name.

52
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,470
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.

53
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,170
I... was on a mission

54
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,930
I was flying...

55
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,920
And then I woke up on a train.

56
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,240
Now I am here.

57
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,480
I need to be briefed.

58
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,970
Uhm, wha-what unit is this?

59
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,090
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
- Who?-

60
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,910
Stand by for thread 1 of alpha memory pattern.
- What is "beleaguered castle?"-

61
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,400
The exercises will assist you.

62
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:50,720
Memory thread 1. Listen to the Lilly awoke
in an evening dress and an opera cloak..

63
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,880
...in her hand were 5 play cards
- Is this a joke?-

64
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,740
The Queen of Spades, Four of Clubs...

65
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,230
..Nine of Clubs,
Three of hearts, Nine of Hearts

66
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,370
Is this a red flag exercise?

67
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,220
End of thread 1. Thread 2: The following
is a recording of a western screetch-owl

68
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,510
End of thread 2. End of pattern.
Acknowledge.

69
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,070
Acknowledge end of pattern.

70
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,800
Stand by to initiate pattern recall?

71
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,900
Go for pattern recall.

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,850
Arrange the 5 playing cards in order of
descending value irrespective of the suit.

73
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,600
Queen, two nines, four and a three
- That is correct-

74
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,710
The passage I read contained mention of
a woman's name. What was that name?

75
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,820
Her name is Lilly.

76
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,510
That's correct
Recall my name.

77
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,180
Goodwin, your name is Goodwin...

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,750
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.

79
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,220
Ma'm, I need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified that I am stateside?

80
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
Who bombed the train, Captain?

81
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,920
What?
- Who bombed the train?-

82
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,570
A woman kept calling me "Shawn".

83
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,870
That is incidental.
Think Captain, remember back.

84
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,890
Who bombed the train?

85
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,530
I don't know who bombed the god damned train.

86
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,160
Then go back and try again.
- Back where?-

87
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,900
You will have 8 minutes, same as last time.

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,820
No, no, no, no, no. No more bullshit sim
tests, ok? I need to know, where I am, what
is the location and condition of my crew.

89
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,530
Does anybody know, that I am stateside?

90
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,000
You are obligated to give me this information!
- Start with the bomb!-

91
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,070
Where is it, what does it look like.

92
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,660
What kind of explosive, how is it detonated.
- Right, right...-

93
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,650
Find the bomb and you'll find the bomber.
- Find the bomb.... wait nooo!-

94
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,420
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

95
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
Yeah, its good.

96
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,110
And I signed for a NALSAR course. Next thing
you know, I'll be moving to India to find myself.

97
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,380
Dont say....
- Know any good Gurus?-

98
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, she got your shoe...

99
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,650
So, what do you think? Am I on the right track?

100
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,910
It's the same train but it's different.

101
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,020
Deep. I hope it's different.
I feel the same way.

102
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,700
What?

103
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,240
<i>- My hand... Brian... What is it with guys,
everything is more beautiful in retrospect.</i>

104
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,380
This looks so real.

105
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,090
You know, I think it's gonna be really good for
me to get as far away from him as possible.

106
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,990
<i>Unbelievable detail.
- Ticket.-</i>

107
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,720
May I see your ticket?

108
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,510
Thanks.

109
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,200
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

110
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,540
The doer?

111
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,470
You are the pretty girl. The distraction.

112
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,340
"Distraction"?
- Every sim has one.-

113
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,910
Hey are we gonna make up the ten minute?
- We are gonna try.-

114
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,150
Are you talking about Brian?
- Hey Grandpa..-

115
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,470
What the hell was the delay back there?

116
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,320
What you late for? -What?-

117
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

118
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,890
I'm late to an asshole festival...
I hear you re headlining.

119
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,290
Oh thats funny. Who are you, a comedian?

120
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,230
Yeah, he is a... comedian.

121
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,240
Sit down, freak.

122
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,690
Fans...

123
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,520
Thats the guy. He came in 3rd on America's
Got Talent. Got sided twice for DUI.

124
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,340
We talked about him.
- Thank you, ma'm, thank you.-

125
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,890
<i>You are welcome. - "Glenbrook station" - Yeah,
but at 1 o'clock the bridge is gonna be jammed.-</i>

126
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,370
Damn it!

127
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,870
Ah, I am sorry.

128
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,490
Hey Mr., hey

129
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,910
You dropped this.
- Ah, thanks.-

130
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,790
<i>"All aboard, doors are closing"</i>

131
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,220
The explosion came from behind me.

132
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,590
What's with you?
- Out of time to talk to you right now.-

133
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,120
I got time for you.

134
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>Chicago, Union Station"</i>

135
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh, shit!

136
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,120
Goodwin, you gonna tell me how to disarm this?

137
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,330
Should I ..... unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it?

138
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,750
Ok, ehmm

139
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,040
I am just gonna leave it.

140
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,590
Ok?

141
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,120
Ladies and Gentleman, Transit Security.

142
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,620
You're not. - Due to a classified security-breach
I need all of you turn off your personal electronic
devices till we pull into the station, ok?

143
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,930
That means laptops, cellphones, Cellphone Sir.
Cellphone, Sir! Thank your very much.

144
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,860
Pagers, anything electronic. Thank you.
It's a precautionary measure,
it's nothing to worry about.

145
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,550
So which is it,
security breach or precautionary measure?

146
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,290
Sir!

147
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,800
Is there a problem here, Sir?
- I am in the middle of a very big deal...-

148
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,290
Shawn?

149
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,340
I need you to turn that off.

150
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,790
Why you don't show me that ID again?

151
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,470
Shawn!

152
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,710
Turn it off!

What's your problem, asshole?

154
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,420
Hey!

155
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,180
Shawn, what are you doing?

156
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,070
Hey, not a good idea m'am. Not a
good idea. Oh, that's not a good idea.

157
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,420
I think you broke his jaw.

158
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,340
It's ok, he is not any more real than you are.

159
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,680
I am not real?
How about next time you drive to work!

160
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,290
There's not gonna be a next time.

161
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,230
Stabilize.

162
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,710
Lower your pulse.

163
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,590
Did you find the bomb?
- Yes....-

164
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,390
There is hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

165
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,530
It's not a concern, Captain.

166
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,360
What is... -Tell me about the bomb.-

167
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,770
Where is that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

168
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,110
He looks like he is in charge,
I wanna talk to him. - That's irrelevant, Captain-

169
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,410
I wanna talk to your commanding
officer! - You can talk to him upon
completion of your mission.-

170
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,740
My mission is in Afghanistan, where my unit is.
I flew two god damn sorties yesterday.

171
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,980
You've been with us for 2 months.

172
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,840
Did you id the bomber?
- No, where is my unit?-

173
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,070
And under who's jurisdiction is this simulation?

174
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,820
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

175
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,860
What lives?

176
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,190
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

177
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,490
No, no, no, what lives?
What you are talking about?

178
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
I need to be briefed!

179
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,950
Sir, I need to give him something.
- That's fine, go ahead.-

180
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,580
Get ready to send him back in.

181
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:59,960
At 7:48 this morning CST, a bomb
exploded on a commuter train outside
of Chicago, killing everyone on board.

182
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,940
and thats the train that you've been on.

183
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,250
No, no, no, I am right here,
you are talking to me right now!

184
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,160
A man named Shawn
Fentress was on that train.

185
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,200
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

186
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,780
Every second spent explaining things
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

187
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,210
This makes no sense.

188
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,070
The train explosion was the first attack
of a series. There are going to be more.

189
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,710
Now, did you find the bomb?

190
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,180
In the restroom, ventilation panel above the sink.

191
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,400
Cellphone detonator.
Are we done?

192
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,080
Eh, no no. But that's good,
that's very very good, Captain. Good.

193
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,720
Our record show that 1812 calls
ended at the moment of the explosion.

194
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,170
52 of those calls were tethered to the
cell tower nearest the train. So one of
those calls was made by our bomber.

195
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,520
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

196
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,130
Yes.

197
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,920
The explosion was timed to engulf the passing
freight train which means, the bomber had to be
watching both trains when the call was made.

198
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,210
52 callers, one of those is our bomber.

199
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,910
I want you to concentrate on
the passengers in your car.

200
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:25,730
Get to know them, narrow the suspect
pool. Look for ones who seem quiet
or withdrawn, who seem nervous.

201
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,740
As always, you'll have 8 minutes.

202
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,240
8 minutes, and I blow up again?

203
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,740
Yes.

204
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,980
I need you to discipline yourself on this
next pass. Perform only the task that we
assign you. Everything else is irrelevant.

205
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,740
Charge the drivers.

206
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,570
Is my father even...

207
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,140
I took your advice...
It was very good advice.

208
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,810
You're kinda quiet today.
- Just got a lot on my mind. Careful.-

209
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,110
Yikes.

210
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,100
Oh, so sorry
- Don't worry about it.-

211
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,600
That's very kind of you.

212
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,840
You're very decent.

213
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,770
Thank you.

214
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,920
And real.
- Ticket.-

215
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,480
How's everything today?
- It's good.-

216
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,430
Anything out of the ordinary?
- Uhmm no.-

217
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,020
I mean behavior on the train.
Is anything... Anybody seems strange to you?

218
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,590
You look strange.

219
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,450
How about you,
does anybody looks suspicious?

220
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:03,560
Are you drunk or something?
- Come here. For a second.-

221
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,250
Come on.

222
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,400
Just think of it as a game.
- A game?-

223
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,580
They are all so utterly normal, Shawn.
That's what so terrifying about them.

224
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,960
Maybe there's a team network.

225
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,000
The sleeping giant coached with
the minister and them out there.

226
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,640
Don't forget the sullen college kid,
he is the expendable one.
I bet they are all controlled by the conductor.

227
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,710
Standing there dictatorial demanding tickets.

228
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,380
You are funny.
- Damn it.-

229
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,260
What about that guy?
- Deposition.-

230
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,420
About that woman sitting across from him?

231
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,650
Hair appointment, every Monday, you know this.
You talk to this people more than I do.

232
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,550
Right, right. And the guy behind her?
He's late for an audition, right?

233
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,570
To recorded offenses... That's the
guy that was sided to SUD. - A DUI, I
know. Hey, hows the signal in here?-

234
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,700
It's good.

235
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,610
Is teaching not stimulating enough
for you anymore, Sherlock?

236
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:28,380
Oh oh, now we slip to the racial
profiling, that is. - Did anyone else
come out of the bathroom over there?-

237
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,070
Well, I saw you coming out of there.
- Me?-

238
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,600
Yes.
- No-

239
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,660
<i>Me?
- Hey Mr-.</i>

240
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,020
Hold on, hold on a second.
Just hold on a second.

241
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,490
It's gotta be something near.

242
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,510
A broken phone.

243
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,180
Christina?
- Yeah?-

244
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,880
Excuse me.

245
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,480
Hey, hey come with me.
- This isn't our stop!-

246
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,530
Now come on, let's take a walk.
- We don't get off here.-

247
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,160
I don't know, just be spontaneous.
- You gonna freaking me up...-

248
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,850
I know this gonna sound really weird but
I have a really bad feeling about this train
and I think that we should get off, ok?

249
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,320
<i>Just get your stuff.
"All aboard. Doors are closing."</i>

250
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,250
Come on, come with me.

251
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,680
So what now?
- Wait, one ........, I'll be right back!-

252
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,120
Ready to get that coffee now?

253
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,590
Oh sorry, yeah, ah... Jus-,
just one more second, ok?

254
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,050
Oh for God's sake.

255
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,470
Feel sick?

256
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,140
It's motion sickness, I get it all the time.

257
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,590
Excuse me... Excuse me.

258
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,330
Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?-

259
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,700
No, I don't have one.

260
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,090
Sure?
- Yeah, I am sure.-

261
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,350
Why you don't leave me alone please?
Or I call the police.

262
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,970
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

263
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,640
You know, you have no right....

264
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,790
What are you doing? Gimme my bag back.

265
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,590
Are you crazy?

266
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,620
Shawn!
- Get back!-

267
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,920
Shawn, what's going on?

268
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,230
Shawn!

269
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,210
Stop, Shawn!

270
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,790
It wasn't you.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

271
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,850
Are you insane?
- No! -No, no!

272
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,420
Where is it? -Get away from me!-
Where is it? -Get away from me, please!-

273
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,000
Shawn, Shawn, get up! Shawn!

274
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,950
Shawn, listen to me, get up!

275
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,580
Shawn -Gimme your hand, get off the track......
Mr. C'mon- Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, get up....

276
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,220
Goodwin?
Come in, do you read me?

277
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,370
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,
do you copy? Please respond.

278
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,920
It's freezing here, whats going on.

279
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,770
What's that?

280
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,940
He is in trouble.

281
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,420
I think the oxygen just went out.

282
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,220
Goodwin?

283
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,080
Goodwin!

284
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,480
Find a way to get through to him.

285
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,680
What is it?
What's going on?

286
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,130
It's not the tertiary cooling ether.

287
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,000
Just keep sending strings out,
see if he hooks on to something.

288
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,300
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.

289
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,120
Sir...
- Please-

290
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,830
It's not a whole lot we can do from here.

291
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,160
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have? - Some...-

292
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,120
....and not long.

293
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:54,100
<i>Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera
cloak, in her hand were 5 playing cards...</i>

294
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,370
Goodwin, you out there?

295
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,400
Goodwin, who is Goodwin.
- This is Captain Stevens, do you copy?-

296
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,380
<i>Captain Stevens?</i>

297
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,690
The capsule lost power.

298
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,120
The capsule? Is that where you
are now, Captain, in a capsule?

299
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,290
You should know, who are you?
- Let me get Captain Goodwin, get to it!-

300
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,980
You invented this thing, right?

301
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,960
I did.
- Are you in command here?-

302
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,820
I am. Were you able to locate the
information we need, Captain?

303
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,910
That's a negative Sir. I was unable
to find the bomber, but I did save
her. A passenger on the train.

304
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,370
I got her off safely, a woman.

305
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,200
Captain, it's gonna be counterproductive
for you to try to save anyone on that
train. They're outside the mission.

306
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, but she survived.
And maybe the rest could too.

307
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,290
She survived, but only inside the Source Code.
None of them will be safe.

308
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,470
What is this Source Code?

309
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:03,660
It's quantum mechanics parable calculus.
It's very complicated.

310
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,110
Try me!

311
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,370
Fine.

312
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,490
When a light bulb's turned off,
there is an afterglow,
a lingering halo-like effect. You seen it?

313
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,600
<i>Yes
- Of course-</i>

314
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,330
The brain is like that, its electromagnetic field
remains charged, just briefly even after death.

315
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,640
Circuits remain open.

316
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,020
<i>Now there is another peculiarity about the
brain. It contains a short-term memory
track that's approximately 8 minutes long</i>

317
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,180
like a convenience store's security
camera that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

318
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:43,800
Now combining these two phenomena,
circuitry that remains viable postmortem and
a memory bank that goes back 8 Minutes

319
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,020
Source Code enables us to
capitalize on the overlap.

320
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,940
Shawn Fentress died on that train, of all the
passengers aboard he was your best link.

321
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,980
You two share the compatibility in terms of
gender, body size and your synaptic maps.

322
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,120
What happens after the 8 minutes?
- After? Nothing.-

323
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:10,790
You cease to exist on the train.
You cannot exist inside the Source Code,
beyond Fentress' 8 minutes.

324
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,130
Source Code is not time travel.

325
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,350
Rather, Source Code is time reassignment.

326
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:26,270
It gives us access to a parallel reality.
Now the deaths on the train were a tragedy

327
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,030
but Source Code empowers us...
- No, but I saved....-

328
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:35,230
one person, that girl, that's always sitting across
from me. I pulled her off the train.

329
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,230
Give me her name.

330
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,780
Christina, I don't remember her last name.

331
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,670
Her name was Christina Warren.
- Yes!-

332
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,640
<i>She was 28
- That's her-</i>

333
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,800
<i>born in Moline, Illinois.
Died this morning on the train.</i>

334
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,340
No, no, I pulled her off.
She's fine.

335
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,540
No, she isn't.
- Believe me, she is-

336
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,750
Believe me.
- She saw me get hit by the express train.-

337
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:15,100
<i>This isn't us getting anywhere. -No, no, no, wait,
wait....- We have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.</i>

338
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,440
What second attack?
- The train was just the beginning-

339
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,290
A letter of intent.
- I am sorry, what are you telling me here?-

340
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,340
We have information that Downtown
Chicago is the next target. And they're
planning to detonate a dirty bomb.

341
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,940
You have any idea how many people
would die if an explosion of that
magnitude were to occur in the city?

342
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,210
We're evacuating as we speak. We've to
stop it before it happens, do you understand?

343
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,750
If you find the bomber, his second attack,
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

344
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,560
We have very little time left.
Out here the clocks only move in one direction.

345
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Charge the drivers.

346
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:55,100
On the upper deck of the next carriage
there is a conductor's compartment. It's
a small office containing a strongbox.

347
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,120
Inside is a loaded handgun.Get to it. You are
authorized to use whatever force necessary.

348
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:09,240
I took your advice.......
It was very good advice.......

349
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,200
You're still here.
- Of course I am-

350
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,730
Guess what?

351
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,520
You've quit your job and you enrolled in a
NALSAR course.

352
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,760
Good guess.

353
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,790
Soda can. Coffee spill.

354
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:35,040
Listen to me... Don't answer this.
You deserve better than that guy.

355
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,170
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect,
doesn't it?

356
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,850
How did you know there was....

357
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,850
How well do you know me?
- Not that well apparently-

358
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,580
Do you know me well enough, that if I did
something that looked a little strange and
was maybe even a little bit dangerous

359
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,850
and told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

360
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,080
No.

361
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,380
Wow, that was honest.

362
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,590
You are beautiful, you're kind,
and you are painfully honest.

363
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,410
Who are you and what did you do with
Shawn Fentress? - It's the new me-

364
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,790
I don't want to hurt you.

365
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,860
No I am not gonna sit in my seat, alright?
He is bleeding, he needs medical attention.

366
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,270
Is it true that you tried to steal a
gun out of the train security box?

367
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,430
Careful ma'm!

368
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,500
Dammit! -What were you thinking?-
Can I borrow your phone? -No!-

369
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,640
You need to go to the hospital, Shawn.
- Please, please- No, you need
help -Can I borrow your phone?- No!

370
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,280
Why do you want my phone?

371
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,330
What would you do if you only had
one minute left to live? - I don't know-

372
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:14,870
I would call my dad. I would hear his voice
and I'd tell him I am sorry.

373
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,920
Tell me everything is gonna be ok.

374
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,010
Everything is gonna be ok.

375
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,330
Oh yeah, the gun in the strongbox, that was a
really great idea. Thanks for that.

376
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,730
Did you make any progress?
- Can I get access to a phone?-

377
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,790
I need to talk to my father.

378
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,030
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes, I will try....

379
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,610
Goodwin, how I am doing? I am just
trying to measure my performance here.

380
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,650
Have you ever gotten back in?
Am I doing any better than you did?

381
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,770
No, we're wasting valuable time here.

382
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:27,500
No, no, I have never been on the
other side of a Source Code mission.
I wouldn't be a viable candidate.

383
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,510
Why not?
..CAOC-N, what is that?..

384
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,920
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

385
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,210
What are they?

386
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:45,090
Captain, you should have found the
suspect by now. This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given
you. Don't squander it thinking.

387
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,430
Do.

388
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,080
Please contact my father for me.

389
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,220
This will stop at some point, Captain.

390
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:01,820
As soon as you finish the mission.
And you re doing really great. This will end.

391
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Whoever planted the bomb had to
have equipment of some kind. Gloves,
a screwdriver to get into the over
the head vent, flashlight, something.

392
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,500
Check bags, backpacks, briefcases, anything.

393
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,040
So... I took your advice.

394
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,290
It was very good advice. -Hey Grandpa!-

395
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,170
What are you doing?
- I am just...-

396
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,770
trying to remember something.

397
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,490
What is that?
- It's a Military patch-

398
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,140
Were you in the Military?

399
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:54,360
A friend of mine was. He was in
Afghanistan and he disappeared and
no one has heard from him since.

400
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,860
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

401
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,500
No, it's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

402
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,110
Do you think, you can see what you can find
on this guy? -Sure.-

403
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,510
He's been on my mind a lot lately,
his name is Captain Colter Stevens,
he is in the 17th Airborne.

404
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,010
Ok, you owe me.

405
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,610
I'll buy you a cup of coffee...
- Why don't I get one for you now-

406
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,820
Christina
Ehmm, I've been having these dreams lately...

407
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,260
Really vivid...

408
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,030
and you've been in them.
- Really?-

409
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,290
What... oh, no...
No that I wouldn't. I.. It's just...

410
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:10,830
Ehm, I'll call you back in a minute honey. Yeah.

411
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,170
Cramming?
- Uh, yeah-

412
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,870
For what?

413
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,310
Ehh, Psych.. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

414
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:27,080
Can I borrow a pen?
- Eh, yeah, sure-

415
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,120
Woooh! Hey, that's not cool man!

416
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,080
Man... Your is a mess.
- What you doing man?-

417
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,830
never find what I am looking for,
just like my bag. Just like my...

418
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,600
How about you let the guy have his bag back?
- Finish your deal!-

419
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,820
Stay out of this tough guy
or doesn't end well for you.

420
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,940
You can't do that.

421
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,370
What am I doing? What am I doing here?

422
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,380
<i>Jesus. Dick.</i>

423
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,310
C-O-C-N.

424
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,900
Excuse me, ma',m. Ehi, how you doing,
good morning. You work at Walter Reed?

425
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,570
Yeah, I used to.

426
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,100
Ehm, I am in the Military.
- You are in the Military?-

427
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,500
Yeah, yeah I am.
- What was going on down there?-

428
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,350
Oh you know, we were just having a little bit of
an argument actually about, about this patch.

429
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:40,660
Is that what they train you to do? Assault
civilians? - Ma'm please. Do any of
these letters, they look familiar to you?

430
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,570
Do you know what the "N" stands for?
- It's Air Force and the "N" stand for Nellis-

431
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,920
Can I borrow your phone? You know
what, actually I can pay for it. I don't
even have to borrow, I can pay you for it.

432
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,350
...have like 100 dollars...
- I don't want your money-

433
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,410
Just bring it back.
- All right, thank you so much-

434
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,060
Come on, come on, come on, come on....

435
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,740
Post operator.

436
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,140
Uhm, Rutledge please.
- Please hold-

437
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,340
Say, please? -You tell him Captain Colter
Stevens is calling- Hold the line.

438
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,720
<i>All aboard. Doors are closing.</i>

439
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,750
Dr Rutledge will be on in a moment.

440
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,190
I have to tell you something.
- I know, I found him-

441
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,730
Your friend...
- I got him.-

442
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,570
An Air Force Base. In Las Vegas.
- No, he's not-

443
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,510
He's dead, Shawn.
- What?-

444
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,940
I am sorry. Your friend
was killed in action two months ago.

445
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,630
No, you must have gotten
the name wrong.

446
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,680
Colter Stevens, 17th Airborne helicopter pilot,
was on the first site I tried.

447
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,770
His father's name is Donald, right?

448
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:27,660
"Donald Stevens will join host Eleonor
Gwah to discuss the death of his
son, Army Captain Colter Stevens

449
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,930
who died in Afghanistan in February and was
honored posthumously with the silver star.

450
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:41,640
Also on the broadcast will be Army
Sergent Rorbert Alvarez, whose life
was saved by Captain Stevens in
a firefight just outside of Kandahar.

451
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,050
I'm sorry.

452
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,520
<i>Captain.</i>

453
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,820
<i>Shawn... talk to me. -Captain.-</i>

454
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,330
<i>Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.</i>

455
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,960
<i>You're with operation Beleaguered Castle.
You are safe.</i>

456
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,880
<i>Now, can you tell me what you see?
Just look and think. - I see a card- That's good.</i>

457
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,650
Do you copy, we're taking a lot of RPG fire here.

458
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,130
Am I dead?

459
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,670
A radio listing is saying that I died in
a helicopter crash

460
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,340
in country, and my father received a medal
for me. - Your condition is not the issue here-

461
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,890
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attacks.
Everything else is irrelevant.

462
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,880
News report saying that I am dead is irrelevant?

463
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,630
Until the person or persons who blew up
that train are in custody... yes!

464
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,820
Goodwin.

465
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,150
One soldier to another.
Am I dead?

466
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,220
Part of your brain remains activated.

467
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,780
What about the rest of me? I can see my
hands and my feet. They still move.

468
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,890
They're a manifestation. They're just
your way of making sense of all this.

469
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:43,130
So..what are you saying? Are you saying
that I am imagining this? I'm imagining that
...I am still alive, that I am in this capsule?

470
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,600
We have fourth amp dropping.

471
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,590
Captain, what just happened?

472
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,310
Can I ask you a question?

473
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,430
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

474
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,920
Where am I?
- Thats classified-

475
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,110
Fuck you!

476
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:52,600
Captain, I can not imagine what you must be
feeling right now, but if are to prevent a second
attack, we need to send you back immediately.

477
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:59,410
And Captain, you cannot deviate from
the mission while inside the Source
Code. Even to investigate your, hmm...

478
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,310
Even to investigate what happened
to you. There is only one continuum
on this end and it can't be unsettled.

479
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:11,270
Well, you know, I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

480
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:15,080
Just before the explosion, so 7:46 this morning
they paged you with a call.....

481
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,810
You may have made that call from the train,
but I would never receive it here.

482
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:26,750
It's a different reality, Captain. If the
call even went through it would be
received by a different me entirely.

483
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:32,510
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

484
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:38,990
We set you, you move forward. We reset
you, you move again. And that represents
the entirety of your function here.

485
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:42,920
You know what, next time, I'll send you a pizza.
I see, if that makes an impression.

486
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:48,300
You cannot alter the continuum of this
reality from within the Source Code.

487
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,690
This can't be legal what you are doing.

488
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:56,420
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself, has been
reviewed and sanctioned by a military court.

489
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:06,520
You know, many soldiers would find
this preferable to death. The opportunity
to continue serving their country.

490
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:12,100
Have you....
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Uh?

491
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,210
That's immaterial.

492
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,020
Any soldier I've ever served with could say
that one death is service enough.

493
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,840
Fine, you can have that in return
for completing this mission.

494
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,270
Wha... Have what?
- I'll give you what you want-

495
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,640
Terminate your service,
let you die.

496
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,030
This is taking too long, you've been to
easy on him. No more rest periods.

497
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:46,160
I am certain, we can find other service men
with wounds similar to yours who'll consider
being a part of this program an honor.

498
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,950
Uh? No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. What?

499
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,190
Send him back.
Charge the drivers.

500
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,060
And Captain Stevens, I'd like you to
remember that it's not only about you,

501
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,900
but it's also about 2 million
real world Americans. Now you
may not value your own life,

502
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,260
I do however ask
that you value theirs.

503
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,370
Advice....

504
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,410
Hey Grandpa.....

505
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,260
Calm yourself, you're back.

506
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,390
Did you find the bomber?

507
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,560
Uh..... There...
are hundreds of people on that train.

508
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:39,470
Well, then check them out one
by one. Doesn't matter what you
do to them, they're already dead.

509
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,910
Get to that gun and shoot them all if you
have to, but get us some usable intel.

510
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,210
No! No, wait!

511
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,830
We have to keep doing this, until you find the
bomber. - Please, I am trying, I am trying-

512
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,660
Who is the bomber?

513
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,630
I am trying.

514
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,570
I am sorry, Captain. I know you are
exhausted and we are all frustrated,
but we can not fail. You can do this.

515
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,440
I can't, I can't...
- Yes, you can-

516
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,580
You are a born hero, son.
Even your father thinks so.

517
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,740
Saving people is what you do best.

518
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,090
It was about a stir, too.
I didn't wanna regroup back

519
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,540
I just..... started feeling
like he didn't wanna come home anymore

520
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,350
- Dad?-
Somehow, he couldn't come home.

521
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,130
and he wouldn't talk to me.... wouldn't hear me.

522
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:51,330
Hardly said he just.... couldn't leave his unit
out there without him and that was that.

523
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:59,840
Those guys.... were his family.
I said two things I shouldn't have. I don't know.

524
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:06,860
I never fully understood him.
And I can't believe he is gone.

525
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,660
Send me back in.

526
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,870
Please don't
blow me up again.

527
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,020
Hello?
I know, its you.

528
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,890
I am gonna find you.
Turn around?

529
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,140
Hey there. -Me?-

530
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,840
Why you look so surprised?

531
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,000
Don't.

532
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,280
Move. Move. Move. The bag over there.
Move over, put the bag over there and move over.

533
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,600
Move over. Now hand me your phone.

534
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,170
You're done! You're done.
- What?-

535
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,210
You can't kill anybody anymore.
- What? I don't understand-

536
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,710
You gonna trigger the bomb with your phone.
- What?-

537
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,990
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

538
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,340
Listen, my name is George Troxel,
I am software engineer, ok?

539
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,170
I was talking to my wife.

540
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,590
Try it again.
Your call, dial it again.

541
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:23,200
Ok, I am gonna press redial. Your phone
is gonna ring and then I gonna shot you.

542
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,880
Shit, I am sorry. Sorry.

543
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,750
<i>Hey! You dropped this.</i>

544
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,390
Wow, thanks.

545
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,750
<i>All aboard. Doors are closing.</i>

546
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,620
Shit, no, no!

547
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,480
No!

548
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,550
Come on!

549
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,880
Stop the train!

550
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,400
Hey!

551
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,100
Hey!

552
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,400
Derek Frost
- Yes?-

553
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,980
See this?
- Yes-

554
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,690
Recognize it?
- No-

555
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,730
Jesus.
- How about you give me your wallet?-

556
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,080
Ok

557
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,850
No, you left it on the train deliberately.

558
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,070
I... must dropped it.

559
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:53,100
No, you planted it there, so everybody
would think you were dead.

560
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,670
I know, it's you.
- How do you know so much?-

561
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,440
Hell is that thing?

562
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:14,260
Wow, wow, wow. wow, wow.
Slow down, slow down.

563
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,110
Do you wanna see it?
- Very patriotic-

564
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,200
Slowly, slowly!

565
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,410
All right, all right. Back up, back up! Back up!

566
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,790
Not many people could build that.

567
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,550
Alright, where is your next target?

568
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,620
Shawn?

569
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,700
Shawn Fentress.

570
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:36,120
Teacher. History.

571
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,550
I don't know you.

572
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,090
I think I killed your girlfriend.

573
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,960
Why?

574
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,820
Oh, you messed up my timing.

575
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,390
Why!?

576
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,690
Oh, you mean why this.

577
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:01,490
Because the world is hell.

578
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,770
But we have a chance to start over
in the rubble

579
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,540
but first there has to be rubble

580
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,760
You are teacher. You..... will understand.

581
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,290
Christina... Stay with me!

582
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,120
Stay with me!

583
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,660
Everything is gonna be ok.

584
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,200
This isn't the end.

585
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,870
Check through there
I'll go check this way.

586
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,300
<i>This is Beleaguered Castle.</i>

587
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,130
<i>Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.</i>

588
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:16,030
<i>Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,
acknowledge transmission.</i>

589
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,990
I have your bomber,
I have his name.

590
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,680
You have the bomber's name?

591
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,320
Derek Frost.

592
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:36,920
He got into a rented white van in
the Glenbrook Station parking lot.

593
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,800
Illinois plate, 5CGY847

594
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:45,070
Illinois plate, 5CGY847

595
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:46,970
All right, let's move.

596
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,740
And Goodwin..... and Goodwin,
there is a radioactive device in the van

597
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,420
some kind of bomb.

598
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,770
Thank you, Captain.
- Yes, Ma'm-

599
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,740
Thank you, Captain.

600
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:05,550
You now off the clock. -About our deal?-
I had hoped that you might reconsider
that for the sake of the program.

601
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,740
I have,
I want something else now.

602
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,230
Good.

603
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:17,430
I.... I still wanna die, but I wanna go back in and
I wanna save all those people on that train first.

604
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,900
It doesn't work that way, it can't.
- No, I know, I know, I know....-

605
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:29,800
I am not really asking to believe
me, sir. I am just..I am asking to
have the decency to let me try.

606
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,490
CPD2 this is AS11

607
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,050
Van is approaching fens
cape to the quarry, over.

608
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:45,000
Roger that, AS11. We're on the vehicle,
that into the quarry road.
We'll stop him about half way down, over.

609
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:49,350
AU-SWAT2, this is CPD2, block
the east end of the road, over.

610
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,430
AU-Swat2, roger that.

611
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:55,200
We are going to switch now to a
live feed from our Chicago affiliate.

612
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,910
The swat team is approaching the white van.

613
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,510
An Illinois man has been
sorted through this morning...

614
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,840
The door is op... the door is open and the man
is on the ground. It appears he has surrendered.

615
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,590
Earlier today the police discovered
a..... -Congratulations, Captain.-
.....lab in the backyard shack..

616
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:15,060
In recent months Frost started posting
anti-government statements on his website.

617
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,660
Yes Sir, it's a real validation of the program

618
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,660
a clear window into just how
revolutionary Source Code can be.

619
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,060
We finally have a powerful
weapon now in the war on terror.

620
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,450
Congratulations Captain,
job well done.

621
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,190
He is not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

622
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,420
I am still waiting an answer.

623
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,960
Are you married, Captain?

624
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:49,290
Jeff, why don't you go take a break?
You deserve to celebrate.

625
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:50,810
Sure.

626
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:54,170
Can I get you something?
- No, I am fine-

627
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,800
Why, you asking me on a date?

628
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,460
Sorry, poor taste.

629
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,100
Are you married?

630
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,230
No.

631
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:08,130
I am divorced.

632
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,140
You think there is
an alternate version of you?

633
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,470
A Goodwin who made different choices?

634
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,540
What do you mean?

635
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:23,700
like uh, you didn't get married or you didn't
get divorced, or just married someone else

636
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,510
a woman who has took a
different fork in the road?

637
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,600
No, I don't, Captain.

638
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:39,880
What you experienced was a shadow, it
was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

639
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,070
This is real life, here.

640
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,710
The one where you talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?

641
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:58,000
The program wasn't designed to alter
the past, it was designed to affect
the future. And you have done that.

642
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,330
I missed something, Captain.

643
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:06,700
That train shouldn't have blown up.
There must have been a second detonator.
Something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

644
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,170
It's a computer program, Captain.

645
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,950
The girl on the train,
all the others, they're lost.

646
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,310
I am sorry about that.

647
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,200
I get it. I get it.

648
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,630
I know, quantum physics, parable calculus.

649
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,210
You're wrong, Goodwin.
You're just plain wrong.

650
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,280
Captain,
Christina is dead.

651
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,370
She doesn't have to be, Ma'm.

652
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,540
I'll ask Rutledge.

653
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,880
I'm asking you.

654
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:46,090
I'm asking you..... Just..... send me.....

655
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,140
Captain.

656
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,260
It's your choice.

657
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,670
At the end of this Source Code
I'll terminate your life support.

658
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,980
There willl be no
coming back.

659
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,930
I am gonna save her, Goodwin!

660
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,560
It was an honor, Captain.

661
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,560
And I thank you for your service.

662
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:16,840
Good luck.

663
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,220
I took your advice.

664
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:39,340
You're gonna move to
India and become a Guru.

665
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,200
Careful, ma'm.

666
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,600
Yeah, I am gonna go find
myself in the mountains.

667
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:48,620
Well maybe you have a cup of coffee with me
before you go.

668
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,570
Yeah, I like to do that pre-teen test.

669
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,830
Good.

670
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,660
Let's do it today.

671
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,640
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.

672
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,180
You know what?
- What?-

673
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,470
I feel really good.

674
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,460
Why?

675
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:17,080
Cause I have been waiting for
weeks for you to ask me for a coffee.

676
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,600
<i>Ticket.</i>

677
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,090
Ok.

678
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,030
Just give me a couple of minutes ok?
And I'll be right back.

679
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:34,420
Gotta go...
save the world.

680
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,690
I knew he was a keeper.

681
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,770
Beautiful day.

682
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,160
Ticket. -Oh, I am sorry. Sorry.-

683
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,360
You trust the DOD?

684
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,570
They got the finances.

685
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:36,960
Yeah, well sure. Look, if we get the funding.
I guarantee you... we can have at least....

686
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,440
8 source code projects up and running
by the end of the year.

687
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,530
Really that many?
- Maybe more-

688
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:46,980
You're real hero, Dr. Rutledge.
- Oh, thank you-

689
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:51,780
We did save lives today.
- Yes, a true victory for the program-

690
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,460
A great victory for us all.
- We'll talk soon-

691
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:59,720
So...... exciting times.

692
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:05,520
Let's initialize the memory wipe on
SC-1 and start crunching the data.

693
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,720
...Sir...

694
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:12,870
We, we.... we told Captain Stevens,
that we were gonna let him die.

695
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,610
Let him die?
He just saved millions of lives today.

696
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:19,480
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?

697
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:24,590
For all we know, he may be the only
candidate with which the system works.

698
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:32,360
So, let's clear his memory
and reinitialize Source Code.

699
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,160
Shall we?

700
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,470
Yes, sir.

701
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,770
Sorry, I just....

702
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,450
Hey Derek,
this isn't your stop.

703
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,470
Hey Mr. you dropped this.

704
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,640
Come on, back here.

705
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,060
Ops.

706
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:31,760
Derek.

707
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,820
It's over.

708
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,610
Do you understand?

709
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:46,300
Hey, my name is Derek Frost
I planted a nuclear device

710
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,470
in a white van,
parked in a Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot

711
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:56,040
right now I am handcuffed to a pole on the 944
CCR train, headed to Chicago Union Station.

712
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,760
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

713
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,310
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.

714
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,450
Ok.

715
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:13,530
Derek, there's no more burying
the world in rubble today.

716
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,880
You mind if I borrow this?

717
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:26,610
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.

718
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:31,350
And.... they want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain.

719
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,910
Hello, Captain.

720
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:16,910
<i>Hello?
- Donald Stevens?-</i>

721
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,540
<i>Yes.</i>

722
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:27,850
<i>My name is Shawn Fentress.
- Who?-</i>

723
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:31,970
I served with your son, Colter.

724
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,180
<i>Oh boy...</i>

725
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:46,750
It's a..... I am sorry it has taken me so long
to.... call you. Sometimes it just takes a while
to figure out what you wanna say, you know.

726
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:50,650
<i>Ah, don't be too hard on yourself...</i>

727
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,180
<i>It's not an easy call to make.</i>

728
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:01,150
How are you doing, Sir?

729
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,030
<i>Uh... Well ehm...</i>

730
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:10,370
<i>All that came back was some ash.
It's hard to believe that it was him.</i>

731
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,780
<i>How well did you know him?</i>

732
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:31,990
I was there when he died, Sir.
He said...

733
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:40,110
that the last time that you guys talked, ehm...
was tough ....and

734
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:49,040
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

735
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:54,080
<i>I just wanted him back.</i>

736
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,780
<i>I loved him so much.</i>

737
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:32,590
<i>I wish I could have told him that.
- He knows it-</i>

738
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,430
Take care, Mr. Stevens.

739
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:11,310
You ok?
- Yeah-

740
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:15,840
Saved the world?
- Sorta-

741
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,940
So, where were we?

742
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,820
Getting some coffee.

743
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,220
Dr. Rutledge?

744
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,320
What?

745
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,330
Shit!

746
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:45,270
What is too hard about it? I run a business, ok?
Everything moves on time or people get fired.

747
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,740
<i>That's how it works in the real world.</i>

748
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,470
- 10 Minutes -
Hey buddy.

749
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:52,450
Don't sweat the small stuff, you'll drown.

750
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,480
Oh thank you for the moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.

751
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,670
What do you sound, self help cds today?

752
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,510
Why don't you just mind your own business?

753
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:04,620
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs
here. This instant!

754
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,910
Why are you always so bitter, Max?
- It's a bitter world we living my friend.-

755
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,240
What you want from me?

756
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,230
It doesn't have to be.

757
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:21,420
I will bet you 100 dollars, that you can't
make all the people on this train laugh.

758
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,380
Oh right...

759
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,300
Actually, 126 bucks.

760
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,620
Is that your way of making fun of me?
- No, it is to have a better day...-

761
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:38,920
No, no. It's good. Easiest money ever.

762
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:46,660
Hey, I... excuse me, people.
One of our fellow passengers has
decided to offer me some money....

763
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,030
What has just gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.

764
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:54,040
It's the new me.
- I like it-

765
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,240
Women always mess up my last
name. I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me "Getoff".

766
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,320
She goes "get off, get off" "I am
"no, Denoff, Denoff", she: "No, you
are fat and you are heavy, get off!"

767
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,580
Good?
20 seconds.

768
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,720
Make it 10.

769
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:19,670
Goodwin.

770
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,060
Look at all this.

771
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,890
What?

772
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,580
All this life.

773
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,860
Goodwin,
open the SC door!

774
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,900
Why you keep looking
at your watch?

775
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,910
Christina, what would you do....
if you knew you had less than a minute to live?

776
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:12,410
I'd make those seconds count.

777
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,960
I'd kiss you again.
- Again?-

778
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,940
Goodwin, open this god damn door!

779
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,360
He has done enough, Dr.

780
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:48,960
Everything is gonna be ok.

781
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:06,690
It is a beautiful Monday in Chicago today.
Temperature is expected to reach the
lower 60. Right now 55 at the Lake....

782
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,400
What, he earned that money.
- Yea, he did- He is funny.

783
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,330
Speaking of which... I have no cash.

784
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:22,160
Come here, I wanna show you something.

785
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,780
It's such a beautiful day, isn't.
- Yeah, it is a really perfect day-

786
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:43,300
Do you believe in fate?
- Not really-

787
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:47,380
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.
Come here.

788
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,370
So, what do you wanna do today?
- I think we should stay here for a while.-

789
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:15,360
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

790
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,380
Good Morning, Jeff.
- Good Morning, Captain-

791
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:43,550
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera
cloak. In her hand were 5 playing cards."

792
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:52,570
"At some point today, you re gonna
hear about a failed terrorist attack
on a commuter train near Chicago."

793
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,980
You and I kept that bomb from going off.

794
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,920
<i>An attempted bombing on a
CCR train outside Chicago</i>

795
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:04,900
but it was foiled. and the suspect was
found on board....

796
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,720
Named Derek Frost.

797
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,570
Goodwin, anything I can help you with?

798
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:21,800
No, that's fine,
I'll come back later.

799
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,180
Well, keep an eye out.

800
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:35,580
One of these days,
the right crisis is going to rear its head

801
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,690
and Source Code is going to have
its moment in the sun.

802
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,280
Yes, Sir.

803
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:54,270
If you re reading this email, then
Source Code works even better than
you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

804
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:59,060
You thought you were creating 8
minutes of a past event, but you're not.

805
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:02,650
You've created a whole new world.

806
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,900
Goodwin, if I am right...

807
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:11,550
Somewhere at the Source Code facility,
you have a Captain Colter Stevens,
waiting to send on a mission.

808
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:16,050
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.

809
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,600
Tell him, everything is gonna be ok.

810
