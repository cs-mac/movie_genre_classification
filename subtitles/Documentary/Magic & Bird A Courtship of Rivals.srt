{3392}{3479}Did you knock 'em dead Corky?
{3481}{3520}I did everything right.
{3594}{3673}You mean it went perfect?
{3674}{3730}You're first time on your own.
{3732}{3775}Me not there to see.
{3841}{3879}Don't make it|more than it was.
{3881}{3965}Now don't give me|that inferiority crap.
{3966}{4038}Now, did the lift go okay?
{4039}{4062}I never did it better.
{4063}{4087}Open.
{4089}{4129}Now, when you're|rich and famous,
{4131}{4169}don't you forget me.
{4170}{4198}I'll never forget you.
{4200}{4248}Open.
{4346}{4400}There are not|three guys alive
{4402}{4479}that can do what you|can with those cards.
{4481}{4533}I'm tellin' ya kid,
{4534}{4585}you're as good as the game.
{4587}{4661}Sure, sure, sure.
{4662}{4719}Another Houdini.
{4721}{4780}Where you scared?
{4782}{4851}I sure was when I started.
{4853}{4878}Well I wasn't calm.
{4880}{4918}But then,
{4920}{4945}I wasn't all that worried.
{4947}{4981}I figured I'd uh...
{4982}{5031}done all the practicing|I could so what the hell.
{5061}{5118}Were you the only magician?
{5119}{5142}Yes sir.
{5143}{5174}The men all wanted|to be Bob Dylan
{5176}{5237}and the girls did mostly|Barbara Walters imitations
{5239}{5333}or sang Dolly Parton songs.
{5334}{5357}Some of them panicked
{5358}{5412}before they got up to perform.
{5440}{5476}Not you though?
{5478}{5538}No, not me.
{5540}{5582}See, the guy who was|in charge of everything
{5584}{5635}ran things so well.
{5637}{5701}He had one of those|hourglass egg timers
{5702}{5747}and when he turned|it over you started,
{5749}{5795}and when the sand was finished
{5797}{5841}so were you.
{5842}{5866}Good evening.
{6111}{6146}Tell me kid,
{6147}{6212}did you begin with|some flourishes?
{6214}{6235}Yeah.
{6237}{6260}You always taught me
{6262}{6333}that they were the|best attention grabbers.
{6335}{6384}Was I, was I right?
{6386}{6420}It was amazing.
{6422}{6476}Everybody quick|shut up and watched.
{6478}{6513}No more whispering.
{6514}{6534}Nothing.
{6536}{6576}And once you had 'em Corky,
{6578}{6632}then what did you do?
{6634}{6696}Well I quick told this|pudgy lady at the ringside
{6698}{6730}to please pick|any card she wanted
{6732}{6770}as long as it was|the big casino,
{6772}{6796}the ten of diamonds.
{6798}{6861}Okay, would you please|show the card to the audience?
{6947}{6977}And I forced it|on her perfectly.
{6979}{7043}Everybody loved it|a lot and laughed.
{7045}{7093}And then I went|straight into rising aces.
{7266}{7349}Did the lift work great?
{7351}{7390}Yes sir.
{7392}{7469}The sand was really running|out of that hourglass.
{7470}{7533}And I told myself to forget it
{7535}{7572}and just concentrate|on the moves.
{7574}{7622}So I took my time|and made it work
{7624}{7678}and everybody|applauded like crazy.
{8061}{8106}So I just took|a couple of bows
{8108}{8153}and I got off.
{8344}{8400}Oh kid.
{8402}{8456}Don't bullshit me.
{8552}{8624}I really did|do everything right.
{8626}{8686}Really.
{8688}{8737}Only nobody much cared.
{8785}{8817}And?
{8892}{8926}And?
{9011}{9045}Go on.
{9046}{9082}I guess I just cracked.
{9083}{9123}"You stupid sons of|bitches, "I said,"
{9125}{9148}"Don't you know|how hard that was?"
{9150}{9218}"That's a thousand hours|of my life you just saw."
{9220}{9300}They don't care|from heart kid.
{9302}{9381}They just want|to be entertained.
{9464}{9517}I guess I didn't do|you proud all in all.
{9519}{9594}But did you|talk to the people?
{9596}{9673}Did you use your charm?
{9675}{9729}I can't, and you know that.
{9941}{9969}Corky?
{10046}{10075}You want to be
{10077}{10149}as good as the game.
{10150}{10196}Don't you?
{10198}{10267}You know I do.
{10269}{10331}Then you gotta find yourself
{10333}{10390}some charm kid.
{10454}{10493}How?
{10523}{10585}You'll think of something.
{11199}{11252}Hey man, why don't you...
{11377}{11414}Hi, I'm George Todson, NBC.
{11416}{11450}I'm to meet Mr. Ben Greene.
{11452}{11472}Oh, yes sir.
{11474}{11497}He's right inside.
{11498}{11524}Thank you.
{11530}{11586}Say my man, how come|he goes ahead of us?
{11686}{11712}I guess this boy Withers
{11714}{11781}is your latest sensation, hmm?
{11783}{11839}Oh yeah, sit down.
{11841}{11915}Yeah, since you booked him|into a very classy spot Ben.
{11917}{11946}And I found him here.
{11948}{12009}You know, it's not easy|getting him to move.
{12010}{12031}You want a beer?
{12033}{12062}It's safe.
{12064}{12086}Sure.
{12087}{12129}He likes this place?
{12131}{12177}Well, he bombed here
{12178}{12223}his first time out, you know?
{12225}{12244}But he didn't get...
{12246}{12291}hey, get him a beer garcon.
{12293}{12326}Sure, Budweiser?
{12328}{12354}But he didn't give up.
{12356}{12393}He just worked his|ass off for a year.
{12394}{12413}He come back.
{12414}{12457}And he hit it big.
{12459}{12544}There's never been|a magician like him.
{12546}{12614}You dragged me down|here for a magician?
{12615}{12641}Come on Ben.
{12642}{12669}I run a goddamn network.
{12671}{12694}We can't book those guys
{12696}{12725}on kiddy shows anymore.
{12726}{12778}Now listen,
{12780}{12836}your old man got his|start working for me
{12838}{12860}you little fart.
{12862}{12916}Don't tell me what bombs.
{12918}{12961}Magic is misdirection.
{12962}{12987}That's all it is.
{12989}{13045}And misdirection is|getting the people to look
{13046}{13122}in the wrong place|at the right times.
{13124}{13139}So?
{13141}{13162}So naturally,
{13164}{13214}magic has had a little|trouble on the tube.
{13216}{13243}Why?
{13245}{13278}Because you can't misdirect
{13280}{13337}the goddamn camera.
{13380}{13401}Ladies and gentlemen,
{13402}{13497}a warm welcome for|Mr. Corky Withers.
{13775}{13797}Good evening.
{13812}{13835}Good evening.
{13875}{13922}Ordinary deck of cards.
{13944}{13967}Loaded with stage presence.
{13969}{13991}I can't decide,
{13993}{14021}does he remind me|more of Errol Flynn
{14023}{14058}or Valentino?
{14108}{14126}Thank you.
{14128}{14196}Young lady, would you please|pick any card you want?
{14198}{14229}As long as it's|the big casino,
{14230}{14281}ten of diamonds?
{14283}{14328}Will you show|the audience please?
{14368}{14398}Dynamite opening Ben.
{14400}{14427}Does he actually get better?
{14429}{14455}That's hard to believe.
{14457}{14487}Well he got a little nervous
{14489}{14541}on account|he knows we're here.
{14542}{14580}My teacher was a great man.
{14582}{14645}His name was Merlin, and uh...
{14646}{14709}No, seriously his|name was Merlin, Jr.,
{14710}{14761}and this is his version|of the rising aces.
{14762}{14793}And here were are,|here are the four aces.
{14794}{14813}One,
{14815}{14838}two,
{14839}{14868}three,
{14870}{14891}four.
{14893}{14926}I'm going to place them|back on top of the deck.
{14928}{14986}And would you|please pick any card?
{14987}{15046}Just pick any card.
{15047}{15073}Good.
{15098}{15133}Look at the card, remember it,
{15134}{15182}and cover the aces.
{15183}{15222}Thank you.
{15224}{15278}All right uh...
{15280}{15364}I'm sorry, I did that wrong.
{15366}{15411}You're not supposed to|cover the aces in this trick.
{15413}{15450}Um, I'm sorry.
{15452}{15479}One sec.
{15481}{15537}He's gonna pull|a five card left.
{15538}{15558}Watch him,
{15560}{15602}just watch him, will ya?
{15604}{15653}Goddamn drunks.
{15654}{15692}He's not liftin'|just the top card.
{15694}{15745}He's gonna grab five.
{15747}{15775}Sir, if you think|you can do better,
{15777}{15799}you're welcome to try.
{15801}{15851}Just gimme a hand|getting up there schmucko.
{15853}{15885}And step aside.
{15886}{15931}Okay, you're on.
{15933}{15965}Okay.
{16018}{16054}What's going on.
{16056}{16073}Thank you.
{16074}{16104}You really think|you're that good do you?
{16106}{16187}I'll|guaran-fuckin'-tee ya I am.
{16189}{16205}Thank you.
{16211}{16239}Thank you.
{16258}{16285}Thank you.
{16295}{16312}Thank you.
{16318}{16341}Thank you.
{16346}{16367}Thank you.
{16369}{16395}Ahhh...
{16397}{16427}You ruined the rising aces.
{16429}{16477}So what, screw it.
{16479}{16528}You see the broad|with the big jugs?
{16530}{16571}You mean the ah,|young lady in the feathers?
{16573}{16612}Yeah, I see her so what?
{16614}{16696}Wonder if she'ld like a|roll in the shavings with me?
{16698}{16746}I don't think|you're very funny.
{16748}{16787}Well they do.
{16814}{16834}Thank you.
{16840}{16876}Thank you.
{16891}{16921}A nice gimmick, the dummy.
{16922}{16970}What's his name?
{16971}{17011}Fats.
{17013}{17039}Don't encourage him.
{17041}{17095}I will now change|a diamond into a heart.
{17097}{17145}I guess the reason|I'm such a great lover is um...
{17146}{17171}I don't want to hear|about your sex life
{17173}{17201}if you don't mind.
{17203}{17238}Tell us all about yours then.
{17239}{17282}Everybody likes short stories.
{17284}{17349}Shhh, Don't encourage him|please ladies and gentlemen.
{17454}{17505}That's really|a clever shtick.
{17507}{17531}Thank you.
{17533}{17573}All right,
{17574}{17598}pick a diamond.
{17599}{17622}Huh?
{17624}{17649}I said pick a diamond.
{17651}{17709}All right.
{17710}{17808}It can change into a|heart while I'm holding it.
{17810}{17861}Well, go on,|show the audience.
{17889}{17909}If you're so great,
{17911}{17953}change it while|I'm holding it.
{17955}{17997}You won't give it back to me?
{18081}{18146}Well that's another|trick you've ruined.
{18148}{18167}Let's see,
{18169}{18209}I'll just have to|think of something else.
{18210}{18291}You mean you're not gonna|change my diamond into uh...
{18352}{18385}Jesus Christ.
{18386}{18421}What?
{18422}{18446}It turned into a heart
{18447}{18489}while I was holding it.
{18590}{18609}How'd he do that?
{18615}{18633}How'd he do that?
{18635}{18674}How did he do it?
{18676}{18706}How many times|do I have to tell you.
{18708}{18764}Do you want to|get out of here alive?
{18766}{18797}The kids good,|I'll give him that.
{18798}{18835}Sure he's good.
{18837}{18913}I got me maybe the best|magician in 50 years.
{18915}{19008}Team'd with the first|X-rated dummy on the block.
{19010}{19053}Eat your heart out.
{19120}{19162}You say he really|bombed here first time?
{19164}{19182}Yes.
{19184}{19221}Of course he didn't have|the dummy with him then.
{19223}{19241}The dummy helps.
{19243}{19261}No question.
{19263}{19281}Right.
{19282}{19298}Local talent?
{19300}{19320}No.
{19322}{19361}He was brought up near|Grossinger's in the Catskills.
{19362}{19405}I think his old|man was a limey.
{19407}{19441}Came here to work|in a health club
{19442}{19474}and gave massages.
{19476}{19507}Somethin' like that.
{19509}{19529}It's me.
{19530}{19571}Chick, It's old Gangrene.
{19573}{19601}Gangrene.
{19625}{19652}That's funny.
{19654}{19678}Quick into.
{19680}{19749}Corky, our visitor from|New York, George Todson.
{19750}{19782}How do you do sir?
{19784}{19820}You have a lot of potential.
{19822}{19853}Hey what about me?
{19854}{19893}You're terrific too Fats.
{19894}{19921}Thanks Mr. Wigston,
{19923}{19947}I mean Tubeston.
{19949}{19960}Todson.
{19966}{19987}Todson.
{20011}{20044}Now that's what I call funny.
{20046}{20093}Hey, you'll strain|your pacemaker.
{20094}{20123}Behave yourself.
{20125}{20182}Come here a second, will ya?
{20184}{20224}Ah, by the way,
{20226}{20282}how did you change|the diamond to the heart?
{20284}{20336}I'm the misdirection dummy.
{20338}{20361}While we're bullshittin',
{20362}{20409}you could bring an|elephant on to the stage.
{20410}{20440}Which is why this magician
{20442}{20481}will not bomb on the tube.
{20483}{20506}Why?
{20507}{20566}Because the goddamn|camera watches their faces
{20568}{20604}and not Corky's hands.
{20606}{20643}So you live and you learn.
{20645}{20655}See ya.
{20657}{20684}Bye.
{20686}{20724}Yeah, all right.
{20726}{20753}How'd it go?
{20754}{20809}Sen-fuckin'-sational.
{20811}{20839}See I'm catching.
{20841}{20880}What happens next?
{20882}{20956}Well, we reel 'em in slow.
{20994}{21029}The same kind of|low key build up
{21030}{21089}we gave|Steve Martin last year.
{21090}{21135}I'm not lettin' you|near New York,
{21137}{21186}till we're close|to making a deal.
{21188}{21217}So I just stay here?
{21219}{21261}No, first,|I'd like to book you
{21263}{21337}in a small lounge in|Vegas for the experience.
{21339}{21373}Then the area talk shows.
{21374}{21434}You know,|Tom Snyder, Mike Douglas.
{21436}{21472}All leading to Carson.
{21474}{21529}And if he asks|you to come back,
{21530}{21569}I think he will,
{21571}{21609}that should do it.
{21610}{21685}So, you keep motor|mouth here in line,
{21686}{21709}while I work on them
{21710}{21755}droolers at the network.
{21757}{21816}It should take five,|maybe six months.
{21818}{21909}Now, when I buy|you a free lunch
{21911}{21979}at the|Four Seasons in New York,
{21981}{22021}you'll know you're home free.
{22023}{22060}Sound okay?
{22062}{22086}Yes sir.
{22088}{22135}You're a good kid Corky.
{22385}{22431}Hey, you know what I think?
{22433}{22484}No, what do you think?
{22486}{22557}We're gonna be a star.
{23542}{23571}Zachary!
{23573}{23620}Seems like I'm|breaking the law.
{23622}{23661}I'll see that no|one touches it sir.
{23662}{23741}No one must ever touch|a Rolls, but a Rolls man.
{23743}{23765}Yes sir.
{23890}{23919}Margo, will you|show this gentleman
{23921}{23965}to Mr. Greene's table please?
{24344}{24359}Hi.
{24365}{24397}Hi.
{24398}{24455}Is everything all right?
{24457}{24474}They want me?
{24476}{24520}The uh, network people I mean.
{24522}{24557}May I?
{24558}{24595}Yeah, thank you.
{24597}{24663}Have a cigar for later Corky.
{24742}{24803}Take two, they're are big.
{24805}{24873}I invented|conspicuous consumption.
{24874}{24940}Don't you forget that.
{24942}{25033}If you're trying to|get my attention you got it.
{25035}{25123}Will you do me a favor kid,
{25125}{25194}will you try not|to turn shit heel.
{25196}{25233}It's almost an automatic
{25234}{25288}once a guy makes it big.
{25290}{25367}I'd love to see|you beat the odds.
{25369}{25398}Maybe I won't make it big.
{25400}{25422}Come on, tell me.
{25424}{25447}What is it.
{25449}{25492}Two years ago,|you couldn't get arrested.
{25494}{25516}Two years from now
{25518}{25563}you are going to have it all.
{25565}{25674}Corky, NBC wants|a pilot special.
{25676}{25697}What's that?
{25698}{25747}What's that,
{25749}{25813}it's what they gave|Rich Little a while back.
{25815}{25838}Menu sir?
{25840}{25877}Ah, you see, when|they're hot for somebody
{25878}{25902}like they're hot for you,
{25904}{25955}they make a contract which|hinges on the first show.
{25957}{25977}And if it hits,
{25979}{26040}you're off and running|for a bunch more.
{26093}{26114}Terrific.
{26116}{26152}That's why they|call me the Postman,
{26154}{26197}I always deliver.
{26254}{26282}Is it set and, everything?
{26284}{26328}It's set but|it's not set, set.
{26330}{26401}There's agent stuff like who|pays how much for publicity,
{26403}{26438}how much for the guest stars.
{26440}{26489}You'll have to|take a medical exam
{26491}{26540}and stuff like that.
{26611}{26659}Now what's wrong.
{26661}{26718}Um...
{26720}{26820}I don't think I'm going|to take the medical exam.
{26822}{26899}Any particular reason.
{26901}{26940}Principle.
{26942}{27001}What the hell does|that mean, principle?
{27035}{27065}Do you remember|that first night
{27066}{27112}when you came backstage|at the uh, Stardust
{27114}{27201}and you said, you wouldn't|mind representing me.
{27202}{27222}Do you remember what I said?
{27224}{27247}You're goddamn right.
{27249}{27279}You said that|I could represent you
{27281}{27348}but you didn't want to sign.
{27350}{27389}That was principle too.
{27390}{27439}Because if we're|happy with each other,
{27441}{27475}our word should be enough.
{27477}{27532}To hell with signing|some piece of paper.
{27534}{27615}Why is this with the|medical exam principle?
{27617}{27677}Because they're saying|something wrong with me.
{27679}{27718}And I say I'm fine.
{27720}{27760}I'm fine.
{27762}{27789}I don't need any doctors
{27791}{27846}poking around|inside me that's all.
{27848}{27887}Are you serious about this?
{27941}{27989}I mean is this a deal breaker?
{28049}{28088}Yeah, I guess it is.
{28189}{28235}Sadie, Sadie.
{28237}{28260}I have to put you on hold.
{28262}{28327}Sadie, what's the first|rule for being an agent?
{28329}{28379}Never forget an|act that killed Lincoln.
{28381}{28419}Head of the class.
{28421}{28504}Get me Bernstein in Legal.
{28506}{28544}Corky has turned impossible.
{28546}{28577}I don't believe it.
{28579}{28626}Well, I should have|been a cesspool cleaner
{28627}{28669}like my mama wanted.
{28708}{28733}Corky's so cheap,
{28734}{28770}last night he sent his|girlfriend out to hustle.
{28772}{28793}It's not true, not true.
{28795}{28836}Just ignore him.
{28838}{28864}When she came|back this morning,
{28866}{28895}he asked how much she'd|gotten and she said
{28897}{28939}"Sixteen dollars|and ten cents".
{28941}{28984}Corky said "ten cents?
{28986}{29029}My God, who gave|you ten cents?"
{29030}{29074}And she said "Everybody".
{29076}{29119}Dammit.
{29121}{29180}Everybody, she said,
{29182}{29212}Body, body, body.
{29214}{29241}Dody, dudy, duny.
{29243}{29258}And she said...
{29264}{29294}And she said...
{29296}{29333}and she said everybody.
{29464}{29491}Hello?
{29493}{29542}I've been having|meetings for hours.
{29544}{29596}I couldn't budge 'em Cork.
{29598}{29645}I thought you|said they wanted me?
{29647}{29691}Well they do Cork, but...
{29693}{29732}Didn't you explain|about the principle?
{29734}{29801}Now kid,|this is network policy.
{29803}{29853}It's legal policy.
{29854}{29880}Now I'm sitting here
{29882}{29933}with three of our|genius lawyers,
{29934}{29979}my God, their IQ's alone
{29981}{30033}must total up to 100.
{30034}{30116}Now we have called|NBC a dozen times
{30118}{30144}and they are not,
{30146}{30198}I repeat not about to spend
{30200}{30231}a half a million bucks
{30233}{30268}only to find out on taping day
{30270}{30307}that there's some|kinda health problem.
{30309}{30337}There's no problem.
{30339}{30360}Corky!
{30362}{30396}Make 'em understand.
{30493}{30553}Well...
{30555}{30615}shoo will you fellas.
{30617}{30656}Let me handle this alone.
{30658}{30687}Yep.
{30689}{30723}Good luck Ben.
{30934}{30958}Yeah.
{30960}{30996}Now kid I don't|have to ask you
{30998}{31020}what the trouble is.
{31022}{31059}'Cause I know|what the trouble is.
{31061}{31102}I've told you once before.
{31104}{31158}It's just success kid.
{31160}{31193}Please believe me.
{31194}{31223}You want success
{31225}{31258}but you're afraid of it.
{31260}{31330}Now that happens to|everybody at this stage.
{31332}{31361}I'm not afraid.
{31362}{31387}Now you stay right there.
{31389}{31412}and I'll be right over
{31414}{31441}and we'll talk it through.
{31442}{31469}I'm not afraid.
{31471}{31496}Hang tight kid.
{31498}{31521}I'm on my way.
{31522}{31560}I won't be here.
{32396}{32463}We should hit Grossinger's|inside another 20 minutes.
{32465}{32494}Never mind that.
{32496}{32533}Take your next left.
{32534}{32561}Here.
{32770}{32813}Keep going into town.
{33351}{33393}Your place?
{33395}{33454}I was brought up here.
{33456}{33541}Must remember it being|a whole lot bigger huh?
{33543}{33577}No.
{33638}{33681}Wanna look around.
{33682}{33739}No point.
{33741}{33782}Family all gone huh?
{33850}{33880}Yeah.
{33882}{33918}Ah, you're lucky.
{33952}{34022}I live with four brothers.
{34024}{34075}All assholes.
{34689}{34761}I don't want to come on|like some ghoul, but uh...
{34762}{34810}do you got people in there?
{34844}{34874}People?
{34933}{34974}Just family.
{35374}{35445}You look a lot like|yourself, you know that?
{35446}{35489}Yeah, I caught you on the|Carson Show a couple times.
{35491}{35537}You must make|a ton for that huh?
{35538}{35568}How'd you luck into that?
{35570}{35580}You know?
{35582}{35605}See, I sing great.
{35606}{35663}I know they'd cream over me.
{35665}{35723}My agent,|William Morris, arranged it.
{35725}{35748}Is this Morris guy
{35750}{35781}a personal friend of Carson?
{35782}{35809}Is that how that works?
{35810}{35869}William Morris is the name|of a agency, not a guy.
{35870}{35888}Oh.
{35890}{35927}Hold it, right here.
{35929}{35966}Pull over to your left.
{36017}{36052}Fine.
{36054}{36094}Hey, this is|Lake Melody ain't it?
{36227}{36257}I'll be right back.
{36830}{36902}Anybody?
{36904}{36940}Anybody home?
{37003}{37042}What do you want?
{37044}{37089}A cabin.
{37090}{37177}We're kinda closed.
{37179}{37236}Something above the|lake is what I'm after.
{37238}{37287}It's just the kind of|place I'm looking for.
{37289}{37331}I won't be disturbed here.
{37333}{37361}That's for sure.
{37362}{37422}But like I said,
{37424}{37491}we're kinda closed.
{37493}{37530}$50 bucks a night.
{37532}{37581}In advance.
{37583}{37620}We just re-opened.
{37656}{37677}If you don't want me waitin'?
{37679}{37725}How you gonna|get to Grossinger's?
{37726}{37767}I'll call a|local cab when I need one.
{37769}{37788}How much?
{37790}{37810}$80 bucks,
{37812}{37884}not countin' tip.
{37886}{37920}Okay.
{37922}{37962}Uh...
{37964}{38029}Here's a hundred|for the driving,
{38030}{38069}and another hundred,
{38071}{38136}for a favor.
{38138}{38179}Name it.
{38181}{38257}You didn't bring|me here, okay?
{38322}{38351}Okay.
{38353}{38377}Good.
{38379}{38396}Thanks.
{38896}{38937}What you see|is what you get.
{38938}{38986}The um, the|bedroom's back there
{38987}{39039}and the kitchenette|and the bathroom across.
{39041}{39085}Fine.
{39087}{39118}Here's your key.
{39554}{39579}Help!
{39599}{39648}Help!
{39650}{39705}Calling all schmucko's.
{39707}{39742}Save me.
{40084}{40125}Hi.
{40130}{40162}Hi.
{40404}{40463}Jesus Christ.
{40465}{40516}This is Grossinger's?
{40634}{40699}I wonder if her ass|is on ball bearings.
{40701}{40730}Shut up.
{40732}{40809}Oh, sounds like|I stepped on a corn.
{40811}{40892}Sorry.
{40894}{40973}It's just that I carried|her picture all these years.
{40974}{41068}And she didn't remember me.
{41070}{41109}Aw...
{41549}{41609}He didn't remember me.
{41842}{41900}Hello?
{41902}{41965}Sorry to bother you.
{41966}{42031}Oh, that's all right.
{42116}{42179}No soap.
{42181}{42231}I didn't think you'd like it.
{42233}{42258}You leaving now?
{42260}{42326}No I didn't mean|no soap that way.
{42328}{42379}I meant there wasn't any soap,
{42381}{42425}or towels either.
{42426}{42502}Oh, come on in|here and grab one.
{42540}{42566}Oh, oh my God,
{42568}{42663}you brought Fats.
{42665}{42735}You thought|Peg didn't remember.
{42737}{42784}Aw...
{42786}{42861}You knew who I was too?
{42862}{42894}Yeah.
{43026}{43049}Well why didn't you two
{43050}{43114}at least grunt at each other?
{43116}{43181}He's just as cute|as he is on the tube?
{43183}{43205}Cute?
{43207}{43230}Virile yes.
{43232}{43260}Sexy yes.
{43262}{43305}Ronald Reagan is cute.
{43306}{43346}Oh please, could I hold him,
{43348}{43403}I'll be careful.
{43405}{43437}Oh, he's heavy.
{43438}{43476}Husky you bimbo.
{43478}{43506}His lips didn't move.
{43508}{43586}That's because you're not|stroking my levers sweetheart.
{43588}{43620}Right in there.
{43622}{43677}Oh, she goosed me.
{43679}{43709}Ignore him, go right ahead.
{43711}{43739}Okay.
{43747}{43782}There.
{43806}{43823}And there.
{43825}{43844}I see.
{44014}{44053}I love it.
{44110}{44158}Hey, she hugged|me to her bosom.
{44160}{44206}I suspect she|found me irresistible.
{44207}{44244}Don't we all?
{44246}{44297}She asked you|over for dinner, huh?
{44299}{44357}How long are|you going to stay?
{44358}{44395}I don't know, why?
{44397}{44429}If you stayed late,|that might mean
{44431}{44482}you was getting|hugged to her bosom too
{44484}{44532}which just might|make old Fats jealous
{44534}{44573}and we wouldn't want that,
{44575}{44622}would we now?
{44624}{44659}Hmm?
{44734}{44771}You never really told,
{44773}{44810}why you were here.
{44812}{44870}I'm hiding.
{44872}{44940}Gotta get my head on straight.
{44942}{44999}My agent,
{45001}{45042}he looks like|the Ancient Mariner
{45044}{45097}in that poem we|hated in high school.
{45099}{45133}He's negotiating|for a shot for me
{45134}{45196}to maybe make it big.
{45198}{45246}We argued.
{45248}{45302}But I thought it|was just principle.
{45304}{45390}The truth is probably|I'm scared of success.
{45392}{45452}That's all.
{45454}{45492}You always were this
{45494}{45541}weirdly timid person Cork.
{45542}{45581}That's for sure.
{45658}{45701}Your folks still|run this place?
{45703}{45767}No, they took|a motel in Florida.
{45769}{45793}Gave this place to me.
{45795}{45869}But I just couldn't|make a go of it.
{45870}{45894}Too bad.
{45949}{46013}The Catskills are dying|and that's the truth.
{46015}{46102}Me and Duke|are lookin' to sell.
{46104}{46182}God, you're beautiful.
{46184}{46222}Don't I wish.
{46339}{46382}I had such a crush on you.
{46384}{46484}No one ever accused you|of having good taste, Cork.
{46486}{46544}When I moved away|I whittled you a present,
{46546}{46592}a wooden heart.
{46594}{46630}You never gave|it to me though.
{46632}{46685}I lost it before|I got it finished.
{46770}{46831}I knew you had a crush on me.
{46833}{46876}I was always pretty for you.
{46878}{46904}I didn't say pretty.
{46906}{46968}You didn't pick up on|my Duke mention either.
{46970}{47009}After all, he is my consort.
{47010}{47053}My spouse.
{47054}{47180}I'm very big on|enlarging my vocabulary.
{47182}{47217}Are you very big on Duke?
{47218}{47279}We seem to separate|what seems like,
{47281}{47339}every full moon,
{47341}{47366}it hasn't been your everyday
{47368}{47457}Walt Disney type marriage.
{47458}{47495}Where is he?
{47546}{47580}Quick business trip.
{47666}{47739}I'm sorry.
{47741}{47789}Tell me, does he...
{47791}{47862}does he still|look like James Dean?
{47953}{47988}Hey.
{48018}{48053}Hey.
{48113}{48183}Hearty burgundy.
{48185}{48273}Very medicinal.
{48274}{48307}Peg?
{48319}{48393}Admit it, now I'm beautiful.
{48590}{48628}How was the orgy?
{48630}{48729}Did you score?
{48731}{48757}The high point of the evening
{48759}{48807}was when|I reduced her to tears.
{48902}{48965}That-a-boy schmucko.
{48998}{49084}Hey, when are we movin' on?
{49086}{49138}Tomorrow.
{49140}{49218}The day after.
{49220}{49247}Soon.
{49340}{49371}Peggy Ann Snow,|Peggy Ann Snow,
{49373}{49400}please let me follow,
{49402}{49453}where ever you go.
{49487}{49560}Why'd you close the door?
{49562}{49593}I'm contemplating|taking a piss,
{49595}{49636}do you mind?
{49638}{49715}Ooh, fancy yancy.
{49746}{49813}Hey stick your|head out here one sec.
{49917}{49973}Was you thinkin' about her?
{50449}{50481}...stuff like that.
{50482}{50570}So how long did you|work with this Merlin guy?
{50572}{50625}I worked for him, years.
{50627}{50658}But uh, he taught|me everything.
{50660}{50684}But I never performed.
{50686}{50729}Never on my own.
{50730}{50768}Why not?
{50770}{50817}Probably afraid I'd fail.
{50819}{50837}Dope.
{50925}{50969}It wasn't 'til the week|he took really sick.
{50971}{51005}And uh, he begged me
{51006}{51084}that I got the guts to try.
{51086}{51162}Did you bring any|tricks up with you.
{51164}{51184}No.
{51186}{51210}I don't do tricks.
{51212}{51287}Tricks means something|set up beforehand.
{51289}{51317}A box with a fake lid.
{51318}{51357}A stacked deck of cards.
{51359}{51396}I don't do that.
{51398}{51455}Will you just use|whatever's available?
{51457}{51489}Yeah.
{51491}{51519}Ah.
{51521}{51541}Here.
{51543}{51601}Amaze me.
{51603}{51622}A stone?
{51624}{51641}Oh come on will ya.
{51643}{51716}Well that was available.
{51718}{51736}Oh, do it again.
{51738}{51765}Do it again.
{51766}{51796}Certainly.
{51798}{51828}Oh, come on.
{51830}{51884}Okay.
{51886}{51916}You bastard.
{51918}{51940}You bastard.
{51942}{51968}I really love magic.
{51970}{52019}No magic, it's just skill.
{52021}{52060}All explainable.
{52062}{52122}I don't think|I want to believe that.
{52124}{52157}Can you explain everything?
{52159}{52200}Pretty much.
{52202}{52254}What can't you explain.
{52256}{52285}Look I don't want|to get into this.
{52286}{52318}Magic's just to entertain.
{52320}{52368}You're not supposed|to take it seriously.
{52370}{52417}What can't you explain?
{52469}{52552}Merlin, his wife was|his assistant before me.
{52554}{52575}They were close.
{52577}{52617}They really cared.
{52619}{52652}Those last days in|the hospital with her
{52654}{52740}he claimed he|could read her mind.
{52742}{52812}You believe that don't you?
{52814}{52841}I don't know.
{52842}{52891}I want to I guess.
{52893}{52912}See in their act,
{52914}{52981}they used to do a lot|of phony telepathy crap.
{52983}{53007}Mostly cards.
{53009}{53072}Then at the end they both|wanted to do it for real.
{53074}{53126}To prove to each other|how much they cared,
{53128}{53151}is how he put it.
{53153}{53173}Do you know
{53174}{53220}the exact procedures|they did and everything?
{53222}{53254}Sure.
{53256}{53307}Look, I don't want|to get into this.
{53309}{53332}Oh, it'll be fun.
{53334}{53353}Come on.
{53354}{53371}I'd fail.
{53373}{53398}So what.
{53400}{53481}I don't want you thinkin'|bad of me let's say.
{53482}{53498}Okay.
{53500}{53521}Forget the whole thing.
{53522}{53559}I'm trying to get away|from pressure, please.
{53561}{53598}So who's putting|you under pressure?
{53600}{53623}Not me.
{53625}{53654}Just thought|it might be a kick.
{53656}{53697}But it's forgotten.
{53820}{53869}Now we've each|shuffled a deck, okay?
{53871}{53905}Now you take mine.
{53980}{54057}So...
{54059}{54101}just spread your|cards like this.
{54177}{54206}Fine.
{54208}{54237}Okay.
{54239}{54304}Now take one card, any card.
{54306}{54337}Look at it.
{54375}{54424}And remember it.
{54426}{54445}Now what?
{54446}{54477}Now come on,|you must really look at it.
{54478}{54506}I'm looking, I'm looking,
{54508}{54541}don't be mad.
{54543}{54562}Okay.
{54564}{54623}Just concentrate|on that one card.
{54625}{54663}Now gather your cards up.
{54795}{54869}Place the card back face down.
{54870}{54919}Good.
{54921}{54971}Just cut the cards once.
{55102}{55150}Just take my deck.
{55152}{55182}Look for your card.
{55184}{55219}When you find it,
{55221}{55251}take it out.
{55310}{55352}Tell me when you've found it.
{55476}{55502}Okay.
{55504}{55518}Okay?
{55520}{55541}What happens now?
{55543}{55605}What happened|with Merlin was uh,
{55607}{55663}she put the card|next to her heart.
{55665}{55736}And uh, he went through|her deck kind of like this.
{55738}{55787}Uh...
{55971}{55994}What's my card?
{55996}{56015}I don't know.
{56017}{56073}You must really think hard.
{56074}{56100}Okay.
{56102}{56181}Okay, I'm|thinking really hard.
{56183}{56273}Well?
{56274}{56298}I'm sorry.
{56299}{56316}Well don't stop.
{56318}{56398}I'm concentrating my ass off.
{56400}{56434}Okay.
{56618}{56657}My God it's red isn't it?
{56658}{56701}It's red.
{56702}{56738}Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
{56740}{56770}I give away nothing.
{56772}{56788}Come on concentrate,
{56790}{56822}just concentrate.
{57100}{57164}Hey.
{57166}{57187}Show me.
{57429}{57460}We came close, what the hell.
{57462}{57492}Sit down Peg.
{57494}{57513}Get back down.
{57515}{57537}That was your fault.
{57538}{57562}You started out fine.
{57564}{57589}But then you let me drift.
{57591}{57626}Jesus Cork, forget it.
{57628}{57658}I was in bad shape|in New York, Peg,
{57660}{57689}and I had to run.
{57690}{57729}Where do you go when|there's no place to go?
{57731}{57754}You go home.
{57756}{57784}Except there was|nothing but empty houses
{57786}{57829}and old cemeteries.
{57830}{57868}And I figured|I'd stop by here
{57870}{57899}and ask your folks about you.
{57901}{57949}Where were you living,|what city, how many kids?
{57951}{57981}Never expected|to find you here.
{57982}{58025}I've loved you|all my goddamn life.
{58027}{58087}I needed a piece of good|news about Peggy Ann Snow.
{58089}{58156}Shuffle the|goddamn cards fast.
{58158}{58213}We're gonna do|it right this time.
{58214}{58277}I just know we will,|because we both want it a lot.
{58425}{58452}Give me your deck.
{58519}{58553}Take my deck.
{58554}{58623}Spread the cards.
{58625}{58648}Take your card.
{58650}{58665}Pick it out.
{58667}{58729}Look at it.
{58731}{58760}Put it back on top.
{58838}{58882}Now, cut the deck once.
{58975}{59012}Take my deck,|look for your card.
{59145}{59247}When you find it tell me.
{59249}{59288}Look at me.
{59346}{59365}Should I think now.
{59366}{59401}Yes, very hard.
{59402}{59419}I am.
{59421}{59461}You're not, I can tell|by your eyes your not.
{59463}{59497}Well I'm frightened is why.
{59498}{59525}Nothing to be afraid of.
{59527}{59549}If it goes bad.
{59550}{59571}It won't go bad,
{59573}{59639}not if two people want|something as much as this.
{59641}{59724}There must be nothing|in your mind but your card.
{59726}{59767}Nothing in your mind but...
{59836}{59886}What?
{59888}{59930}My card.
{60125}{60153}Concentrate.
{60470}{60512}Just think, think hard.
{61074}{61109}Is it...
{61140}{61166}Please is it...
{61252}{61311}Is it the three of clubs?
{61402}{61437}The three of clubs?
{61646}{61681}I didn't fail.
{61705}{61729}I didn't fail.
{61761}{61790}I didn't fail.
{61834}{61863}I didn't fail.
{64746}{64765}I'll bet they don't give
{64766}{64809}service like that|at Grossinger's.
{64894}{64986}Drop in again in 15 years.
{64988}{65049}Why the jokes?
{65051}{65137}I'm kind of feeling|my way along.
{65139}{65194}I never fooled around before.
{65196}{65271}True.
{65273}{65339}I guess sex wasn't that|big a deal in my life.
{65425}{65496}What about Duke?
{65498}{65566}Mainly he blew|in my ear a lot.
{65568}{65601}True.
{65602}{65717}I deceived him into|thinking it drives me mad.
{65718}{65749}He tongues away at me
{65750}{65800}and I moan a lot but...
{65802}{65868}secretly I'm making|a grocery list.
{65952}{66017}Oh, I can be|a very crappy lady
{66018}{66071}if I put my mind to it.
{66102}{66142}Come here.
{66194}{66232}Let's you and me take off.
{66234}{66265}Just us.
{66266}{66309}You don't care for|Duke and you know it.
{66311}{66343}I dump Duke,
{66345}{66367}and you'd leave Fats,
{66369}{66387}that's your offer?
{66389}{66478}Yeah, just say the|word and we'll go.
{66480}{66536}A man appears after 15 years.
{66538}{66589}Says run away with me.
{66591}{66626}A girl ought to at least
{66628}{66672}be able to|take a bubble bath.
{66674}{66718}Think about it, right?
{66783}{66873}Why in the hell were you so|shy all those years ago, huh?
{67363}{67407}Hey what do you|say sports fans.
{67446}{67463}What's the matter?
{67465}{67494}Getting your period?
{67496}{67542}Feeling kinda blue.
{67544}{67582}I miss the city bad.
{67584}{67618}Oh the country grows on you.
{67620}{67662}So does fungus.
{67743}{67789}I told you once|already we'd leave.
{67790}{67816}When?
{67818}{67903}When I want to, now drop it.
{67905}{67928}What's so great here?
{67930}{67951}Tell me that.
{67953}{67990}Simmer down okay?
{67992}{68020}Okay.
{68105}{68143}Hey, how's this|for a solution?
{68145}{68200}You stay around|here and turn hayseed
{68202}{68257}and I'll head|back to Manhattan.
{68326}{68370}I take it the|silence means no?
{68372}{68395}Discussion's over.
{68397}{68420}That's all.
{68498}{68529}I want out of here!
{68530}{68561}Simmer the hell down!
{68562}{68582}Just because...
{68584}{68598}Watch it mister!
{68600}{68619}Just because some...
{68621}{68639}You've been warned!
{68641}{68692}Just because some|sagging bitch of an ingenue
{68694}{68723}drops her pants for you!
{68725}{68742}Shut up!
{68744}{68773}Corky, you do it so good.
{68775}{68822}You're even better|than the garbage men.
{68933}{68983}Hey Ben,
{68985}{69005}how do you like it?
{69007}{69032}I think it's|going to be terrific.
{69034}{69065}What's with Gangrene?
{69066}{69099}Blue Cross|repossess your tongue?
{69101}{69118}Come on in, shut up.
{69120}{69166}Come on in Ben, I'll do|the whole routine for you?
{69168}{69196}How the hell did|you ever find me.
{69198}{69226}You're amazing.
{69228}{69264}I'll bet it was|that kid cab driver.
{69266}{69315}He must've called|the office and found ya.
{69317}{69344}Is that right, that's it?
{69346}{69392}Yeah, I told him|I was with William Morris.
{69394}{69413}He looked like a hustler,
{69414}{69448}so I gave him a|hundred to shut him up.
{69450}{69502}How much did|you give him to talk.
{69504}{69525}Doesn't matter.
{69527}{69562}Right, right,|right, right, right.
{69564}{69593}Right, you're here,|that's the main thing.
{69595}{69637}That's it, right.
{69639}{69667}Come on, grab yourself a seat.
{69669}{69710}And uh, watch.
{69712}{69743}Just remember that|I haven't got this
{69745}{69800}anywhere near|performance level yet.
{69802}{69896}How long ya|been like this kid?
{69898}{69929}Like what?
{69930}{69968}Oh my God, you don't|think that was for real?
{69970}{70022}How'd you think I rehearse?
{70024}{70049}It's no good.
{70051}{70111}It's for the act|for Christ sakes!
{70113}{70149}Watch now.
{70151}{70179}Ladies and Gentlemen,
{70181}{70210}for your viewing pleasure.
{70212}{70245}My version of|the Miser's Dream.
{70247}{70268}Was it a wet dream?
{70270}{70289}Shut up.
{70290}{70309}Imagine if you will.
{70311}{70338}When I have a wet dream|all that happens
{70340}{70381}is I wake up|covered with sawdust.
{70382}{70408}If you don't stop interrupting
{70410}{70436}I'm going to put|a contract out on you
{70438}{70468}with a mafia woodpecker.
{70470}{70517}Oh, what I wouldn't|give for a woodpecker.
{70518}{70575}Would you be quiet.
{70577}{70603}Don't encourage him,|ladies and gentlemen.
{70605}{70640}It's really a great|beginning, isn't it Ben.
{70642}{70719}Is this why you wouldn't|take the medical exam?
{70721}{70771}You figured|somebody'd find out?
{70773}{70793}Bullshit!
{70794}{70877}I'll take the stupid exam!
{70879}{70912}I was afraid of|success like you said.
{70914}{70946}I needed to get|my head on straight.
{70948}{70979}I'll take the exam,
{70981}{70997}do the show,
{70998}{71022}whatever you want.
{71024}{71090}What I want kid?
{71092}{71162}What I want is for|you to see somebody.
{71164}{71200}Who would I see?
{71202}{71228}Quit with the games!
{71230}{71253}Quit with the yelling!
{71254}{71272}Shut up!
{71274}{71305}He should show a little|grati-fuckin'-tude.
{71307}{71328}You been slavin' away,
{71330}{71357}comin' up with|the great new stuff.
{71358}{71401}That was blockbuster|material mister.
{71403}{71441}When I come back with|Woody the Woodpecker,
{71443}{71479}they'll plotz in Vegas.
{71481}{71526}That's funny.
{71528}{71568}Nothin's funny.
{71570}{71608}Not anymore.
{71610}{71675}What are you gonna do?
{71677}{71726}I'm gonna make|a few phone calls.
{71728}{71754}Tell people you mean?
{71756}{71832}Corky, you ain't in control!
{71923}{71969}Ben,
{72009}{72061}you owe me a listen|don't you think?
{72305}{72364}Yeah, I was kind of out|of control back in the city.
{72366}{72427}I uh...
{72429}{72464}I could feel myself
{72466}{72530}starting to slip|down the iceberg.
{72532}{72571}So you took off,
{72573}{72605}and now you're fine?
{72607}{72618}Sure.
{72620}{72639}On account of Peg.
{72641}{72679}The local town pump,|terrific knockers.
{72681}{72721}Look Fats, please.
{72723}{72776}Come on will ya?
{72778}{72804}Sorry.
{72806}{72854}Um...
{72856}{72892}I've known her|ever since high school.
{72894}{72977}I never figured I'd have|a chance with her, but uh,
{72978}{73013}now everything's changed.
{73015}{73058}She believes in me.
{73060}{73087}Listen...
{73089}{73193}girls are for|down the line kid.
{73195}{73278}Right now, you|gotta let me help you.

{73319}{73349}Beautiful doctors.
{73351}{73377}He means headshrinkers.
{73379}{73405}He just thinks|you're a fruit cake.
{73407}{73446}He doesn't, he never|said that, he's on our side.
{73448}{73469}He's the villain.
{73471}{73493}Don't forget that.
{73495}{73543}Never forget that.
{73545}{73573}Hey kid.
{73651}{73700}I'm gonna ask|you to do something.
{73702}{73741}It's a little something
{73743}{73794}anybody ought|to be able to do.
{73796}{73825}Now if you can do it, fine.
{73827}{73897}We'll forget this whole thing.
{73899}{73938}But if you can't,
{73940}{74044}we'll think about getting|you to see somebody fast.
{74046}{74125}Is it a deal?
{74126}{74171}Name it.
{74173}{74201}Make Fats shut up
{74203}{74252}for five minutes.
{74565}{74623}Five minutes.
{74625}{74695}I can make him|shut up for five years.
{74697}{74733}Wonderful.
{75148}{75230}I feel like|the village idiot
{75232}{75268}if you want to know the truth.
{75466}{75530}Can we talk or is it going|to be strictly semaphore?
{76159}{76196}How long so far?
{76286}{76403}There's 30 seconds.
{76405}{76441}Gosh, that's uh...
{76443}{76505}four and a half|minutes to go.

{77249}{77320}A pro never forgets|his good lines kid.
{77427}{77469}How long now?
{77550}{77593}Coming up to a minute.
{77748}{77864}Do you think we'll|laugh about this some day?
{77866}{77916}We might.
{77918}{77945}Make a terrific scene
{77946}{77992}if you ever decide to|write your autobiography.
{77994}{78030}Hey I know what|you should call it, um...
{78066}{78095}"Failing Upwards",
{78097}{78153}or, "How to Succeed|in Show Business,
{78155}{78196}by Outliving Everybody".
{78338}{78369}Two minutes yet?
{78518}{78575}A minute fortyfive.
{78691}{78747}This is very cruel|of you, you know that?
{78799}{78845}I don't mean it to be.
{78961}{79041}I don't know if I'll ever|be able to forgive you.
{79042}{79134}Well, that would be sad.
{79136}{79189}Time?
{79190}{79236}It's uh...
{79238}{79306}two and a half minutes to go.
{79524}{79576}I can't make it.
{79638}{79726}Well, I didn't|think you could.
{79815}{79833}Hello everybody.
{79835}{79861}This is Mrs. Norman Main.
{79863}{79897}My mother thanks you,|my father thanks you,
{79898}{79938}my sister thanks you,|and I thank you.
{79940}{79972}You have nothing|to fear but fear itself.

{80106}{80180}Here's Fats.
{80281}{80304}You're not lettin'|him outta here.
{80306}{80356}He's the villain,|don't forget that.
{80358}{80417}Hey, I think you|better sit down.
{80419}{80466}Hey kid,
{80468}{80521}I have lived through|Tallulah Bankhead
{80522}{80568}and the death of Vaudeville.
{80570}{80605}I don't scare easy.
{80606}{80640}I need my chance.
{80642}{80689}Your only chance|is to get help fast
{80690}{80747}and that's what I'm|going to see happens.
{80810}{80889}Don't, ever raise|a hand to me again.
{80891}{80962}You're taking my one chance.
{80964}{81020}I'm your one chance.
{81136}{81153}He's right.
{81155}{81180}The Postman's right.
{81182}{81223}You're crazy.
{81341}{81378}I tried to stop him didn't I?
{81380}{81442}Tried, tried?
{81444}{81510}You failed.
{81512}{81536}God damn it.
{81538}{81580}Look at me.
{81582}{81645}You know it's|the hatch for you.
{81647}{81672}There's nothing wrong with me.
{81674}{81692}I know that,
{81693}{81712}and you know that.
{81714}{81768}But all those piss ant|dolts who run the world,
{81770}{81818}they hate us|because we're special.
{81820}{81871}They'll put you|somewhere deep and moody.
{81873}{81912}Don't talk that way please.
{81913}{81948}Cut the migraine shit.
{81950}{81980}Don't you care about anything?
{81981}{82035}Christ, don't you|care about the girl?
{82089}{82133}Peg?
{82134}{82155}I love Peg.
{82157}{82180}I hope she loves you too.
{82182}{82225}So on visiting day|she can bring crayons
{82226}{82261}and the two of you's|can color together.
{82263}{82288}What do you want from me?
{82290}{82321}You know goddamn well what.
{82323}{82342}I don't!
{82344}{82361}Liar.
{82362}{82376}Tell me!
{82378}{82396}Weakling.
{82398}{82412}I'm not, I'm not!
{82414}{82433}Stop the Postman!
{82434}{82450}I can't!
{82452}{82469}Gutless fuck!
{82471}{82487}I can't!
{82489}{82511}Stop the Postman!
{82513}{82548}How, how with what?
{82550}{82605}Me, me, me, me, me!
{83423}{83459}Cork?
{83524}{83569}What's up, what is it?
{83589}{83661}Oh, I meant to ask.
{83663}{83743}Do you want me make|unthaw the asparagus tips,
{83745}{83854}or the French-cut green beans?
{83856}{83880}Either.
{83882}{83920}No fair.
{83922}{83938}You're the man
{83940}{83992}you've got to|make the decision.
{84065}{84100}Asparagus tips.
{84147}{84209}Hey what are you|doing in the woods?
{84211}{84265}Walkin', thinkin'.
{84267}{84298}About me?
{84300}{84365}You changin'|your mind about me?
{84366}{84426}Jesus no.
{84428}{84488}Better not you bastard.
{85255}{85279}Well what is it?
{85281}{85326}My head, you broke it.
{85328}{85349}Well what'll I do?
{85350}{85399}Can't think, help me.
{85401}{85421}I will don't worry.
{85422}{85467}I'll take care.
{85469}{85497}Ahh...
{85498}{85536}You're hurtin' me.
{85575}{85590}Sorry.
{85667}{85716}There you are,|that should do it.
{85718}{85749}That better?
{85751}{85775}I guess.
{85777}{85803}Good.
{85937}{85965}All right.
{86021}{86083}Does it show.
{86085}{86126}Uh...
{86128}{86209}Well, I'll slip you into your|overall outfit with a cap.
{86211}{86322}And uh, nobody will|be able to tell a thing.
{86324}{86343}Hey Fats?
{86345}{86377}Yeah.
{86378}{86406}I've been doin'|some thinking.
{86408}{86434}Yeah.
{86504}{86563}What would you say if I uh...
{86565}{86629}if I called the|police and told?
{86631}{86665}You ain't being logical.
{86667}{86706}Look, Gangrene|was taken care of
{86708}{86750}because he was going|to have you put away.
{86752}{86775}If you tell the cops,
{86777}{86824}they'll have you put away.
{86997}{87029}Well what'll we do with him?
{87031}{87093}Bring me any identification|he's got on him.
{87095}{87118}Why?
{87120}{87155}Time for a little dip.
{87157}{87189}After dinner get|yourself some stones
{87191}{87265}and stuff 'em in his pockets.
{87267}{87324}But I'm not that|strong a swimmer.
{87326}{87363}Just dog paddle|out to the middle
{87365}{87417}and drop him down.
{87418}{87438}I know this lake.
{87440}{87463}There's snapping|turtles out there.
{87465}{87490}Everybody said that.
{87492}{87521}Once there was a|water moccasin scare.
{87522}{87562}I don't care if the|Loch Ness monster's out there,
{87564}{87601}and he's ravenous.
{87957}{88016}Do it beautifully.
{92484}{92516}Hello?
{92638}{92663}Good morning.
{92665}{92700}Coffee's on.
{92856}{92880}Coffee's ready.
{92881}{92898}Good.
{92900}{92945}Careful.
{92947}{93047}Uh, Duke got home|very late last night.
{93049}{93083}He didn't much like the idea
{93085}{93135}of me being here|alone with a man.
{93137}{93184}He's watching us now.
{93274}{93349}Uh, do you think it's wise
{93351}{93424}for me to come up there now?
{93426}{93493}I think he wants to|watch us together.
{93518}{93574}Oh.
{93611}{93656}Give me five minutes.
{93720}{93741}Hey.
{93798}{93863}Has he got a telescope?
{93865}{93916}Because if he doesn't,
{93917}{93954}I'd like to say that
{93956}{94001}going to bed with you is maybe
{94002}{94069}the best three things|that ever happened to me.
{94070}{94113}And I'd love some coffee.
{94115}{94155}And I adore you.
{94157}{94220}And I take it|with cream and sugar.
{94221}{94273}And your breasts|belong in the Louvre,
{94275}{94304}which is a museum in Paris
{94305}{94335}that I plan on|visiting with you
{94337}{94365}once you get wise
{94367}{94423}and decide to leave|the old ear blower.
{94494}{94546}Are you ever somethin'.
{94886}{94942}Hello?
{94944}{95001}We're in the kitchen.
{95003}{95032}Hi Duke.
{95034}{95085}How are you?
{95087}{95123}Come on in, sit down.
{95125}{95185}Yeah, thanks.
{95187}{95224}Doing okay.
{95301}{95351}You take your coffee how?
{95353}{95385}Everything.
{95457}{95495}Sorry I wasn't|here to greet you.
{95497}{95561}Help with the|entertaining and all.
{95562}{95597}But somebody's|got to earn a living.
{95655}{95699}You're still in|real estate right?
{95701}{95739}No, I gave that up.
{95741}{95790}It was dull.
{95792}{95836}What I really like|is the out a doors.
{95837}{95885}Go fishing, hunting.
{95919}{95967}That probably seems|dull to someone like you.
{95969}{96011}No, not at all.
{96013}{96043}Fine, thanks.
{96092}{96147}And I do a little|sellin' nowadays.
{96149}{96190}Sundries, like that.
{96259}{96324}I'm surprised Peg here|didn't bring you up to date.
{96325}{96371}Well she may have.
{96373}{96395}The truth is,
{96397}{96436}once I start drinking wine,
{96437}{96490}you can forget about me.
{96696}{96745}Hey Duke, that stuff you sell?
{96747}{96801}You don't happen to|have a penis do you?
{96802}{96852}My last one caught|Dutch Elm Disease
{96853}{96901}and it's murder|getting an erection.
{96955}{96981}God damn, that's clever.
{96983}{97005}Don't tell schmucko.
{97007}{97025}Tell me.
{97026}{97071}'Cause I'm the talent.
{97073}{97120}Shhh...
{97201}{97245}Do you travel|a lot in your work?
{97246}{97266}How do you do that?
{97268}{97310}I mean that's terrific.
{97312}{97386}I'm really glad you're|here for me to see this.
{97388}{97469}Are you going to be good?
{97470}{97497}I mean it.
{97499}{97550}You promise?
{97602}{97652}Okay.
{97654}{97711}Ask him if he's|glad I'm here too?
{97783}{97832}Yeah, the both of you.
{97833}{97863}Thank you.
{97942}{97974}How long are you going to be?
{97976}{98000}Quick as I can.
{98001}{98072}As long as it takes me to|board up those far cabins.
{98073}{98099}Don't stay out too long.
{98101}{98127}You'll get soaked.
{98153}{98217}How'd I do.
{98219}{98256}Just unbelievable.
{98258}{98296}Too bad Fats wasn't here.
{98298}{98338}He might of|been a little help.
{98340}{98382}Gotten a couple of laughs.
{98432}{98506}You're always unbelievable.
{98508}{98568}Oh, brains as well as boobs.
{99621}{99710}Corky, do you drive a Rolls?
{99742}{99770}No.
{99772}{99874}Well there's somebody's|white Rolls parked down there.
{99876}{99916}Shit.
{100023}{100052}It's gotta be Gangrene's.
{100053}{100078}Why would he leave it though.
{100080}{100101}Who's is it?
{100103}{100140}My agent.
{100141}{100163}He's rich as hell.
{100165}{100233}But still you just don't leave|an $80,000 car and walk away.
{100235}{100280}He must have|come looking for me.
{100281}{100307}Looking for you?
{100309}{100323}Yeah.
{100325}{100358}He's left the keys.
{100453}{100518}Yeah, look if|I level with you,
{100520}{100557}you won't let this get around?
{100623}{100647}I'm in hiding.
{100649}{100684}A lot of career problems.
{100685}{100760}I haven't been|behaving all that normal.
{100762}{100793}Well can you find out|what's happened to him.
{100794}{100822}This cars been here|a couple of hours.
{100824}{100893}Yeah, I'll sure as hell try.
{100894}{100979}Hey, would you mind|getting it unstuck?
{100981}{101025}Me driving an $80,000 car,
{101026}{101057}I'd mind that a lot.
{101148}{101182}Sadie?
{101200}{101246}Sadie?
{101248}{101307}It's me.
{101309}{101349}Is he in?
{101397}{101432}Please.
{101689}{101740}Don't yell at me Goddamn it.
{101741}{101807}I'm sick of hearing|about my erratic behavior.
{101845}{101900}How the hell|did you ever find me.
{101945}{101972}I tipped that bastard cabbie
{101974}{102018}so he wouldn't tell.
{102089}{102114}We were on a long walk
{102116}{102155}is why you|didn't find anybody.
{102220}{102250}Never mind who the we is,
{102252}{102293}finish about the car.
{102322}{102361}Ha, ha.
{102363}{102405}I'd love to have seen that.
{102406}{102486}You hitchhiking|a ride to Grossinger's.
{102488}{102549}Why didn't you have 'em|come and un-stick the car.
{102581}{102614}Quit yelling.
{102616}{102631}I should a known,
{102633}{102708}nobody touches your|Rolls but a Rolls man.
{102709}{102744}Sorry.
{102745}{102784}Duke's on his way.
{102849}{102874}Yes sir.
{102876}{102929}That was the we.
{102931}{103025}Yes sir, a lot.
{103026}{103054}It's not ridiculous.
{103056}{103106}We grew up together.
{103108}{103129}Yes she's married.
{103131}{103210}But I think she's|leaving him for me.
{103212}{103260}The marriage was over.
{103297}{103376}I'm not talking|about puppy love Ben.
{103377}{103427}I'm talking about salvation.
{103554}{103579}Some fish.
{103581}{103622}Some fish he takes me for.
{103624}{103659}Your old pal|I'm talking about.
{103661}{103697}I suspected.
{103699}{103745}His story's so full a holes.
{103747}{103792}Why do you keep|repeating that?
{103793}{103853}So a car is here, who care?
{103854}{103916}Besides, Corky|agrees with you.
{103917}{103940}It's a crazy story,
{103941}{103968}but there it is.
{103969}{104034}Some happy coincidence.
{104036}{104073}A guy drives 90 miles
{104075}{104108}and you and Corky|just happen to be
{104109}{104186}off in the woods|when he's snoopin'.
{104188}{104227}You put out for him|in the woods did ya?
{104229}{104271}I love it|when you're drinking.
{104369}{104390}Well why didn't you tell me
{104392}{104454}about this Goddamn|legendary walk before?
{104456}{104480}No comment.
{104481}{104501}Listen,
{104503}{104549}I know his story's bullshit
{104550}{104575}because I got the|car out of the mud
{104577}{104611}and it was nothing.
{104613}{104652}If I can do it, anybody can.
{104653}{104674}Maybe he tried.
{104676}{104695}Maybe he couldn't.
{104697}{104743}He's old.
{104745}{104789}Corky never said he was old.
{104791}{104822}He must of to me.
{104824}{104860}When?
{104861}{104911}When we were|having dinner, probably.
{104965}{105011}He got squiffed fast|and flaked out.
{105013}{105058}That's what he said earlier.
{105060}{105134}And how did you know|he was old, did you see him?
{105136}{105166}Answer me, I'm talking to you!
{105168}{105204}No, I didn't see him.
{105206}{105224}Why not?
{105225}{105249}He must've wrung the bell.
{105251}{105278}I mean the guy|drives 90 miles,
{105280}{105326}he's gonna ring the Goddamn|doorbell, wouldn't you agree?
{105328}{105356}I didn't hear any bell.
{105357}{105373}Now quit this.
{105375}{105393}Why not?
{105395}{105428}What were you|doin' that was so...
{105486}{105551}Did he ring while you|were screwin', is that it?
{105553}{105574}That is it isn't it?
{105576}{105597}No it isn't.
{105598}{105627}Why didn't you|invite him in to watch?
{105629}{105667}Shut your dirty mouth.
{105669}{105693}Did you screw Corky?
{105695}{105729}No!
{105730}{105768}I'll pound you|all day, you keep lying!
{105769}{105805}I'm not lying!
{105806}{105829}The truth, the goddamn truth!
{105831}{105859}Did you fuck him?
{105861}{105915}No I didn't!
{106105}{106152}But I wanted to.
{106229}{106276}Come on, it'll be fun.
{106277}{106297}If you don't like fishin'
{106299}{106355}I'll let you row.
{106357}{106421}Just had a|good talk with Peg.
{106423}{106503}Like to have one with you now.
{106505}{106543}I'll grab a jacket.
{106574}{106602}Where is Peg?
{106604}{106694}She's in town making|a decision, she said.
{106696}{106723}Oh.
{107148}{107196}What are you doin' that for?
{107197}{107243}Uh, habit.
{107245}{107276}Hey, we trust each|other don't we?
{107277}{107302}Of course.
{107304}{107340}You seem upset.
{107342}{107385}Should I be?
{107466}{107501}Get in the front.
{108433}{108464}What are you lookin' for?
{108465}{108503}Nothin'.
{108649}{108712}You're the one wants to fish.
{108713}{108745}Why don't you try over there.
{108747}{108769}Here I'll do the rowing.
{108770}{108825}I know the best holes.
{108826}{108877}When I get us there|you can take over.
{109471}{109501}I'm not much on booze.
{109503}{109545}I told you that.
{109546}{109599}You told me a lot of things.
{109601}{109636}What's that supposed to mean?
{110560}{110669}Peg said you|screwed her last night.
{110706}{110744}Damn.
{110745}{110826}I told her to|keep it a secret.
{110828}{110864}You think it's funny do you?
{110865}{110906}Is that why you|brought me out here?
{110908}{110980}Try to get me to admit to|something that never happened?
{110981}{111086}If it is I'd like to|go back in now Duke.
{111088}{111180}What she said was,
{111181}{111314}she wanted to|go to bed with you.
{111316}{111337}I'm loosin' her Corky,
{111339}{111446}And I don't know what to do.
{111448}{111496}All she does is|talk about you Duke.
{111498}{111570}You're not losing anybody.
{111572}{111598}What I said before,
{111600}{111688}about quitting the|real estate business,
{111689}{111769}there was never any|real estate business to quit.
{111770}{111853}She came in when I was on top.
{111855}{111919}And she stuck with|me all the way down.
{111921}{111972}Goddamn it.
{111973}{112005}Oh, that's heavy.
{112091}{112151}Duke, I said I'd|like to go back in now.
{112216}{112258}This feels like a whale.
{112260}{112277}God, I'm cold,
{112279}{112308}let's get the hell in.
{112353}{112394}It's comin' loose.
{112500}{112525}Hey you're breakin' my pole.
{112527}{112554}I'm trying to|help you, that's all.
{112556}{112603}Well don't help.
{112605}{112636}It's comin' now.
{113029}{113055}It's comin'.
{113465}{113513}Goddamn log.
{113620}{113684}Any of that scotch left?
{113685}{113718}Thought you|didn't like booze?
{113720}{113805}I'm freezing my|nuts off, that's all.
{113807}{113832}Thanks.
{113941}{113964}Thanks.
{114393}{114413}I wonder who he is.
{114414}{114452}See what his wallet says.
{114453}{114466}Jesus Christ,
{114468}{114511}I was thinking' he might|be your Rolls Royce guy.
{114513}{114533}Gangrene?
{114534}{114553}You must be kidding' me.
{114554}{114589}He's about 6'3".
{114647}{114677}Nothin'.
{114789}{114814}He's stripped clean.
{114816}{114843}It doesn't make sense.
{114845}{114893}Must be some identification.
{114955}{115011}Jesus Christ,|he might still be alive.
{115013}{115044}Fantastic.
{115045}{115067}I'll do the kiss of life.
{115069}{115098}You run up to the house,|call Normandy Hospital.
{115100}{115124}Tell 'em to get over.
{115125}{115173}Right.
{115175}{115214}And stay at the house|'til they get there
{115216}{115256}so you can direct|'em straight here.
{115257}{115284}Gotcha.
{119485}{119536}Ben Greene.
{119538}{119591}Gangrene.
{119593}{119668}Son of a bitch.
{119669}{119719}He is the Rolls guy.
{120338}{120388}Oh.
{120872}{120895}Jesus.
{120901}{120936}Jesus.
{120994}{121028}Don't panic.
{121029}{121058}My God, what have you done!
{121060}{121084}I said don't panic.
{121086}{121113}My God, what am I going to do?
{121115}{121170}Well pick me up|dumb dumb and I'll tell ya.
{121313}{121344}Listen to me.
{121393}{121426}Listen to me.
{121486}{121527}Well sit down then dummy.
{121533}{121592}Alright.
{121666}{121693}You're gonna|zoom to my suitcase
{121695}{121721}and whip out one of those
{121723}{121780}nice long pieces of canvas.
{121839}{121902}Well clean my face|and you won't throw up.
{121988}{122020}Okay.
{122021}{122060}You're gonna take the canvas
{122062}{122115}and you're gonna wrap|part around Duke here,
{122117}{122164}and part of it|around Gangrene.
{122166}{122217}Then you're gonna|get a nice big rock
{122219}{122277}and wrap the rest around it.
{122278}{122325}Take that out a my mouth.
{122327}{122355}Then you're gonna row out
{122357}{122402}and dump the|bundle over the side.
{122404}{122436}And if you do it right,
{122437}{122517}I'll be able to say|atta boy schmucko.
{122518}{122567}Two birds with one stone.
{123561}{123581}Hi.
{123586}{123614}Hi.
{123616}{123672}You've had|quite a day I guess.
{123673}{123715}Whatever.
{123717}{123766}Where's Duke.
{123768}{123803}We had a blow out.
{123805}{123851}He tried to get me to admit|we'd gone to bed together.
{123853}{123877}But uh...
{123879}{123917}when he couldn't he told|me he was going to go hunting
{123919}{123956}and I should get the hell out
{123957}{123996}by the time he got back.
{124137}{124169}Are you coming with me?
{124325}{124369}Are you coming with me?
{124420}{124475}I gotta know.
{124477}{124505}Who wins,
{124507}{124558}me or Duke?
{124660}{124748}If I'm a prize,
{124749}{124829}then you're the winner.
{124831}{124871}And as soon as Duke gets back
{124873}{124927}and I can tell him in|person that I'm leaving,
{124929}{124965}we can take off.
{125064}{125107}Gee you know I, I...
{125109}{125144}I don't think you|should put yourself
{125145}{125245}through a big emotional|scene like that, do you?
{125247}{125336}Well, I gotta leave|Duke with his pride.
{125337}{125419}We spent a lotta|years together and uh...
{125421}{125489}he's gotta understand|that he didn't fail.
{125490}{125526}We failed together.
{125606}{125667}So let's the both|of us pack okay.
{125669}{125752}Don't try arguing|me out of this.
{125754}{125777}He's got to be home soon.
{125778}{125828}He can't hunt|at night time right?
{125889}{125910}Okay.
{125953}{125974}Oh, my God.
{125976}{126027}She's leaving Duke for you.
{126029}{126080}Fan-fucking-gradly,|fan-fucking-tastic.
{126081}{126140}Thank you sports fans.
{126141}{126184}Well where are we off to?
{126185}{126212}Now don't get|emotional about this.
{126214}{126276}About what, about what?
{126278}{126308}I think maybe there's|just going to be
{126309}{126337}two of us on the honeymoon.
{126339}{126371}What's the punch line?
{126373}{126405}You're gonna leave me behind?
{126406}{126458}Come on buddy,|quit the kiddin'.
{126460}{126482}My head's on straight on now.
{126484}{126519}I want to get to|know her, that's all.
{126521}{126541}Take her places.
{126542}{126559}Show her things.
{126561}{126608}Paris, maybe, like that.
{126609}{126633}The Eiffel Tower.
{126635}{126649}The Louvre.
{126651}{126673}You know?
{126675}{126712}Schmucko, you've|never been to Paris.
{126713}{126755}What's this show her routine?

{126975}{127010}You want me to come crawling?
{127012}{127047}You want me to beg?
{127049}{127102}Okay, this is me, Fats,
{127104}{127128}and I'm beggin'.
{127130}{127154}It's not easy for me either.
{127156}{127174}It is.
{127176}{127205}It is easy.
{127207}{127263}You wont be alone.
{127373}{127434}I'll tell.
{127499}{127557}What will you tell?
{127558}{127600}Everything.
{127946}{127977}I will.
{128141}{128196}I swear.
{128236}{128260}In the middle of the act,
{128261}{128320}one night, when|you don't expect it.
{128321}{128420}I'll scream, there's|bodies in Lake Melody.
{128501}{128548}I don't see that happening.
{128609}{128660}I'm doing a single now.
{129111}{129136}Duke?
{129189}{129233}Duke?
{131782}{131816}How'd it go?
{131817}{131845}Duke understand.
{131847}{131881}We haven't talked yet.
{131921}{131968}You mean he isn't back yet.
{131969}{132002}Christ Peg.
{132004}{132032}Got kinda scary up there.
{132033}{132056}And I wanted a drink,
{132057}{132125}but I didn't much|wanna drink alone.
{132213}{132252}Well let's just go.
{132253}{132274}Let's get the hell out.
{132276}{132305}Send him a telegram.
{132307}{132369}I'm sorry, my mind's made up.
{132371}{132424}Besides, he can't|be much longer.
{132425}{132467}You don't know that.
{132469}{132539}He was drinking heavy|when he left here.
{132541}{132571}Did he take|a flashlight with him?
{132573}{132600}Did you notice?
{132602}{132622}All I noticed
{132624}{132671}was that big Goddamn|elephant gun he was carrying
{132673}{132754}when he hinted|I vacate the premises.
{132756}{132777}Come on,
{132778}{132815}it's stupid waiting around.
{132817}{132875}Then I'm stupid.
{132877}{132916}I didn't say you were stupid.
{132918}{132958}I said waiting was.
{132960}{133003}I'm aware of your|opinion on the subject.
{133005}{133051}Well try agreeing|with me for once.
{133053}{133089}Instead of being stubborn.
{133091}{133142}Give it a rest Cork.
{133231}{133285}Aaah...
{133287}{133323}Sweet mystery of life
{133325}{133406}at last I've found you.
{133408}{133452}Fasten your|seatbelts everybody.
{133453}{133533}It's going to|be a bumpy night.
{133535}{133595}I'm here to save|you two from yourselves.
{133597}{133681}Want me to do|something dazzling.
{133683}{133734}You do magic too?
{133736}{133769}Corky does magic.
{133771}{133810}I only do tricks.
{133841}{133895}Hey I got just the thing Peg.
{133897}{133924}Bring me a couple|a decks of cards
{133925}{133967}and I'll read your mind.
{134006}{134025}What do you mean?
{134027}{134057}I'll pull the same|card from your deck
{134058}{134120}that you pull from mine.
{134122}{134145}That's not a trick.
{134146}{134169}You can't do that.
{134171}{134193}Sure.
{134194}{134232}You just peek at the|bottom card after shuffling
{134234}{134279}and it's easy as apple pie.
{134281}{134337}Corky makes a|big deal production number|out of it sometimes.
{134339}{134432}Like when he's got some bimbo|stewardess he wants to screw.
{134433}{134469}He makes him think|their minds have touched.
{134470}{134513}Never fails.
{134514}{134545}You'll never know|how many people
{134547}{134604}want to believe in magic.
{134749}{134796}Oh shit.
{134893}{134915}Peg.
{134917}{134961}Peg please.
{134962}{135006}Please, please come...
{135008}{135056}Were you laughing|every second.
{135057}{135084}Please, please.
{135086}{135201}Was I funny you|bastard son of a bitch?
{135203}{135220}Oh...
{135221}{135252}Let me explain.
{135253}{135318}Hey, hey.
{135320}{135355}Jesus.
{135409}{135464}Listen to me you schmuck.
{135465}{135566}You gotta please just|answer me one small question?
{135568}{135612}Why'd you think|I blew the whistle?
{135613}{135661}Ah, because I was leaving.
{135663}{135682}Because you were jealous.
{135684}{135713}Wrong schmucko.
{135715}{135755}I did it because I could.
{135757}{135796}See?
{135798}{135845}Why didn't you stop me?
{135846}{135929}Answer, you didn't|because you couldn't.
{135953}{135974}Look at him.
{135976}{136024}He still doesn't understand.
{136026}{136048}Better sit down kid
{136049}{136124}while I hit you|with an explanation.
{136203}{136222}Ever since we got together,
{136224}{136245}I laid low.
{136247}{136274}It was best for the act.
{136276}{136313}I let you share|the limelight.
{136315}{136366}If there's one|thing about me, I'm big.
{136368}{136395}But then earlier today,
{136397}{136414}when I begged ya,
{136416}{136442}pleaded not to be left behind
{136444}{136491}and you pissed|ice water all over me,
{136493}{136584}well, that tore it.
{136585}{136615}If I'm boring you,
{136617}{136646}please walk around.
{136648}{136692}I don't care.
{136693}{136723}Fats don't start in on me.
{136725}{136781}Please don't.
{136783}{136820}Listen, I took a failure.
{136822}{136861}With the charm of|Tricky Dickey Nixon.
{136863}{136894}I made us skyrocket.
{136896}{136922}It's not gonna be you and her,
{136924}{136955}it's gonna stay you and me.
{136957}{136999}Except from now on|even that's changed.
{137001}{137028}It's me and you.
{137030}{137065}You said I've|got a weak stomach.
{137066}{137083}You look tired.
{137085}{137100}I'm not.
{137102}{137125}Then what are|you yawning for?
{137126}{137145}I'm not yawning.
{137146}{137167}You gotta wake you up.
{137169}{137189}Crawl around.
{137190}{137209}That should help.
{137210}{137228}You think?
{137229}{137270}Hey yeah, it does help.
{137272}{137316}Say thank you Fats.
{137317}{137340}Thanks.
{137341}{137369}Thanks Fats.
{137371}{137409}With feeling, like I'm doing.
{137411}{137456}I'm filled with|greatest fucking joy.
{137457}{137480}Gee you've got|talent after all.
{137481}{137502}Let's see what|else you can do.
{137504}{137549}Fats says smile.
{137551}{137585}Fats says frown.
{137587}{137630}Fats says touch the ceiling.
{137632}{137674}Fats says spin around.
{137676}{137712}Fats says get a knife.
{137753}{137774}What?
{137776}{137831}Get a knife.
{137833}{137862}Come on.
{137864}{137923}From my suitcase.
{137925}{137963}Yeah.
{137965}{137992}I know where it is.
{137994}{138024}I wonder what we|could do with it?
{138025}{138048}Hey, I could|whittle something.
{138049}{138097}I'm good at that,|and fast too, name it.
{138098}{138121}No.
{138122}{138172}I'm looking for something|with a little more pizzazz.
{138174}{138233}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{138235}{138260}Don't do it.
{138261}{138348}You really love|old Peg don't ya?
{138350}{138382}Oh please, don't kill her.
{138384}{138409}Schmucko easy.
{138411}{138437}I wouldn't dream of
{138439}{138473}depriving you|of that pleasure.
{138474}{138502}No, I can't do it!
{138504}{138549}There's that old|bug-a-boo of yours again.
{138551}{138576}lack of confidence.
{138577}{138625}I won't and you can't make me!
{138627}{138669}Wow, I really stepped|on a corn that time.
{138671}{138701}If I can't make ya,|I can't make ya.
{138703}{138728}How's your head Cork?
{138729}{138748}Fine!
{138749}{138789}Thought you might|be getting' a migraine.
{138791}{138808}No!
{138810}{138842}Shows how wrong you can be.
{138971}{139018}Open those baby blues.
{139020}{139084}Looks to me like one|of those gut wrenchers.
{139086}{139161}It's getting bad fast.
{139163}{139192}Please!
{139193}{139280}Drilling right|into the brain is it?
{139336}{139408}Surprise.
{139410}{139429}Came fast.
{139431}{139462}It can go fast.
{139464}{139480}Yeah.
{139482}{139501}Oh yes.
{139502}{139540}Not so deep anymore?
{139542}{139583}No, not so deep.
{139585}{139623}It'll all be gone soon.
{139625}{139708}Uh... Thanks Fats.
{139781}{139822}Want it|a hundred times worse,
{139824}{139893}and a hundred days long?
{139894}{139956}No.
{139957}{140064}Then take the knife|on up the hill lover.
{140118}{140210}And kiss the girl goodbye.
{140677}{140721}Duke?
{140773}{140852}I left schmucko|down at the cabin.
{140853}{140897}Open up huh?
{140898}{140969}You and me gotta|have a quick palaver.
{140971}{141018}Corky there's nothin' to say.
{141020}{141042}I told ya,
{141044}{141072}he's at the cabin.
{141074}{141181}You and me are the only ones|can straighten this out.
{141183}{141220}Go away Cork.
{141222}{141246}Fats.
{141248}{141296}All right, go away Fats.
{141298}{141334}That's better.
{141336}{141416}At least we|know who we are now.
{141417}{141487}Hey, I've got a present|that'll make you smile.
{141489}{141527}Promise it will.
{141529}{141557}He made it for you Peg.
{141559}{141593}For you to remember him by.
{141595}{141621}See, he's leaving now
{141623}{141683}and he wants you to have this.
{141685}{141728}Have what?
{141729}{141785}A wooden heart.
{141787}{141806}He whittled it for you
{141808}{141856}before he sent me up.
{141857}{141936}He's quick with his hands.
{141937}{142017}Leave it outside the door.
{142018}{142062}Take his heart Peg.
{142064}{142176}So he'll know you don't|feel contempt for him.
