1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,520
<i>Have you ever thought about</i>

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,999
<i>how we would be right now</i>

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,420
<i>if we had never met?</i>

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,049
<i>Are you saying...</i>

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,990
<i>if I hadn't met you?</i>

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,599
<i>If I hadn't met you, the current me</i>

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,529
<i>would probably be like any other woman,</i>

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,549
<i>and find a man who loves
me more than I love him.</i>

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>I would be blandly dating
him, without any worries.</i>

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,630
<i>Stop pushing me.</i>

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,439
<i>Mom, can you stop forcing me?</i>

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,699
<i>What about you? If you hadn't met me,</i>

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,949
<i>what would the current you be like?</i>

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,899
<i>Hello, I'm Xiao Min.</i>

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,460
<i>Hello, I'm Hao Meng.</i>

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,129
<i>Perhaps I would be like you,</i>

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,879
<i>going by every man's advice,</i>

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,119
<i>and finding a woman who cares
more about me than about herself.</i>

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>A kind and honest</i>

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,739
<i>woman who doesn't have any particular strengths, but
a good woman who's understanding of all my flaws.</i>

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,979
<i>If you want to take a picture...</i>

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,089
<i>Perhaps I wouldn't have
the urge to marry her.</i>

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,510
<i>Really?</i>

24
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,700
<i>But I also wouldn't think
about breaking up with her.</i>

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,890

<i>Even if I my heart doesn't
beat crazily anymore,</i>

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,310
<i>I will still tell myself that having no

28

lost something, I will still reassure myself</i>

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,710
<i>that having no regrets
is a type of happiness.</i>

30
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,529
<i>Because...</i>

31
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,630
<i>we are not together.</i>

32
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,219
Why are you here?

33
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,520
It was me who sent a text
with my father's phone.

34
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,799
Other than him, I don't think
you will meet with anyone.

35
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,939
Whether you believe it or not, your father and
I do not have that kind of a relationship.

36
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,439
That's what all the
mistresses say in dramas.

37
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,739
Miss Cai, are you humiliating me?

38
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,349
That's not what I mean. Why
would I humiliate you?

39
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,789
Didn't you say that you and my
father have a clean relationship?

40
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,279
That's exactly what he said.

41
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,499
He said that even though you're his first love,
the person that he loves now is my mother.

42
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,009
He's only friends with you.

43
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,419
What he said is true. We're only friends
who've reunited after many years.

44
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,899
He really does love your mother.

45
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,979
Really?

46
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,179
Of course! He told me himself how much he
loves your mother and you, his daughter.

47
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,720
You can choose not to believe me, but
you have to believe your father.

48
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,340
Okay. If it's really how you say
it is, then prove it to me.

49
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,869
That's right! You better prove to me that there's
nothing going on between you and Cai Hong Li.

50
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,020
- We are really—<br>- Kneel!

51
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,129
I'm sorry. Recently, my husband and I are
living separately and arguing about divorcing,

52
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,619
but both my son and daughter
don't support my decision.

53
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,969
So I've been feeling suffocated
and wanted to talk to someone.

54
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,799
That's why I asked Hong
Li to come out and talk.

55
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,499
It's true.

56
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,499
Don't misunderstand. There's really
nothing going on between Hong Li and I!

57
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,449
I never thought to steal
someone else's husband.

58
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,509
Plus, I can tell that Hong
Li is sincere towards you.

59
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,209
In his world, you and your daughter
are what's most important.

60
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,489
Before I met up with Hong Li,

61
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,999
I had already seen you
two at the supermarket.

62
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,219
What?

63
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,889
I saw you two pushing the cart,

64
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:54,299
talking and laughing while buying wine.
It was clear that you two were happy.

65
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,169
After seeing you two leave,

66
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,290
I was really envious.

67
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,560
- Because my husband and
I—<br>- Okay, okay, okay.

68
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,029
We still need to take care of this issue.

69
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,719
- Cai Hong Li!<br> - Yes!

70
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,519
- Go buy wine.<br>- What?
<br> -What? (Huan Zhen)

71
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,909
What do you mean what? Do you want
to keep kneeling or go buy wine?

72
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,050
Oh, oh, okay. Report:
Yes, I'll go buy wine!

73
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,579
Tonight...

74
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,549
is lady's night! You can't
leave until you're drunk.

75
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:43,349
What? You're saying my mom
is drinking with your mom?

76
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,619
Really? I've never seen my mom drink.

77
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,729
<i>Yeah.</i>

78
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,069
Not only can she drink, her tolerance is quite high. She's
having a good time with my mom, talking and laughing.

79
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,979
They might even become drinking buddies.

80
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,299
It was only hours ago when that unsightly scene
happened, now they're happily drinking together?!

81
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,359
What is she thinking? I'm really starting
to have trouble understanding my mom.

82
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,859
Perhaps what she feels most hurt about is not being
misunderstood, but rather having no one understand her.

83
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,299
<i>The people who appear the strongest
are often the loneliest.</i>

84
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,339
Just like how I misunderstood you before.

85
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,179
Perhaps.

86
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,129
Anyway, don't worry. I'll take care of her.
When she feels better, you can take her home.

87
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,699
Alright.

88
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,509
Hey, I have a question.

89
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,149
What question?

90
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,639
How come when you found out
that my mom had no money

91
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,639
and didn't know where to go,

92
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,520
you contacted me first instead
of calling my brother?

93
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,249
I've already broken up with him.

94
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,369
Wouldn't it be weird to call him?

95
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,010
If you guys have already broken up, then
why are you still doing so much for him?

96
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,849
I'm not doing if for him, it's for you.

97
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,699
<i>Me?</i>

98
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,219
Yeah. Don't forget that I'm
not only your brother's ex,

99
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,179
I'm also your best friend.

100
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,979
<i>Of course I need to help your family.</i>

101
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,809
It better be like that.

102
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,389
<i>Cai Huan Zhen!</i>

103
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,129
Oh, coming!

104
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,159
<i>I'll talk to you later. Your mom's
calling me. That's all for now. Bye-bye.</i>

105
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,060
Okay, bye.

106
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,799
Who were you talking to?

107
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,300
I was talking to...

108
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,989
Ohoho! Ohoho!

109
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,319
Ahh! Ahh!

110
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,369
What are you doing?

111
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,549
Mrs. Hao, Mrs. Hao! Are you alright?

112
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,469
I want to drink, let me drink!

113
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,739
Xia Yu He!

114
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,199
Go die!

115
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,709
Ah, Auntie, do you want to rest first?
You can come to my room to rest.

116
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,709
Stop pretending to be nice!

117
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,409
You're the happiest seeing
me this way, right?

118
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,939
Don't think that if you treat me well,

119
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,059
- I'll let you and Hao Meng be together.
That's impossible! <br> -That's not right!

120
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,159
Ahh, hold on.

121
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,369
Why are you laughing?

122
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,770
I'm laughing because I'm
happy to drink with you.

123
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,450
Auntie! Ah, A-Auntie!

124
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,619
Hello? Sheng Nan, where are you?
I didn't see you.

125
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,219
<i>About that...</i>

126
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,289
I'm almost there, I'm almost there!
I'm on the way. I'll be there soon!

127
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,189
Wait for me, uh, outside by the door.

128
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,130
Okay, okay. Bye-bye!

129
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,449
Cai Huan Zhen, sorry.

130
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,019
I wasn't trying to trick you.

131
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,919
I'm not just your best friend,

132
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm also my brother's good sister.

133
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,210
Why are you here?

134
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,149
My sister said that my mom's drunk,

135
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,910
and she wanted me to take her home.

136
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Come in.

137
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,509
Why did she drink this much?

138
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,200
- Actually, your mom drank most
of the alcohol herself. <br> -Huh?

139
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,599
It's probably that she
normally has a lot of

140
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,479
pressure, so when she drank,
she became like this.

141
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,059
Even my mom and my dad who
drank with her are drunk too.

142
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,379
She normally never drinks in front of me,

143
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,980
I didn't think that she'd be like this now.

144
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,449
Sorry.

145
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,819
I said I'd take care of her well

146
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,830
but I let her drink so much.

147
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,110
The person who should apologize is me.

148
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,609
I didn't consider her mood
and let her leave alone.

149
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,350
Thankfully you were there. Thank you.

150
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,929
-No-no-no-no-no. <br> -Let's go.

151
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,349
There's no need. There's no need to go.

152
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,230
I don't want to go back.

153
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,629
Do you want... to just let
your mom sleep here for today?

154
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,909
And then come get her tomorrow?

155
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,189
Will that be too bothersome?

156
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,429
I was just thinking, that at this time

157
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,649
if she has to go home to face the people
she's the closest to and cares most about,

158
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,290
she will probably need some more time.

159
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,250
Yeah.

160
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,390
That hurts.

161
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,329
This is okay for now.

162
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,159
When she wakes up tomorrow, I'll call you.

163
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,979
Turn on the lights...
turn off the lights...

164
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,880
Then I'll just have to inconvenience you.

165
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,279
Hao Meng, Hao Meng, go tell him.

166
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,299
I, Xia Yu He, will never
go back in this lifetime.

167
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,859
I'll never go back!

168
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,879
Really, don't come look for me!
Even if you beg me there's no use!

169
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,110
I'm telling you, I won't go back!

170
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,489
Tell him I won't go back.

171
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,930
Auntie, Hao Meng isn't here. I'm Huan Zhen.

172
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,090
- Auntie, just lie down first, okay.
<br> -There's no problem, no problem.

173
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,590
I'll tell you.

174
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,990
Actually these past dozens of years,
I've suffered through many hardships.

175
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,509
I...

176
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,459
I really tried hard to be

177
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,779
Hao Yi Sheng's good wife.

178
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,499
And be Hao Meng's and Hao
Shen Nan's good mother.

179
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,859
But what's the use?

180
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,939
My husband sees me and
thinks I'm transparent!

181
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,090
My daughter gets scared when she sees me!

182
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,579
And when my son sees me he avoids me!

183
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,109
Everyone thinks

184
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,690
that Xia Yu He only cares about
her own honor and reputation.

185
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,369
You guys are all wrong.

186
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,149
Actually, what I care most about

187
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,989
is whether or not my Hao
Meng is living well or not.

188
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,859
Do you know that when Hao Meng
first graduated from school

189
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,809
he had to be some environmental lawyer?

190
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,649
And what was the result?
He had piles of debt!

191
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,469
His father said kids had to fall to grow.

192
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,089
Unless Hao Meng himself begged his
father, his father wouldn't help him.

193
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,569
I wasn't willing to let
Hao Meng suffer hardship

194
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,549
so I begged him and really
even kneeled in front of him.

195
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,469
As long as I could help Hao Meng,
what does my honor count for?

196
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,409
Because in my heart,

197
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,010
Hao Meng is the best child
in the whole world.

198
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,170
In this whole world, there is no woman
who is good enough for our Meng Meng.

199
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,299
But to tell you the truth,

200
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,939
I actually don't even
want him to get married,

201
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,659
because I'm really scared,

202
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,840
that if he has a wife, he'll forget me.

203
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,169
So his girlfriend needs to be picked by me.

204
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,869
I want to pick one that
is willing to listen,

205
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,030
a daughter-in-law who won't steal my son.

206
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,820
What now?

207
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,659
What are you looking at me for?
Do you think I'm really scary?

208
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,199
Is a mother like me really scary?

209
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,669
No, not at all.

210
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,630
You're not scary at all.

211
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,790
I understand your feelings.

212
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,419
You understand?

213
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,280
-Really, I understand.

214
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,020
Because I feel the same way as you do.

215
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,239
Because I'm afraid that
other people will worry,

216
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,690
I always pretend to be strong and smart,

217
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,129
but really, the two of us
are actually quite stupid.

218
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,190
Even if the two of us
clearly really love him,

219
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,869
we don't know how to express it.

220
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,070
We grasp the things we care
about tightly in our hands.

221
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,609
Sometimes, though, they get crushed.

222
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,250
But even so, we hold onto them
tightly and protect them.

223
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,429
Because Hao Meng and Sheng
Nan have a mother like you,

224
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,290
they are really happy and content.
You're not scary at all.

225
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,389
Really? Having a mother like me,

226
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,499
they are actually happy?

227
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,470
Really. They're really really happy.

228
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:08,110

229
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,290
Your mother, she's already asleep.

230
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,920
What are you thinking?

231
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
I think I don't really
understand my mother.

232
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,699
I thought back earlier,

233
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,079
I don't think I've ever, like you,

234
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,420
sat by her side and calmly
listened to her talk.

235
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,159
Earlier I carefully thought back,

236
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,119
and realized that I never
once had this type of memory.

237
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,599
If being with the one I
loved for my whole life

238
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,940
is an extremely happy and
deserving of anticipation event,

239
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,069
then my mother, who, for the
sake of her own children,

240
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,939
became tied together with
someone she didn't love,

241
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,160
isn't she even more unfortunate
and full of despair?

242
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,810
But I think... that your mom, even
more than you think, loves your dad.

243
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,219
How is that possible?

244
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,759
Sheng Nan and I have watched the two of them
argue almost every day since our childhood.

245
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,469
Compared to your parents,

246
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,779
they are like... two people
who cannot stand each other

247
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,940
and, they are, at most, roommates.

248
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,549
From a woman's perspective,

249
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,720
your mom often argues with your dad in
hopes of being cared about a bit more.

250
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,569
Just like my mom, she
often argues with my dad.

251
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,099
But that's because she cares
too much about my dad.

252
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,629
Their generation of women doesn't know
how to express their feelings well,

253
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,409
so they often use this method
to tell their other half

254
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,430
"I care very much about you. Could
you also care more about me?"

255
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,939
Even if it's a bit dumb and a bit
like they are appearing to be strong,

256
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,089
that's just considered part of their love.

257
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,169
If you look closely at their daily life,

258
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,290
you will realize that there's a lot
of clues that they're in love.

259
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,739
What's wrong?

260
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,060
Did I say something wrong?

261
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,860
No.

262
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,919
I just think that being like this right now

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,930
and chatting with you feels really good.

264
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,290
Me too.

265
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,269
It has gotten late now.

266
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,350
I'll leave first.

267
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,030
Good night.

268
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,539
Earlier when we first got
together, I had a dream.

269
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,589
I dreamed that the two of us

270
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,180
woke up under a huge tree

271
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:07,530
and in the dream the two of us were like a
couple who've been together for a long time.

272
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,490
We brushed our teeth together
and ate breakfast together.

273
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,889
We were on the sofa together

274
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,830
watching a movie that had been
rerunning for god knows how long.

275
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Good night.<br>♫<i> Heaven knows how many
<br>misunderstandings there must be...</i> ♫

276
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,540
Hao Meng.

277
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,120
Have a safe trip back.

278
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,140
<i>Subtitles brought to you
by The Eligibles @ Viki</i>

279
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,779
Dad! Didn't I tell you it's
not what you're thinking?

280
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,910
So why do you have to do this?

281
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,589
What's wrong now?

282
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,959
Dad just took all of mom's things and
wants me to take them to your place.

283
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,249
You didn't tell him that all of
this was a misunderstanding?

284
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,899
Of course I did, but he doesn't listen!

285
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,329
Now what do we do?

286
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,209
If they want to divorce,
then just let them divorce.

287
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,829
Huh?

288
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,170
First take these clothes
and put them on the car.

289
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,210
O-oh.

290
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,500
Brother, what if they really want to
divorce, then wouldn't the two of us—?

291
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,580
Auntie.

292
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,719
I prepared some honey water.

293
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,540
It's good for hangovers.

294
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,779
<i>Actually, I am just scared</i>

295
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,969
<i>that our Meng Meng, after getting married
and having a wife, will forget me.</i>

296

<i>I want to find a woman who listens</i>

297
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,030
<i>and a daughter-in-law who
will not steal my son.</i>

298
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,630
In the bathroom, I put a new toothbrush and bath-towel,
so you could stay for breakfast then leave.

299
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,840
Is this your room?

300
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,440
That's right.

301
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,580
Is there something wrong?

302
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,949
A woman's room can be this messy?

303
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,440
I don't understand how Hao
Meng can like a girl like you.

304
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,139
And, uh, last night I drank

305
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,949
a bit too much, so

306
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,619
that's why I stayed for the night.

307
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,220
So, tell your mother

308
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,349
I caused much trouble for her

309
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,700
so later I'll go back. Oh my...

310
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,619
Auntie, are you okay?

311
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,759
Nothing is wrong. Can I ask
where the bathroom is?

312
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,880
If you walk out, you'll see it.

313
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,469
Uh... do you want to stay and have dinner?

314
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,360
You really don't have to. Sorry for the
inconvenience, but I'll leave first.

315
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,310
Mom.

316
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,820
Before you go home, I want
to take you somewhere.

317
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:18,090
<i>Subtitles brought to you
by The Eligibles @ Viki</i>

318
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,660
Did the two of you ask me here to meet him?

319
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,209
Hao Meng, I told you.

320
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,239
If she wants to leave, let her leave.
I have nothing to say to her.

321
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,880
The two of you don't need to misunderstand. I asked you
to meet here to go through with the divorce proceedings.

322
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,239
I have five copies of the divorce papers. The man and woman
both have a copy. Each side's witness both also get copy.

323
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,969
The last copy is for the Household
Registration Office for proof.

324
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,099
The divorce agreement only had
a signature on one paper.

325
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,070
So I can't help you get the divorce
passed if it's not complete.

326
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,709
As for the witnesses,

327
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,880
Sheng Nan and I will take those positions.
Both of us have signed the papers.

328
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,019
As for the property and retirement fees,

329
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,079
I have already used your situations and

330
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,369
your needs to decide how to divide them.

331
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,659
There shouldn't be too many problems.

332
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,510
Now.

333
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,190
Divorce, please.

334
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,780
Okay.

335
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,569
Since Brother already said so.

336
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,959
It's better to be clear.

337
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,349
Just make it as if we don't owe anyone.

338
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,670
I agree, I'll sign.

339
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,419
Then sign! Who cares?

340
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,489
Okay, after this, Sheng Nan and I
will go to the office with you

341
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,679
and end your marriage.

342
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,750
It will end.

343
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,239
Wait a second brother.

344
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,689
When we were going through
the assets of you two,

345
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,059
There is one more thing
that hasn't been split.

346
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,050
What is that?

347
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,189
This thing is not mentioned,

348
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,089
because it's not considered anything.

349
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,299
So I need to point it out
in front of both of you.

350
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,250
Wait.

351
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,719
This accessory box is my marriage
gift, it has nothing to do with him.

352
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,919
Yes, it used to belong to you.

353
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,629
But everything in the box is not yours.

354
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,229
Since you want to divorce,

355
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,470
What is there not to split up?

356
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,750
What is it that you can't show me?

357
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:42,109
Dad, these are things that can't be seen.

358
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,940
These are your memories with Mom.

359
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,149
There's rain.

360
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,569
Remember to bring an umbrella.

361
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,350
November 3, 1996.

362
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,309
Since I saw you coughing
for the whole night,

363
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,569
I got you medicine,

364
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,279
remember to take it after eating.

365
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,980
March 12, 2001.

366
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,070
This medicine pack is the medicine
mentioned on the post it.

367
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,899
I didn't think Mom would save it,

368
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,680
and not take it.

369
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,899
To be honest, before today,

370
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,319
I believed what you told me.

371
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,389
You said you never wanted to marry dad.

372
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:54,329
You even said you've never loved him.
And I believed all of this,

373
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,189
but the Cai Huan Zhen that
you hated the most told me,

374
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,179
that I need to look at your day-to-day life

375
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,389
and I will find evidence that
the two of you love each other.

376
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,359
And reality proved that she was right.

377
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,749
I think that no matter if it's
me, Sheng Na, or Dad, or you,

378
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,079
we were all were tricked by your pride.

379
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,679
In your heart, you must still love Dad.

380
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,590
Otherwise, you wouldn't
save any of these things.

381
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,340
Dad.

382
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,419
When mom first married you, she may
have had someone else in her heart.

383
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,029
But you chose to use coldness and
detachment to face your marriage.

384
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,359
You let a woman use this petty and low way

385
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,250
in your detachment, saving all the next-to-nothing
pieces of evidence that there was concern and care.

386
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,259
In this box, it contains
Mom's yearning for you.

387
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,399
And the detachment you
exhibited towards her.

388
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,319
This is the evidence that
you gave her a tragic love!

389
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,109
If you put no care in your
attitude then let me say this,

390
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,000
should you still be considered as a man?

391
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,080
As your son,

392
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,440
I couldn't have not said these words.

393
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,620
But as your divorce lawyer,

394
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,569
I really think that your marriage,

395
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,749
really has not gone to
a point of no return.

396
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,380
I hope the two of you can
give yourself and each other

397
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,270
a last chance.

398
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,750
Let them calm down first.

399
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,250
Then, what do you plan do to now?

400
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,450
I never thought that

401
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,220
you would have kept all these things.

402
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,829
Even movie tickets...

403
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,889
1997 <i>Titanic.</i>

404
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,180
That was our

405
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,640
last time watching a movie together.

406
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,980
Yu He, we haven't watched a
movie together in twenty years.

407
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,140
Do you want to watch a movie together?

408
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,420
Do you have time later?

409
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,680
Yes.

410
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,790
I feel really good. I want
to go to the place...

411
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,029
Do you remember the last time
the two of them held hands?

412
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,940
<i>Please.</i>

413
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:09,220
From childhood until now, I've never seen
them as close as they are right now.

414
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,369
- Then what do you plan to do
with Cai Huan Zhen? <br> -Huh?

415
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,319
- Dad and Mom argued for thirty years and have managed to
reconcile, what impossibilities do the two you have? <br> -I...

416
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,160
You are the man. I beg of you, take
the initiative already! Can't you?

417
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,130
- The timing isn't right. <br> -Then
when is the timing right?

418
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,060
When the timing is right,
you'll naturally know.

419
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,939
Huan Huan Jie, Busan City Hall just called to ask if you have
finished making the fixes to the collaboration project plan.

420
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,539
I'm correcting it right now. Let them know that
before I get off work I'll send it to them.

421
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,590
Okay, no problem.

422
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,149
-Hey. <br> -Hmm? <br>-Are you okay?

423
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,100
I'm very good.

424
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,309
My brother, these days,
did he not call you?

425
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,859
No.

426
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,789
Uh, I really don't know what he's thinking.

427
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:21,090
He clearly wants to reconcile with you, but he's
just putting on a facade and not doing anything.

428
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,130
Right now he probably doesn't
want to reconcile with me.

429
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,659
Or... are you saying,

430
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,310
that in your heart, you actually also
really want to reconcile with him.

431
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,409
I never said that.

432
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,510
Huan Huan Jie, someone is here to see you.

433
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,689
Auntie, you coming to see me today...
is there something wrong?

434
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:15,059
Huan Huan, coming here, I wanted to ask you

435
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,959
do you have a partner now?

436
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,620
-Huh? <br> -Huh?

437
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,689
Are you still single? Do
you have a boyfriend?

438
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,149
Mom.

439
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,349
Are you coming here today to say nonsense
like you can't be together with brother?

440
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,329
Stay quiet please, I'm here
to speak with Huan Huan.

441
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,379
Ah, what's the matter?
Do you have a boyfriend?

442
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,789
-No. <br> -Ah, perfect!

443
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:43,089
I have a single man with
good qualifications.

444
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,089
Did I hear wrong, Mom? You want to set
Cai Huan Zhen up on a blind date?!

445
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,589
You are really strange and noisy!

446
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,669
Ah, I'm here to find Huan Zhen.
What are you doing here right now?

447
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,779
Mom, aren't you being too over the top? It's not like
you don't know Cai Huan Zhen and brother's situation.

448
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,559
You doing this and you're even
setting up a blind date for her?

449
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,689
Huan Huan, let's not listen to her.

450
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,869
Here, this is the man's photo and information.
Take a look at it first. If you're satisfied,

451
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,220
Auntie can arrange for you to go
out to dinner to meet this person.

452
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,319
Auntie, thank you, but I really don't
have this intention right now.

453
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,079
Are you sure? This man's
qualifications are really good.

454
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,939
- I'm really okay, thank you. <br>-Look at it first. If you really
are not satisfied, we can talk about it, it's not too late.

455
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,819
Okay, okay, okay. I'll look at it to see if this man's
qualifications are that good. Just wait a moment, okay?

456
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,169
Ah, you're really strange. I already told you
this isn't for you. What are you looking at?

457
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,889
- No, you— <br>- Let go. You're really strange. It's
not your type so why are you fighting for it?

458
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,309
- Because—<br>- Stop fighting!

459
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,920
I'll look, I'll look!

460
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,909
What do you think?

461
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,380
This should be the type you like, right?

462
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,919
Huan Zhen,

463
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,620
relax, don't be nervous.

464

465
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,489
Okay. I won't bother you guys anymore.

466
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,849
You two can talk by yourselves.

467
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,110
I'll be leaving first.

468
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,159
Brother, I did what you wanted me to.

469
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,189
It'll be up to you now. Don't
forget what you promised me.

470
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,790
Don't make me disappointed.

471
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,380
You asked your mom to take me out?

472
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,969
That's not the main point.

473
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,629
The main point is that you're
sitting in front of me,

474
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,710
so in my mom's mind, you're the woman most
suited to be with me in the entire world.

475
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,249
When we separated,

476
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,190
I couldn't understand many things.

477
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,019
Why can't we be together even
though we love each other?

478
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,630
Why are you pushing me away even
after everything I did for you?

479
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,160
Do you not love me anymore?

480
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,980
It's not that I don't love you.

481
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,600
I just don't think we're
suited to be together.

482
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,700
To find this answer

483
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,910
I went back to the place where we broke up.

484
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,950
I stood on the streets of Busan,

485
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,650
and remembered the words you told me.

486
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,410
In that instance, I understood.

487
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,649
No matter how much we love each other,

488
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:50,890
no matter how much we want to be together, the
problem between us is still not solved, right?

489
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,529
So in your heart,

490
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,479
what you're most afraid of

491
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,870
are those things that might disappear.

492
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,220
That's why I told myself

493
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,179
that if I can't solve
the problem between us,

494
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,730
if I can't destroy all those things you're afraid of,
<br>then I don't have the right to say that I love you.

495
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,419
In Korea,

496
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,670
you said that my sister dislikes you.

497
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,929
Right now, you two have reconciled.

498
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,990
So you can't use this excuse anymore.

499
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,989
You said that my mom dislikes you,

500
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,199
that we're not suited to be together.

501
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,549
Right now, she's no longer
against us being together.

502
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:47,900
So you can't use this excuse
to reject me either.<br>Lastly,

503
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,759
it's also what you're most afraid of.

504
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,450
You think that being with me
will make me lose many things.

505
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,259
Why do you have this?

506
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,010
Teacher Yu E gave it to me.

507
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,029
This note made me realize your emotions.

508
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,870
But what I want to tell you is that

509
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,199
being with you never
made me lose my dreams.

510
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,700
Because rather than being afraid of those things
that might disappear, I'm most afraid of losing...

511
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,030
I'm most afraid of losing you.

512
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,130
So right now you don't have
any excuses to reject me!

513
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,150
Can you return to my side?

514
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,399
Do you remember what you told me?

515
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,360
When we first got together,
you had a dream.

516
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:21,099
In the dream, we were like a couple
who've been together for a long time.

517
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,199
Watching a movie that's been
rerunning for a long time,

518
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,180
sleeping together, waking up together.

519
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,930
I still remember.

520
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,939
Me, too.

521
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,519
Because I've dreamt the exact same dream.

522
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,289
It's a pleasant dream, but for some reason,

523
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,809
I felt afraid after waking up.
The me in the dream

524
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,209
was not the Cai Huan Zhen who has
had many failed relationships.

525
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,050
It was a Cai Huan Zhen who was
really happy and really blissful.

526
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,629
I suddenly felt so scared. I was scared
that we would work too hard for this dream,

527
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,949
but then one day, we would wake up

528
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:10,119
and realize that this relationship
was not as pleasant as we imagined.

529
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,750
What would we do then?

530
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,919
It's not that I don't want
to return to your side.

531
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,129
It's just that I'm really not certain

532
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,060
if I can achieve happiness like this.

533
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,879
If I can't be like you, saying "Yes!

534
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,030
This time, we can be happy until the end."

535
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,260
Wouldn't it be unfair to you?

536
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,520
Give me a bit more time.

537
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,139
After I've sorted out myself,
after I find the answer, okay?

538
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,479
What if you still can't find the answer?

539
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,460
Do you still not understand what I want?!

540

Cai Huan Zhen!

562
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,789
Aren't you going to work?
You're going to be late.

563
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,349
I'm already up.

564
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,370
Then what are you doing?

565
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,470

00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,390
I'm not.

567
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,859
Cai Huan Zhen, let me tell you something
very important. <br>Please pay attention.

568
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,729
Earlier I calculated yours
and Meng Meng's lives,

569
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,880
today your luck with
romance is very unsteady.

570
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,019
So today,

571
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,579
you can't take your phone to work.

572
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,059
How do I go to work if you take my phone?

573
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,369
You won't die for being without
your phone for one day.

574
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,879
You two can't contact each today!

575
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,989
Hey!

576
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,270
How can you take someone's phone like that?

577
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,049
Hey, wife, did you take her cell phone?

578
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,929
You don't have to worry
if I'm the one doing it.

579
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,080
Hurry and give it to me.
Otherwise we'll run out of time.

♫<i> Come and show me love </i>♫

613
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,199
♫<i> So come and give me love </i>♫

614
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,940
♫<i> L. O. V. E~ Love </i>♫

615
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,289
You said that you can't be with me

616
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:12,450
not because you don't love me,

617
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:18,679
but because you're not certain
if we can find happiness

618
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:23,039
by continuing to be together.

619
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,539
To be honest,

620
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,800
I can't answer you.

621
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,199
Because the answer

622
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,589
needs to be found

623
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,600
by the both of us.

624
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,470
What if

625
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,970
we still can't find it in the end?

626
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:57,409
What if I'm not the person that's
supposed to find the answer with you?

627
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,930
Impossible.

628
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,030
We will definitely find the answer.

629
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,659
Because our meeting

630
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,920
was destined.

631
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:17,690
It was destined before we even met.

632
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,399
<i>Whether it was the silhouette that made my
heart mysteriously pound for the first time...</i>

633
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,089
<i>- I don't want to.<br>- Just try it.</i>

634
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:31,789
<i>- I don't want to!<br>
- I don't care!</i>

635
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,709
<i>I'll bring the dress to you tomorrow.
Bye bye!</i>

636
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:39,650
<i>No! Bye bye!</i>

637
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,459
<i>Hey.</i>

638
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,659
<i>Why are you here?</i>

639
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:50,570
<i>The second time you made my heart palpitate...<br>-
Who is she?<br>- She's my best friend, Cai Huan Zhen.</i>

640
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,200
<i>Why is your hair so ugly?</i>

641
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:04,170
<i>Or the time you made my heart beat
to the point that I forgot myself...</i>

642
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:11,930
<i>All those innumerable times
you made my heart beat...</i>

643
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,259
<i>all this time...</i>

644
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,310
<i>it was only one person.</i>

645
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,850
Will you marry me?

646
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:10,229
To find the answer...

647
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,210
together.

648
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,640
I will.

649
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,889
♫<i> Forever </i>♫

650
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:53,490
♫<i> Forever </i>♫

651
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:25,450
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

652
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,239
<i>I know, he's really popular.</i>

653
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,309
<i>Who?</i>

654
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,779
<i>You all think he's good at basketball?</i>

655
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,479
<i>A sandwich and bubble tea.</i>

656
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,569
<i>Please wait a minute.</i>

657
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,979
<i>Cai Huan Zhen, let's go.</i>

658
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,559
<i>Alright.</i>

659
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,139
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

660
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,110
<i>I can't believe...</i>

661
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,110
<i>Cai Huan Zhen!</i>

662
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,039
<i>Perhaps we're not all perfect.</i>

663
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:45,619
<i>But that doesn't mean we can't
have a perfect relationship.</i>

664
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:50,959
<i>Because happiness is
earned by fighting for it.</i>

665
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,340
<i>To every woman... marry me, or not?</i>
