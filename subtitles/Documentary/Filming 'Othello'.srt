1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000


2
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,840
There was once in venice 
 a moor Othello who for

3
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,950
his merits in the affairs of war 
 was held in great esteem.

4
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,340
It happened that he fell in love 
 with a young and noble lady

5
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,800
called desdemona,

6
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,400
who drawn by his virtue, 
 became equally enamoured of him.

7
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,010
So it was that since her father 
 was much opposed to the union

8
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,240
of desdemona with a moor, 
 she fled her house at night.

9
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,310
In secret haste 
 they were married.

10
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,740
Now there was in Othello's 
 company, an ensign named lago,

11
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,500
a very amiable outward appearance

12
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,180
but his character was 
 extremely treacherous.

13
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,910
I have told often and 
 I retell it again and again.

14
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,080
I hate the moore.

15
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll poison his delight.

16
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,800
How? How, lago?

17
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,300
Proclaim him in the streets, 
 incense her kinsmen,

18
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,710
and though he in fertile climate 
 dwell, plague him with flies.

19
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,640
No, they come.

20
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,370
What will I do?

21
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,440
Why, go to bed and sleep.

22
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,640
- I'll incontinently drown myself. 
 Oh, bitterness.

23
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,240
What should I do?

24
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,610
Put money in thy purse.

25
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,710
Ere I would say I would drown 
 myself for love of a guinea

26
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,230
hen, I would change my 
 humanity with a baboon!

27
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,500
Come, be a man.

28
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,340
Drown thyself?

29
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,740
Drown cats and blind puppies.

30
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,840
It cannot be that desdemona 
 should long continue her love

31
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,000
to the moor or he his to her.

32
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,350
It was a violent commencement.

33
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,200
And thou shalt see an answerable 
 sequestration,

34
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,410
put buy money in thy purse.

35
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,710
When she is sated with his body

36
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,830
she'll fine the error 
 of her choice.

37
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,740
She must change, she must, 
 for youth.

38
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,140
Your daughter!

39
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,940
- Look, your house! 
 - Your house!

40
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,810
- Your daughter! 
 - Your daughter!

41
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,970
Senior, is all your family 
 within?

42
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,150
Why, wherefore ask you this?

43
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,710
Lf't be your pleasure for your 
 dull watch o' th' night,

44
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,710
transported, with no worse nor 
 better guard but with a knave

45
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,940
of common hire, a gondolier, 
 to the gross clasps of a

46
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,330
lascivious moor.

47
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,200
This thou shalt answer!

48
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Straight satisfy yourself, if she 
 be in your chamber or your house,

49
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,350
lago, can I depend on the issue?

50
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,600
Thou are sure of me. 
 Go, make money.

51
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,470
It is too true an evil. 
 Gone she is.

52
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,410
Is there not charms by which 
 the property of youth

53
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,340
and maidhood may be abused?

54
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,800
Call up all my people!

55
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,440
Raise my kindred!

56
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,170
Where is the moor?

57
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,670
Keep up your bright swords 
 for the dew'll rust them.

58
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,640
Oh, thou foul thief!

59
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,280
Where hast thou stowed 
 my daughter?

60
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,350
Hold your hands! Good signor,

61
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,910
where will you that I go to 
 answer this your charge?

62
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,940
To prison till fit time of law

63
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,540
and course of direct session 
 call thee to answer.

64
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,310
Now at the same hour, there 
 came messengers in haste

65
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,140
to the senate for there was 
 news that the turkish armies

66
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,440
were moving against the 
 venetian garrison in cyprus.

67
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,170
The senators, already raised

68
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,610
the net, elected the moor to the 
 commander of their troops.

69
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,470
And officers were searching

70
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,310
the town to apprise Othello 
 of this honor

71
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,670
when lo, desdemona's old 
 father himself brings the moor

72
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,970
at sword's point to the council 
 chamber upon a charge of

73
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,770
working from desdemona with 
 unlawful enchant.

74
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,910
She was abused,

75
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,010
stolen from me and, ay, 
 corrupted by magic spells.

76
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm very sorry for't.

77
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,970
If she in chains of magic were not 
 bound, whether a maid so tender,

78
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,810
fair and happy would ever have 
 to incur her general mock,

79
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,280
run from her father

80
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,840
to the sooty bosom of such a 
 fierce bat!

81
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,940
Damned as thou art, 
 thou hast enchanted her!

82
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,510
Othello, what in your own part 
 can you say to this?

83
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,910
Nothing but this is so!

84
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,070
Did you by indirect and forced

85
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,200
courses subdue and poison 
 this young maid of affection?

86
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,270
Most potent grave and 
 reverend signors,

87
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,440
my very noble and approved 
 good masters,

88
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,600
that I've taken away this old 
 man's daughter it's most true.

89
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,840
True I have married her.

90
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,050
The very head and front of my 
 offending has this extent,

91
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,940
no more.

92
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,680
Rude in my speech,

93
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,670
and little blessed with the soft 
 phrase of peace,

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,670
since these arms of mine had 
 seven years' pith till now some

95
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,970
nine moon wasted they 
 have used their dearest action

96
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,450
in the tented field and little 
 little of this great world can i

97
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,780
speak more than pertains 
 to feats of broil and battle.

98
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,900
And therefore little shall I grace 
 my cause in speaking of myself.

99
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,140
Yet by your gracious patience

100
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,670
i will round unvarnished tale 
 deliver of my whole course of love,

101
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
what drugs, what charms,

102
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,180
what conjuration and what

103
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,110
mighty magic, for such 
 proceedings am I charged withal

104
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,040
that I won his daughter.

105
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,540
Her father loved me, oft

106
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,610
invited me, still questioned me 
 the story of my life.

107
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,870
I ran it through even from my

108
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,970
boyish days wherein I speak of 
 the most disastrous chances

109
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,110
of moving accidents by flood 
 and fields of hair-breadth

110
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,440
scapes for the imminent 
 deadly breach.

111
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,440
Of being taken by insolent foe, 
 and sold to slavery,

112
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,470
of my redemption thence and 
 potency my travels history

113
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,910
wherein a venturous vast and 
 desert idle, rough quarries,

114
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,470
rocks and tills whose heads 
 touch heaven.

115
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,640
It was my head to speak.

116
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,610
Rest to hear, but desdemona 
 seriously inclined.

117
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,910
But still the house affairs would 
 draw her thence, which ever as

118
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,280
she could with haste dispatch,

119
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,100
come again and with a greedy 
 ear devour up my discourse.

120
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,930
I found good means to draw

121
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,710
from her a prayer of earnest 
 heart that I would all my

122
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,270
pilgrimage dilate, and often 
 did beguile her of her tears

123
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,400
when I did speak of some 
 distressed stroke of my use of it.

124
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:19,070
She gave me for my pains, 
 a world of sighs.

125
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,580
She swore, in faith: 'twas 
 strange, 'twas passing strange.

126
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,040
Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous 
 pitiful.

127
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,340
She wished she had not heard

128
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,310
it, yet she wished that 
 heaven made her such a man.

129
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,340
She thanked me, and bade me 
 if I had a friend that loved her

130
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,610
i should but teach him how to 
 tell my story

131
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,880
and that would woo her.

132
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,870
Upon this hint I spake,

133
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,530
she loved my for the dangers 
 I had passed,

134
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,480
and I loved her that she 
 did pity them.

135
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,960
This only is the witchcraft 
 I have used.

136
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,040
I think this tale would win 
 my daughter, too.

137
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,540
Come hither, desdemona.

138
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,080
Do you perceive in all this 
 noble company

139
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,910
where most owe you obedience?

140
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,710
My noble father, I do perceive 
 here a divided duty.

141
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,640
To you I am bound for life 
 and education.

142
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,610
My life and education both do 
 learn me how to respect you.

143
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
You are the lord of duty.

144
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,240
I am hitherto your daughter. 
 But here's my husband.

145
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,800
And so much duty as my 
 mother showed to you

146
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,710
preferring you before her father

147
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,250
so much I challenge that I 
 may profess,

148
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:54,670
due to the moor, my lord. 
 God be with you. I have done.

149
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,750
When remedies are past 
 the griefs are ended.

150
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,670
Please it your grace on to 
 the state affairs.

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,070
The turk with a most mighty 
 preparation makes for cyprus.

152
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,540
Othello, the fortitude of the 
 place is vast known to you.

153
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,270
You must away this morning.

154
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,840
With all my heart.

155
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,170
When we consider the importance 
 of cyprus to the turk, we must

156
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,970
not think the turk is so 
 unskillful to leave that latest

157
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
which concerns them first,

158
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,270
neglecting an attempt of ease and 
 gain to wake and wage a danger.

159
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,970
Look to her, moor 
 if thou hast eyes to see.

160
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,930
She has deceived her father 
 and may thee.

161
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,210
My life upon her faith!

162
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,110
Mark me with what violence 
 she first loved the moor

163
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,700
but for bragging and dealing 
 a fantastical lie.

164
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,630
Will she love him still for prating?

165
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,610
Ah, let not thy discreet heart 
 think it.

166
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,800
- Lieutenant cassio. 
 - Largo

167
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,110
what a cannon.

168
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,140
I know my price.

169
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm worth no worse a place.

170
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,340
But he, sir, had the election.

171
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,350
And what's he? This michael 
 cassio, this florentine,

172
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,810
that never set a squadron in the 
 field nor the division of a battle

173
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,880
knows more than a spinster. 
 Yet cassio must his lieutenant

174
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,240
be, by god bless the mark of 
 the fellow's ancient!

175
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,840
Well, I would not follow him that.

176
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,030
Oh, sir, content you.

177
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,840
I follow him to serve my turn 
 upon him.

178
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,640
Lago? Lago!

179
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,710
Honest lago!

180
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,500
I wake up on your lordship.

181
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,770
My desdemona must I leave 
 with thee.

182
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,610
I pray bring her after good time 
 to cyprus.

183
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,970
Well, me good lord, I'll do it.

184
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,500
The moor's of a free and 
 open nature, that thinks men

185
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,840
honest that seem to be so, 
 and will as tenderly be led by

186
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,500
th' nose as asses are.

187
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,010
We cannot all be masters.

188
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,280
Nor all masters cannot by 
 truly followed.

189
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,770
You shall mark many a duteous 
 and knee-crooking knave who

190
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,810
doting on his own obsequious 
 bondage wears out his time,

191
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,570
much like his master's ass, for 
 naught but provender; and when,

192
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,050
he's old, cashiered.

193
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,600
Whip me such honest knaves!

194
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,010
Others there are who, trimmed

195
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,180
in forms and visages of duty, 
 keep yet their hearts attending

196
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,250
on themselves, 
 and throwing but shows of

197
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,300
services on their lords, 
 do well thrive by them, and when

198
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,630
they have lined their coats 
 do themselves homage.

199
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,810
These fellows have some soul,

200
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,040
and such a one do I profess 
 myself for, sir, it is as sure

201
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:40,040
as you're roderigo, were 
 I the moor, I would not be lago.

202
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,040
In following him I follow 
 but myself.

203
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,400
When my outward action doth 
 demonstrate the native act and

204
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,480
figure of my heart in compliment

205
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,280
extern, 'tis not long after but 
 I will wear my heart upon my

206
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:02,180
sleeve, for daws to peck at. 
 I am not what I am.

207
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,540
I have but an hour of love 
 to spend with thee.

208
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,930
We must obey the time.

209
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,210
Oh, lago, what tidings can 
 you tell of my lord?

210
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,440
He's not yet arrived, but the

211
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,010
turkish fleets be not enshelterd 
 they are drowned.

212
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,380
It is there! I know 
 Othello's trumpet!

213
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,370
News, lads! News! The desperate 
 tempest hath so banged the turks

214
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,830
that their designment halts.

215
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,540
Our wars are done!

216
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,900
He takes her by the palm. 
 Well said. An excellent courtship.

217
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,130
With as little a web as this will I 
 ensnare as great a fly as cassio.

218
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,340
It gives me wonder great as my 
 content to see you here before me.

219
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,370
Oh, my soul's joy!

220
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,900
If after every tempest come such

221
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,700
calms, may the winds blow 
 till they have wakened death.

222
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,410
- My dear Othello! 
 - Oh, my fair warrior!

223
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,610
I prattle out of fashion, and 
 I dote in my own comforts.

224
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,000
- Worthy montano, your pardon 
 - sir

225
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,180
good michael, look you 
 to the guard tonight.

226
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,500
Come, my dear love.

227
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,870
Once more well met at cyprus.

228
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,180
It is Othello's pleasure that 
 upon certain tidings now arrived

229
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,240
importing the destruction of 
 the turkish fleet, every man

230
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,100
put himself into triumph.

231
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,300
Each man what sport and revels 
 his addiction lead him.

232
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,710
For, besides these beneficial news,

233
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,430
it is the celebration of 
 our general's nuptial.

234
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,140
Heaven bless the isle of cyprus 
 and our noble general Othello!

235
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,640
First, I must tell thee this.

236
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,750
Desdemona is directly 
 in love with him.

237
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,970
With cassio? 
 Why, 'tis not possible.

238
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,170
Her eyes must be fed.

239
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,240
And what delight shall she 
 have to look on the devil?

240
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,800
Very nature will compel her 
 to the second choice.

241
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,900
Now sir, this granted,

242
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,250
who stands so eminent in the degree 
 of this fortune as cassio does?

243
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,330
Why, none! Why, none!

244
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,210
A slipper and subtle knave, 
 a devilish knave!

245
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,340
- He is handsome. 
 - Cassio?

246
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,000
He has all the requisites in him

247
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,840
that folly and green minds 
 look after.

248
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,370
Oh, a pestilent complete knave

249
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,340
and the woman hath found 
 him already.

250
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,140
I cannot believe that in 
 desdemona.

251
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,180
Did you not see her paddle 
 with the palm of his hand?

252
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,830
Did not mark that?

253
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,410
Yes, that I did, but that was 
 but a courtesy.

254
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,410
Courtesy? Lechery. An index

255
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,430
and obscure prologue to the 
 history of lust and foul thoughts.

256
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,270
They met so near with their lips 
 that their breaths embraced together.

257
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,940
Villainous thoughts, roderigo.

258
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,670
But, sir, be you ruled by me.

259
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,640
Listen, listen to cassio tonight. 
 Watch him on the court of god.

260
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,610
Cassio knows you not. 
 I'll not be far from you.

261
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,600
Do you find some occasion 
 to anger him from what

262
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,800
other course you please.

263
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,800
Well

264
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,570
sir, he's rash and very sudden

265
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,580
in choler, and haply may 
 strike at you.

266
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,700
Provoke him that he may,

267
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,870
for even out of that will I 
 cause these of cyprus to mutiny

268
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,670
and the displanting of cassio. 
 Lieutenant cassio!

269
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,310
Lago, I'll say, you like me 
 well, lago?

270
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,100
In the sincerity of 
 love and friendship.

271
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,470
Come, lieutenant, a stoup of 
 wine!

272
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,010
Here a brace of gallants that

273
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,210
fain have a measure to the 
 health of black Othello.

274
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,640
Not tonight, good lago.

275
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,230
I have very poor and unhappy 
 brains for drinking.

276
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,740
Oh, just one cup.

277
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,740
I must to the watch.

278
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,180
Not this hour, lieutenant, 
 'tis not yet ten o' th' clock.

279
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,800
Our general cast us thus early 
 for the love of his desdemona.

280
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,610
He hath not yet made wanton 
 the night with her

281
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,440
and she is sport for jove.

282
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,370
She's a most exquisite lady.

283
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
And full of game, I'll warrant.

284
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,100
What an eye she has 
 to provocation.

285
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,180
I object, I think right modest.

286
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:47,940
Well, happiness to their sheets. 
 Another cup, I'll drink for you.

287
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,240
I have drunk two cups and 
 I don't dare not to task

288
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,680
my weakness with any more.

289
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,410
My man, 'tis a night of revels.

290
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,870
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.

291
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,110
If it were now to die, 'twere 
 now to be most happy,

292
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,470
for I fear my soul hath her content

293
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,640
so absolute that not another 
 comfort like to this

294
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:43,900
succeeds in unknown fate. 
 Ah, brothers on call tonight!

295
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,730
God, an excellent song!

296
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,540
I learned it in england, where

297
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,150
indeed they are most potent 
 in potting.

298
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,830
Your dane, your german,

299
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,570
and your swag-bellied hollander 
 - drink, ho! -

300
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,970
are nothing to your english.

301
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,210
Is your englishman so exquisite 
 in his drinking?

302
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,360
He drinks you with facility 
 you dane dead drunk,

303
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,640
he sweats not to overthrow 
 your almain,

304
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,010
he gives your hollander a vomit 
 ere the next pottle can be filled.

305
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,640
To the health of our general!

306
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,140
I am for it, lieutenant, and 
 I'll do you justice.

307
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,740
Good faith, a little one, 
 not past a pint, as I'm a soldier.

308
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, god above all 
 and there be souls must be saved,

309
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,110
and there be souls must not 
 be saved.

310
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,510
It's true, good lieutenant.

311
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,840
For mine own part, no offense

312
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,840
to the general, nor any man 
 of quality, I hope to be saved.

313
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,270
Ay, but, by your leave, 
 not before me.

314
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,580
Do not think, gentlemen, 
 I am drunk.

315
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:17,040
This is my ancient, my right 
 hand, this is my left.

316
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,200
I am not drunk now. I can 
 stand well enough, and

317
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,850
i speak well enough.

318
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,740
Excellent well!

319
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,470
Very well. You must not think 
 then that I am drunk.

320
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,000
Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!

321
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,700
What noise is this?

322
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,500
A knave teach me my duty?

323
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,240
What's the matter, lieutenant?

324
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,700
I'll beat the knave into 
 a twiggen bottle.

325
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,640
Away, I say.

326
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,610
Go out and cry a mutiny!

327
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:22,140
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny! 
 Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!

328
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,000
Stop, lieutenant!

329
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,070
Hold this shame forever!

330
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,270
Have you forgot all place of 
 sense and duty?

331
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,470
Hold the rage!

332
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,770
Hold, gentlemen!

333
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,970
You're ordered above. 
 Yeah, move, come on!

334
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,180
Why, sir, the generals!

335
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,770
Silence that dreadful bell!

336
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,150
Who began this? Lago.

337
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,030
I do not know.

338
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,900
Friends all, but now, even now, 
 in quarter and terms like

339
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,940
bride and groom devesting 
 them for bed,

340
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,100
but now swords out and tilting 
 one at other's breasts.

341
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,070
Worthy montano, what's the matter

342
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,870
that you unlace your 
 reputation thus and spend your

343
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,430
rich opinion for the name 
 of a night-brawler?

344
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,510
Your officer, lago, can 
 inform you.

345
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,040
Fortunate. Town of war to manage 
 private and domestic quarrel?

346
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,340
In night, and on the court 
 and guard of safety?

347
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,370
Lago, who began't?

348
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,070
Thou dost deliver more or less 
 than truth, thou art no soldier.

349
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,140
I had rather have this tongue 
 cut from my mouth than it should

350
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,610
do offense to michael cassio.

351
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,400
Sir, men in rage strike those 
 that wish them best,

352
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,370
yet surely cassio I believe 
 received from him that fled

353
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,800
some strange dignity, which 
 patience could not pass.

354
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,810
I know, lago, the honesty 
 and love doth mince this matter,

355
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,170
making it light to cassio.

356
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:02,740
Cassio, I love thee, 
 but never more be officer of mine.

357
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,330
Look if my gentle love be not 
 raised up.

358
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,540
I'll make thee an example.

359
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,900
What, are you hurt, lieutenant? 
 Ay, past all surgery.

360
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,030
Marry, heaven forbid!

361
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,510
Reputation, reputation, 
 reputation!

362
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,100
O, I have lost my reputation!

363
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,730
I have lost the immortal part 
 of myself,

364
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,930
and what remains is bestial.

365
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,310
My reputation, lago, 
 my reputation.

366
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,140
Reputation oft got without 
 merit and lost without deserving.

367
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,870
I tell you what you shall do.

368
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,340
Our general's wife is 
 now the general.

369
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,910
Confess yourself freely to her.

370
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,370
Desdemona is of so free, so 
 kind, so blessed a disposition

371
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,240
she holds it a vice in her 
 goodness not to do more than

372
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,330
she is requested.

373
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,180
Farewell, lieutenant.

374
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,800
Roderigo.

375
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,730
My money is almost spent,

376
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,870
i have been tonight exceedingly 
 well cudgeled.

377
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,770
And I think the issue will be,

378
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,170
i shall have so much experience 
 for my pains, and so, with

379
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,940
no money at all, and a little 
 more wit, return again to venice.

380
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,110
How poor are they that 
 have not patience!

381
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,830
Does not go well?

382
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,570
Cassio has beaten thee, and 
 thou by that small hurt hath

383
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,410
cashiered cassio.

384
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,840
Content thyself awhile.

385
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,430
For whiles this honest fool 
 plies desdemona to repair

386
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,170
his fortune, and she for him 
 pleads strongly to the moor.

387
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,510
Io, by how much she strives

388
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,480
to do him good, she shall 
 undo her credit with the moor.

389
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,630
So will I turn her virtue into pitch, 
 and out of her own

390
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,140
goodness make the net 
 that shall enmesh them all.

391
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,830
Do not doubt, cassio.

392
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,570
I'll have my lord and you again 
 as friendly as you were.

393
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,940
Madam, whatever shall become 
 of michael cassio, he's never

394
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,400
anything but your true servant.

395
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,840
Ha! I like not that.

396
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,700
What dost thou say?

397
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,640
Nothing, my lord, or if, 
 I know not what.

398
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,470
How now, my lord?

399
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,800
I have been talking with 
 a suitor here.

400
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,840
A man that languishes in 
 your displeasure.

401
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,740
Who is't you mean?

402
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,900
Why, your lieutenant cassio.

403
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,150
Went he hence now?

404
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,080
I' sooth so humbled that he hath 
 left part of his grief with me

405
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,100
to suffer with him.

406
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,430
Good love, call him back.

407
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,440
Some other time.

408
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,730
- Shall't be shortly? 
 - The sooner, sweet, for you.

409
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,370
- Shall't be tonight at supper? 
 - No, not tonight.

410
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,950
Tomorrow dinner then?

411
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,350
I shall not dine at home.

412
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,900
I meet the captains 
 at the citadel.

413
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,370
Why then, tomorrow night. 
 I prithee name the time.

414
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,270
No more. Let him come 
 when he will.

415
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,440
I will deny thee nothing.

416
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,810
Whereon I do beseech thee

417
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,370
grant me this to leave me 
 but a little to myself.

418
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,910
Shall I deny you? No. 
 Farewell, my lord.

419
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,000
- My noble lord. 
 - What dost thou say, lago?

420
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,340
Did michael cassio, when you 
 wooed my lady,

421
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,470
know of your love?

422
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,610
He did, from first to last. 
 Why dost thou ask?

423
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,040
But for a satisfaction of my 
 thought, no further harm.

424
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,040
Why of thy thought, lago?

425
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,110
I did not think he had been 
 acquainted with her.

426
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,930
O, yes, and went between us 
 very oft.

427
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,670
- Indeed? 
 - Indeed? Ay, indeed.

428
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Discern'st thou aught in that? 
 Is he not honest?

429
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,170
- Honest, my lord? 
 - Honest? Ay, honest!

430
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,300
My lord, for aught I know.

431
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,070
What dost thou think?

432
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,110
Think, my lord?

433
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,700
Think. Thou dost mean something.

434
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,340
I heard thee say even now, 
 thou lik'st not that,

435
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,910
when cassio left my wife.

436
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,330
If thou dost love me 
 show me thou thought.

437
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,700
My lord, you know I love you.

438
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,370
I think thou dost.

439
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,370
For michael cassio, I dare

440
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,070
be sworn, I think he is honest. 
 I think so, too.

441
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,940
Men should be what they seem.

442
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,170
Certain, men should be 
 what they seem.

443
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,290
Why then, I think cassio's 
 an honest man.

444
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,670
Nay, yet there's more in this?

445
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,330
I prithee speak to me as 
 to thy thinkings.

446
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,070
Good name in man and woman,

447
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,540
dear my lord, is the immediate 
 jewel of their souls.

448
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,740
Who steals my purse steals 
 trash; 'this something, nothing.

449
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,110
Twas mine, 'tis his, and has 
 been slave to thousands.

450
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,060
But he that flinches from me 
 my good name robs me of

451
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,810
that which not enriches him 
 and makes me poor indeed.

452
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,240
By heaven, I'll know 
 thy thoughts.

453
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,000
Beware, my lord, of jealousy! 
 It is the green-eyed monster,

454
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,900
which doth mock the meat 
 it feeds on.

455
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,200
That cuckold lives in bliss 
 who, certain of his fate,

456
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,240
loves not his wronger.

457
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,310
But o, what damned minutes 
 tells he over who dotes,

458
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,940
yet doubts, suspects, 
 yet fondly loves!

459
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,710
Why? Why is this?

460
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,340
Think'st thou I'd make a life of

461
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,310
jealousy to follow still the 
 changes of the moon with

462
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:53,460
fresh suspicions? 
 No, lago, I'll see before I doubt.

463
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,940
When I doubt, prove. 
 I speak not yet of proof.

464
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,380
Look to your wife. 
 Observe her well with cassio.

465
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,630
I know our country disposition 
 well.

466
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,510
In venice they do let heaven

467
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,440
see the pranks they dare not 
 show their husbands.

468
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,170
Their best conscience is not to 
 leave't undone but kept unknown.

469
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,440
Dost thou say so?

470
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,810
She did deceive her father, 
 marrying you.

471
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,280
And when she seemed to shake 
 and fear your looks,

472
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,340
she loved them most.

473
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,140
And so she did.

474
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,900
Why, go to then! She that so 
 young could give out such a

475
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,230
seeming to seel her father's 
 eyes up close as oak.

476
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,100
He thought 'twas witchcraft. 
 But I am much to blame.

477
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,080
I humbly do beseech you of my 
 pardon for too much loving you.

478
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,970
I'm bound to thee forever.

479
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,600
I see this hath a little 
 dashed your spirit.

480
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,840
Not a jot, not a jot.

481
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,060
Trust me, I fear it has.

482
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,010
I hope you will consider what 
 is spoke comes from my love.

483
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,570
Cassio's my worthy friend.

484
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,900
My lord, I see you're moved!

485
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,470
No, not much moved.

486
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,510
I do not think but 
 desdemona's honest.

487
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,540
Long live she so. 
 And long live you to think so.

488
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,540
And yet, how nature erring 
 from itself

489
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,770
ay, there's the point, as to

490
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,970
be bold with you, not to 
 affect many proposed matches

491
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,370
of her own clime, complexion, 
 and degree.

492
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,740
One may smell in such a will 
 most rank, foul disproportions,

493
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,570
thought unnatural.

494
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,370
My lord, I would I might entreat 
 your honor to scan this thing

495
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,910
no further. Leave it to time.

496
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,360
Farewell.

497
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
Leave me, lago.

498
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,770
How now, my dear Othello?

499
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,770
My lord, I take my leave.

500
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,610
Are you not well?

501
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,100
I have a pain upon my 
 forehead here.

502
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,400
Why, that's with watching.

503
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,510
It will away again.

504
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,870
Let me but bind it hard, within 
 hours it will be well.

505
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,280
Your napkin is too little. 
 Let it alone!

506
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,610
I have a thing for you.

507
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,370
You have a thing for me?

508
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,070
It is a common thing to 
 have a foolish wife.

509
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,940
O, is that all? What will you

510
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,370
give me now for that 
 same handkerchief?

511
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,200
What handkerchief?

512
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,500
That which so often you 
 did bid me to steal.

513
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,370
Give it me.

514
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,880
If it be not for some purpose 
 of import, give't me again.

515
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,370
Poor lady, she'll run mad.

516
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,340
I have use for it. Leave me.

517
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,870
How now, general?

518
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,530
I swear 'tis better to be much

519
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,580
abused than but to 
 know't a little.

520
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,400
- My lord! 
 - Is my lord angry?

521
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,630
He went hence but now, and 
 certainly in strange unquietness.

522
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,970
- I will go seek him. 
 - I prithee do so.

523
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,540
There's matter in't indeed 
 if he be angry.

524
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,900
Villain, be sure thou prove 
 my love a whore, be sure of it!

525
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,270
Give me the ocular proof,

526
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,170
or, by the worth of mine eternal 
 soul, thou hadst been better

527
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
have been born a dog than 
 answer my waked wrath!

528
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,430
Is't come to this?

529
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,770
Make me to see't, or at the 
 least so prove it that

530
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,470
the probation bear no hinge 
 nor loop to hang a doubt on

531
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,210
or woe upon thy life!

532
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,400
Never pray more, 
 abandon all remorse.

533
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,410
For nothing canst thou to 
 damnation add greater than that.

534
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,440
O monstrous world!

535
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,060
Take note, take note, o world!

536
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,830
To be direct and honest 
 is not safe.

537
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,430
By the world I think my wife 
 be honest, and think she is not.

538
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,010
I think that thou art just, and 
 think thou art not.

539
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,670
I'll have some proof. Her name,

540
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,640
that was as fresh as dian's 
 visage, is now begrimed and

541
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,740
black as mine own face.

542
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,870
Would I were satisfied!

543
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,500
How satisfied, my lord?

544
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,440
Would you, the supervisor, 
 grossly gape on?

545
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,640
Behold her topped?

546
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,200
It is impossible you should 
 see this.

547
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,540
Were they as prime as goats, 
 as hot as monkey?

548
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,240
Give me a living reason 
 she's disloyal!

549
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,910
I lay with cassio lately, and 
 being trouble with a raging

550
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,940
tooth, I could not sleep.

551
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,040
There are a kind of men so loose 
 or should that in their sleeps

552
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,580
will mutter their affairs.

553
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,730
One of this kind is cassio.

554
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,170
In sleep I heard him say,

555
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,800
sweet desdemona, let us 
 be wary, let us hid our loves.

556
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,610
And then, sir, would he gripe 
 and wring my hand, cry

557
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,730
o sweet creature! Then kiss

558
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,470
me hard as if he plucked up 
 kisses by the roots that grew

559
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,630
upon my lips, laid his leg o'er 
 my thigh, and sigh, and kiss

560
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,270
and then cry, cursed fate 
 that gave thee to the moor!

561
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,740
I'll tear her all to pieces!

562
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,930
Tell me but this. Have you not 
 sometimes seen a handkerchief

563
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,130
spotted with strawberries in 
 your wife's hand?

564
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,370
I gave her such a one.

565
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,500
Such a handkerchief, I'm sure 
 it was your wife's, did I today

566
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,440
see cassio wipe his face.

567
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,940
If it be that

568
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,140
if it be that, or any that was

569
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,280
hers, it speaks against her 
 with the other proofs.

570
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,510
Now do I see 'tis true.

571
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,230
O, that the slave had 
 forty thousand lives!

572
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:22,860
One is too poor, too week 
 for my revenge!

573
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,310
- Yet be content! 
 - Blood, blood, blood!

574
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,440
Patience, I say. 
 Your mind may change.

575
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,970
Never, lago. Like to the pontiac

576
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,810
sea, whose icy current and 
 compulsive course nev'r keeps

577
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,270
retiring ebb, but keeps due on 
 to the propontic and the

578
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:41,900
hellespont.

579
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,770
Even so my bloody thoughts,

580
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,340
with violent pace, shall nev'r 
 look back, nev'r ebb to humble

581
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,970
love, till that a capable and 
 wide revenge swallow them up.

582
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,200
Witness that here lago doth 
 give up the execution of

583
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,810
his wit, hands, heart to 
 wronged Othello's service.

584
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,040
Within these three days let me

585
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,580
here thee say that 
 cassio's not alive.

586
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,800
My friend is dead. 'tis done 
 at your request.

587
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,230
But let her live.

588
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,740
Damn her, lewd minx!

589
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,340
O, damn her!

590
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,400
Now art thou my lieutenant.

591
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,370
I am your own forever.

592
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,800
Cassio! Cassio!

593
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,970
Give me your hand.

594
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,280
This hand is moist, my lady.

595
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,530
It hath felt no age nor 
 known no sorrow.

596
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:39,770
This argues fruitfulness and 
 liberal heart. Hot, hot and most.

597
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,140
'Tis a good hand, a frank one.

598
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,260
You may, indeed, say so 
 for 'twas that hand that

599
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,430
gave away my heart.

600
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,800
A liberal hand.

601
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,480
Come now, your promise.

602
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,370
- What promise, chuck? 
 - Let cassio be received again.

603
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,240
Lend me thy handkerchief.

604
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,810
I have it not about me.

605
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,830
- Not? 
 - No, indeed, my lord.

606
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,030
That's a fault. That handkerchief

607
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,200
did an egyptian to my mother 
 give.

608
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,270
The worms were hallowed that 
 did breed the silk.

609
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,950
Then would to god that 
 I had never seen't.

610
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,430
Is't lost? Is't gone? 
 Speak, is it out of the way?

611
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,540
It is not lost. 
 But what an if it were?

612
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,540
How?

613
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,000
I say it is not lost.

614
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,870
Fetch't, let me see it!

615
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,100
Why, so I can, but I will 
 not now.

616
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,430
This is a trick to put me 
 from my suit.

617
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,370
Pray you let cassio 
 be received again.

618
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,940
- The handkerchief! 
 - I pray talking of cassio

619
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:30,700
the handkerchief!

620
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,670
A man that all his time hath founded 
 his good fortunes on your love,

621
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,810
- shares dangers with you 
 - the handkerchief!

622
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,310
Come, come, you'll never 
 meet a more sufficient man.

623
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:46,440
Away. Away! 
 Away!

624
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,370
Cassio, this handkerchief. 
 Whose is it?

625
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,930
I found it here. 
 I like the work well.

626
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,400
'Tis very good! 
 Shall I see you soon at night?

627
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,410
I will see you soon, bianca.

628
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,040
- Come, lieutenant. 
 - Cassio, handkerchief.

629
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,900
Take it. Have it copied 
 thee made for it.

630
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,680
Tell you yet once more,

631
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,560
importune desdemona to 
 put you in your place again.

632
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,040
Sure there's some wonder 
 in this handkerchief.

633
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,040
'Tis a year or two shows 
 us a man.

634
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,370
They're all but stomachs, 
 and we all but food. Cassio!

635
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,400
They eat us hungerly, and 
 when they're full, they belch us.

636
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,010
How now, good cassio? 
 What's the news with you?

637
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,470
What trumpet is that same? 
 Something from venice.

638
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,010
My noble lord, whilest you 
 were here, overwhelmed with

639
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,170
your grief, cassio came hither. 
 I shifted him aways, bade him

640
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,140
anon return, and 
 here speak with me.

641
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,300
Mark the fleers, the gibes,

642
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,370
and notable scorns that dwell 
 in every region of his face.

643
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,310
For I will make him tell 
 the tale anew,

644
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,410
where, how, how oft, how 
 long ago, and when he hath

645
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,800
and is again to cope your wife.

646
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,140
I say, but mark his gesture.

647
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:38,200
Marry patience, or I shall say 
 you're all in all in spleen,

648
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,600
and nothing of a man. 
 Dost thou hear, lago?

649
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,670
I will be found most cunning 
 in my patience.

650
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,770
But - dost thou hear? - 
 most bloody.

651
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,630
- How do you know, lieutenant? 
 - Lago.

652
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,040
Now, if this suit lay in bianca's 
 power,

653
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,070
how quickly should you speed!

654
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,830
Alas, poor caitiff!

655
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,310
I never knew woman love 
 man so.

656
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,100
She gives it out that 
 you shall marry her.

657
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,870
Ay!

658
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,930
I was talking on the sea bank, 
 and the bauble falls me thus

659
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,040
about my neck

660
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,240
so hangs, and lolls, and 
 weeps upon me,

661
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,330
so shakes and pulls me!

662
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,310
- Cassio! 
 - I must leave her company.

663
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,370
What did you mean by that same 
 handkerchief you gave me even now?

664
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,500
A likely piece of work that 
 you should find it in your

665
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,800
chamber and know not who 
 left I t there!

666
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,170
This is some minx's token.

667
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,970
I'll take out no work on't.

668
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,970
Now now, my sweet bianca? 
 How now?

669
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,480
After her! After her!

670
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,900
Did you see how he laughed 
 at his vice?

671
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,650
O lago.

672
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,300
Did you see the handkerchief?

673
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,730
Was that mine?

674
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,070
Desdemona gave it him, and 
 he hath giv'n it his whore.

675
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,800
I had been happy if the general 
 camp, pioners and all, had

676
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,970
tasted her sweet body.

677
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,440
So I had nothing known.

678
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,030
What sense had I of her 
 stolen hours of lust?

679
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,810
I saw it not, it harmed me not.

680
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,700
I slept the next night well, 
 was free and merry!

681
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:43,170
I found not cassio's kisses 
 on her lips.

682
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,970
A fine woman, a fair woman, 
 a sweet woman.

683
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,270
Nay, you must forget that.

684
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,810
Ay, let her rot and perish, 
 and be damned.

685
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,570
No, my heart is turned to stone. 
 I strike it and it hurts my hand.

686
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,000
O, the world hath not a 
 sweeter creature!

687
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,810
She might lie by an emperor's 
 side and command him tasks.

688
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,040
Nay, that's not your way.

689
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,400
Hang her! I do but say 
 what she is.

690
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,840
So delicate with her needle.

691
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,700
An admirable musician.

692
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,970
O, she will sing the savageness 
 out of a bear.

693
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,730
Of so high and plenteous 
 wit and invention

694
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,870
she's the worse for all this.

695
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,440
O, a thousand, a thousand 
 times.

696
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,710
Of so gentle a condition?

697
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,070
Ay, too gentle.

698
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:02,310
Nay, that's certain. 
 Yet the pity of it, lago.

699
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,270
O lago, the pity of it, lago.

700
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,370
I will chop her into messes!

701
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,570
Cuckold me!

702
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,000
- Will you think so? 
 - Think so, lago?

703
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,160
- What, to kiss in private? 
 - An unauthorized kiss?

704
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,930
Or to be naked with her 
 friend in bed an hour or more

705
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,700
not meaning any harm.

706
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,410
Naked in bed?

707
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,430
But if I give my wife 
 a handkerchief

708
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,370
what then?

709
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,800
Why, then 'tis hers, my lord, 
 and being hers shy may,

710
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,910
i think, bestow't on any man.

711
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,770
By heaven, I would most 
 gladly have forgot it!

712
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,600
He had my handkerchief!

713
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,240
- Ay, what of that? 
 - That's not so good now.

714
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,630
What if I had said I had seen 
 him do you wrong?

715
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,600
- Or heard him say 
 - hath he said anything?

716
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,600
He hath, my lord, but 
 no more than

717
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,280
what hath he said?

718
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,170
That he did I know not what he did 
 what? What?

719
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,800
Lie.

720
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,540
Lie with her?

721
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,400
With her, on her, what you will.

722
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,980
Damnation!

723
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,070
My lord, I say, Othello!

724
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,370
Dost thou mock me?

725
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,530
I mock you not, by heaven.

726
00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:04,640
O now for ever farewell 
 the tranquil mind.

727
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,000
Farewell content.

728
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,700
Farewell the plumed troops, 
 and the big wars that make

729
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,470
ambition virtue. O farewell!

730
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,430
Farewell the neighing steed and 
 the shrill trump,

731
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,140
the spirit-stirring drum, 
 th'ear-piercing fife, the royal

732
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:35,610
banner, and all quality, 
 pride, pomp, and circumstance,

733
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,300
of glorious war.

734
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,380
And o you mortal engines 
 whose rude throats the immortal

735
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,700
jove's dread clamors 
 counterfeit.

736
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:54,070
Farewell! Othello's occupation's 
 gone!

737
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,170
- God save you, worthy general. 
 - Pray you.

738
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,140
The duke and the senators 
 of venice greet you.

739
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,940
I kiss the instrument of 
 their pleasures.

740
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,610
Is there division 'twixt my lord 
 and cassio?

741
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,900
A most unhappy one, I would 
 do much t' atome them,

742
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,970
for the love I bear to cassio.

743
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,740
My lord?

744
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,170
May be th' letter moved him, 
 for, I think, they do command

745
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,030
him home, deputing cassio 
 in his government.

746
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,710
- Trust me, I am glad on it. 
 - Indeed?

747
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,460
- Why, sweet Othello 
 - devil! Out of my way!

748
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,100
I will not stay to offend you.

749
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,830
Truly an obedient lady.

750
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,380
I do beseech your lordship 
 call her back.

751
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,810
- Mistress! 
 - My lord!

752
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,970
What would you do with her, sir?

753
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:39,310
Who? I, my lord?

754
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,770
You did wish that I would make 
 her turn.

755
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,710
Sir, she can turn, and turn, 
 and yet go on and turn again,

756
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,200
and she can weep, sir, weep.

757
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,100
And she's obedient, as you say, 
 obedient. Very obedient.

758
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,470
Proceed you in your tears.

759
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,670
Concerning this, sir

760
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:00,270
o well-painted passion! 
 I am commanded home.

761
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,840
Get you away, I'll send 
 for you anon.

762
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:14,810
Sir, I obey the mandate and 
 will return to venice.

763
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,570
Cassio shall have my place.

764
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,810
You are welcome, sir, 
 to cyprus.

765
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:38,740
Goats and monkeys!

766
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,700
Is he not light of brain?

767
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,540
He's that he is.

768
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,000
Let me see your eyes.

769
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,010
Look in my face.

770
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,500
Why, what art thou?

771
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,470
Your wife, my lord. 
 Your true and loyal wife.

772
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,070
Had it pleased heaven to try me 
 with affliction, had they rained

773
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,530
all kinds of sores and shames 
 on my bare head, steeped me

774
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,440
in poverty to the very lips, 
 given to captivity me and

775
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,840
my utmost hopes.

776
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:02,040
I should have found in some 
 place of my soul a drop of patinece

777
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:08,160
but, alas, to make me the fixed 
 figure for the time of scorn

778
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,040
to point his slow and moving 
 finger at.

779
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,410
Yet could I bear that too, well, 
 very well.

780
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,900
But there where I have garnered 
 up my heart, where either

781
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,500
i must live or bear no life, 
 the fountain from the which my

782
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:38,630
current runs or else dries up, 
 to be discarded thence, or

783
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,640
keep it as a cistern for foul 
 toads to knot and gender in.

784
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,140
I hope my noble lord 
 esteems me honest.

785
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,670
O, ay, as summer flies are 
 in the shambles, that quicken

786
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,470
even with blowing.

787
01:01:52,780 --> 01:02:01,640
O, thou weed, who art so 
 lovely fair, and smell'st so

788
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,780
sweet, that the sense aches 
 at thee, would thou hadst

789
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,010
never been born!

790
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:16,010
Alas, what ignorant sin 
 have I committed?

791
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,740
Committed? A thou public 
 commoner, I should make very

792
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,880
forges of my cheeks that would 
 to cinders burn up modestly.

793
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,800
Did I but speak thy deeds. 
 What committed?

794
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,670
Heaven stops the nose at it, 
 and the moon winks,

795
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,900
the bawdy wind that kisses all 
 it meets is hushed within the

796
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,400
hollow mine of earth and 
 will not hear't. What committed?

797
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,800
- Are not you a strumpet? 
 - By heaven you do me wrong!

798
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,640
- Are not you a strumpet? 
 - No, as I am a christian!

799
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,970
- Is't possible? 
 - O heaven forgive us!

800
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,970
I cry you mercy then.

801
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:59,800
I took you for that cunning 
 whore of venice that married with Othello

802
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,440
how do you, madam?

803
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,010
How do you, my good lady?

804
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,710
Faith, half asleep.

805
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,310
Good madam, what's the 
 matter with my lord?

806
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,500
With who?

807
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,940
Why, with my lord, madam.

808
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,100
Who is thy lord?

809
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,070
He that is yours, sweet lady.

810
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,800
I have none. Do not talk 
 to me, emilia.

811
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,670
I cannot weep, nor answers have 
 I none, but what should go by water

812
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:14,240
prithee tonight lay on my 
 wedding sheets, remember.

813
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:05,270
Get me some poison, lago, 
 this night.

814
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:10,400
I'll not expostulate with her, 
 lest her body and beauty

815
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,900
unprovide my mind again.

816
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,870
Do it not with poison.

817
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:20,830
Strangle her in her bed, even 
 the bed she hath contaminated.

818
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,140
Good, good! The justice of 
 it pleases.

819
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,870
And for cassio, let me be 
 his undertaker.

820
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,970
Excellent good!

821
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,110
You shall hear more by midnight.

822
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,610
A halter pardon him!

823
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,900
And hell gnaw his ones!

824
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,130
Who should he call her whore?

825
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,370
Who keeps her company?

826
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,970
What time? What place?

827
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,970
What form? What likelihood?

828
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,800
The moor's abused by some 
 most villainous knave,

829
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,210
some base notorious knave, 
 some scurvy fellow!

830
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,800
Speak within doors.

831
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,930
Some such squire he was 
 that turned your wit the steamy

832
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:23,340
side without and made you to 
 suspect me with the moor.

833
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,940
Desdemona.

834
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:35,070
Get you to bed.

835
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,400
Dismiss your attendant there.

836
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,240
Look't be done.

837
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:46,180
I do not find that thou deal'st 
 justly with me.

838
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,530
What in the contrary?

839
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,900
Every day thou daff'st me 
 with some device, lago.

840
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,410
I have wasted myself out of 
 my means.

841
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,540
The jewels you have had from 
 me to deliver desdemona would

842
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,470
half have corrupted a votarist.

843
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,970
You have tole me she hath 
 received them, and returned

844
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,110
me expectations and comforts 
 of sudden respect and

845
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,260
acquaintance, but I find none.

846
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,910
Very well. Go to.

847
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:12,510
I cannot go to, man, 
 nor 'tis not very well.

848
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,180
I will make myself known 
 to desdemona.

849
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,640
She will return me my jewels.

850
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:23,070
If not, I will seek satisfaction 
 of you.

851
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,300
Now I see there's a mettle 
 in thee, and even from this

852
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,410
instant do build on thee a 
 better opinion than ever before.

853
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,710
Give me thy hand, roderigo.

854
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,470
I protest I have dealt 
 mostly directly in thy affair.

855
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,840
It hath not appeared.

856
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:45,870
I grant thee it hath not appeared, 
 and your suspicion is not

857
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,010
without wit and judgment.

858
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,170
If thou hast that in thee indeed 
 which I have greater reason

859
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,040
to believe now than ever,

860
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:01,170
i mean purpose, courage, and 
 valor, this night prove it.

861
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:08,140
If thou the next night following 
 enjoy not desdemona,

862
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,340
take me from this world 
 with treachery.

863
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,560
There is especial commission 
 come from venice to depute

864
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,040
cassio in Othello's place.

865
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:35,610
Why, then Othello and desdemona 
 return again to venice.

866
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,300
Unless his abode be lingered 
 here by some accident, wherein

867
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:45,200
none can be so determinate 
 as the removing of cassio.

868
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,400
How do you mean, removing him?

869
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,370
Why, by making him uncapable 
 of Othello's place.

870
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,400
Knocking him out his brains.

871
01:09:56,410 --> 01:10:00,100
And that you would have 
 me to do?

872
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:16,210
I will be near to second your attempt, 
 and he shall fall between us.

873
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,010
I have no great devotion 
 to the deed.

874
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,270
It makes us, or it mars us.

875
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,770
Think on that.

876
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:46,800
Lago.

877
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:01,770
Lago.

878
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,170
Hark! Who is it that knocks?

879
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,300
It is the wind.

880
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,300
I called my love false love.

881
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,300
But what said he then?

882
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,070
O, these men, these men

883
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,330
dost thou in conscience think, 
 tell me emilia, that there be

884
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,280
women do abuse their husbands 
 in such gross kind?

885
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,570
There be some such, 
 no question.

886
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:16,700
Wouldst thou do such a deed 
 for all the world?

887
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,200
Why, would not you?

888
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,460
No, by this heavenly light!

889
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,560
Nor I neither by this 
 heavenly light.

890
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,570
I might do it as well as 
 in the dark.

891
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,510
Wouldst thou do such a deed 
 for all the world?

892
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,840
The world's a huge place.

893
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,310
It is a great price for a small vice.

894
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,270
In troth, I think thou 
 wouldst not.

895
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,330
In troth, I think I should.

896
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,400
Marry, I would not do such a 
 thing for a joint-ring, nor for

897
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,300
measures of lawn, nor for 
 gowns, petticoats, nor caps,

898
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,880
nor any petty exhibition, but 
 for all the whole world?

899
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,990
I do not think there is 
 any such woman.

900
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:53,110
Yes, a dozen, but I do think 
 it is their husbands' faults

901
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,400
if wives do fall.

902
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,400
Say that they slack their duties 
 and pour our treasures into

903
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,270
foreign laps, or else break out 
 in peevish jealousies, throwing

904
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,400
restraint upon us, 
 or say they strike us.

905
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:09,000
We have galls, and though 
 we have some grace.

906
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,660
Yet have we some revenge.

907
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,130
Let husbands know their wives 
 have sense like them.

908
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,230
They see, and smell.

909
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,870
And have their palates both for 
 sweet and sour, as husbands have.

910
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:21,770
What is it that they do when 
 they change us for others?

911
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,570
Is it sport? I think it is.

912
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,910
And doth affection breed it? 
 I think it doth.

913
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:29,000
Is't frailty that thus errs? 
 It is so too.

914
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,430
And have we not affections? 
 Desires for sport? And frailty?

915
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,310
As men have?

916
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,930
Then let them use us well, 
 else let them know, the ills

917
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:41,230
we do, their ills instructs us so.

918
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,410
Good night. Good night.

919
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:40,110
It is the cause, it is the cause, 
 my soul.

920
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,530
Let me not name it for you, 
 you chaste stars.

921
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:51,740
It is the cause. Yet I'll not 
 shed her blood.

922
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:57,570
Nor scar that whiter skin of 
 hers than snow, and smooth

923
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,140
as monumental alabaster.

924
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:06,900
Yet she must die, else she'll 
 betray more men.

925
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,810
Put out the light, and then 
 put out the light.

926
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:16,700
If I quench thee, thou flaming 
 minister, I can again they

927
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:20,100
former light restore, should 
 I repent me.

928
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:25,900
But once put out thy light, 
 those cunning'st pattern of

929
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:31,170
excelling nature, I know not 
 where is that promethean heat

930
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,100
than can thy light relume.

931
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,530
- Othello. 
 - Ay, desdemona.

932
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,500
Will you come to bed, my lord?

933
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,370
Have you prayed tonight, 
 desdemona?

934
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:51,940
Ay, my lord.

935
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,500
If you bethink yourself of any 
 crime unreconciled as yet to

936
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,270
heaven and grace, 
 solicit for it straight.

937
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,010
Alas, my lord, what may you 
 mean by that?

938
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,910
Well, do it, and be brief.

939
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:07,500
I would not kill thy 
 unprepared spirit.

940
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,510
No, heaven forfend!

941
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,330
I would not kill thy soul.

942
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,100
Talk you of killing?

943
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,030
Ay, I do.

944
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,240
Then heaven have mercy on me.

945
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,940
Amen, with all my heart.

946
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:29,230
If you say so, I hope 
 you will not kill me.

947
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,000
Peace! And be still.

948
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,300
I will so, and yet I fear you.

949
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,000
Why I should fear I know not, 
 since guiltiness I know not.

950
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,300
But yet I feel I fear.

951
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,180
That handkerchief!

952
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,890
That handkerchief which I so 
 loved and gave thee,

953
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:55,800
thou gave it to cassio.

954
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,760
No, by my life and soul!

955
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,600
Send for the man and ask him.

956
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,710
Sweet soul, take heed.

957
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,530
Take heed of perjury, 
 thou art on thy deathbed.

958
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,470
- Lord have mercy on me. 
 - I say amen.

959
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,740
And have your mercy too. 
 I never loved cassion in my life.

960
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,430
I saw the handkerchief. 
 He found it then,

961
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,440
i never gave it to him.

962
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,800
Send for him, let him 
 confess the truth.

963
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:15,970
He hath confessed.

964
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:16,660
What, my lord?

965
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,210
That he hath used thee.

966
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:23,730
How? Unlawfully?

967
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,540
Ay.

968
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,410
He will not say so.

969
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,700
No, his mouth is stopped.

970
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,230
Honest lago hath taken 
 order for it.

971
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,160
What, is he dead?

972
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,540
Had all his hairs been lives, 
 my great revenge had

973
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,010
stomach for them all.

974
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,230
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou 
 for him to my face?

975
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,460
O, banish me, my lord, 
 but kill me not!

976
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:47,930
Down, strumpet!

977
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,200
Kill me tomorrow, let me 
 live tonight!

978
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,560
It is too late.

979
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,660
Now how dost thou look now?

980
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:30,930
Cold, cold, my girl, 
 even like thy chastity!

981
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,260
O cursed, cursed slave!

982
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,960
Whip me, ye devils, from the 
 possession of this heavenly sight!

983
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,640
Blow me about in winds!

984
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,640
Roast me in sulphur!

985
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:45,260
Wash me in steep-down gulfs 
 of liquid fire!

986
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:54,090
O desdemon! Dead desdemon! 
 Dead, o! O!

987
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,230
My lord! My lord!

988
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:59,500
What, ho, my lord! My lord!

989
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,040
I do beseech you that 
 I may speak with you, my lord.

990
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,370
What, ho, my lord!

991
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,000
I had forgot thee.

992
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:10,800
O my good lord, yonder..., 
 alas, what cry is that?

993
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,170
Yonder's murders done.

994
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:16,300
It is the very error of the moon.

995
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:20,410
She comes more nearer earth 
 than she was wont

996
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,360
and that makes men mad.

997
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:28,200
Alas! That was my lady's voice.

998
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:33,050
O! Sweet desdemona! 
 Who hath done this deed?

999
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,940
Nobody, I myself.

1000
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,010
Commend me to my kind lord.

1001
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,060
You heard her say herself.

1002
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,470
It was not i.

1003
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,870
She said so. I must needs 
 report the truth.

1004
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:15,340
She's like a liar gone 
 to burning hell!

1005
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,330
It was I that killed her.

1006
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,780
She turned to folly, and 
 she was a whore!

1007
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,640
Liar!

1008
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,070
Cassio did top her.

1009
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,460
Ask thy husband else!

1010
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,870
That she was false to wedlock?

1011
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,060
Ay, with cassio.

1012
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:31,680
Had she been true, if heaven 
 would make me such another

1013
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:36,470
world of one entire and perfect 
 chrysolite,

1014
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,740
i'd not have sold her for it.

1015
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:42,000
My husband say she was false?

1016
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,760
Ay, it was he that told me 
 on her first.

1017
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,030
An honest man he is, and hates 
 the slime that sticks

1018
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:48,470
on filthy deeds.

1019
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,240
She was too fond of her 
 most filthy bargain.

1020
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:51,940
Peace.

1021
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,900
- Do thy worst. 
 - Peace.

1022
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,960
This deed of thine is no more 
 worthy heaven than

1023
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,200
thou wast worthy her.

1024
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,530
Peace, you were best.

1025
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:03,160
O gull! O dolt! As ignorant 
 as dirt!

1026
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,790
I'll make thee known though 
 I lost twenty lives.

1027
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,730
Help! Help, ho, help!

1028
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,980
Murder! Help, ho!

1029
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,500
Disprove this villain, if thou 
 be'st a man.

1030
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,130
He says thou told'st him that 
 his wife was false.

1031
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,530
I know thou didst not.

1032
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,740
Speak, for my heart is full.

1033
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,970
I told him what I thought, and 
 told no more than what he

1034
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,540
found himself was apt and true.

1035
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,070
But did you ever tell him 
 she was false?

1036
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,630
I did.

1037
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:31,930
You told a lie, upon my 
 soul, a lie! A wicked lie!

1038
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:34,870
Did you say with cassio?

1039
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,590
With cassio, mistress.

1040
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,730
Go to, charm your tongue.

1041
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,030
I will not charm my tongue.

1042
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,770
I am bound to speak.

1043
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:42,930
My mistress here lies 
 murdered in her bed.

1044
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,330
Heaven forfend!

1045
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,270
Nay, stare not, masters.

1046
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:52,280
It is true indeed.

1047
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,470
Villainy, villainy, villainy!

1048
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:00,070
I think upon it, I think I smell it.

1049
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,200
O villainy! I thought so then.

1050
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,000
I'll kill myself for grief.

1051
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,360
What, are you mad?

1052
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,570
Good gentlemen!

1053
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:11,880
I'll charge you get your home.

1054
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,230
Let me have leave to speak.

1055
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:19,630
It is proper I obey him, 
 but not now.

1056
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:25,900
Perchance, lago, I will 
 never go home.

1057
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:27,300
Nay, lay thee down and roar, 
 for thou hast killed the sweetest

1058
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:32,380
innocent that ever 
 did lift up eye.

1059
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,630
O, she was foul!

1060
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,370
Lago knows that she with 
 cassio hath the act of shame

1061
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,110
a thousand times committed.

1062
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:38,610
O heaven!

1063
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,730
Cassio confessed it, and she 
 did gratify his amorous works

1064
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,440
with that handkerchief!

1065
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,460
Handkerchief!

1066
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,170
- 'Twill out, 'twill out! 
 - Hold your peace.

1067
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,210
I peace? No! I will speak as 
 liberal as the north!

1068
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,240
Be wise.

1069
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:56,970
Heaven! A man, devil did 
 them all, all, all!

1070
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,230
I shame against me, 
 yet I'll speak.

1071
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:03,690
Oh, thou dull moor, that 
 handkerchief thou speaks of

1072
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,140
i found by fortune, and did 
 give my husband

1073
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:29,800
she was chaste, she loved thee.

1074
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,300
She loved thee.

1075
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:55,530
Othello, did you and he 
 consent in cassio's death?

1076
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,630
Ay.

1077
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,040
Dear general, I never gave 
 you cause.

1078
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,370
Othello, your power and 
 your command is taken off,

1079
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,840
and cassio rules in cyprus.

1080
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,510
Be not afraid though you do 
 see me weaponed.

1081
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,910
Here is my journey's end.

1082
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:25,000
Here is my butt, the very 
 seamark of my utmost sail.

1083
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:35,690
Will you, I pray, demand that 
 demi-devil why he hath thus

1084
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,570
ensnared my soul and body?

1085
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,570
Demand me nothing.

1086
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,540
What you know, you know.

1087
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:52,490
Are there no stones in heaven 
 but what serves for the thunder?

1088
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:30,170
I pray you, when you shall 
 these unlucky deeds relate,

1089
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,760
speak of me as I am.

1090
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,640
Nothing extenuate, nor set 
 down aught in malice.

1091
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:52,600
Then must you speak of one that 
 loved not wisely, but too well.

1092
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,470
Of one not easily jealous, 
 but being wrought,

1093
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:09,500
perplexed in the extreme, 
 of one whose hand like the

1094
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:17,970
base indian, threw a pearl 
 away richer than all his tribe.

1095
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,160
Set you down this.
