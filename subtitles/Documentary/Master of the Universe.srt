1
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,041
Let's assume I want to be a part of it.

2
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,458
How should I act and
what can I expect?

3
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:07,833
Collect the necessary 'pats on
the back' without a murmur.

4
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,458
You get them by doing
'one-nighters' and 'two-nighters'.

5
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,041
A 'one-nighter' means spending
the night in the office.

6
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:20,458
A 'two-nighter' is two nights in the
office or working straight through.

7
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,083
If you do this often enough ...

8
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:30,083
eventually someone will
entrust you with larger tasks.

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,541
But only if you don't arouse
the slightest doubt.

10
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,791
Or even hint...

11
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,583
that things could be done differently.

12
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,708
No political statements.

13
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,250
And:

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,833
Absolute loyalty to the organisation.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,291
Basically you have to be
willing to give up your life.

16
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,375
How does a 'two-nighter' work?

17
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,458
Well, the boss comes to
you and says: "Listen up.

18
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,791
Something just came in.
The day after tomorrow,

19
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,458
we have to present a
concept to company X, Y, Z:

20
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:22,541
How they can finance the buyback
of 10% of their shares ...

21
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,791
and an estimate of how this
will affect the market, etc.

22
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,000
Sorry.

23
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,208
I know it's your birthday and you
wanted to go out with your girlfriend,

24
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,083
but I can't think of anyone
else I can pass this on to."

25
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,833
This one's in the bag.

26
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,375
Then he sits down and makes
a PowerPoint presentation.

27
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,625
At 2:00 a.m. he falls
asleep at his desk.

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
At 5:00 a.m. the cleaning
lady wakes him up.

29
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,250
Then he gets back to work.

30
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,708
Don't question whether it makes
sense to buy back those shares.

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
Basically it's like being in the army.

32
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,833
I've been talking to our lawyer.

33
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,500
There shouldn't be any problems

34
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,458
as long as we don't mention names
or disclose any business secrets.

35
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,500
We may not infringe on any
personal or privacy rights.

36
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,291
I'd suggest you confer
with your lawyer as well,

37
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
also regarding the work contracts,

38
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
to make sure we're on the safe side.

39
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,375
That building over there

40
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,250
with the round tower on top ...

41
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,375
If you try to picture it ...

42
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You see the white pane on top...

43
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,333
Try to imagine...
that's where the Citibank logo was.

44
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,541
That was the Citibank headquarters.

45
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,625
Then Merrill Lynch moved in.

46
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,416
On 20 floors. Later on, Bloomberg.

47
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,833
Now it's the Bank of
Communication from China.

48
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,791
I think that's about it.

49
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,583
Here we have...

50
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,000
You can see the leap the
Commerzbank has made.

51
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,791
The building with the green roof ...

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,625
was the original building of the
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

53
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,625
Then the first tower came.

54
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:06,000
The dark brown one between the
Japan Tower and the Taunus Tower.

55
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,375
Right behind it soars...

56
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,958
the latest building of
the Commerzbank.

57
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,833
They added an antenna to make
it higher than the Deutsche Bank.

58
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,041
Looks like this was supposed
to be the trading floor.

59
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,166
Those are the server racks.

60
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,666
If this was meant to
be a trading floor,

61
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,125
then it's a really small one.

62
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,166
The ideal trading floor
doesn't have any walls,

63
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,291
and preferably no such posts.

64
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,583
It's rather like a soccer field:
open without any boundaries.

65
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,083
In the past, you relied more
on verbal communication.

66
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,375
You had to call out to each other.
That's why it was important.

67
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:11,583
People stood up and
gestured across the room

68
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,833
to clarify things.

69
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,333
Today you have small chat rooms.

70
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,125
You don't have to shout anymore.

71
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,541
The trading floors of the major banks,

72
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,416
I think the biggest one
is UBS in Greenwich.

73
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
It has about 1000 workstations.

74
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,583
1000 people on one floor.

75
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,625
I don't know how many fit
in here. Maybe 100, 150.

76
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,416
If even that.

77
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,041
It's sort of a sacred place:

78
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,041
You pass through the security gate,

79
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,333
and go to your desk
and push a button,

80
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,000
and it goes 'bzzzz'.

81
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,666
Then ...

82
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,875
your neighbour arrives and
says, "Good morning".

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,125
He pushes his button
and it goes 'bzzzz'.

84
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,000
Eventually everyone's there,

85
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,375
and the whole thing picks up speed.

86
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,416
Around 9 or 10 a.m.
it starts getting loud.

87
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,625
It's like the command centre
of Starship Enterprise.

88
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:28,583
This sounds crazy, but
somehow you feel...

89
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,708
It's the ingredient

90
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,333
that makes you feel like the
Master of the Universe.

91
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,208
You sit there in a really
comfortable chair.

92
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,625
There are 6 or 8
screens all around you,

93
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,000
with funny things flickering on them.

94
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,791
You have 2 keyboards and a
telephone and a mouse or two.

95
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,958
You can just...

96
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,333
It's not for everybody, but I
found it quite fascinating.

97
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,583
That was 1986.
Thatcher and Reagan.

98
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,125
They basically unleashed the
first wave of privatisation.

99
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,625
Here in Germany,

100
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,208
we'd had a cosy capital market zoo.

101
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,791
Up to then.

102
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,791
Everything was regulated.

103
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:23,333
Then foreign banks were
licensed in Germany.

104
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,291
And these people
from America came.

105
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,083
We thought they could walk on water.

106
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,541
They wore strange braces

107
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,166
and broad-striped shirts.

108
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,125
They explained to
us how things work.

109
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,791
It was fascinating.

110
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,833
You were sent to seminars.

111
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,208
They showed you how 'swaps' work,

112
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,500
how 'options' work and
'financial innovations'.

113
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,583
'Financial innovations'
were all the rage.

114
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,250
We hung on their every word.

115
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:01,041
We held them for godlike
creatures who'd been sent to us.

116
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:07,208
Then all those instruments were
approved in Germany, too.

117
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,208
Which, I'd like to
emphasize, was not bad.

118
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,208
It was ...

119
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,333
a very anachronistic system.

120
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,166
A closed system with
designated regional entities.

121
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,250
It was unsuitable for moving the
economy into the 21st century.

122
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:32,583
The real economy and the financial
economy were put on par. Technically.

123
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,750
Then the financial economy was a
step ahead of the real economy.

124
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,416
That's the situation we're in right now.

125
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,750
Is deregulation to blame? No.

126
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,750
Was it a prerequisite? Yes.

127
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,583
Back then...
It was a Bavarian bank.

128
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,875
I spent weeks driving
through the countryside.

129
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,083
As far as the Czech border.
I can't remember where all I went.

130
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:08,000
We gave lectures to
expand our product range.

131
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,750
Our audiences weren't exactly
thrilled by my presence.

132
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,958
You might be able to imagine
why given the regional context.

133
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,166
"We've always done it this way, huh."

134
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,541
They don't want to
deal with new things.

135
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,958
I used to tell people:

136
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:34,291
"You're far from Frankfurt.
You're far from London.

137
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,625
This doesn't mean no one's going to
come see you, but it might take longer."

138
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,375
I wasn't even 30 at the time.

139
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,833
This was a way to make
a name for yourself,

140
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,541
because it was very
specialized knowledge.

141
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:57,250
There were only 10 or 15 people
at the bank who knew this stuff.

142
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,375
If you were one of them,
then age was no issue.

143
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,500
You were considered the expert ...

144
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,458
no matter how old or stupid you were.

145
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,083
No, it was ...

146
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,916
a chance for quick fame

147
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,875
within the bank.

148
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,958
Did you succeed?

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,500
That's for others to judge.

150
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,250
I couldn't say.
- At an early stage you were...

151
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,791
I was promoted very quickly.

152
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,333
And I made more and more
money really fast. Naturally.

153
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,958
Were others faster? Yes.

154
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,541
Were a lot of others slower? Yes.

155
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,625
We were a whole cohort
of people my age.

156
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,000
We sailed right through those banks.

157
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,791
Many of the older co-workers
had a lot of skills,

158
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,875
but they weren't keen on
working with computers.

159
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,958
Whereas we sat there
for nights on end,

160
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,750
trying to program some
Excel spreadsheets.

161
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,958
Calculation models for financial
tools ... things like that.

162
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,500
It was an industry.

163
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,916
Like Bill Gates and
his fucking garage.

164
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,958
Five years earlier or later,

165
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,333
and the man would have
become an accountant.

166
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,333
But he was in this bloody
garage at the right time.

167
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:39,958
We happened to be there when
computers were brought in.

168
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,416
And we were interested
in computers ...

169
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,583
and ...

170
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,125
English books about financial theory.

171
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,125
It was like a gigantic sandbox,

172
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,000
where you played with your moulds.

173
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,916
We couldn't mess up anything.

174
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:06,041
Nowadays a lot can go wrong in
the sandbox, but not back then.

175
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,000
It was awesome. We always
came up with something new.

176
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,125
Some weird products. I
once invented oil bonds.

177
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,208
You earned heating
oil instead of interest.

178
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,875
The oil price was...

179
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,833
I'll just give you any old number: $30.

180
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,666
I wrote a whole paper about it.

181
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,208
How they needed to be constructed,

182
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,125
how to do the hedge, etc.

183
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,875
Then my boss said to me:

184
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,458
"Forget about crap like that!

185
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,833
First there has to be a war in Iraq.

186
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,458
Then the oil price has to skyrocket
before anyone will buy that stuff."

187
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,583
I think that was 4 days before
Hussein invaded Kuwait.

188
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,166
I found that quite amusing.

189
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,291
I'll give you a simple
example of interest bets.

190
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,083
Lots were sold to municipalities
and mid-sized companies.

191
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:21,666
It's a bet on interest rate changes
between the Swiss Franc and the Yen.

192
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,833
And ...

193
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,500
it's a position a German
municipality has nothing to do with.

194
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,583
No one bets on anything obvious,

195
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,791
because you probably wouldn't
find anyone to bet against.

196
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,208
But sometimes...

197
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,416
the models banks use ...

198
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,583
reveal very unusual situations.

199
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,666
It's called a 'Black Swan'.

200
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,041
What is the probability that
a black swan will swim by ...

201
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,916
at this very moment? Extremely low.

202
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,333
The first step is to
identify the situation.

203
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:09,375
Some other things are necessary
before you can sell such a product.

204
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
You could never sell a
construction like this ...

205
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,583
to a company like
Volkswagen or BMW.

206
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,458
Because they have the
same models as the banks.

207
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,958
If they entered these parameters,

208
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,291
they'd be on the same
side as the bank.

209
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,458
That would be like us betting
that the sun will rise tomorrow.

210
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,500
We wouldn't because
we both agree it will.

211
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,208
You can only sell a
product to a client ...

212
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,416
who doesn't have the
same opportunities.

213
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,250
The second point,

214
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,333
and this is a significant constraint:

215
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,166
These products make
sense for certain clients.

216
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,333
There are clients around the world,

217
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,750
who have items in their
balance sheets ...

218
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:03,208
that pose a risk. And I can neutralise
this risk with this construction.

219
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:08,166
It's like buying fire
insurance for your home.

220
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,500
The interesting question is:

221
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,208
Do I take out a fire insurance
policy for my own house ...

222
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,166
or for my neighbour's house?

223
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,166
The point is:

224
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,708
The product only makes sense

225
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,583
if it offers me an offsetting item.

226
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,375
Otherwise it's speculation.

227
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,708
Are the clients aware
of what they're buying?

228
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,083
No. That's the whole scandal.

229
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,041
I don't want that to
be recorded, please.

230
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,208
Seriously, right?!

231
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,416
Back to the previous topic.

232
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,958
I reject this simplified notion ...

233
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,041
that criminal elements are at work ...

234
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,916
figuring out ways to
outwit other people.

235
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,375
We're not talking about
Albanian shell game players.

236
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,166
We're talking about products.

237
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:07,208
They make sense.

238
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:11,375
But if applied incorrectly,
they may cause a disaster.

239
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,041
I'll rave about all this some more,

240
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,000
and try to clarify how
these mechanisms work.

241
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,666
A treasurer has closed a deal.

242
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:32,750
One week later there's a
treasurers congress in Dortmund.

243
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,708
He says:

244
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,791
"You're really stupid.

245
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,791
Do you know how to clear your
municipal balance of deficits?

246
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,666
Swiss Franc against Yen. I did it.

247
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,333
I'm up by 3 million."

248
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,708
That's how it was in the beginning.

249
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,500
Mayor: "Great!"

250
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,583
Then all the other guys on
the table feel like dimwits.

251
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,500
At the same time there's
a bankers convention,

252
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:05,875
where derivatives traders are
swapping ideas for new products.

253
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,041
One says:

254
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,541
"I made a killer deal
with this one town.

255
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:15,333
Huge. Earned 800,000. One trade."

256
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,208
The bankers sit there
feeling like dimwits, too.

257
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,708
Do I have to explain
what's going to happen?

258
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:25,875
The more banks offer this product,
the more treasurers buy it.

259
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:31,750
Lemmings. But that's only human.

260
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:36,291
It's not treachery or deception.

261
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,375
There may have been
cases involving deception.

262
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:46,625
Those clients are often invited by
the bank to speak to other clients.

263
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,291
Everything is closely interwoven.

264
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,875
Again ...

265
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,583
would there be charges today

266
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:00,541
if the municipalities had
pocketed 30 million instead?

267
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,083
I doubt it.

268
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:35,750
My ten years with the
second bank were fantastic.

269
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,875
We had a clear adversary,
a competitor bank,

270
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,750
and it served its purpose.

271
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,833
It was unspoken, but
clear to everybody:

272
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,500
We want ...

273
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,416
to do business others have
been doing up to now.

274
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,208
And we want to do it better.

275
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,375
For example, imagine there
was a long struggle

276
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:07,041
to close a deal with Dow
Chemical in the USA

277
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:11,083
to place a ?500 million
bond on their behalf.

278
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,750
And there's lots of competition.

279
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,375
Nobody knows who's won.

280
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,541
Then you get a call:

281
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:24,500
You have to prepare
everything in secret.

282
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,208
You have to select certain
hedging strategies,

283
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:31,583
and inform your traders that this
bond will soon be on the market.

284
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:35,750
Then you sit there
and press a button.

285
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:40,916
And this deal hits the news
headlines worldwide.

286
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:44,250
Just imagine how angry
your competitors would be.

287
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:48,125
Their bosses demand:
"Why didn't we get the deal?"

288
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:52,000
Then you get the feeling
with the touch of a button,

289
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,958
you've changed world history.

290
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,625
Then you get an offer
from another bank:

291
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:05,000
You'll triple your salary and
be four times more important.

292
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,250
You can bring your whole family
and we'll rent you a house.

293
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,791
It was incredible.

294
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,000
Then you go to your boss and say:

295
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,416
I like it here just fine but I'm leaving.

296
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,791
Then they put you
through the wringer.

297
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:23,291
He starts explaining everything
they have in store for you.

298
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:27,375
Suddenly where you thought
nothing was developing,

299
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,833
whole new worlds open up.

300
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,666
Then the other offer is
no longer so attractive.

301
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:38,166
Once I was in one of the
company director's office.

302
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,333
I knew him really well
and cried my eyes out.

303
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:47,333
I said: Help me. I have no
idea how to get out of this.

304
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,250
I don't know what to do.
I've already accepted.

305
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,375
I'd feel really awkward if I back out.

306
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:58,458
And I'd feel even worse
if I told you I'm leaving.

307
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:03,208
Do you know what he did?
He called the other bank.

308
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,041
He said: "Listen, guys:

309
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,833
That's it. Leave the man alone."

310
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:16,583
Then he told me to drive home,

311
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:21,416
pick up my wife and
go away for the night.

312
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,125
Because the telephone
wouldn't stop ringing all night.

313
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,708
I thought he was nuts.

314
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,791
But it rang every three
minutes all night long.

315
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,541
It was the head hunter worried
about losing his commission.

316
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,166
He gets a big one for
big earners like me.

317
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,583
Kerviel gambled away
almost 5 billion Euros.

318
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,333
He juggled with up to 50 billion.

319
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:28,458
Allegedly because his
bank wanted him to do so.

320
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:32,250
"The seniors treated
me like a prostitute

321
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,708
who's supposed to
make huge profits.

322
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,000
I had to raise more money
for the bank every day."

323
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:43,250
Jérôme Kerviel's story didn't
convince the judges in Paris.

324
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,291
Accordingly, his prison
sentence is long.

325
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,750
His lawyer is baffled.

326
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,291
"The bank has been spared
although it formed Kerviel.

327
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,208
In a virtual system of financial
products beyond all measure,

328
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,625
everything's fine as long as
the traders are making profits.

329
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,500
But if they start making
losses, the bank sues them."

330
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,791
The bank is very
pleased with the verdict.

331
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:11,041
Société Générale is satisfied
that it has been awarded ...

332
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,416
damages for its financial losses.

333
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:18,333
Kerviel has to pay
back 4.9 billion Euros.

334
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:22,375
Based on his current
salary as an IT-consultant,

335
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:27,000
he would have to work about
178,000 years to repay his fine.

336
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,875
To answer the question of
why it's always individuals:

337
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:37,250
It also has to do with the system.

338
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,333
I think most people overrate

339
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:46,708
the trader's role in
the banking system.

340
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,541
He's not a senior manager.

341
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:55,500
He's like a chief mechanic
in a Daimler production line.

342
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:01,041
Of course, junior and senior
traders have different limits.

343
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,750
I can't think of any other profession

344
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:09,583
where one can do such harm.

345
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:14,041
Think of it as an
upside down pyramid.

346
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:20,416
Those who can cause serious
damage are at the bottom.

347
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,166
I hope this comes across okay.

348
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:31,000
There's the general impression
that those people ...

349
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:35,583
are managing directors
or have big titles.

350
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:40,500
No. A trader is well paid ...

351
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,791
but he doesn't have
any responsibility.

352
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,583
except for his limited area of work.

353
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,750
They're not managers.

354
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,208
They're laying hens, to put it bluntly.

355
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,375
It's completely normal for a
trading desk at a bank –

356
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:02,875
whether they're trading shares,
derivatives or fixed-rate securities –

357
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:07,416
a trading desk with 3 or 4
people and an assistant,

358
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,958
has the same sales and profits of a
mid-sized company with 100 employees.

359
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,416
Try to imagine the pressure
these people are under.

360
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,291
I don't share this analogy.

361
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,083
He talks about being
treated like a prostitute.

362
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,875
He had to make more and
more money every year.

363
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:32,625
That was my experience,
too. It's always about...

364
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:38,041
They don't care what a
certain market has to offer.

365
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:43,291
Whether there have been
changes that will temporarily ...

366
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:48,333
or structurally lead to a
loss of profit. Not at all.

367
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,291
"10% more each year. I
don't care how you do it."

368
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,291
"I don't care how you do it."

369
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,875
I've heard such sayings.

370
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,833
I read this number in a book:

371
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:46,750
Twenty years ago the holding period
of shares was 4 years on average.

372
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,916
Today it's 22 seconds.

373
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:59,750
When you think about it, a share
is an interest in a company.

374
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:04,875
What's the point of keeping
an interest for 22 seconds?

375
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,166
Nobody can explain this to me.

376
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:16,250
You always try to get closer to
the stock market computers.

377
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,916
Because they... it's less
than the blink of an eye.

378
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:25,583
We're talking radioactive decay
times between these distances.

379
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,000
Because it's the difference between
closing a successful deal and ...

380
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,958
being the one who gets
the information later.

381
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,916
You probably can't even
measure these times.

382
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:40,500
But being 500 meters closer to the

383
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,125
stock market computer centre than
the other makes a difference.

384
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,250
Think of it like this:

385
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:54,000
Automated computer systems
place buy and sell orders

386
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,125
to gauge a reaction.

387
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,958
Then they quickly
remove these orders.

388
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:03,041
It's not about trading with assets.

389
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:07,708
But about finding out how the
market has positioned itself.

390
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,750
Are there more buyers
or sellers? Or worse:

391
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,291
Is someone trying to steer the
market in a certain direction?

392
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:20,041
Trade volumes are incredibly large.

393
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:24,666
It's easy to make a lot of money
on tiny price movements.

394
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,541
Let's say you start
with only ?100,000.

395
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,916
You need a price change
of 1% to make ?1000.

396
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,375
If you have billions at your disposal,

397
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:43,416
you need only 0.0001 or
0.00001% to make a good profit.

398
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:50,250
There's a disparity of weapons. You
can see it in these computer systems.

399
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:56,250
Siemens or Volkswagen are
both smarter than a bank.

400
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:02,083
Then it comes down to mid-sized
companies, local governments,

401
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,208
and private clients.

402
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:12,666
There's an old saying on the stock
market: Private investors always lose.

403
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:17,333
Sure, sometimes they
win. But it's like roulette.

404
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,833
A roulette player always remembers
the ?8000 he won yesterday.

405
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:26,000
But he forgets the 5 x
?2000 he lost a week ago.

406
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,958
That's human nature.

407
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:34,750
Consistently ...

408
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:40,125
making money on the stock
market without risk is really tough.

409
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,333
The time of modest
share prices is over.

410
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,875
Everyone is going public.

411
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:50,291
Last year marked
another new record:

412
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,291
194 companies made their
debut on the stock market.

413
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:01,500
Mostly businesses from the Internet,
media and computer branches.

414
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,083
Their market rate increased
by more than 500%.

415
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,708
Mobilkom head Gerhard
Schmidt is beaming.

416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,291
His company had a successful
launch on the 'Neuer Markt'.

417
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,166
Investors made a real bargain ...

418
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,666
The 'Neuer Markt' is THE
high-growth segment in Germany.

419
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,208
An interesting segment for
investors willing to take a risk.

420
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,666
Michael, today we want
to discuss a topic:

421
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,000
Women usually wear it on their
ring finger or around their necks.

422
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:30,541
We men have it in our cars.

423
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,041
Platinum.

424
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,208
Very nice.

425
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:37,041
The platinum price
had a turbulent year.

426
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:41,000
It was a real rollercoaster ride.

427
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,916
What do analysts expect
for the next 12 months?

428
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,083
Conservative estimates are ...

429
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,916
$1,700 in 2013 and $1,800 in 2014.

430
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,250
There may be more
positive estimates,

431
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:57,250
but those are the general estimates.
A moderate increase in price.

432
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,916
That's still a bit away
from the current rate.

433
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:05,708
So you'd recommend
a leveraged product.

434
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:09,083
Which products have you selected?

435
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,916
This time we've got a
WAVE Unlimited Call.

436
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,750
At the moment it's around
$1500 per ounce.

437
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,541
So we've still got some room.

438
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,250
The benefit of this product
is its unlimited term.

439
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:33,875
The investor has some time
for the investment to evolve.

440
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,000
Exactly. It's for more
upbeat investors.

441
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,208
We also have WAVE Unlimited Puts
for downbeat investors as well.

442
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:47,125
For more go to xmarkets.de.
Thank you very much, Michael.

443
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,375
Have a nice weekend.

444
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:26,458
I don't have a
cosmopolitan background.

445
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,666
I travelled to Munich
with my suitcase.

446
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,166
By train. I can still remember it.

447
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,958
I didn't know anyone there.

448
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,208
All I knew is I started
work the next day.

449
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:50,333
I spoke a bit of English.
Like for domestic use.

450
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,583
It was my only foreign language.

451
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,708
I went down the hallways. I
heard Spanish from one room,

452
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,916
French from the next and a language
I didn't know from the third.

453
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,833
I kept walking around thinking:

454
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,583
I want to be a part of this.

455
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,083
I started reading books.

456
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:15,458
Books about wine,
cigars, clothing, shoes.

457
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,166
At some point you get the idea,

458
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,125
and you find a business
partner to talk to about it.

459
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,291
My father's a heating engineer.

460
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,333
My very first day on the job
I earned more money ...

461
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:35,750
than he did at the end of his career.
From the very first day.

462
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,791
Then I called from
Tokyo or New York.

463
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:42,750
I called my mother. She couldn't
believe I was really there.

464
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,416
You come into the
office in the morning,

465
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,500
and basically know what lies ahead.

466
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:11,791
You're taken care of. You don't
have to do anything else.

467
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:15,583
You drive directly into the
underground parking lot.

468
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:19,166
You climb a few stairs
to your workplace.

469
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:25,041
You don't really need to worry
about the outside world.

470
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,375
Your children attend
the same kindergarten.

471
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,708
You vacation in the same places.

472
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:35,416
You go skiing in Gstadt or to
the Seychelles or Mauritius.

473
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:41,125
It's a closed system that leads
you further away from reality.

474
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:47,958
I don't need the outside
world anymore.

475
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,333
For the most part.

476
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,875
That's why I don't worry about

477
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,750
what I do at work.

478
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,583
If the deals I finalise or
the actions I take ...

479
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,000
have any kind of effect
on the outside world.

480
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:38,083
This disconnection
from social processes

481
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,250
is basically institutionalized.

482
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:47,875
There's no way you can talk
about your job during dinner.

483
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,791
If somebody had told me:

484
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:56,916
"We're going on holiday with
TUI. It's 200 Euros cheaper."

485
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,875
I couldn't be bothered
with such things.

486
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:03,625
When you make ?100,000
per month, you don't care.

487
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,000
You have no more common
interests with your friends.

488
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:11,333
Unless you force yourself
to talk about other things.

489
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:14,541
But a certain part of
your life gets left out ...

490
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,958
or it doesn't interest anyone else.

491
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:23,958
Then you start wondering if ...

492
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,791
it would be better to give up
some of the things you're fond of

493
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:30,666
for something insecure
but maybe better.

494
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:39,958
A normal person would say:
If this is what my job's doing to me,

495
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,833
I need a new job,
but not a new family.

496
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,166
But with this job I thought:

497
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,625
The job's okay.

498
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:55,291
But I need a new relationship that
fits it, or whatever you want to call it.

499
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,791
My wife and I had this big discussion
after our first child was born.

500
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:07,708
She wanted me to go
on paternity leave.

501
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:11,000
My employer back then,

502
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:14,083
in the early-90's, would
have permitted this.

503
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,750
I always said, "No way."

504
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,375
My wife said,
"You just don't want to."

505
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,541
There was just no way.

506
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,250
It's a little like I said before.

507
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,166
You know in advance
with this profession,

508
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:38,375
if you choose it,

509
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,291
then you know what you're
getting yourself into.

510
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,916
And there's no room
for paternity leave.

511
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,708
Maybe some people do it.

512
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,125
But I couldn't.

513
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,583
I'd have felt like I
wasn't living up to ...

514
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,875
my own standards for
my professional life.

515
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:01,125
Regardless of whether it
was possible to do this.

516
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,208
It's like...

517
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:13,125
It's like a virus that gets you.

518
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:18,833
At the time we're talking about,
I was very heavily infected.

519
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,708
You said: "I made the decision."

520
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,958
Was there ever a 'we'?

521
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,250
In terms of my family? Yes.

522
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,625
Once.

523
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:42,708
But it was less a 'we' and
more my wife saying:

524
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:45,583
"If you do that I'm not
coming with you."

525
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,833
What was that about?

526
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,791
A similar situation:

527
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,500
A foreign job in a place my
wife didn't want to go to.

528
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,500
When I think about ...

529
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:17,500
the golden days I've
just been idealising.

530
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:21,875
Maybe they weren't so ideal.
We tend to glorify the past.

531
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,750
I suffered sometimes, too.

532
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:27,000
But let's leave it at that.

533
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,333
It's also that ...

534
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,500
the more important you become,

535
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,291
the more your family becomes
integrated into this social context.

536
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:42,666
Every major bank hosts a
family celebration, for example.

537
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:47,500
Where children and ...

538
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:51,166
spouses and everything
that can walk

539
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:56,166
get together during
the holiday season.

540
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:03,000
If you walk down the street
behind the Deutsche Bank,

541
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:06,166
there's a day-care centre for
Deutsche Bank children only.

542
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:11,333
They're already being shaped
as soon as they can walk.

543
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,000
That was a bit cruel.

544
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,666
But it's very tight-knit.

545
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:23,541
Then there are the events
with clients as well.

546
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:28,458
I was at an opera festival
in London with my wife.

547
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,833
It wasn't a reward for me or my wife.

548
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:37,250
It was an organised 'get-together'
with clients and their wives.

549
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,625
Speaking of absence...

550
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,166
This was a big issue at peak times.

551
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,083
You have to figure about
280 workdays per annum.

552
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:55,041
I wasn't home for half of
them. Maybe even more.

553
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:01,416
We had the appropriate
domestic staff.

554
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,541
So my wife didn't get stuck
with all the housework.

555
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,375
Still it was...

556
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,875
I wouldn't quite say my
children were strangers to me.

557
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,916
There's always the question of the
time you spend with your children.

558
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:20,750
It's not so much the
quantity that counts ...

559
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:26,208
but the amount of quality
time you have together.

560
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:32,083
Spending 6 hours with a small
child who keeps jabbering:

561
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,875
What's the point?

562
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,958
It depends on how you do it.

563
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,125
This takes us back to the topic:

564
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,000
Were you a good
father or a bad father?

565
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:47,333
I can't be the judge. You'll
have to ask others.

566
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,250
I can only talk about
what I observed and felt.

567
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,166
But I can't speak for others.

568
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,291
That wouldn't be fair.

569
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:01,208
The other things you're alluding to ...

570
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,208
I have no evidence or
anecdotes about them.

571
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,708
Really.

572
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,583
Never mind. That's enough.

573
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:20,833
That's all I have to
say about it. Finito.

574
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,500
The severe financial and currency
crisis in Southeast Asia ...

575
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,125
takes centre stage at the
summit of Asian states.

576
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,041
The Hong Kong stock exchange
suffered its heaviest fall in history.

577
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,500
Asian stock exchanges
toppled like dominoes.

578
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:23,125
Take Bangkok: Here
hotels and office buildings

579
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:26,583
have been popping up
over the last 10 years.

580
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,666
But the building boom was
financed with borrowed money.

581
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:32,250
Most of it from the US and Japan.

582
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,416
Now the lenders want
their money back.

583
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:39,166
They've lost their faith in the
booming Southeast Asian region.

584
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:43,333
Within only a few days the price
for rice has risen by 50%.

585
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,166
Cooking oil increased
by more than 100%.

586
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:51,125
The money collapse has led to bankruptcies
and increased unemployment.

587
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:54,875
In a country where 40% of the
population is already unemployed.

588
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:59,958
The IWF reacted with a massive
intervention into Indonesian affairs.

589
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:02,958
Director Michel Camdessus
said the task is now...

590
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,750
... to restore confidence in the
currency and the economy.

591
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,875
The government demonstrates it
recognises the country's problems.

592
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:14,416
And it's prepared to take
the necessary measures.

593
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:17,333
Even though they may
be difficult and painful.

594
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:27,083
We didn't think about
these things back then.

595
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,166
Countries can –

596
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:34,583
like in Germany –

597
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:38,708
raise money by issuing
bonds, treasury notes, etc.

598
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:44,250
Or they can borrow money abroad.

599
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,625
Under certain circumstances on
the 'Euromarket' back then...

600
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,458
it was cheaper to
borrow money abroad

601
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,083
than to raise it domestically.

602
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,750
So they turned to this option.

603
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,875
Countries were considered
... like Portugal or Sweden.

604
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:07,291
Nobody would have ever
doubted their financial standing.

605
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,083
This was long before the
introduction of the Euro.

606
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:16,625
Countries could provide unlimited
amounts of their currencies.

607
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:20,375
Because they could print as
much as they wanted to.

608
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:25,375
We also had constitutional crises and
national bankruptcies in the 90's.

609
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:29,583
South Korea and Argentina.

610
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,250
But ...

611
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,416
there was no global meltdown.

612
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:42,708
No maelstroms leading the rest
of the world into the abyss.

613
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:50,375
Because globalisation and
interlacing weren't as tight as today.

614
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:57,125
In the 90s, everything didn't
seem interdependent.

615
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,958
It was more manageable.

616
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:04,291
You had 4 gears. If you did this
here, then this happened there.

617
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,625
It was easy to understand
what would happen.

618
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,625
Today there are 7500 gears.

619
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:14,750
You don't know what will
happen if you turn one.

620
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,708
It was a completely different
situation back then.

621
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:24,125
When I remember how many lawyers
I had to deal with in the 90's...

622
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,833
... and how many lawyers I
needed for my last transactions,

623
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,458
it's like the factor 10.

624
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:35,083
The point is that the significance
of potential losses ...

625
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,458
and pending costs from
lawsuits is constantly rising.

626
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,625
I believe:

627
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,625
If you keep increasing
the expected returns ...

628
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:50,791
then the whole business
automatically starts shifting ...

629
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:55,833
not into illegality but in that direction.

630
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,541
You see how far you can go.

631
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:03,458
Then you add a little clause
here to make that happen, etc.

632
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,666
And:

633
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:08,166
If you do a lot of business,

634
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,833
and the business models
shift in an illegal direction,

635
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,666
then some businesses
will fall off the cliff.

636
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:22,583
People tend to have a fairly
naive understanding of all this.

637
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:26,000
I'll construct a case that
happened here in Germany.

638
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:30,333
A bank plunges into a liquidity crisis
and is taken over by another bank.

639
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,875
Most people have this notion that ...

640
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,583
these people walk into the bank
and liquidate that old business.

641
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,500
It's not that simple.

642
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,000
It's like you're opening a cupboard.

643
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,958
There are 5000 files inside.

644
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,875
Each file contains 1000 pages.

645
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,833
I need to find a particular transaction.

646
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,458
Maybe it's in the 3rd
file on the top left.

647
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,125
I definitely want to unwind it.

648
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:00,166
And now's a good time to do it.

649
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:04,250
But I don't know if the 2nd
file at the bottom left says,

650
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:08,500
I may not process this transaction
between January and March or such.

651
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:15,125
All these contracts may
refer to one another.

652
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:21,958
Picture a permutation: possibilities
that exist mathematically.

653
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,791
They increase exponentially.

654
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,333
I have two options:

655
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:33,666
I can hire a lawyer or law firm
to read all these contracts.

656
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:39,708
3-4 years later, after they've
waded through 5 million pages,

657
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:43,166
and I've paid a few million in fees,
I get a legal opinion saying:

658
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:46,583
"It's probably like this, but
we assume no liability."

659
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:51,208
Or I can read it myself even
though I may lack the expertise.

660
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,375
Or I can make a
decision in uncertainty.

661
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,500
That's what's happening.

662
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,125
This isn't ...

663
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,791
You often read about stupid banks,

664
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,291
the damn business or
how stupid can you be?

665
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,791
That's what you see in
the press in other words.

666
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,750
But it's...

667
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:16,458
It's impossible to provide
certainty with deals like this.

668
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,458
Impossible.

669
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:23,750
I have to make a
decision in uncertainty.

670
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,125
Then look at the consequences,

671
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:31,291
and try to straighten out things
if something goes wrong.

672
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,000
I venture to claim that no one ...

673
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:40,250
understands the accounting
of the Deutsche Bank.

674
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:45,708
There's an auditing company that's
familiar with the accounting system.

675
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:49,791
But no single person can understand
how those numbers are generated.

676
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:51,291
It's too complex.

677
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,125
That's why ...

678
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:59,458
It's like I'm demanding
transparency about something...

679
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,083
I can't demand transparency about.

680
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:07,250
It's like the question about the
existence of the God particle.

681
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,041
I don't know if it exists.

682
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,125
Nor do I know how ...

683
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,083
every last branch of
this industry works.

684
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,041
Nobody does.

685
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:53,583
Banks have a Plan B for everything.

686
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:58,833
If an atomic bomb struck Frankfurt,
everyone would know what to do:

687
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:02,625
Where to go, when it's
okay to go home, etc.

688
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,666
But there's no Plan B
for this financial crisis.

689
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:45,333
In the business report from
UBS you find an item ...

690
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,875
on the subject of accrual
contingent liabilities.

691
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:52,250
It says here:

692
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:55,083
UBS makes provisions
for proceedings ...

693
00:59:55,333 --> 01:00:00,041
when upon legal consultation the
executive board concludes ...

694
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:03,333
that such payment is
probably obligatory ...

695
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,375
and the exact amount
can be reliably estimated.

696
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:13,041
For every probable case
here there are explanations.

697
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,250
There's a procedure
for municipal bonds.

698
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,958
There's the Lehman
Principal Protection Notes.

699
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:21,291
Securities issued by Lehman.

700
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,208
UBS sold them wrongfully,

701
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,666
and is apparently
facing a lawsuit now.

702
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:33,416
Next we have lawsuits related to the
sell-off of residential mortgages.

703
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:39,041
These are the 'junk mortgages'
in the US that were sold.

704
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,833
Then come the
disclosure requirements.

705
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,333
There's Bernard Maddoff.

706
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:50,333
A convicted investment
swindler UBS worked with.

707
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:55,583
'Transactions with the City of Milan
and public sector entities in Italy.'

708
01:00:55,833 --> 01:01:00,875
These are municipal swaps,
interest bets by municipalities.

709
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:06,458
Then the HSH bank in
Hamburg and Hannover.

710
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:12,083
They're suing UBS for selling them
something they never should have bought.

711
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:15,458
The Kommunale
Wasserwerke Leipzig GmbH.

712
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,375
Puerto Rico.

713
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:22,583
There's a whole chapter about Libor,
which was recently concluded ...

714
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:27,541
through a considerable
payment from UBS.

715
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,375
How much was it?

716
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,750
$1.5 billion. Something like that.

717
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:42,041
It's interesting how such things are
never restricted to one organisation.

718
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:47,708
I'd be surprised if there were
a scandal concerning ...

719
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:52,750
a product that doesn't affect
another company as well.

720
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,416
That would be really strange.

721
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:59,041
The industry is way
too interconnected.

722
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,875
I remember one particular product.

723
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,375
I won't go into detail because it's
irrelevant and too complicated.

724
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:13,166
But my employer at the time made
a big fuss about this new product.

725
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:21,458
We agreed with some experts that
this product didn't make any sense.

726
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,291
It was extremely risky,

727
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,958
yielded a very small profit
and was very costly to produce:

728
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,583
All the things you don't need.

729
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,791
Eventually we were the last
to jump on the bandwagon.

730
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,208
Only because one of the big
bosses had read in the newspaper

731
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,041
that everyone else was doing
it. So, why weren't we?

732
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:48,416
We gave in to a mood
of collective panic.

733
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:54,541
And rushed out a product instead
of just leaving it to the others.

734
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,125
We believe ...

735
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,916
and we understand this
better than everyone else:

736
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:02,041
This can't work.

737
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:06,250
Now we're seeing the
results of this development.

738
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:11,125
This product was created in 2004.

739
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:15,333
Now, 4-6 years later, it's exploding.

740
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,166
These are the two really bad banks.

741
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:46,291
The Gesellschaft für Wertmanagement
and the Erste Abwicklungsanstalt.

742
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,083
Hypo Real Estate and WestLB.

743
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,250
Here the Restructuring
Unit of the Commerzbank.

744
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:57,208
That's on balance. Euro Hypo
still exists as a normal bank.

745
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:01,916
It's not necessarily a 'bad' bank.

746
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:07,916
The HSH Nordbank is
a regional state bank.

747
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:13,041
Apparently it has a
balance of ?58 billion ...

748
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:18,916
marked as non-performing
loans or transaction loans.

749
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,708
The interesting question is
where the loss is incurred.

750
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:29,666
You can add together the
Commerzbank and the Euro Hypo.

751
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,708
Government involvement: 25%.

752
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,083
Hypo Real Estate: 100% .

753
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,125
Erste Abwicklungsanstalt:
100%. HSH: 100%.

754
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,166
The only ones who
might have to pay ...

755
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:50,375
are the 75% of the remaining
Commerzbank shareholders.

756
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,958
And the government.

757
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:57,041
Along with the taxpayers.

758
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:07,000
How would I explain this to my kids?

759
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,541
It's like picking a rotten
apple from the fruit basket.

760
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:16,166
The rotten apple is still there.

761
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:19,458
You can see if part of
it can be salvaged,

762
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,083
or if it's completely rotten.

763
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:25,666
I understand why it
has to be like this.

764
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,416
But these decision-making
processes happen so fast.

765
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:35,166
Debates about ?100-200 million
for culture go on for years.

766
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:41,000
But 100 or 200 billion for a bank rescue
is coughed up over a weekend.

767
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,208
It's possible. It's quite fascinating.

768
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:16,250
The pressure is mounting
on Angela Merkel.

769
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,958
Greece needs even more money.

770
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,458
If this summit fails to produce a
solid plan to combat the debt crisis,

771
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,250
the entire euro zone rating
will be downgraded.

772
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:28,208
Threatens rating giant
Standard & Poors.

773
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:32,083
Never before has the
finance industry so blatantly

774
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,416
held a gun to politicians' heads.

775
01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:08,625
The important thing in Greece ...

776
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:14,500
was to prevent Greece from
going bankrupt at all costs.

777
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,250
That's what it was about.

778
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:20,458
There are two kinds of Greek bonds:

779
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,791
International or English law
bonds and Greek law bonds.

780
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:32,291
The difference is under Greek
law the state can declare:

781
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:38,125
You won't get ?10,000 for
?10,000, but only ?4,000.

782
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,500
That's what happened.

783
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:44,458
Under English law you need to
have a meeting of creditors.

784
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:48,458
They decide whether this
settlement is acceptable or not.

785
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:54,750
So if I, as a hedge fund, buy 75
Million of 100 Million bonds ...

786
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,833
then I'll have a qualified
majority for the vote.

787
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,166
Then I can tell the Greeks:

788
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,458
"Either you give us the money ...

789
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:09,541
or we'll blow the whole thing up.
Then technically you'll be bankrupt."

790
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,833
That's how they operate.

791
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:18,541
They try to cause you as
much trouble as they can.

792
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,083
They use every possible means
to enforce their legal right.

793
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:26,791
Until eventually you say:
"All this hassle over 20 million?"

794
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,625
Then you pay and they win.

795
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,666
Greek bonds were a business model.

796
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:43,333
There were targeted buyouts
under International Law.

797
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:47,916
There's a list of all the
Greek bonds out:

798
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,125
500, 700, 1000 or whatever.

799
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:53,958
You can search a database
and find out which are ...

800
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:57,666
under English law and which under
Greek. You ditch the Greek ones.

801
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:02,416
Then you have 50, 70 or
100 under English law.

802
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,375
Then you ask: How much money
do I have and what's the rate?

803
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:11,500
Let's say they're quoted at 30%

804
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:13,916
instead of 100%.

805
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,250
And you want to buy 75 million
of a total of 100 million.

806
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,541
You need 75% of the voting rights.

807
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:24,500
You possess 75% of 30 million.

808
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:28,041
You buy 28 million for the voting
rights for a 100 million bond.

809
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,458
That's your profit.

810
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:33,708
You pay 28 million and force
the state to pay out 100 million.

811
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,166
It's worth it.

812
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:42,375
That's how you do it. It was
a common business model.

813
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,333
Several companies
were doing it that way.

814
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:56,208
So much money is
now in circulation ...

815
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,166
that you can tackle
whole countries with it.

816
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,958
You start with the smallest – Greece.

817
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:08,083
You wait to see how the EU reacts.

818
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,708
You create a certain...
How should I put it...

819
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,458
You crack the ice a bit.

820
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,958
Then you take on the
next biggest: Portugal.

821
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,875
And the ice cracks some more.

822
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,458
Some people have an interest
in the collapse of the Euro.

823
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:28,875
There's an enormous
profit potential there.

824
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,500
Surely some people have a political
interest in the Euro collapse.

825
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,375
That's how you'd do it.

826
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:45,833
I can't think of a good
example right now.

827
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:50,791
You look for the
weakest point, crack it,

828
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:53,916
and then break it from inside out.

829
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,583
I was just in Spain.

830
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,583
Things are really dismal there.

831
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,333
Really dismal.

832
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:13,041
People are really desperate.
Supermarket selections are declining.

833
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:15,958
Some things just don't work anymore.

834
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:19,541
When you order a certain amount
of construction material –

835
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:22,375
tiles, bricks or whatever –

836
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:23,916
they no longer get delivered.

837
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:29,000
Because no lorry will go from
A to B for a little box of tiles.

838
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:31,083
And nothing else gets ordered.

839
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:35,625
This might sound strange ...

840
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:40,958
but the whole social
infrastructure is slowly crumbling.

841
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:47,833
There's no more buying power
so no one's trading anymore.

842
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,500
When there's no more trade,
transportation declines.

843
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:56,541
It's like dominoes falling.

844
01:11:56,708 --> 01:12:00,708
If you go there regularly like I do...

845
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:04,291
then you notice each time ...

846
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:08,000
how the country is crumbling.

847
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:15,083
People are trying to build up some
kind of subsistence existence.

848
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:19,583
Instead of flowers they're now
growing potatoes in their gardens.

849
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,208
It's really noticeable.

850
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,333
With countries, you have to find...

851
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:35,666
the origin of the debt problem.

852
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:40,625
The real estate crisis plunged
Spain into the abyss...

853
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,166
and was multiplied and
reinforced by the banks.

854
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,458
It's a debt crisis in the private sector.

855
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:50,333
Not in the national budget.

856
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:53,500
It's a similar situation
in the Netherlands.

857
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,916
But no one likes to talk about it.

858
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,541
Just imagine:

859
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,791
I think 120% of Holland's
Gross National Product...

860
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:05,208
is real estate debt.

861
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:09,166
Only Property. Private debt.

862
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,375
No one cares about
the national debt.

863
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,125
Because private debt
goes far beyond...

864
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:21,083
what's considered
reasonable for national debt.

865
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:27,791
If suddenly 30% of the Dutch can
no longer pay their mortgages...

866
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:32,750
I think it's highly unlikely
the bailiff would evict them.

867
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:36,083
They'll have to find a solution.

868
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:40,500
Like they're starting to
cancel evictions in Spain.

869
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,500
And trying to keep things
from getting out of hand.

870
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:47,083
Or you'll force people onto welfare.

871
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,958
And who wants that?

872
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:55,000
What can we expect next?

873
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,458
France.

874
01:13:58,625 --> 01:13:59,833
France.

875
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:07,291
They have a severe
economic problem.

876
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:14,541
The essential structural
reforms are not being tackled.

877
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,458
I'm not an enemy of taxes.

878
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:21,708
But they're adopting
a fierce fiscal policy.

879
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,541
I think France is going
to become a problem.

880
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,541
Then what?
- Then it'll be over and done with.

881
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,833
Game over.

882
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:39,833
That's why they're desperately
trying to prop up Spain or Italy.

883
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:44,875
It's a chain reaction: Greece,
Portugal, Spain, Italy.

884
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:47,291
It's always the next in
size. Then France...

885
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:53,500
If France gets into such a situation,

886
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,666
no one will be able
to bear the burden.

887
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:58,541
Forget it.

888
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,250
They'll have to come up
with something else.

889
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:08,458
It's going to blow up
in our face one day.

890
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:12,750
Either financially or socio-politically.

891
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:16,583
There's no way this is going
to have a happy end.

892
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,583
Eventually I was laid off.

893
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:04,916
I've reached an age where
the people around me ...

894
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,083
are being phased out.

895
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:10,333
Nobody's working till retirement age.

896
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:17,750
Usually companies offer
a generous settlement.

897
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,875
No bonuses, but you get your
salary for another 5 years.

898
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,458
You're lowering the average age.

899
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:35,291
53, 54, 55. That's it.

900
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,791
It happens continuously.

901
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,375
People get a better job and leave.

902
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:56,291
Or get sacked for messing up.

903
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,333
It's another matter
when it come in waves.

904
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:03,583
When they tell you, usually
at the end of the year:

905
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:09,291
"We're cutting 4000 jobs.
800 here and there."

906
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:14,000
So you can figure out
which area is concerned.

907
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:17,833
It's a bit like a front
campaign in World War I:

908
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,083
Let's see who's still in the trenches.

909
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,375
Some people quickly slip off.

910
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:26,958
Suddenly they're sitting where
you can't see them anymore.

911
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,625
Over in the corner somewhere.

912
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,208
It's pretty silly.

913
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:34,583
But you can't help thinking:

914
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,416
"When's it my turn?"

915
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:41,583
There's more ... fear.

916
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,500
It used to be different.

917
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:48,458
People were sacked and
new ones were hired.

918
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,708
But this kind of...

919
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,458
war-like experience...

920
01:17:56,833 --> 01:18:00,833
didn't exist back then.

921
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:05,541
Nowadays it's a management tool...

922
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,166
to put pressure on people.

923
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:15,625
I had a Colombian
boss once who said:

924
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:19,125
I kick out 10% of my
employees each year.

925
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,958
Then you know you've
got 10 years tops.

926
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,666
Do you mind talking about this?

927
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,875
No. I just don't know why...

928
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:36,666
you're always trying to
get more out of me.

929
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:39,875
I'm telling you as much as I can.

930
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,625
There are no more
details to talk about.

931
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:47,500
I told you, it hurts. Obviously.

932
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,833
And this process is what it is.

933
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:56,458
So a family is created that drags
you in and captivates you.

934
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:01,541
But the way you're discharged
from this family doesn't ...

935
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:07,708
match the family spirit that was initally
presented as a mirror or option.

936
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:12,416
Yes, that's right.
- So this family never really existed.

937
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,750
No.

938
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:18,041
You believed in a family that ended
up chucking you out the backdoor.

939
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,875
Yes, but...

940
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:27,375
It's like being a mercenary versus
dying for one's fatherland.

941
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,583
There's something for everybody.

942
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:35,291
I need to feel loved by
an institution, if possible.

943
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:39,375
And ... feel valued.

944
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:45,958
Then it's even worse when the
rug is pulled out from under you.

945
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,875
The mercenary feels no pain.

946
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,666
He doesn't give a damn.

947
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:12,083
It's a fairly normal cycle.

948
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,416
First there's euphoria.

949
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:17,708
Then the wave washes you
away and you swim and swim.

950
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,708
And sooner or later
you have a hangover.

951
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:32,291
Then I moved heaven and
earth to get a new job ...

952
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:35,416
that was similar to or
better than the old one.

953
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:41,750
In retrospect I have to say:

954
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:45,916
That was one crucial step too many.

955
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:51,333
I felt like I'd lost all my dignity.

956
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:54,625
It didn't have to be like that.

957
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,666
It takes a really long time...

958
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:21,250
to take a critical view
of the whole matter.

959
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:28,458
With most people, even
those who've lost their job,

960
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:31,583
their top priority is:

961
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,458
How do I get the same job
again as fast as possible?

962
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,375
They don't ask themselves:

963
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:44,083
Is there some life plan I've
always dreamt about?

964
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:48,250
And now I can try it out?

965
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,875
Instead...

966
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:56,583
they continue along
the same old path.

967
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:01,583
This is a problem in an industry
that's dramatically shrinking

968
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:04,166
like the banking industry.

969
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,708
I think a lot of mentally
affected people ...

970
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:13,708
will fall by the wayside.

971
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:16,166
Because they're...

972
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:21,416
incapable of leading their own lives

973
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:24,791
outside this system.

974
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,291
Yes.

975
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:35,000
Why does no one
trust banks anymore?

976
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:39,375
Some banks say it's
because of the crises.

977
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:42,833
Others say it's the stock markets.

978
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,208
We did something a
bit unusual for us.

979
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:52,416
We looked for the reasons
in ourselves and asked:

980
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,041
Does Germany need another bank
that does the same old thing?

981
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:04,125
Or do we need a bank that puts an
end to speculation on basic foods?

982
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,041
That finances renewable
energy for the future.

983
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,250
That lends money to small
and mid-sized companies.

984
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:18,291
That doesn't reward consultants for
selling as many contracts as possible.

985
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,333
But only when their
clients are satisfied.

986
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,541
There's a long road ahead of us.

987
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,250
But it also begins with the first step.

988
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:34,916
I don't think anything's
happening within this system.

989
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,416
Everyone's staring at politicians
and regulators and saying:

990
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:42,916
"Tell us what to do!" Actually they know
exactly what's expected of them.

991
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,666
But they're not doing it.

992
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:50,083
Instead they run ads that
state: "We understand".

993
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:55,333
Or print some gigantic
corporate identity brochures ...

994
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:59,833
and corporate
responsibility brochures.

995
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:04,750
You can observe this, too. I've
been involved in philanthropy.

996
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:09,125
Corporate social responsibility
is an important part of it:

997
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:13,666
i.e., the donations and social
activities undertaken by companies.

998
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:18,208
This may knock some people's
socks off who know better, but:

999
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,833
The bigger the shit, the thicker the
corporate social responsibility brochures.

1000
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:25,458
Yes.

1001
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,791
It's good that measures
are being taken.

1002
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:32,916
I think what's being done...

1003
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:36,166
within the political decision-making
framework is sensible.

1004
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,875
But I'm convinced they
won't achieve their goal.

1005
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,875
They won't achieve their goal.

1006
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:49,791
Laws are passed in 6 months.

1007
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:54,791
?150 billion to save a bank
is passed in 6 months.

1008
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:58,833
But what people think...

1009
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:02,208
reflects the social situation.

1010
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:05,791
It will take decades to change.

1011
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,916
No politician can pull that off.

1012
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:15,416
Just look at the semantics
used today: 'The markets'.

1013
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:18,125
There's no such thing
as 'the markets'.

1014
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:23,166
We act like they're some godlike
power descending upon us.

1015
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,708
'The Bank' or 'The Company'
decided.

1016
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,750
No. People make decisions.

1017
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,791
And if you tell them
to stop, they'll stop.

1018
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,250
You just have to do it the right way.

1019
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:43,875
If the boss of a large investment bank
sent out an email tomorrow saying:

1020
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:50,041
"Every trader who still has shorts
in Spain, Portugal or elsewhere,

1021
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:53,333
who is speculating against these
countries, will be sacked."

1022
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,375
It would end immediately.

1023
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:59,083
Other parties would
have to join in as well.

1024
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:03,708
But if the will were there, it
would be like pulling the plug.

1025
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,875
So why doesn't this happen?

1026
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:09,375
Because no one ever
takes the first step.

1027
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,916
Do we need a fresh
start? Yes, for sure.

1028
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:16,583
But then...

1029
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:20,208
Either an external shock:

1030
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:25,166
i.e., political interventions
or another crisis.

1031
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:31,958
Or a radical freak

1032
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:36,666
who can convince us of
a new business model...

1033
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:39,625
that works.

1034
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:44,875
Wasn't the recent shock big enough?

1035
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,166
No.

1036
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:49,750
No.

1037
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:56,833
Only simpletons believe the
market is capable of learning.

1038
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:00,708
We had that topic: Can banks learn?

1039
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:05,458
It's collective versus individual
learning, but the answer is no.

1040
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,125
No. Markets don't learn yet.

1041
01:27:08,416 --> 01:27:10,416
Investors don't learn either.

1042
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:16,500
They jump into the same abyss...

1043
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,500
that they jumped into or were
shoved into 2 years ago.

1044
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,208
Now they're gladly jumping into it.

1045
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:28,083
There are lots of examples
dating back to the 30's.

1046
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,208
That's...

1047
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:31,750
No.

1048
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,750
I don't believe in it.

1049
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,750
Was the shock big enough?

1050
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:38,833
Sure, it was a big shock.

1051
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:41,375
Let's get on with it.

1052
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:45,250
Rainer Voss quit his
job at his last bank,

1053
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:49,541
and is now a man of
independent means.

1054
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:56,750
The building was abandoned
after the merger of two banks.

1055
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,833
It has been empty for 6 years.
