I bring a girlfriend home from school.

4

What a lame-o.

5
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:51,540

<i>Of course,
I don't know that yet.</i>

shears matches her gardening clogs?</i>

<i>- And that's his lover, Jim.

25

Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.

Good morning, Carolyn.

28
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:54,367
I love your tie!
That color!

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,934
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?

30
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:02,742
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

31
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,343
<i>- I've never heard that.
- Man, I get exhausted just watching her.</i>

32
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,480
<i>She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.</i>

33
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,326
<i>We used to be happy.</i>

34

<i>I wish I could tell her that's all going
to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.</i>

<i> </i>

39
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,050
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

40
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:48,287
- Yes.
- Congratulations.
You've succeeded admirably.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,854
Lester, could you make me
a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.

42
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,956

00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,536
Nice going, Dad.

<i>Hello. This is Lester Burnham

I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.

54
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:35,732
Well, we're all under
a deadline here. You see,
there's some basic information...

55
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:40,245
about your product launch
that isn't even covered
in your press release, and I'd--

56
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:43,179
Yeah, c--
can I ask you a question?

57
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:47,708
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

58
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,619
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.

59
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>

60
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,721
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!

61
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,295
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?

62
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,067
For you, Brad,
I got five!

63
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,634
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

64
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,838
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

65
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:18,314
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

66
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,251
<i>- Right?
- Exactly.</i>

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,256
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,</i>

68
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:29,488
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months?

69
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:33,622
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000.
That's somebody's salary.

70
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,793
That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him!

71
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,860
<i>Jesus!</i>

72
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:42,634
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

73
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,176
<i>-  
- That's why we're having everyone...</i>

74
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,738
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

75
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:53,581
That way management
can assess who's valuable--

76
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,382
And who's expendable.

77
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:59,151
<i>It's just business.</i>

78
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:02,489
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.

79
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:06,793
- You've been here how long?
A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

80
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,732
I'm trying to level with you.

81
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,294
This is your one chance
to save your job.

82
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,603
<i>  There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.</i>

83
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,702
-   You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

84
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,747
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

85
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,545
Let's just all sell our souls
and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.

86
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:28,643
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?

87
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,950
So, we finally
got new neighbors.

88
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:35,619
<i>You know, if the Lomans
had let me represent them
instead of the Real Estate King,</i>

89
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,219
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.

90
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,061
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

91
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,727
<i>Their sycamore?
Come on.</i>

92
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,498
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

93
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,564
<i>You know that.
How can you call it their sycamore?</i>

94
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:54,738
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn't partially
mine, which, of course, it was.

95
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,906

to this elevator music?</i>

99
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,761
No. No, we don't.

100
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:16,767
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

101
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,770
you can listen
to whatever you like.

102
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,743
So, Janie, how was school?

103
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:29,178
It was okay.

104
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,682
Just okay?

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,846
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.

106
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,759
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

107
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,227
They've hired
this efficiency expert,

108
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,026
this really friendly guy
named Brad--

109
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,536
How perfect is that?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...

110
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:55,061
in firing somebody,
because they couldn't just come
out and say that, could they?

111
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,473
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us--

112
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,036
  You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

113
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,241
What do you expect ?

114
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:08,582
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

115
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:14,419
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

116
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:23,525
Oh, what ?
You're " Mother of the Year" ?

117
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,060
-  
You treat her like an employee.
- What ?

118
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:31,772
 
What ?

119
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:34,505
I'm going
to get some ice cream.

120
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,156
Janie...

121
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:51,328
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.

122
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,626
I'm just-- I--

123
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:59,870
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

124
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,998
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault ?

125
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,476
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It--

126
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,944
Janie, what happened ?
We used to be pals.

127
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,720

Welcome.

This living room
is very dramatic.

139
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,199
<i>Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!</i>

140
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:48,763
A simple cream could
really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.

141
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,637
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen ?

142
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,113
It's a dream come true
for any cook.

143
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:00,549
Just filled
with positive energy, huh ?

144
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:06,114
And you'll be surprised
how much a ceiling fan can
cut down on your energy costs.

145
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,724
<i>You know,you could have some fun
backyard get-togethers out here.</i>

146
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,200
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

147
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,729
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

148
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,742
What do you call this ?
Is this not a plant ?

449
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,877
Coming, Dad.

450
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:28,474
<i>You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.</i>

451
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:37,651
- I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

452
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:41,356
 
So what's up ?

453
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:46,230
I-- I need a urine sample.

454
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,236
Wow.

455
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:51,000
It's been six months already.

456
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:54,167
Can I give it to you in the morning ?
I just took a whiz.

457
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,370
Yeah. I suppose.

458
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:03,080
Y-You know--

459
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:14,427
Well, good night, son.

460
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,928
<i> </i>

461
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:22,736
I've been waiting for you.

462
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:46,093
You've been working out,
haven't you ?

463
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:48,330
I can tell.

464
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,933
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.

465
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,534
I'm very, very dirty.

466
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:30,742
What are you doing ?

467
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:34,106
Nothing.

468
00:44:34,184 --> 00:44:36,778
- You were masturbating.
-   I was not.

469
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:39,686
Yes, you were.

470
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:43,522
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.

471
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:47,188
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

472
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:50,198
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.

473
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,200
That's disgusting.

474
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:55,396
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.

475
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:57,735
- So do I.
- Really ?

476
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:02,141
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

477
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:05,807
 
Lester, I refuse to live like this!

478
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:07,873
This is not a marriage.

479
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:11,045
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,

480
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,089
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

481
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:16,216
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

482
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,886
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

483
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:21,760
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

484
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:24,527
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.

485
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:27,729
I'm not ? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.

486
00:45:27,804 --> 00:45:29,965
Don't you mess
with me, mister.

487
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,202
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

488
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,437
On what grounds ?

489
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:38,105
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

490
00:45:38,181 --> 00:45:40,615
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

491
00:45:40,683 --> 00:45:43,277
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

492
00:45:43,353 --> 00:45:45,651
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

493
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:51,093
<i>But... I did support you
when you got your license.</i>

494
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,256
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

495
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:58,164
Oh!

496
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:02,000
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay ?

497
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:16,384
<i>  It's a great thing
when you realize you still have...</i>

498
00:46:16,452 --> 00:46:19,046
<i>the ability
to surprise yourself.</i>

499
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:23,115
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.</i>

500
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:25,160
Hey, guys.

501
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:27,662
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

502
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,062
- I just started.
- Good for you.

503
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:34,229
I figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.

504
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:37,137
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

505
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,141
increased strength
and flexibility as well ?

506
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:43,667
I-- I want
to look good naked.

507
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,821
 

508
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:03,260
<i>Oh, what is this ?
Fuckin' gay pride parade ?</i>

509
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,426
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

510
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:08,766
 

511
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,605
My entire life is passing
before my eyes, and those two
have barely broken a sweat.

512
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:16,975
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

513
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,037
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

514
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:22,209
Oh, whoa. Well.

515
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:24,549
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

516
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:31,460
Ricky, uh--

517
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:35,122
I was thinking about the, uh--
I was gonna-- The movie we talked about.

518
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:37,132
<i>- Re-Animator.
- Yeah!</i>

519
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,966
You want to borrow it ?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

520
00:47:51,981 --> 00:47:54,575
- Can you hold this for a sec ?
- Sure.

521
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,746
I don't think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here, but you never know.

522
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:01,881
- What is this ?
- Urine.

523
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:06,327
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

524
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:09,331
Are you kidding ?
You just smoked with me last night.

525
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,492
It's not mine.

526
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:15,333
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

527
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:19,000
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

528
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:23,102
You like Pink Floyd ?

529
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:27,081
I like a lot of music.

530
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:32,686
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

531
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:35,189
How much do you want ?

532
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:39,194
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce ?

533
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:45,800
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

534
00:48:47,036 --> 00:48:49,027
Wow!

535
00:48:49,105 --> 00:48:51,699
This shit is
top of the line.

536
00:48:51,774 --> 00:48:55,437
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

537
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:59,277
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

538
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:03,284
Is that what we smoked
last night ?

539
00:49:03,352 --> 00:49:05,980
This is all I ever smoke.

540
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:13,318
- How much ?
- Two grand.

541
00:49:13,396 --> 00:49:15,660
Jesus!

542
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,598
Things have changed since 1973.

543
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:22,399
- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

544
00:49:22,472 --> 00:49:24,838
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

545
00:49:24,907 --> 00:49:28,240
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>

546
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:30,541
And I only accept cash.

547
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:34,413
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

548
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:39,421
God. When I was your age,
I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.

549
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:43,550
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

550
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:48,129
All I did was party
and get laid.

551
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:52,825
I had my whole life
ahead of me.

552
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:59,071
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

553
00:49:59,142 --> 00:50:02,111
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

554
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:07,774

I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

563
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,993
I see you're smoking pot now.
I-- I'm so glad.

564
00:50:53,062 --> 00:50:55,553
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...

565
00:50:55,631 --> 00:50:58,122
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

566
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:02,467
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:05,698
Uh-- Lester!

568
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:07,800
You have such hostility in you.

569
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:12,143
Do you mind ? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.

570
00:51:12,215 --> 00:51:15,810
Lester, you will not
get away with this.

571
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:19,013
<i>- You can be sure of that.

573
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:24,885
you... think.

574
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:28,590
" My job consists of

580
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:48,345
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

581
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:52,615
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

582
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:56,419
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

583
00:51:56,492 --> 00:52:00,189
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

584
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:03,426
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

585
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:06,024
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

586
00:52:06,102 --> 00:52:08,036
buying pussy
with company money ?

587
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:10,834
<i>Which I think
would interest the I.R.S.,</i>

588
00:52:10,906 --> 00:52:12,965
since it technically
constitutes fraud.

589
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,977
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

590
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:20,311
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

<i>- What do you want ?

That's not going to happen.

593

What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot ?

Against who ?

00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:39,064
 
Against you.

Man... you are
one twisted fuck.

599
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:58,415
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...

600
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:01,183
with nothing to lose.

601
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:08,130
Yeah.

- Buddy.

Christy left for New York
this morning.

605
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:26,570
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

606
00:53:26,649 --> 00:53:30,141
- What's she doing in New York ?
- She's moving there.

607
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:32,244
Yes, we are splitting up.

00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,915
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

609
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,653
Yes. According to her, I'm...

610
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,753
too focused on my career.

611
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,822
-  
- As if being driven to succeed is...

612
00:53:43,899 --> 00:53:47,630
some sort of a character flaw.
 

613
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:51,696
Well, she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her.

614
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,265
Ooh! Ha. Wow.
 

615
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:59,275
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:03,842
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

617
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:06,615
Well, call me crazy,

618
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:11,183
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

619
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,024
<i>one must project
an image of success...</i>

621

<i>What are you doing ?</i>

622
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:42,283
<i>- I was filming this dead bird.
- Why ?</i>

623
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:44,553
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>

624
00:54:47,062 --> 00:54:50,725
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.

628
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:03,703
Well, whatever. This is boring.

<i>- Do you need a ride ?
- Are you crazy?</i>

631
00:55:10,052 --> 00:55:13,351
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

632
00:55:13,422 --> 00:55:16,880
It's okay. I'll walk.
But thanks.

633

He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.

- I fire a gun.
- Really ?

683
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:17,419
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

684
00:58:17,488 --> 00:58:21,857
and I...just pop off
a few rounds.

685
00:58:21,926 --> 00:58:25,862
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

686
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,865
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.

687
00:58:30,935 --> 00:58:33,267
Well...

688
00:58:33,337 --> 00:58:35,532
almost nothing.

689
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:43,403
- So, do you like your new house ?
- I like it.

690
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:47,008
The people who used to live
there fed these stray cats,
so they were always around,

691
00:58:47,084 --> 00:58:49,746
and it drove
my mother nuts.

692
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,779
And then she cut down
their tree.

693
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:55,951
Is that a funeral ?

694
00:58:56,027 --> 00:59:00,361
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died ?

No.

697
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:08,436
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

698
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:10,940
just laying there
on the sidewalk.

699
00:59:11,008 --> 00:59:13,272
She looked really sad.

700
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,384
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

701

Why would you film that ?

702

- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it ?

703
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:39,596
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,661
just for a second,

705
00:59:41,739 --> 00:59:44,606

754
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:12,839
cave in.

755
01:04:59,356 --> 01:05:02,951

- No, that's quite all right, dear.

758
01:05:12,636 --> 01:05:15,503
Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.

759
01:05:15,573 --> 01:05:18,007
Why don't you tell
our daughter about it, honey ?

760
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:21,135
- Janie, today I quit my job.
-  

761
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:24,146
Then I told my boss to go fuck
himself, and then I blackmailed
him for almost $60,000.

762
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:26,079
<i>- Pass the asparagus.
- Your father seems to think...</i>

763
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,618
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

764
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:31,450
And your mother seems to prefer
that I go through life
like a fucking prisoner...

765
01:05:31,522 --> 01:05:33,786
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.

766
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:36,451
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her ?

767
01:05:36,527 --> 01:05:39,121
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...

768
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:41,687
on the same day
that you lose your job!

769
01:05:41,765 --> 01:05:43,960
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go ?"

770
01:05:44,034 --> 01:05:45,968
I quit!
Pass the asparagus.

771
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:49,301

putting me under the added pressure...</i>

772
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:51,432
of being the sole
breadwinner now.

773
01:05:51,508 --> 01:05:53,442
<i>- I already have a job.
- No, no!</i>

774
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,104
<i>Don't give a second thought
as to who's going to pay the mortgage.</i>

775
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:58,444
We'll leave it up to Carolyn.
"You're going to take care
of everything now, Carolyn ?"

776
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:00,278
"Yes. I don't mind."

777

<i>"Everything ? You don't mind having
the sole responsibility?</i>

quit his job, and you don't--"

Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus ?

780
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:10,619

No, I'm glad because, uh--

810
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:17,846
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

You cannot count

You know, it's sad but true,

the better.

907
01:17:11,857 --> 01:17:13,791
So what ?
It's just a couch.

908
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,426
This is a $4,000 sofa,

909
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,431
upholstered in Italian silk.

910
01:17:20,499 --> 01:17:22,592
This is not just a couch.

911
01:17:22,668 --> 01:17:26,434
It's just... a... couch!

912
01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:28,700
This isn't life!

913
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,969
This is just stuff,

914
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:33,637
and it's become more important
to you than living.

915
01:17:33,712 --> 01:17:35,907
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.

916
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:47,482
I'm only trying to help you!

917
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:55,396
 
Don't.

918
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,560
<i> 
Why?</i>

919
01:18:00,339 --> 01:18:02,830
It's weird watching myself.

920
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:05,342
I don't like how I look.

921
01:18:07,913 --> 01:18:10,848
<i>I can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.</i>

922
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:14,909
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

923
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,297
Ha! How does it feel now ?

924
01:18:26,365 --> 01:18:28,333
Fine.

925
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,391
You don't feel naked ?

926
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,034
<i>I am naked.</i>

927
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:36,540
You know what I mean.

928
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:48,711
So tell me about
being in the hospital.

929
01:18:51,723 --> 01:18:55,716
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

930
01:18:55,794 --> 01:19:00,993
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

931
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:04,558
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right ?

932
01:19:04,636 --> 01:19:08,231
Of course,
I got kicked out.

933
01:19:08,306 --> 01:19:10,740
Dad and I had
this huge fight.

934
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:13,937
<i>He hit me.</i>

935
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:17,971
<i>And the next day at school,
some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>

936
01:19:19,785 --> 01:19:21,878
and I just snapped.

937
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:28,958
I wanted to kill him.

938
01:19:29,027 --> 01:19:31,393
I would've... killed him...

939
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:35,992
if they hadn't pulled me off.

940
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:43,131
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

941
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:47,042
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

942
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:50,845
<i>Wow.</i>

943
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,976
<i>- You must really hate him.
-  </i>

944
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:56,748
 
No.

945
01:19:56,822 --> 01:19:58,983
He's not a bad man.

946
01:19:59,057 --> 01:20:03,687
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.

947
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,593
<i>Wait.</i>

948
01:20:05,664 --> 01:20:07,948
I already do hate my dad.

949
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:11,842
Why ?

950
01:20:13,853 --> 01:20:17,448
He's a total asshole:
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

951
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:19,754
and it's disgusting.

952
01:20:19,826 --> 01:20:23,387
- You'd rather he had the crush on you.
-  

953
01:20:23,463 --> 01:20:25,727
<i>- Gross. No.
-  </i>

954
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:33,629
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

955
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:41,647
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

956
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:44,980
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

957
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:47,246
How ?

958
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,847
<i>Well, now I, too,
need structure,</i>

959
01:20:50,924 --> 01:20:54,087
a little fucking discipline.

960
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:07,333
I'm serious, though.

961
01:21:07,407 --> 01:21:10,342
How could he not
be damaging me ?

962
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:15,214
I need a father
who's a role model,

963
01:21:15,282 --> 01:21:17,876
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...

964
01:21:17,951 --> 01:21:22,684
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

965
01:21:22,756 --> 01:21:25,020
What a lame-o.

966
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,657
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

967
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,796
Want me to kill him for you ?

968
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:47,673
Yeah. Would you ?

969
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:51,384
It'll cost you.

970
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:54,147
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.

971
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,745
I've got almost $3,000.

972
01:21:59,326 --> 01:22:02,090
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.

973
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:05,757
<i>But--</i>

<i>You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do--</i>

977
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:27,519
<i>hiring someone
to kill your dad.</i>

978
01:22:30,256 --> 01:22:34,920
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I ?

979
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:00,113
You know I'm not serious, right ?

980
01:23:01,187 --> 01:23:03,212
Of course.

981
01:23:17,871 --> 01:23:21,739
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other ?

982
01:23:26,045 --> 01:23:28,513

984

I've got a very important

- Is it okay if Angela

- She's always welcome.

I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

1002
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:47,418
because of you and that way
that you behave.

Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

1010
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:20,725
I'm going with Jane
