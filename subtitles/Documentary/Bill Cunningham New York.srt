1
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,585
What it's all about now? Huh?

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,486
We're making
a documentary about Bill.

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,821
Oh, a documentary on him? Yes.

4
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,791
Oh. What about it?

5
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,227
What do you want me say about Bill?

6
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,966
<i>The best fashion show
is definitely on the street.</i>

7
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,127
<i>Always has been
and always will be.</i>

8
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,671
<i>It never occurred to me
that I'm just waiting.</i>

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,970
<i>It's always the hope
that you'll see...</i>

10
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,772
<i>some marvelous,
exotic bird of paradise,</i>

11
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>meaning a very elegant,
stunning woman,</i>

12
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,440
<i>or someone wearing
something terrific.</i>

13
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,179
A friend of mine, Steven O.,
called me at home,

14
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,620
and he said, "Patrick,
there's 17 pictures of you...

15
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,453
<i>in the New York Times. "</i>

16
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,960
I was walking on a cloud
for weeks after that. I still am.

17
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,963
I'm still on my dandy cloud.

18
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,157
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,598
<i>Look at... Look at the shoes.
See the heels?</i>

20
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,465
Isn't that wonderful?

21
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,131
<i>You have to be able to give the reader...
in a flash on Sunday...</i>

22
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,438
<i>news and excitement
about what it was.</i>

23
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,806
You know,
he has two columns.

24
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,812
One of them
which is about...

25
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,782
a documentation
of New York life,

26
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:37,016
<i>in terms of the drivers of its social and
philanthropic world, political world,</i>

27
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:42,117
<i>and this other, which is really
an attempt to tease out trends...</i>

28
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,061
<i>in terms of the reality
of how people dress.</i>

29
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,625
<i>By covering those two aspects,
I think he really does address...</i>

30
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,829
<i>the whole spectrum
of what we are as New Yorkers,</i>

31
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,372
<i>and I believe
he's the only one who does it.</i>

32
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,740
<i>See, I don't decide anything.
I let the street speak to me.</i>

33
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,837
<i>In order for the street
to speak to you,</i>

34
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,712
<i>you've got to stay out there
and see what it is.</i>

35
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,251
<i>You just don't manufacture
in your head...</i>

36
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,184
<i>that skirts at the knee
are the thing.</i>

37
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,814
<i>Then you go out and photograph
people with skirts at the knee.</i>

38
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,861
<i>You've got to stay on the street and
let the street tell you what it is.</i>

39
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,692
<i>There's no shortcuts.
Believe me.</i>

40
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,963
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know where to stop or start.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,036
This is terrible.

42
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,532
What's your deadline?

43
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,233
You could... You could
really be a great help to me.

44
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,832
What?

45
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,911
Take these out like this, John.

46
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,038
Okay.
Make it easy.

47
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,241
And keep them like this,
and it would help me.

48
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,114
Put 'em in here.
Okay.

49
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,653
I hate to ask you.
I don't mean to use you...

50
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,053
or misuse you,
but it would be helpful.

51
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,787
Today is Thursday.

52
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,884
When do you usually
know when your page...

53
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,726
Right now.
Right now. I see.

54
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,823
Yeah, it should be done.
I see.

55
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,765
We haven't even got 'em scanned.

56
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,497
Do you know what your page is yet?
Your "On the Street" page?

57
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,197
Do you know
what it's going to be?

58
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,334
It's going to be, uh,
all on legs and shoes.

59
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,148
Oh, those are nice.

60
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,949
Now that's a good one.

61
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,489
I guess we'd better do it.

62
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,289
You're gonna call that store
you want me to run down to...

63
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,760
to go get your film?
Yeah.

64
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,935
Oh, hello there.

65
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,699
Uh, this is the guy that
comes on a bicycle.

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,434
You're developing some film for me.

67
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,034
Yeah. Uh, listen, I'm in...
kind of running,

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,479
and a friend of mine
was gonna come and pick it up.

69
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,482
John.

70
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,576
He's a tall fella,
and he has long hair.

71
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,713
You know. Okay.

72
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,120
All right.

73
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,657
I'll go get it.

74
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,388
There's a couple of pictures on there
of shoes from this morning.

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,123
All right.
So, we need that for today.

76
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,394
- And I'll quickly get on this.
- Okay. I'll be right back with it.

77
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,992
Wait a minute. Come on.
Let's get snappin' and crackin'.

78
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,835
See, static, static.
Getting a little better.

79
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,068
Then when the wind blows a bit...

80
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,405
Oh, isn't that fun.

81
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,674
Oh, you see, the minute
you get in the rain...

82
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,750
<i>When it rains,
it's a whole different scene.</i>

83
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,684
<i>Or when there's a blizzard
is the best time.</i>

84
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,482
<i>Things happen.
People forget about you.</i>

85
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,047
<i>If they see you,
they don't go putting on airs.</i>

86
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,251
<i>They're the way they are,</i>

87
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,693
<i>and if they happen to be wearing
what you're photographing,</i>

88
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,491
<i>then you're in business.</i>

89
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,590
He's caught me on a rainy day
jumping puddles,

90
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,566
the same way I did for Avedon,

91
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,864
<i>but...</i>

92
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,700
<i>It was much less painful...</i>

93
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,706
<i>when Bill photographed me,</i>

94
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,435
<i>and much more natural.</i>

95
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,101
He catches you
crossing a street...

96
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,009
with boots and
blue jeans and this,

97
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,445
and he's so happy,

98
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,346
and he's much happier
when you're in this...

99
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,681
<i>looking terrible and ratty,
than he is...</i>

100
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,621
<i>if he saw you in something
incredibly elegant and smart.</i>

101
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,724
<i>That's my poncho.
They're so cheap...</i>

102
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,162
that you wear them once or twice,
and then they start tearing.

103
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,234
First at the neck, immediately.

104
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,702
Well, why buy a new one?
It's only gonna tear anyway.

105
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,636
So you repair the old one.

106
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,069
Damn you, New Yorkers.
You're all so extravagant and wasteful.

107
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,176
But I don't believe in one wear.

108
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:03,483
So a little tape.
And we're back in business.

109
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,524
I know this embarrasses everyone.

110
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,457
It doesn't embarrass me.

111
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,392
I think everyone
that knows Bill...

112
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,488
and understands who he is
and what he represents...

113
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,330
will always be thrilled
to be photographed by Bill.

114
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,338
I mean, I've said many times
that we all get dressed for Bill.

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,704
Anna! Anna!

116
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,009
Anna, right here, please?

117
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,104
Anna, right here.
Can you stop for a moment?

118
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,342
- She stopped for you.
- She stopped for Bill.

119
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,284
<i>He's sort of
been documenting me for...</i>

120
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,855
<i>Since I was a kid, like in my...
19, 20 years old,</i>

121
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,514
<i>and it's one snap, two snaps,</i>

122
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,184
or he ignores you,
which is death, you know?

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,593
But he's always doing it
because he has a point of view.

124
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,494
He'd take my picture
whenever he saw me.

125
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,261
<i>Sometimes it got into the Times,
and most often not.</i>

126
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,462
And then little by little,
he began to photograph me more.

127
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,406
I would come into a place.
And he would say, "Oh, thank God you're here."

128
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,670
Every...
Oh, I guess you can't say that.

129
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:03,181
<i>But he used to say, "Everybody here looks so boring.
Everybody looks alike. "</i>

130
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,113
<i>See, a lot of people have taste.</i>

131
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,209
But they don't have
the daring to be creative.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,585
<i>Here we are in an age
of the cookie-cutter sameness.</i>

133
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,487
<i>There are few that are rarities.</i>

134
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,858
<i>Someone that doesn't look
like they were stamped out of...</i>

135
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,988
ten million other people
looking all the same.

136
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,726
At the U.N.,
my friends used to...

137
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,962
Colleagues used to call me
the designing diplomat...

138
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,700
because during the day,
I wore my U.N. Suit,

139
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,470
which was very conservative,
but in the evenings,

140
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,977
<i>I'd go out to Studio 54.</i>

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,674
<i>That's when Bill photographed me
for the first time.</i>

142
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,215
I wish I could find the picture.

143
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,911
<i>The first picture he ever took of
me in the New York Times.</i>

144
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,818
I used to have this coat
with a big hood...

145
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,324
<i>and it was a Hudson Bay blanket,
so it was all, like, bright striped,</i>

146
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,156
<i>and I used to wear them with,
like, little hot-pink ankle boots.</i>

147
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,596
<i>That's how I met him.
He used to run after me on the street.</i>

148
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,566
<i>He's like a war photographer in
that he'll do anything for the shot.</i>

149
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,569
<i>I've been in deep conversations
with him...</i>

150
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,834
<i>where he just will, like, run from
me 'cause he sees somebody.</i>

151
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,308
<i>So, I mean, he sees something that's
amazing, he has to go shoot it.</i>

152
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,349
<i>I sometimes will look at his pages
in the Times or online,</i>

153
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,907
and just be so amazed that he and I...

154
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,113
and all my team and all
the rest of the world...

155
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,122
we're all sitting
in the same fashion shows...

156
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,785
but he's seen something
on the street or on the runway...

157
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,862
that completely missed all of us,

158
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:27,421
and in six months' time, you know,
that will be a trend.

159
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,467
Hold that right there.

160
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,196
<i>You have to do three things.</i>

161
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,434
<i>You don't get the most
information from any one.</i>

162
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,304
<i>You have to photograph
the collections.</i>

163
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,878
<i>You have to photograph
the women on the street...</i>

164
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,107
<i>who have bought the things
and how they're wearing them.</i>

165
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,582
<i>And then you have to go
to the evening events.</i>

166
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,713
<i>You can't report to the public
unless you've seen it all.</i>

167
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,791
<i>People just go off
and say what they think.</i>

168
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,917
<i>Well, it isn't really what I think.</i>

169
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,892
<i>It's what I see.</i>

170
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,630
<i>It doesn't
happen like in a day or an hour.</i>

171
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,995
I go out and that's it.

172
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,763
I run around and photograph
all people with holes in their sneakers.

173
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,962
It's not that at all.

174
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,040
Suddenly I see something,
then I see it again,

175
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,337
and I think, "Ah, there's an idea,"
and other times I'll see it and I'll think,

176
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,776
"Wow, that's an idea,"
and then I'll look for it.

177
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,747
<i>But I'll be doing ten other ideas
all at once, you see.</i>

178
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,538
They make the best sandwich.

179
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,445
And coffee... three dollars.
The cheaper the better, you know?

180
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,948
<i>The coffee at the Times,
l... I... It's so... ugh.</i>

181
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,705
My cord kept coming out of the
camera last night. Oh, yeah?

182
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,742
So I've been worried sick.

183
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472
But I got something,
any rate, on that roll.

184
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,343
We'll see about the others.

185
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,349
<i>Do you know
anything about his personal life?</i>

186
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,892
Nothing.
Nothing.

187
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,359
Absolutely nothing.

188
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,862
<i>I don't think anybody
gets to know him very well, do they?</i>

189
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:47,598
I have the feeling that he doesn't sit down
to talk to people too much.

190
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,873
<i>I have no
idea about his private life.</i>

191
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:57,074
I have no idea if he's lonely. I have no idea...
Where does he eat dinner every night?

192
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,208
You have no id...
I mean, I don't.

193
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,582
<i>I wonder, you know,
what he does do.</i>

194
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,935
<i>For all the years
that I've known Bill,</i>

195
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,638
<i>he's lived at Carnegie Hall...</i>

196
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,876
in a tiny, tiny room.

197
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,511
You know, I once went to his studio.
Have you been there? Oh, my God.

198
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,486
When I saw that,
I was just, like, wow.

199
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,057
<i>File cabinets,
file cabinets, file cabinets.</i>

200
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,823
<i>He has negatives
of every picture he's ever taken.</i>

201
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,359
That's my filing system.

202
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,771
Okay.

203
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,031
And this is my clothes closet.

204
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,146
Does he still sleep on the cabinets?

205
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,978
<i>It's just like it was
just all a little room...</i>

206
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,609
<i>with all these file cabinets
and negatives,</i>

207
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,917
<i>and that was probably
30 years ago.</i>

208
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,958
I know that the bathroom
was in the hall.

209
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,995
Editta?

210
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,593
Come in.

211
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,296
I've been here 60 years.

212
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,533
Carnegie Hall.

213
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,041
And I'm
he only one here...

214
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,203
except Bill on this floor,
you know.

215
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,008
I've done...
This is fabulous.

216
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,640
All the stars of Hollywood.

217
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,184
Yes.
Well, I'm very famous.

218
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,311
Look at the people I've done. Look.

219
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,857
Tyrone Power,
Henry Fonda, Mary Martin.

220
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,391
Let's see.

221
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,120
Andy Warhol here.

222
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,992
You can't photograph that.

223
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,325
Just you.

224
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,024
Not this. Not Andy.

225
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,193
Why not?
Because not.

226
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,739
What do you mean you can't
photograph Andy Warhol?

227
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,898
Who are you kidding?

228
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,134
What do you mean?
That's what he was all about.

229
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,006
What?
Being photographed.

230
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,204
I just sold two to China.

231
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,080
This is, uh, Bernstein,

232
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,051
and he lived here in Carnegie Hall.

233
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,019
June Carter.

234
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,419
See, this is, uh...

235
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,219
You know who she is.

236
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,953
Oh, Tilda Swinton?
Yes!

237
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,358
Tilda Swinton.
Swinton.

238
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,363
Isn't that nice? Mm-hmm.

239
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,830
<i>I was here 60 years.</i>

240
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,334
<i>I'm...
I'm really a, uh, a legend now.</i>

241
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,768
A legend or a fixture?

242
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,840
Well, I'm both,
you know what I mean?

243
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,938
Does Bill live next door?

244
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,978
He's down on the corner.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,605
He's got a tiny little place, yeah.

246
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,183
It's nothing.

247
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,617
By the way,
this is Lesley Vinson,

248
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,249
<i>and Lesley was the art director
of Details Magazine.</i>

249
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,793
<i>The original Details
with Annie Flanders.</i>

250
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,328
We worked well together.

251
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,160
She took me on and didn't mind
how many changes I made...

252
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,394
or how many pictures
I wanted to put in.

253
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,868
The most extraordinary
art director.

254
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,802
Incredible. Um...

255
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,932
The love of Bill's life,
I think.

256
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:17,581
<i>Details got started
on the ides of March 1982.</i>

257
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,742
The reason I remember that date...

258
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,253
<i>was it was the date that the SoHo
News went out of business.</i>

259
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,416
<i>The vision that I had for Details
was really a continuation...</i>

260
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,757
<i>of what I had been doing
at SoHo News,</i>

261
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:35,527
<i>discovering people and giving them
their first opportunity to be in print.</i>

262
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,968
<i>The reason Annie founded
the magazine was to give a platform...</i>

263
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,168
<i>to the downtown,
independent, small designers,</i>

264
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,803
<i>who no one else would pay attention
to until they were successful...</i>

265
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,473
<i>and then steal them from Annie.</i>

266
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,040
<i>Oh, Annie was the Earth mother
of downtown.</i>

267
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,987
<i>I don't know if that's
what you called it. Oh, definitely.</i>

268
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,320
Annie would just give Bill like...
Here's a hundred pages,

269
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,657
<i>and Bill flourished with Annie
more than ever anywhere.</i>

270
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:08,096
<i>It was like she almost gave him his own little
mini magazine just to do it however he wanted.</i>

271
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,760
He'd work all day,
and he'd come up at night,

272
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,702
and our sessions usually lasted
till about 4:00 in the morning.

273
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,036
I worked for the Establishment
during the day,

274
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:21,306
<i>so I was like a bird getting out
of a cage, and I'd go down there.</i>

275
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,971
<i>It was marvelous.</i>

276
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,938
<i>I would come after my job
at the Times,</i>

277
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,137
<i>and we would lay this out,
and then I'd go home about 2:00.</i>

278
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,907
Biked back from SoHo
where we were.

279
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,348
<i>I think one Details
Magazine, it was Fall Special...</i>

280
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,579
<i>125 pages of Bill Cunningham.</i>

281
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,383
A hundred pages?

282
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,617
Ninety-nine.
Ninety-nine pages.

283
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,716
We just...
We never thought of it.

284
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,763
We just went on and did what we wanted
till we had said what we wanted to say.

285
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,992
111 pages.
111 pages.

286
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,763
Here what I did was I blew up
the embroidery of the coat,

287
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,338
and we put it on the pages,

288
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,999
and then put the coat, small,
in the middle of it,

289
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,541
'cause the news was in...

290
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,009
Yeah, the idea was
the big... was this.

291
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,275
'Cause it was like something
out of the Renaissance, you see?

292
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,078
You try to show the reader
what was really new.

293
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:38,122
Look at this. It's like something
from Paul Poiret, uh, 1910.

294
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,590
Scheherazade,
the Arabian Nights.

295
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,356
Look at the embroidery,
the tassels, the lace.

296
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,228
Now, I mean, can you imagine
the extravagance of these pages?

297
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,130
Annie Flanders never blinked.

298
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,793
You can't say anything, Annie.

299
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,498
I didn't take money,
so I can do what I want.

300
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,770
It's a wonder she didn't say,
"That didn't mean you can bankrupt me."

301
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,437
What I did
from the very first issue...

302
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,074
is I kept a list of how much
Bill would've gotten paid.

303
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:09,985
Well, the first check I sent him, he came in
the office and ceremoniously ripped it up.

304
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,649
The second check,
he did the same thing.

305
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,717
You see, if you don't take money,
they can't tell you what to do, kid.

306
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,889
That's... That's the key
to the whole thing.

307
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,522
Don't touch money.

308
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,464
It's the worst thing
you can do.

309
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,662
There's a story
about the fact that Bill,

310
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,239
<i>when you sold Details
to Condé Nast,</i>

311
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,832
Bill refused to cash his check.
Yes.

312
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,471
<i>And Si Newhouse was calling you
like every couple of months...</i>

313
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,742
<i>to say,
"Bill, your check is waiting."</i>

314
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,715
Condé Nast bought it?
Yes, yes.

315
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,877
Newhouse bought it
a year ago.

316
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,217
Well, Newhouse is
taking the money.

317
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,348
Yeah, but they don't
own me, you see.

318
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,790
They don't own you.

319
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,862
That's the important thing,
never to be owned.

320
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,693
I know they don't own you.
I know they don't own you.

321
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,198
Money's the cheapest thing.

322
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,928
Liberty and freedom
is the most expensive.

323
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,365
No, you know
what I mean, Richard.

324
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:06,706
So you asked me... about not falling
into the traps of the rich.

325
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:15,378
I would think it was my first, uh, partner
in my fashion business.

326
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,955
<i>A woman by the name
of Rebekah Harkness,</i>

327
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,888
<i>a very affluent New York family,</i>

328
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,952
<i>and she was looking to invest
in my hat shop and she did.</i>

329
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:29,500
But then the army came along...
this is 1951...

330
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,091
<i>I was drafted.</i>

331
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:36,539
<i>Well, they were appalled that I would go,
and their investment would be on hold.</i>

332
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,904
<i>Who knows what would happen?</i>

333
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,375
I was appalled at them.

334
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,639
I thought, "You're drafted.

335
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:46,548
<i>This is the country where you live,
who you are. You go. "</i>

336
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,813
Well, they couldn't understand that at all.

337
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,220
Course I went in the army.
I wouldn't think otherwise.

338
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,418
They badgered me and they badgered
my family, and finally...

339
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,087
<i>my aunt and uncle,
whom I lived with here in the city,</i>

340
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,190
<i>I think they returned the money
she had invested which... God...</i>

341
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,360
Maybe it was a thousand dollars?

342
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,699
Which was a lot of money then.

343
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:11,037
To the Harkness family, I don't think
a thousand dollars was a lot of money.

344
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,907
Oh, they tried to have it...
I know what it was...

345
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,140
deducted from my army salary,

346
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:22,084
which would have taken about ten years,
'cause I don't know what you made...

347
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,645
You got paid maybe $90 a month
or something like that.

348
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,782
Some stupidity.

349
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,656
So my family paid it off,

350
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,730
and then when I got out of the army,
I paid my family back.

351
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,957
Don't take a picture of us.

352
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,229
I'll break that
fucking camera over your head.

353
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,769
Yeah, he wanted...
he wanted me...

354
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,744
to come up
and meet my replacement.

355
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,338
Your replacement.
Your...

356
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,178
Yes, you passed
on the torch to me.

357
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,411
You're just a trophy wife.

358
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,952
I was always there
at the beginning.

359
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,954
I've showed her
some of your layouts.

360
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,752
Oh, you teaching, uh...
Uh, I don't teach.

361
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,123
Muffin or is she teaching you?
She's teaching me.

362
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,788
Now, see, you made those
too big, those flowers.

363
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,127
What flowers?
See, that's... that's too big.

364
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,700
Where's the love today, Bill?

365
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,269
Love? Just get the page done.
Show 'em where the love is, Bill.

366
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,702
Show 'em where the love is, right?
Just get the page done.

367
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,297
Winchester.
Winchester.

368
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,469
And he means the gun
off the back shelf of the pickup truck.

369
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,876
John, let me see this one here.

370
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,849
Put your favorite up here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,919
You see, it's a little
short coat in here.

372
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,112
Don't encourage him.

373
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,121
The good thing is he can't
hear me talking about him.

374
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,884
Maybe 190.
I don't know what it was.

375
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,620
Then all of a sudden,
when I don't think he can hear me,

376
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,286
he hears me perfectly well.
What?

377
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,591
Bill's fingerprints are all over
everything he does,

378
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:18,466
'cause he's never ever, ever sold out
one inch of anything.

379
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,164
When the hat business
was sort of sloughing off,

380
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,867
<i>he was working
for Women's Wear Daily as a...</i>

381
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,806
Writing a millinery column.

382
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,813
<i>Part of his falling out with
Women's Wear Daily...</i>

383
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,473
hadn't to do
with anything really big.

384
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,744
It had to do with this
ethical issue for him,

385
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,915
which was that many of his photographs
were being used for an "In and Out" list,

386
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:44,052
and his feeling is that
it's all equally in.

387
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,993
That's the reason he's documenting it.

388
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,259
He's incredibly kind.

389
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,326
I don't think we've ever seen
a cruel picture done by Bill,

390
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:58,342
and certainly he's had an opportunity
to really have done it.

391
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,673
He's chosen never to do it.

392
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,542
<i>He was still working
at Women's Wear,</i>

393
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:06,083
<i>and he did a piece
on women on the street...</i>

394
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,278
<i>in the same clothes
as the models on the runway.</i>

395
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,324
<i>It was about how incredible women
had their own style...</i>

396
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,916
<i>and what they could do
with the clothes, side by side...</i>

397
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,188
<i>with what the designers did
on the runway,</i>

398
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,960
and they changed his copy
to make fun of the women.

399
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:28,005
This idea of a valuation of one person
over another, or one image over another,

400
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,802
was not something
that he really subscribes to as a person.

401
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,002
He was so beyond upset.

402
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,047
It was so sad and it...

403
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,946
He didn't think he'd ever get over it,

404
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,883
because he was
so embarrassed and upset...

405
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,548
and really cared about the women
that he had put in this...

406
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,989
in this and what happened.

407
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,721
<i>That was the end of his career
at Women's Wear Daily.</i>

408
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,024
Yeah, she's lovely.

409
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,694
Jesus, what'd she...
Just get a garbage bag?

410
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:01,068
Rubbish bag. Looks like she's
in a rose, a black rose.

411
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,970
It's a garbage bag.

412
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,974
What the hell
you talking about a rose?

413
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,510
What would you people
from southern New Jersey know?

414
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,910
Oh-ho.
Beautiful woman.

415
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,108
These two are exquisite. Look at them.

416
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,549
<i>It's really
hard to describe oneself...</i>

417
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,986
<i>because I think one lives very often
in other people's visions.</i>

418
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:23,117
I see myself as the world's oldest living
teenager 'cause I have such a good time,

419
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,823
and I try to get as much kick
out of things as possible.

420
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,424
I have all my little animals, who,
by the way, are very jealous of me,

421
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,527
and so I have to give them jewelry...
otherwise they bite.

422
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:38,075
I always heard growing up that
Joan Crawford said that...

423
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,906
whenever she went out,
she had to go out as Joan Crawford.

424
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,641
So I took that to heart, and whenever I
go out, I have to be Patrick McDonald.

425
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,912
I have to be the dandy,
and I would never go out...

426
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,920
without my beauty mark,
my eyebrows, my hat.

427
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,387
I would never do that.

428
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,788
We're all canvases.

429
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,726
We're all blank canvases when we get up
in the morning, and we paint ourselves.

430
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,694
<i>Sometimes we're surreal.</i>

431
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,790
<i>Sometimes we're impressionistic.
Sometimes we're modern.</i>

432
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,801
<i>It... It just depends on the day.</i>

433
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:10,136
This is my, uh,
alphabet outfit, and,

434
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:14,474
this is another of,
uh, my... my clothing...

435
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,140
that appeared in "On the Street"
column of Bill Cunningham.

436
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,081
I call it "Awning Stripes."

437
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,585
A Scottish plaid outfit.

438
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,247
I don't know which clan
it belongs to.

439
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:30,761
When I wear this outfit, people smile, and
it kind of cheers them up a little bit.

440
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,730
This is one of my other
lollipop salesman's outfit.

441
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,700
A combination of different plaids
from Scotland.

442
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,275
This used to be
my old sofa, the jacket,

443
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,437
and my pants was...
used to be my ottoman.

444
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,950
These are, uh, the issues
from my appearances...

445
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,679
in Bill Cunningham's
"On the Street" column.

446
00:25:55,787 --> 00:26:02,351
They're laminated so that this will
preserve it for, uh, my grandchildren.

447
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,623
Put this one
in the upper right-hand corner.

448
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,425
Give me these two together.

449
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,897
Lap them together.
Together.

450
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,633
Uh, put the dog back where
the cab is for the minute.

451
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,229
Let me see them again, John.

452
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,865
Now don't get angry.

453
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,341
Jiggle the mouse.

454
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,639
I'm going to jiggle you
right out that damn window.

455
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,271
Why don't you go get your film,
so I can straighten this out?

456
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,317
No, I will. Put it back.
As soon as I get exactly what I want.

457
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,252
Oh, Jesus, give me
strength to deal with you today.

458
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,985
Oh, and we gotta leave room for that damn
three or four lines Web site, some nonsense.

459
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,961
<i>Look at now. They've got the audio
thing going at the Times,</i>

460
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,556
which they pushed me into, and they said,
"Well, a lot of people don't read the paper."

461
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,727
<i>I said, "Okay, I'll do it.
Where do we do it?"</i>

462
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,841
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

463
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,502
This is...
He's getting in a zone.

464
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,140
<i>I just go in the room and
say what's on my mind and that's it.</i>

465
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,511
<i>It's done in five minutes.</i>

466
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,381
Okay. Yeah.

467
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,081
Uh, this is Bill Cunningham,
and "On the Street" this week...

468
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,251
<i>... there's no question
black is the story this week.</i>

469
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:14,924
<i>Here we are, the first week in August, and
the New Yorkers are all in black clothes.</i>

470
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:20,061
<i>This is Bill Cunningham, and "On the
Street"this week is a very interesting...</i>

471
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,537
<i>Isn't it always?
But it really is.</i>

472
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,235
<i>The picture frame collar.</i>

473
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:30,975
<i>There was the most popular T-shirt this
summer was printed with multiple sunglasses.</i>

474
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,109
<i>There's no reason to be doom and gloom
and think that fashion is finished.</i>

475
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,620
<i>Just reach back into your closet...</i>

476
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,622
<i>I call it "the thin man."</i>

477
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,090
<i>It's a serious way of dressing.</i>

478
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:46,459
<i>They've got something going here,
and I thought it was serious enough...</i>

479
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,361
for you to take a look at.

480
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,866
Thank you very much,
and I hope you enjoy it.

481
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,645
Hmm.

482
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,910
Okay, move it all over and take this woman
and put her in the corner.

483
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,416
Yeah, that's nice.

484
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,747
I think it's all right.

485
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,047
That's not bad.

486
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,055
You want me to order
your lunch today?

487
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,717
I beg pardon?
Do you want me to order you in lunch?

488
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,953
Oh. Lunch.
No. Soup, you know.

489
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,359
I'm not thinking about lunch.

490
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,794
No. I know what we need.

491
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,560
What? Yeah. It's all right.
No, leave everything alone.

492
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:27,366
Uh, put her here,
and put her over here.

493
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,702
Yes. There it is. You got it.

494
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,539
See, the hair, the same gesture,
the wind. Wonderful.

495
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:38,014
If you examine his pictures,
he always is focused on some detail...

496
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:44,055
or some narrative or conceptual thing
that he's documenting.

497
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,422
Do you like
that we're dressed alike, Bill?

498
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,858
I said, do you like it that
we're dressed alike? Mm-hmm.

499
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,930
We've been hanging around
with each other for 60 years.

500
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,090
That's great.
We went to high school together.

501
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,168
That's great. Yeah. Terrific.

502
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,394
And we never
had a fight.

503
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,130
Oh, good.
That's better.

504
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,798
That's better.
There's enough people fighting.

505
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,876
Watch these
crazy cabdrivers.

506
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,205
Okay, good-bye.

507
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:24,024
<i>So his photographs,
rather than just paparazzi shots,</i>

508
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:30,295
<i>are really evidence of what fashion is
at any given moment in the world.</i>

509
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:37,341
<i>His archive is really not just
an encapsulation of fashion,</i>

510
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,875
<i>but of New York life,</i>

511
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,775
<i>and I think it's wonderful
for fashion historians...</i>

512
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,404
<i>that this did happen...</i>

513
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,949
<i>That there was this
one individual...</i>

514
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,745
<i>who was willing
to dedicate his life...</i>

515
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,616
<i>to this fascinating
manifestation of culture.</i>

516
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,510
<i>It's not photography.</i>

517
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,018
<i>I mean, any real photographer
would say he's a fraud.</i>

518
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,213
<i>Well, they're right.</i>

519
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,588
<i>I'm just about capturing what I see
and documenting what I see.</i>

520
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,921
Ah!

521
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:35,330
I mean, is he Horst?
Put a bunch of flowers in front of you?

522
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,130
No. He's not that,
but that's not what he wants to be.

523
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,637
<i>I think he photographs life.</i>

524
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:53,916
<i>The parallel between the emerging
japanese designers in the early '80s...</i>

525
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,645
<i>and the bag people in New York...</i>

526
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,153
was startling, astonishing.

527
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,191
No one would talk about it
or even show the pictures.

528
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,954
And as time went on,

529
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,826
the Japanese woman
Rei Kawakubo admitted...

530
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,558
<i>that her inspiration...</i>

531
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,601
<i>That when someone said, "Who do you
think are the best-dressed women?"</i>

532
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,534
<i>And she said,
"The bag women in New York."</i>

533
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,368
<i>Now whether she was being facetious
or cynical...</i>

534
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,966
or a real artist and saying
what she really thought,

535
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,447
you know, we're too close
to a very touchy subject.

536
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,949
But as a historian, uh,

537
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:32,045
what we see in New York
in the 1980s in some areas...

538
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,489
is close to medieval Europe.

539
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,256
The shapes, I mean, of these people.

540
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,468
Didn't someone
give you your first camera?

541
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:59,278
David Montgomery, an American photographer
who lived and worked in London.

542
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:03,411
<i>We were there at his home with
his wife and all for dinner one night.</i>

543
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:08,720
I said, "Gee, do you have an assistant
who could take a picture for me tomorrow?"

544
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,691
Some fashion shop, I mentioned.

545
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:15,061
And... Yes,
he sent one of his assistants out.

546
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,192
And then when he came to New York
about three months later,

547
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,032
he said,
"Here, I brought you something."

548
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,438
He said, "Use it like a pen,
like you take notes.

549
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,975
Do it with a camera."

550
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,672
<i>A little Olympus half-frame.
They were $39,</i>

551
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,309
and you got 72 pictures
to a 36 roll of...

552
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,321
Frame roll of film
so I liked that even better.

553
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,586
One of the interesting
things about street style...

554
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,129
is that it emerged
at the same point...

555
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,427
that, um, Bill got a camera.

556
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:55,268
And by street style, I'm talking about fashions
that really did emerge from the street.

557
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:59,810
There was always a sense
of a kind of quotidian world...

558
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:04,871
<i>that one sees in photographs that were done
at the turn of the century, for example,</i>

559
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,010
<i>by the Seeberger brothers, or different
people who were documenting the bon monde,</i>

560
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,457
but it wasn't really street style in that it
wasn't, theoretically, "ordinary" people,

561
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,156
<i>going about their business
dressed in fascinating ways.</i>

562
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:26,134
<i>That really begins to happen in the 1960s,
and that is the moment which Bill begins.</i>

563
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,795
<i>On an Easter Sunday,</i>

564
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,897
I came back here to get film,

565
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,977
and the phone rang
and I picked it up,

566
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:40,950
<i>and it was the Times fashion critic and editorial
writer Charlotte Curtis, who I knew very well.</i>

567
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:46,490
And she said, "Bill, grab your cameras and get
up to the Sheep Meadow as quick as you can.

568
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,081
They're having a be-in."

569
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,853
What the hell is a be-in?

570
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,419
<i>I jumped on my bike
and went up to the Sheep Meadow,</i>

571
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,762
<i>and there were thousands of kids.</i>

572
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:01,862
Oh! I mean, you just never saw
anything like it.

573
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:07,570
<i>All the flower children,
the hippies, everything,</i>

574
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,010
<i>All up there,
and it was a lovely day,</i>

575
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,777
and they were lying on the grass
or the dirt or whatever it was,

576
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,285
and they were dressed.

577
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,854
It was marvelous,

578
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,650
<i>and that really did me in.</i>

579
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,782
<i>From then on, that was it, kid.</i>

580
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,520
<i>My Sundays and Saturdays...</i>

581
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:28,088
<i>Saturdays down in SoHo, and Sundays up in the park...
were completely taken.</i>

582
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,257
<i>That was it.</i>

583
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:36,739
Course, as Antonio said, "Yep, and you
photographed everything in black and white,

584
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,934
and it was all about color."

585
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:46,575
Course he was right, but I couldn't
afford color film and developing...

586
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,982
so it's in black and white.

587
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,923
Oh, boy. Someday,
it's all gonna fall down on me.

588
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,424
I know. I don't even
want to think about that. My God.

589
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,622
If I disappear under a bunch of books,
you'll know what...

590
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,924
They're all fashion books.

591
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,159
Imagine me having to move
the end of June?

592
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,636
I thought it was just open-end.
That at some time, people would have to move out of here.

593
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,174
Is there a specific date when you have to leave?
Yeah, June 30th. So they say.

594
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,766
Bill, that's like in two
or three months. Hmm?

595
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:18,338
<i>The battle against a plan to evict artists
who live and work at Carnegie Hall...</i>

596
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,917
<i>was taken to the steps
of city hall today.</i>

597
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,114
<i>Over the years, the studios have seen the likes
of Marlon Brando and Leonard Bernstein.</i>

598
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,421
<i>Now the remaining tenants at Carnegie
Hall are turning to the mayor for help.</i>

599
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,620
<i>CBS 2's Andrew Kirtzman reports.</i>

600
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,492
<i>Today, residents
gathered at City Hall...</i>

601
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,260
<i>with actor John Turturro
as their champion.</i>

602
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,326
<i>They want Mayor Bloomberg to step in,
since the city owns Carnegie Hall.</i>

603
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:45,637
<i>Not far away, the concert hall's artistic director
held his own City Hall press conference.</i>

604
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,679
Their work... It is perfectly possible
for them to do somewhere else.

605
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,078
The work of Carnegie Hall,
and the work of music...

606
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,448
and our contribution to the city,
has to come from Carnegie Hall.

607
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:59,956
<i>City hall sources tell Andrew that Mayor
Bloomberg will not intervene in the matter.</i>

608
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,390
<i>He reportedly feels it's a
private, landlord-tenant dispute.</i>

609
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,691
<i>There was no official comment
from the mayor's office.</i>

610
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,992
The state of things now is,
I don't want to say grim,

611
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,398
but it feels like the
studios of Carnegie Hall,

612
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,767
the legendary studios,
are on its last legs.

613
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,705
There are six tenants remaining in
the building, all rent control.

614
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,574
<i>Everything is turned into offices.
Corporate offices.</i>

615
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,705
<i>Beautiful artist studios like this
have been divided up...</i>

616
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,545
<i>with partitions and computers
and telemarketers.</i>

617
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,019
<i>Agnes de Mille's studio...
This is the famous one, Ballet Arts,</i>

618
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,147
<i>where she choreographed
Oklahoma.</i>

619
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:37,284
<i>Can you imagine how big that studio was?
That is now a sea of telemarketers.</i>

620
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,056
<i>For us it feels criminal.</i>

621
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,030
<i>It feels immoral that these people,
at this stage of their life,</i>

622
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,763
<i>are going to spend their twilight years,
fighting to hold on to these studios.</i>

623
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:52,332
<i>That's why it's a treat to see Bill and
Editta Sherman standing their ground...</i>

624
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,775
<i>and being the last holdouts here
of the Carnegie Studios.</i>

625
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,540
Editta Sherman!

626
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,280
Come on in!

627
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,714
What is this thing?

628
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,013
How come they're not doing
something on me?

629
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,588
We did something on you.
This is all of you.

630
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,385
We're doing something
on all of you now.

631
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,549
Well, why?

632
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,459
Here I am. They don't even
bring a cup of coffee.

633
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,895
Well, I think they're not very civilized.

634
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,432
Editta's always hungry.

635
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,027
She's always hungry.

636
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,627
You see?
This is a crazy house.

637
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,536
- That's so beautiful.
- I know that.

638
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,268
Suzette, how
long have you known Editta?

639
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,810
Were you here
when I moved in in '49?

640
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,402
No. You were here first.
Forty-nine.

641
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,174
I moved in here in the '40s.

642
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,614
I guess I must have been here
around 1940, huh?

643
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,710
And Bill was making hats.
He was a designer.

644
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,483
In this building?
Yes. Yes, he made hats.

645
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,618
And I met him because I wanted
to buy one of the hats.

646
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,720
Did Suzette wear your hats?

647
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,731
Yeah. I wear the orange
one all the time.

648
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,460
Suzette is very conservative.
It's wearing out.

649
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,264
An orange one. The orange beret.
She had one.

650
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,100
There's a picture
of it around somewhere.

651
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,298
Yeah, I have
one downstairs...

652
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,840
A painting of it,
a big painting.

653
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,170
Well, I have the hats here.

654
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,543
One of them is a little beret,
which is very cute.

655
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:04,979
No, it's nothing.

656
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,845
Don't show them the garbage.

657
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,612
This is one of Bill's hats.

658
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,824
Everybody looks at me
on the street when I wear this hat.

659
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,592
Like that one?

660
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,497
<i>My hat salon
was on the 10th floor.</i>

661
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:29,505
<i>Ginger Rogers used to come and joan Crawford.
Marilyn Monroe was one,</i>

662
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,303
and I had no interest
'cause they weren't stylish.

663
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,937
I think this is the way he has this.
We have it?

664
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,346
Maybe I should have
something light on, like this.

665
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,817
You like it?

666
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,318
This all right?

667
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,191
I know Bill Cunningham was a milliner,
and he went under a label William J.

668
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,922
You see, he didn't go...
He went by William.

669
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,497
There, his label.

670
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,692
Actually, I've seen a few of his hats
at F.I.T. At an exhibit.

671
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,565
<i>They were quite beautiful.</i>

672
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,299
<i>That's what we have in common, also, that
he used to see me on the street in hats.</i>

673
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,276
<i>Well, I did the little trick.</i>

674
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,644
<i>I put my hat in front of my face,
and I changed hats.</i>

675
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,944
It's just, so it's not so blatant.

676
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,918
It doesn't... It doesn't break the line.

677
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:22,482
<i>And that's how I put on hats
when I'm in public.</i>

678
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,992
<i>I love this little bowler.</i>

679
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,689
I feel like Mr.
Peanut in this little bowler.

680
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,493
It's kind of a different silhouette for me.

681
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,828
It's very Mr. Peanut.

682
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,870
Do you like this one?

683
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,873
Do you want the same fur?

684
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,511
Do you like it that way
or do you like it hanging?

685
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,881
My friend Ray Solowinski
on the eighth floor was a photographer,

686
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,855
and he had the studio
where Caruso made his first recordings.

687
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,825
Marlon Brando had
his studio here.

688
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,452
Mrs. Sherman, no lipstick.

689
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,655
Yes, I know.

690
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,858
It doesn't go with that costume.
Well...

691
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,197
Do you have
any funny stories... Yeah!

692
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,066
Like about the three of you?
About living in Carnegie?

693
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,605
Yes. Oh, definitely.

694
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,403
Sherman...
Sherman was the centerpiece.

695
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,205
It had always been her hobby.

696
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,040
She was self-taught,

697
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:21,881
and she danced to the music
of the dying swan.

698
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,149
<i>Whose music is the dying...
Oh, it was The Carnival of the Animals.</i>

699
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,280
Yes.

700
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,755
You know how that goes.

701
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,851
# Da, da, da, dee, da, da, da #

702
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,271
<i>We'd never seen
anything like this in our lives.</i>

703
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:48,107
<i>But Editta would turn off all the lights
, and on the night of a full moon...</i>

704
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,373
<i>the moon would come
through those skylights...</i>

705
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,609
<i>Editta would come out
and do the dying swan.</i>

706
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,447
<i>We were all mesmerized by that.</i>

707
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,391
<i>Someone like Editta Sherman...</i>

708
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:13,232
<i>She's married to the studio and her
craft, and that's her life.</i>

709
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:17,637
<i>And to extract her
out of this environment is...</i>

710
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,643
<i>That feels criminal to me because she's
an artist who works in this environment,</i>

711
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,975
<i>and it's because of this environment
she does what she does.</i>

712
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,140
<i>And it's true of a lot
of the other tenants.</i>

713
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,711
<i>So... to sort of displace them
at this stage in their lives,</i>

714
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,020
<i>into some sort of anonymous apartment
is just, you know, I think,</i>

715
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,754
<i>would be the beginning of the end
for a lot of these tenants.</i>

716
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,498
Is it sad for you? They're going to
relocate us in the neighborhood.

717
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,765
So you're not worried... It'll be an
apartment with a kitchen and a bathroom.

718
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,238
Who the hell wants a kitchen
and a bathroom?

719
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,332
Mmm.
Just more rooms to clean.

720
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,173
Can you see one of
these fancy apartment houses...

721
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,339
where all they move in are filing cabinets?

722
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,512
I'm not gonna worry.
I have more fun going out and photographing.

723
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,748
<i>I suppose it'll bother me at
the time, but so what?</i>

724
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,790
<i>Inconvenient but otherwise...</i>

725
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,918
<i>You can't interrupt your life
with that nonsense.</i>

726
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,463
Psst! Psst!

727
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,497
- Look at Veronica!
- Bill, a hug.

728
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,940
Hello child. My...

729
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,671
The diamonds have gotten bigger.
Right?

730
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,246
And, of course...

731
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,009
Now that they make them at Club Monaco,
they get bigger and bigger.

732
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,085
And, of course, they're all real.

733
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,482
Yes.
Absolutely.

734
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,714
In someone's mind.

735
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:43,987
Bill, this gentleman here in the
velvet blazer straight ahead of you...

736
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,358
is David Koch,
who we're honoring tonight.

737
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,930
<i>Oh, I know him, yeah.</i>

738
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,795
<i>I've never had
an experience like this Bill.</i>

739
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,959
I'm kind of over the moon about
it, you know? Good. Good.

740
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,560
Enjoy it. My head is spinning.
Well, you should be.

741
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,732
<i>"Evening Hours"documents
, perhaps to some, simply parties...</i>

742
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,469
<i>and the people who go to them,
but really, what it's about...</i>

743
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,139
are the amazing connections
people have in this city...

744
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,716
with each other, with the
various organizations...

745
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,752
they think are important,
with the people who they honor,

746
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,684
<i>and Bill really chronicles that.</i>

747
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:15,555
This is Karole Armitage.
She has a dance company in New York.

748
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,786
You have to come
take pictures of my gala.

749
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,591
We need you.

750
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:24,259
Remind me. Have someone at your place
send a postcard. Okay, I will.

751
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,098
No formality.
Just send me something in the mail.

752
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,970
These are all the ones
I couldn't get to last week.

753
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,011
You know, you simply can't get involved
in all of these things. It's...

754
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,409
I used to try.

755
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,916
This one I might go to, but I just don't know.
The security could be so awful.

756
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,953
<i>First, I select a charity
that will do the most good.</i>

757
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,615
<i>Never looking at a guest list. As a
matter of fact, people call up and say,</i>

758
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,956
<i>"Well, this one's coming or that one.
" I say, "Don't bother even telling me,</i>

759
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,586
<i>and don't bother sending a guest list
'cause I'm not interested. "</i>

760
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,064
"The Queen of Sweden,
the Queen of Jordan,

761
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,794
their Royal Highnesses"...

762
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,427
and, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

763
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:06,441
<i>I'm interested in what the charity does,
and that's why the Times is there.</i>

764
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,010
<i>It really is that way.</i>

765
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,138
<i>People find it hard to believe. They
think it's a society column.</i>

766
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,715
<i>It's not at all.</i>

767
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,613
<i>It never was meant to be.</i>

768
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,516
<i>There was a magazine.
It's now deceased.</i>

769
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,919
They had a headline...

770
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,551
The best magazine
title I've ever seen.

771
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,754
<i>"You went out last night.</i>

772
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,330
<i>Nobody wrote about it.</i>

773
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,023
<i>Do you exist?"</i>

774
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,067
<i>Now that's...</i>

775
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,569
<i>That's the frame of mind that
a lot of people got caught up in.</i>

776
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,005
You kids print your names for me.
Where's it gonna be? Where's our picture gonna be?

777
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,735
<i>He's New York Times.
Oh.</i>

778
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,812
<i>The Times have a little benefit page.
It's small stuff.</i>

779
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,073
We gotta be in it.
Unimportant.

780
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,409
We're pretty
good-looking people.

781
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,245
Yeah. That's what I thought.

782
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,319
New York is about status.

783
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,251
That's all it's about.

784
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,348
There is...
This is not a pleasant city to live in,

785
00:44:55,459 --> 00:45:01,659
aside from the fact that there are a lot
of people, uh, here who are ambitious.

786
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,565
<i>People are very pushy
socially in New York,</i>

787
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,603
<i>but they don't wave a flag.</i>

788
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,003
<i>They just move in the
right direction.</i>

789
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,940
<i>The right direction is toward
Bill Cunningham's camera.</i>

790
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,705
<i>I don't think that Bill
considers himself a social arbiter.</i>

791
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,580
<i>I really don't consider him as being someone who
gets a lift out of being with these people.</i>

792
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,214
Yeah, that's it! Yeah.

793
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,982
That's... That's the way.

794
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,921
Yeah, it's a nice expression.

795
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,289
None of this stiff stuff.

796
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,124
You caught us napping.
I get that with the benefactors up there.

797
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,357
How you doing today there?
Okay, kid.

798
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,127
<i>There's a little fish in the back.</i>

799
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,930
Would they bring you some fish
over to the other side?

800
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,698
Oh, no. I don't want anything.
Are you sure?

801
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,432
Oh, yeah. I eat with my eyes.

802
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,373
Yeah, I know, but you need
to keep your body up too.

803
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,275
Hmm? You won't let me
get you a little plate?

804
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,176
Oh, no. No, thank you, Mary.

805
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,612
Nobody would see you.

806
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,344
No. Thank you, child.
Okay.

807
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,285
<i>A lot of people
think it's a little peculiar...</i>

808
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,255
<i>that I never have a drink
or something like that,</i>

809
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,155
<i>but I made up my mind...</i>

810
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,727
<i>Oh, at Women's Wear.</i>

811
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,296
<i>People were always wining
and dining you,</i>

812
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,560
<i>and I thought,
"Well, I'm not into that."</i>

813
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,569
<i>I'm there just to
report for the Times.</i>

814
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,400
<i>I'm not there to be wined and dined,</i>

815
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,806
<i>and I certainly wouldn't compromise
the Times,</i>

816
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,003
<i>so I made up my mind
at that point...</i>

817
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,342
<i>I wouldn't take even
a glass of water.</i>

818
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,145
<i>I have something to eat
before I go to work, and that's it.</i>

819
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,219
<i>Period.</i>

820
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:34,518
<i>It's keeping a distance from what you're
doing, so you can be more objective.</i>

821
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,855
<i>Objective over what, I don't know,</i>

822
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,054
<i>but, uh, it works for me.</i>

823
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:45,701
New York society
becomes harder and harder to define.

824
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,430
The latest definition...

825
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:51,030
<i>is everything from the girls
who smile for party pictures...</i>

826
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,972
<i>to the old WASPs.</i>

827
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,772
He loves, like, an old, stylish gal.

828
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,439
<i>Come on.
He loves an old, stylish gal.</i>

829
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,380
<i>And they all love him.</i>

830
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,112
<i>That's why I think...
I don't know the history of Bill,</i>

831
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,519
<i>but we suspected that there was some
kind of society connection with Bill,</i>

832
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,524
<i>because he also felt as comfortable
with Lady Astor,</i>

833
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,651
<i>and he knew all those people.</i>

834
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,286
I'm David Rockefeller.
William Astor.

835
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,058
You look marvelous indeed.

836
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:20,228
Isn't that nice? When you think of all
that's going on, that they came tonight?

837
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,362
Why are you not making peace?

838
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,736
Hello, Bill.
Come with me.

839
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,869
<i>Brooke Astor...
Someone like that is a rarity.</i>

840
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,574
<i>She had such a human touch,
a correctness, about her,</i>

841
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,651
<i>but not in a stuffed-shirt way.</i>

842
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,742
<i>She immediately
made people feel at ease.</i>

843
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,621
<i>She believed not in exclusion,
but inclusion.</i>

844
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,693
<i>We're all the same.
We all have the same problems.</i>

845
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,457
<i>We all have family members
that are whatever the hell it is.</i>

846
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,692
I've loved and admired
my mother...

847
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,463
for more than
three-quarters of a century.

848
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,662
Let's all toast to my mother,

849
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,209
who was born,
not only on the 30th of March,

850
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,337
but in 1902,
the 30th of March was Easter Day.

851
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:10,614
Mrs. Astor represented some timeless
sense of style and elegance...

852
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,313
and philanthropy...

853
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,686
and doing the right thing.

854
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,591
I really am not so extraordinary.

855
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:24,031
I'm just an ordinary person
who has had a very good life...

856
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,626
and is very near...
and it is getting very near to the end.

857
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,036
And I've had a wonderful time.

858
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,404
<i>You've all really been so sweet.</i>

859
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,273
<i>I think it was
impossible not to admire her.</i>

860
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,973
They became really very close friends.

861
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,050
<i>And he did chronicle
her every single move.</i>

862
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:45,588
<i>It was with a genuine kindness and
affection, and he protected her.</i>

863
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,419
<i>To the very end
they were great friends.</i>

864
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,255
I'm guessing...

865
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:55,525
that he might actually have come
from a wealthy family because of that,

866
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:59,591
and because only people who come from
wealth can live the way he lives.

867
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,103
<i>So that's always been my assumption,</i>

868
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,140
<i>but I've actually never discussed it
with him.</i>

869
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,183
<i>About ten years ago
, I was sitting outside...</i>

870
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,913
<i>downtown at a restaurant,</i>

871
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,650
and it must have been 11 o'clock at night.

872
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,921
And all of a sudden,
there goes Bill Cunningham on his bike.

873
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:31,399
I thought, "Oh, I want to say hello,"
but he was gone in a fleeting moment.

874
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,699
And all I could see was his blue coat
and the bike go by.

875
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,535
<i>And I knew where he was headed.</i>

876
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,609
<i>He goes to many events
in one evening.</i>

877
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,678
<i>He's in one event uptown,</i>

878
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,643
<i>and he's downtown at another event.</i>

879
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:47,274
<i>It's rigorous work.</i>

880
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,455
This is too early to be
at one of these downtown parties.

881
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,525
We're the only ones here. Bill's
gonna be here for five minutes and leave.

882
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,758
Big smiles.
Come on, Annie!

883
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,391
<i>Beautiful, guys.</i>

884
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,660
That's a classic Schwinn.

885
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,395
Someone gave it to me.

886
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,028
That's my 29th.
Wonderful.

887
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,801
I've had 28 stolen.

888
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,273
28 stolen bikes?

889
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,004
Yeah. That's the 29th.

890
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,774
Oh, my goodness, the kids are all here.

891
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:21,248
The kids are here.
I came out from L.A. With Annie.

892
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,252
Oh, how wonderful.
She's ensconced down there.

893
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,288
Oh, aren't you kids beautiful?
Look at you.

894
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,517
"You kids." Never changes.

895
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,650
Look at you two kids.
You gonna take?

896
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,092
Yes.
Of us?

897
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,164
Yes. In basic black? Are you kidding?

898
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,829
A very special one too. Yes.

899
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,165
<i>Bill is a true egalitarian.</i>

900
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:49,541
However, that doesn't mean
he isn't aware of the nuances...

901
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:53,377
of cultural division and hierarchies.

902
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,508
<i>He just treats it all the same.</i>

903
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,610
<i>He really is the person who,</i>

904
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,552
<i>whether you're a bicycle messenger,</i>

905
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,183
<i>a woman who's breaking
the glass ceiling on Wall Street,</i>

906
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,727
<i>a socialite in New York...</i>

907
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:09,458
<i>who's an up-and-comer
and part of nouvelle society,</i>

908
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,228
<i>or an old Dutch or German family...</i>

909
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:17,739
<i>that is still in the last phases
of its denouement in Newport...</i>

910
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,138
<i>He doesn't care.</i>

911
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:24,737
<i>It's all, for him, the huge variety
of life in New York City.</i>

912
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,611
When was the first
time Bill photographed you?

913
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,651
<i>In 1986,
and the Times said...</i>

914
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,722
He came to me the next week and
he said, "I'm so disappointed.

915
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,759
<i>The Times said we can't put you in
because you're wearing a dress."</i>

916
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,261
And he said, "But I'm going
to keep trying to get you in."

917
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,194
And I was like, "What the hell?

918
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,860
I'm wearing a pair
of workman's boots with that dress."

919
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:50,269
And he said, "I know Kenny,
but they won't put you in, but I'm trying."

920
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,933
And now, they put everything in.

921
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:56,206
<i>He's such a maverick.
Really a maverick.</i>

922
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,804
<i>He means so much to people like us.
Really.</i>

923
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,406
He's an artist.

924
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,815
We'll talk.

925
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,615
You have two choices.

926
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,845
You can either have Jon Bon Jovi
give you the welcoming remarks...

927
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,580
and me doing the singing...

928
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,155
Or the reverse.

929
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,385
Seriously, this is one
of the great jewels of New York.

930
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,961
It is great for the economy of this city.

931
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,724
It is great for the education of our kids.

932
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,459
It is great for everybody.

933
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:55,197
So you have a great evening tonight,
and thank you for all you're doing.

934
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,206
Thank you for your support
of this wonderful museum. God bless.

935
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,774
That's why I was going up with it.

936
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,275
Yes, like that. Yeah. That's nice.

937
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,245
Now let's put this one, a single
picture party, right in here.

938
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,374
Put this one down at the bottom,
this party, and put this one above it.

939
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,451
We'll see. We'll just...

940
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,953
Just put it on. Stop your antics.

941
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,523
Put it up there.

942
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,095
Damn you kids!

943
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,256
I love this one. Scientists.

944
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,130
He must be quite a jokester.

945
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,636
He's a Nobel laureate
and so forth,

946
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,070
and he's teasing
the other scientist.

947
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,234
Look at this beautiful child,
but we have no room for her.

948
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,073
I think we need
someone new, young.

949
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,012
I didn't know who she was.
Just, I liked the way she looked.

950
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,878
The dress is terrific.

951
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:17,181
Asymmetric on the bias.
You never see that.

952
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:21,223
And it's not a model. That's a private
person that brought their own clothes.

953
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:24,191
I have the most beautiful
picture of Mrs. Bass.

954
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,819
She looks like
a John Singer Sargent portrait.

955
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,297
A what?
Absolutely ravishing.

956
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,702
Except, she's got a modesty bib
filling in the V-neckline.

957
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,365
What a crime.
That should have been...

958
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,966
I'm sure the dressmaker got timid.

959
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,544
You know, to fill it.

960
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,080
Isn't that a shame?
It should have been left open.

961
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,240
Look how elegant she is.
Oh, yeah.

962
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,318
Oh. That woman is amazing.

963
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,752
Uh, wasn't she in last week?
No. No.

964
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,348
Oh, no, you don't cut her arms.
Are you crazed?

965
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,689
Well, excuse me.
Keep her hands in.

966
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,263
My God, John.
Where's your sensitivity?

967
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,333
I mean, she's probably
the most elegant woman,

968
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,267
or one of the most elegant women,
in New York.

969
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,134
Oh, you wouldn't know.
What am I talking to you about that stuff?

970
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,535
You're a lumberjack,
and here I'm talking dresses to you.

971
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:19,013
Are you talking to me?
I was completely ignoring you all that time.

972
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,687
Oh! Now stop it.

973
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,314
Turn that damn thing off.

974
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,189
Bill, we're gonna hound you.
We're gonna hound you.

975
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,024
You've already done that.
Now stop it.

976
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,293
These guys are tough as nails.
They think they're taking over.

977
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,391
They're not taking over.
We're not.

978
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,527
I got news for them.
Yeah.

979
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:49,409
These jerks think
they're going to follow me to Paris.

980
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,070
Who are they kidding?

981
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,048
We are.
No, you're not.

982
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,429
<i>I didn't get to Paris till 1951.</i>

983
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:23,077
<i>I was stationed
in the southwest of France.</i>

984
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,840
<i>I'd take the train up to Paris.</i>

985
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,917
<i>Of course,
it was very different from today.</i>

986
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,918
<i>They were only couture houses.</i>

987
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:39,959
<i>They were clothes
that gave women enormous security...</i>

988
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,396
<i>through the elegance of cut
and taste and refinement.</i>

989
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,695
<i>There was nothing
frivolous about them.</i>

990
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,278
<i>You see, when I began in the '40s,</i>

991
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,820
<i>there were no photographers
at fashion shows.</i>

992
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,585
<i>What the fashion houses had to do
was take their own photographs...</i>

993
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,788
<i>and bring them to the editors
to select something.</i>

994
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:18,129
Then the ready-to-wear
came into existence in the...

995
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:24,298
in the end of the '60s,
beginning of the '70s, very slowly.

996
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,807
<i>At Saint Laurent's
first ready-to-wear show,</i>

997
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:31,279
<i>I think there were maybe myself,
and maybe a Vogue photographer.</i>

998
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:35,579
<i>I mean, it didn't have this
fanatic following that it has now...</i>

999
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,917
<i>of all these manufacturers and people
that just would kill to get in...</i>

1000
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:44,119
<i>because they need to steal ideas
for their own work.</i>

1001
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:49,020
<i>So they let Paris
be the laboratory of ideas.</i>

1002
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,831
The press entrance is that way,
so you have to ask them, unfortunately.

1003
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,569
Nikki, should we go...
Just one person, huh?

1004
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,514
Oh.

1005
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:11,451
Nikki, um, I'll see you later.

1006
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,024
<i>Looking at these collections,</i>

1007
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,123
<i>I look for what I think
a woman could wear, would wear,</i>

1008
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,261
<i>and whether it would fit
a human body,</i>

1009
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:29,838
<i>other than the model.</i>

1010
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,406
<i>I'm very attuned to that.</i>

1011
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,068
<i>If it isn't something a woman could
wear, I have no interest in it.</i>

1012
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,907
I've watched Bill photograph
from the front row,

1013
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,074
and you can see when the camera goes up
or the camera stays down.

1014
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,175
<i>And he's very opinionated.</i>

1015
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,811
He does not applaud
everyone.

1016
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,787
He knows
what's innovative...

1017
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,052
<i>and what's borrowed or copied.</i>

1018
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,960
<i>He knows if he sees someone, you know
, putting something on a runway...</i>

1019
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,032
<i>if it was done, like,
30 years before.</i>

1020
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,192
And so he would pull it up.

1021
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,203
<i>Thirty years before,
and he'd show the picture and...</i>

1022
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,706
<i>I mean, he got...
Designers would be devastated.</i>

1023
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,038
He once did that with Isaac Mizrahi.
He pulled up a Geoffrey Beene...

1024
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,510
<i>from like five years before
or something,</i>

1025
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,844
<i>and Isaac was so mad, and even Geoffrey
Beene, I think, got mad at Isaac.</i>

1026
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,044
<i>You know, it was like
he would definitely start trouble.</i>

1027
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,121
Not on purpose, but he would do...

1028
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,953
He would definitely, like, point out,
like, if he saw something, he'd call it.

1029
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,397
<i>The photographers at the
shows, they're all in the back,</i>

1030
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,163
<i>so they get a clear photograph
with nothing disturbing.</i>

1031
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,135
<i>They get a plain wall.
It's all fine.</i>

1032
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,366
<i>But they're getting
everything straight on.</i>

1033
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,533
<i>Well, fashion's not that way.</i>

1034
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:46,309
<i>You have to know in an instant, "Oh, the
angle is this, and the detail is that. "</i>

1035
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,883
<i>And it's not straight on.</i>

1036
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:52,512
<i>I just like it on the side, so I
can get a front, a back, a profile...</i>

1037
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,317
<i>or hopefully.</i>

1038
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,621
<i>Most of the time I
miss it, but I try.</i>

1039
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,958
<i>#I hear Jerusalem
bells are ringing #</i>

1040
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,500
<i>#Roman cavalry choirs are singing #</i>

1041
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,934
<i>#Be my mirror, my sword and shield #</i>

1042
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,734
<i>#My missionaries in
a foreign field #</i>

1043
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,901
<i>#For some reason I can't explain #</i>

1044
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:21,644
<i>#Once you go there was never,
never an honest word #</i>

1045
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,346
<i>#And that was when I
ruled the world ##</i>

1046
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,482
The wider world
that perceives fashion as a...

1047
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,060
sometimes a frivolity
that should be done away with...

1048
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:38,566
in the face of social upheavals
and problems that are enormous...

1049
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:42,695
The point is, in fact, that fashion...

1050
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,608
Um...

1051
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,506
You know, in point of fact,

1052
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:54,640
it's the armor to survive
the reality of everyday life.

1053
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,548
I don't think you could do away with it.

1054
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,121
It would be like doing
away with civilization.

1055
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,053
You know, l... That's what I think.

1056
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,217
I mean, a lot of people think
"He's a crazy fanatic," you know.

1057
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,592
<i>At any rate,
that's what I think about it.</i>

1058
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,126
How is it different
shooting here than in New York?

1059
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,866
Fashion week here is exceptional.

1060
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,441
Why?

1061
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,772
It educates the eye.

1062
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,345
Paris?

1063
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,143
That's right. That's really...

1064
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,911
I come for the fashion,
but that's what happens.

1065
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:32,454
Every six months
it's like going to school.

1066
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,854
You have to go back
and reeducate the eye.

1067
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,218
You couldn't take me
to a fine restaurant.

1068
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,392
So you don't care about food?
No.

1069
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,469
Really?
Oh, no, no.

1070
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,128
Do you listen to music?

1071
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:54,403
I used to go to concerts here,
in the churches and the opera.

1072
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,637
But that stopped years ago.

1073
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,577
There's no time.
Yeah, sure.

1074
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,309
Right.

1075
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:05,148
I mean, if I'm lucky I get to
church on Sunday.

1076
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,348
That's where I hear the music. Really?
You go to church to hear the music?

1077
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,323
Do you go to church?
Yeah.

1078
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,450
Every Sunday?
Yeah.

1079
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,550
Really?

1080
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,633
It's no big deal.

1081
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,603
I go and repent.

1082
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:37,375
And you see all the paparazzi
going crazy? Oh, yeah.

1083
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,955
Over Catherine Denueve.

1084
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,923
<i>I can hear people say, "He's
gotta be the dumbest one in the crowd.</i>

1085
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,492
<i>He didn't bother
photographing her. "</i>

1086
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,152
<i>Well, she wasn't wearing
anything interesting.</i>

1087
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,923
<i>I'm interested in clothes.</i>

1088
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,760
<i>And even if I knew them, knew who
they were, and usually I don't,</i>

1089
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,961
<i>I don't go to the movies much
and I've never owned television.</i>

1090
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,598
<i>I'd never be a paparazzi.
I couldn't be.</i>

1091
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,734
<i>To torment people and chase them...
Oh, that I couldn't do. I wouldn't do.</i>

1092
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,143
<i>I think it has to be done
just discreetly and quietly.</i>

1093
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,512
<i>"Invisible,"I think, is the word.</i>

1094
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:17,188
This is the greatest subject
in all of Europe... Madame Piaggi.

1095
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,193
<i>C'est le video
The New York Times.</i>

1096
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,353
Yeah, I know.

1097
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,263
The pumps. I don't like them
on me, but it's good on her.

1098
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,935
When did he first photograph you?

1099
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,266
Uh, in the '70s.

1100
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:33,001
<i>I photographed her
outside Saint Laurent's couture show,</i>

1101
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:37,512
<i>mixed in with all the other women that were
trying to be so chic with their pantsuits.</i>

1102
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,513
<i>It was a revelation.</i>

1103
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,640
<i>I mean, I never saw anyone like her.</i>

1104
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,549
<i>I think she's a poet with clothes.</i>

1105
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,815
<i>But a very fine poet.</i>

1106
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,982
<i>Oh, my God, I wouldn't miss her.</i>

1107
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,718
<i>To me, that's the
reason to go to Paris.</i>

1108
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:55,890
<i>I mean, I just like fashion
as an art form of dressing the body.</i>

1109
01:03:55,998 --> 01:04:00,799
If we all went out looking like a slob like
me, it would be a pretty dreary world.

1110
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,667
No, see, I think Bill is very stylish.

1111
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,866
He has a look. It's individual.

1112
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,909
It's Bill... the blue smock.

1113
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,104
The jacket is functional 'cause
it has all the pockets. Right.

1114
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,841
And you can launder it.

1115
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,780
<i>And I thought the color was nice.</i>

1116
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:21,313
<i>Originally, when I started to buy them
at the Bazar de L'Hotel de Ville,</i>

1117
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,221
<i>they were $20.</i>

1118
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:27,820
<i>And they were the ones
that the street sweepers wore.</i>

1119
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,990
<i>They came in black
and white and blue.</i>

1120
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,568
<i>And, you see, with the cameras,</i>

1121
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:37,469
the jackets all get torn here and ruined.

1122
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,406
So that was another thing.

1123
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,706
<i>Why have an expensive,
beautiful jacket...</i>

1124
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:47,544
<i>and wear it with all the cameras
rubbing on it and wreck it?</i>

1125
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,518
<i>I mean,
I can't imagine such wastefulness.</i>

1126
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,590
Oh, don't mind me. These are my...

1127
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,058
I have to take every morning
my heart pills.

1128
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,460
Keep the heart going.

1129
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:10,863
This would be an upscale French
café for me. Oh, really?

1130
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,440
Not...

1131
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,578
Not terribly upscale, but upscale.

1132
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,014
I like very simple,
down-to-earth, basic things.

1133
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,177
You know, I don't like anything fancy.

1134
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,812
And of course, I suppose that's such
a contradiction. Well, exactly.

1135
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,517
Here I love all these women
dressed up in all these...

1136
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,056
But I don't mind it. L...

1137
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,825
What other people do
doesn't concern me.

1138
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,730
It's just not my interest.

1139
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,098
Tell me something about your family.

1140
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,171
Oh, my family's
just working-class people.

1141
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,571
<i>Just marvelous, normal,
hardworking people.</i>

1142
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,234
<i>And Catholic people.</i>

1143
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:53,247
I think I have, uh, half and half.

1144
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:56,876
When I'm outgoing,
I guess I'm my dad.

1145
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:02,652
And when I'm... uptight you'd call
it now, or whatever you call it,

1146
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,488
uh, I'd be definitely my mother.

1147
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,721
What does your family
think of what you do?

1148
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,730
No one ever said anything about it,

1149
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,528
but I think in years, in retrospect...

1150
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,626
'cause I never thought about it...

1151
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:19,640
they didn't think fashion
was a very manly pursuit,

1152
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,006
or profession, for a man, you know.

1153
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,840
So it was that kind of thing.
Right.

1154
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,146
Whatever.

1155
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,049
Do you feel honored to be getting
this award from the French?

1156
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,785
Oh, it's very lovely of them.

1157
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,827
It's exciting.

1158
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,556
I don't know
why they're doing it, frankly.

1159
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,996
Oh, come on, are you kidding?

1160
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,398
'Cause you live long enough to hang around?
Are you kidding?

1161
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,960
Congratulations.
Oh, Daphne! Oh, child!

1162
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,973
It's you they should be honoring, not me.

1163
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,339
<i>Merci.</i>

1164
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:58,607
It should be Jean Luc.
He's the one they should be honoring.

1165
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,182
No. Yes!

1166
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,148
He doesn't want
to be honored.

1167
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,880
He doesn't want
anything.

1168
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:09,014
And I'm amazed
he accepted tonight.

1169
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:14,358
<i>He's not only Chevalier, but directly
Officer, which is exceptional.</i>

1170
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:19,366
Very deeply, I think
he doesn't believe he deserves it.

1171
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:23,234
That's why he deserves it... even more.

1172
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:34,012
I just think it's so funny
that you're working at your own party.

1173
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,778
My dear, it's not work.
It's pleasure.

1174
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,410
You know, you're right, but still.

1175
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,352
You think I'm gonna miss
a good picture?

1176
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,025
Are you still living in Carnegie Hall?
Yeah.

1177
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,993
In the same studio?
Yeah. Yeah.

1178
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,064
Okay.

1179
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,030
They're going to throw me
out eventually. Oh, God.

1180
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:54,261
No, no, no.
Either that or I go out in a coffin.

1181
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,304
Who knows? Who cares?

1182
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,768
<i>Bonsoir, madame.</i>

1183
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,437
Congratulations.

1184
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,202
When I photograph...

1185
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,141
But that's what we're here for.

1186
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:19,715
I'm not interested in the celebrities,
with their free dresses.

1187
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,655
<i>That's...
C'est pas important.</i>

1188
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,461
At least look at the clothes.

1189
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,563
It's the clothes,

1190
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,230
not the celebrity,
and not the spectacle.

1191
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:42,140
It's as true today as it ever was.

1192
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,906
He who seeks beauty...

1193
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,879
Will find it.

1194
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:06,127
<i>We cannot base New
York City's entire economy...</i>

1195
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,533
<i>on Wall Street and real estate.</i>

1196
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:15,736
<i>It's a rally to save, or protect, the
garment industry from disappearing.</i>

1197
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,812
But I'm afraid it's too late.

1198
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:19,210
Uh...

1199
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,910
All the jobbers are gone.
They've all more or less moved out.

1200
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:27,045
<i>90-95%
of the clothes Americans wear...</i>

1201
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,989
<i>are made outside of America.</i>

1202
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,889
Michael!

1203
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,693
Mr. Cunningham, they
would like you up there.

1204
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,095
How are you?
Great. Good.

1205
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,325
You?
Good to see you.

1206
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,799
Good.

1207
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,392
I'm hanging out
behind the scenes.

1208
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:44,063
I think I'll take one of those pea coats.
Made in America?

1209
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,107
Get ready for the best part
of the pea coat.

1210
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,403
Cashmere and neoprene.
Oh, too rich for me.

1211
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:56,247
David Wolfson is one of the last..."jobbers"?
What do you call yourself, David?

1212
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:59,219
Oh, contractor. Contractor.
Excuse me. I'll get it straight.

1213
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:04,258
There were thousands of them 30 years ago,
and there's now maybe 45.

1214
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,225
You know? Yeah.

1215
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,858
Oh, look at this.

1216
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:37,251
This would fit the bill
of the measurements...

1217
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,988
of what Carnegie Hall said we were
entitled to or not to?

1218
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,656
Yes.
Yeah.

1219
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,261
Well, it would be nice if I had
clothes to hang here.

1220
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,566
But it's beautiful,
with the whole wall of windows,

1221
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,938
and the windowed kitchen
facing the park.

1222
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,206
That's an embarrassment,
isn't it?

1223
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,696
Uh, where's the next one?

1224
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:22,828
The next one is on the 14th floor.

1225
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,033
Here we go.

1226
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,076
To your right.

1227
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:37,175
I think... I think you'd like this one...

1228
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,254
as an option.

1229
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,156
Okay.

1230
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,538
Bill, this was the one
that had the dining area...

1231
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,632
My dear, l...
and the bigger kitchen.

1232
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,770
I've never dined in, in my entire life.

1233
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,848
Well, maybe you'll start.

1234
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,247
This seems smaller.

1235
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,410
A little bit.
It could be the lighting.

1236
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,147
Yes.
Yeah.

1237
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,722
Yeah, the view.

1238
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:24,556
I appreciate your time, and I'll try
not to take more of it, you know?

1239
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,100
You take as long as you need.
Well, yeah.

1240
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,106
If you take one of these
apartments, when are you going to move?

1241
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,382
What do you do with bicycles?
I don't know.

1242
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,478
<i>So I'm going to ask
you two very personal questions...</i>

1243
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,241
<i>you may or may not want to answer.</i>

1244
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,815
<i>It's completely up to you.</i>

1245
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:19,081
But have you ever had a romantic
relationship in your entire life?

1246
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:24,491
Now, do you want to know
if I'm gay?

1247
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,390
Yes.

1248
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:27,962
Isn't that a riot?

1249
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:32,557
Well, that's probably why the family wanted
to keep me out of the fashion world.

1250
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,829
They wouldn't speak of such a thing.

1251
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,897
No. I haven't.

1252
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:43,034
Never in your entire life?
No. It never occurred to me.

1253
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,238
I guess I just was interested in clothes.

1254
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,781
That's the obsession.

1255
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,852
It's probably a little peculiar.

1256
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:52,818
Is that something you regret?

1257
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,721
No. I wouldn't even think about it.

1258
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,816
No, I don't regret it.

1259
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,020
There was no time.
I was working night and day.

1260
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,120
I mean, I don't know when you'd...

1261
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,132
Uh, no, it was...

1262
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,529
And in my family, uh,

1263
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,907
things like that were never discussed.

1264
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,500
So it never...
It wasn't even in my head or my mind.

1265
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,103
I wouldn't have known a thing about it.

1266
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,681
So they needn't have worried.

1267
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,580
But years later, I surmised...

1268
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:27,587
that that must have been
in the back of their minds.

1269
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,817
And certainly the women
from Chez Ninon.

1270
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,254
You've had good friends.

1271
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,456
You've had good friends.

1272
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:38,965
A few people that I've known.

1273
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,558
Yes. Yeah.

1274
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,331
Uh...

1275
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:45,998
People that... Oh, you mean...
Just friends.

1276
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,906
Oh, Yeah. Yeah.
No, I have friends.

1277
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,377
I mean,
Antonio was a dear friend.

1278
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,005
Oh, Antonio... I love those kids.

1279
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,607
And Suzette.
Yes.

1280
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:01,178
Yeah, they... It's just, I suppose I've...

1281
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,684
I don't know.

1282
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:07,956
You can't be in love with your work,
but I enjoyed it so much that it didn't...

1283
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,156
Yeah.

1284
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,256
But hey, listen, I am human.

1285
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,767
Exactly.

1286
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:19,671
You do have, uh, body urges
or whatever,

1287
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:24,041
but, uh,
you control it as best you can.

1288
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:29,242
And then the other question is...
and again, you don't have to answer this...

1289
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:33,515
but I know that you go to church
every Sunday.

1290
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,419
Oh, yeah.

1291
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,151
And does religion...

1292
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:41,094
Is that an important component
of your life?

1293
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,913
We don't have to talk about this.

1294
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:08,512
Yeah, I think it's a good guidance
in your life.

1295
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:11,783
Uh...

1296
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:19,094
Yeah, it's something I need and, uh...

1297
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,726
Yeah, I guess maybe
it's part of your upbringing.

1298
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,304
I don't know.

1299
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,032
Whatever it is, everyone...

1300
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,305
You do whatever you do
the best you can work things out,

1301
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,346
but yeah.

1302
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:36,374
I find it very important. Yeah.

1303
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,851
For whatever reason.
I don't know.

1304
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,819
As a kid...

1305
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:44,449
I went to church and all I did
was look at women's hats.

1306
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,757
You know.

1307
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:52,129
But later, when you mature,
for different reasons.

1308
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,264
There's nothing worse.
Yes, there is.

1309
01:17:56,371 --> 01:18:00,467
What you're about to go through
is worse than getting a pink slip.

1310
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,736
All right? Are you ready?

1311
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,812
Because it's this way. It's like...

1312
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,642
Oh, my... Surprise!

1313
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:09,546
Happy birthday!

1314
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,447
Look at them all in those jackets!

1315
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,355
How did you do it?

1316
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,485
Spending all that money!
Oh!

1317
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,586
Terrible. That's it.
We're taking you out the back way.

1318
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,461
Look at those kids!

1319
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:35,003
You kids are... You're a riot.

1320
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,544
This old geezer...

1321
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,915
...and we are so delighted...

1322
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,886
to have you as part of our family
and be part of yours.

1323
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:50,014
And... Family? I've fought
with every one of these kids!

1324
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,786
That's family!

1325
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,417
That's right. That's it.

1326
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,995
That's right.

1327
01:18:56,531 --> 01:19:00,331
Gee whiz!
# Happy birthday to you #

1328
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:04,394
# Happy birthday to you #

1329
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:08,374
# Happy birthday, dear Bill #

1330
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:13,414
Well, okay.
# Happy birthday to you ##

1331
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,915
Don't forget to make a wish.
Let's see if I can get it, Melissa.

1332
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,417
This old geezer...

1333
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,818
Okay, kid. You got it.

1334
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,057
Whoo!

1335
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,798
That is really nice.

1336
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,964
Bill, we wrote a...
I wrote a song for you.

1337
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,563
Oh, my God.

1338
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:45,779
# Bill, what's happening
out on the street today? #

1339
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:51,011
# Bill, last night you partied
and now you pay #

1340
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,648
# Bill, your page is late
and you're still out on your bike #

1341
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:01,320
# Hemlines, black ties, fur coats,
pink scarves, sandals #

1342
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,056
#When will you make your mind up? #

1343
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:08,694
# Bill, you can't fit all those pictures
on the page #

1344
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:14,367
# Bill, we're going blind
and we're half your age #

1345
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,376
# Bill #

#Why can't we be like you are #

1347
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:22,210
# Getting your own damn way #

1348
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:27,277
# Oh, Bill, we celebrate you today ##

1349
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,856
<i>Yeah!</i>

1350
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,469
I just try to play a straight game,

1351
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,479
and in New York that's very...
almost impossible.

1352
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,740
To be honest and straight in New York,

1353
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:10,489
that's like Don Quixote fighting windmills.

1354
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,583
Ooh, hoo. Shut up, Cunningham.

1355
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,357
Let's get this thing
on the road and get up and work.

1356
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,064
All right, turn off the cameras.
We've had enough of this.
