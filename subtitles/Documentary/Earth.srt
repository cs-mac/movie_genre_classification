1
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,531
I was eight years old,
living in Lahore in March of 1947,

2
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:31,604
when the British Empire in India
stafted to collapse.

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,576
Along with talks of India's independence
from Britain came rumblings

4
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:42,206
about its division into two countries,
Pakistan and India.

5
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:48,317
Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs who had lived
together as one entity for centuries

6
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:53,155
suddenly stafted to clamor
for pieces of India for themselves.

7
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:56,596
The arbitrary line of division
the British would draw

8
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,189
to carve up India
in August of 1947

9
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:04,293
would scar the Subcontinent forever.

10
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,246
Oh, God!
What have you done, Lenny-baby?

11
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,133
I thought Americans had dropped
another atom bomb.

12
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,329
Yousaf, come and see.

13
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:45,940
What will Madame say?

14
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:48,643
Good God!

15
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:52,778
My sweet!

16
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,754
What's one plate?
Break a hundred.

17
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,841
Nanny.

18
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,248
Madame.

19
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,679
Madame, I've heard before the British
give us independence,

20
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:28,413
they will dig a long canal.

21
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,616
One side, independent India;
one side, Pakistan.

22
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,956
If they want two countries,
that's what they'll do, right, Madame?

23
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,494
What rubbish, Shanta.

24
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:06,123
It's a sin to cut flowers after sunset.
They're sleeping.

25
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,659
Just as well.

26
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,922
Imagine their pain if they're awake.

27
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:14,827
Here, have a roti.

28
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:15,936
No thanks.

29
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,300
Have one;
you need strength

30
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:24,036
to look after that rascal Lenny
and her cousin Adi.

31
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:26,746
He's a terror.

32
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:29,716
Don't be so hard on them.
They're asleep by now.

33
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:41,423
Mr. Singh.
He owns buffaloes.

34
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:44,996
Mrs. Buffalo.

35
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,635
Mr. Rogers, Head of Police.

36
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,569
Shut up, I know.

37
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:08,634
Shut up, you white man!

38
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,745
You son of a fool!

39
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,246
You white monkey!

40
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:43,002
Me too.

41
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,679
Let's go, Masseur.

42
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,917
Come, Lenny-baby, sit.

43
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:42,461
Did you know, Lenny-baby is afraid
of your lion in the zoo?

44
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:43,620
Don't worry Lenny-baby.

45
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:47,825
I'll hold on to his chain real t-t-tight.

46
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:50,562
He won't dare h-h-huft you.

47
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:53,539
Don't be scared.

48
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,036
Nobody lets the lion out of the cage.

49
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:02,706
Besides, the cage is so strong,
even a hundred lions can't break it.

50
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,217
And I feed the lion a juicy goat each day.

51
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,686
So why would he want to eat
a stick like you?

52
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:19,591
Would your face were pockmarked
like the moon.

53
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,564
Stars your gentle beauty would festoon!

54
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,942
In beauty's grindstone,

55
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,640
one grain got stuck.

56
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,512
Why worry, Dil Navaz?

57
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:12,914
The one you love has better luck.

58
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,883
I've invented an oil that grows hair
on bald heads.

59
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:30,826
It has fish and mustard oil, pearl dust,
and many herbs.

60
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,438
Careful, Shanta.

61
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:33,630
It'll grow hair on your fingers.

62
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:34,741
Good God!

63
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:39,602
That's nothing, Hasan.

64
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,340
I've invented a feftility pill.

65
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,050
Really?

66
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:48,955
I'll try it.
I'm not that young anymore.

67
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,683
You idiot, it's not an aphrodisiac.

68
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:54,055
It's a feftility pill for women.

69
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:56,719
But it's so potent
it can make men pregnant.

70
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,465
What's the news
from the Viceroy's house?

71
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:05,264
I've heard Gandhi, Nehru, and Mountbatten
are really tight.

72
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:06,372
Really?

73
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:10,033
If they are that close,
who will champion us Muslims?

74
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,077
And who will help Jinnah Sahib?

75
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,010
Master Tara Singh
and his bleating herd of Sikhs?

76
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:19,915
Dil Navaz, who are you calling
b-b-bleating sheep?

77
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:21,918
Y-y-you!

78
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:25,281
Listen.

79
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,689
Unless you stop talking
about Hindus and Muslims,

80
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,420
I'll stop coming to the park.

81
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:34,058
This is just a discussion amongst friends.

82
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,227
But if you don't like it, we'll stop.

83
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:49,580
Okay, friends, God be with you.

84
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,582
Lenny-baby, you'll get tired.

85
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:00,988
Come ride on my bicycle.

86
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,961
The doctor says she needs exercise.

87
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,587
What does the doctor know?

88
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:07,393
You tired, Lenny-baby?

89
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,024
Ver-r-ry tired.

90
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,645
Listen, Shanta.

91
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,749
In the eyes of God,
we are all equal.

92
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:26,148
You're a Hindu; I'm a Muslim.
What's the difference?

93
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:27,947
Again Hindu-Muslim talk?

94
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,715
We'll stop coming to the park.

95
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:36,762
Now you'd better go.

96
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,797
I have work.

97
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,559
What work?

98
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,634
Washing and ironing

99
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,669
and dusting Madame's room.

100
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:45,931
I'll help.

101
00:13:46,073 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm very good at dusting.

102
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,808
Are you crazy?

103
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,673
Mummy will kick you out
in one minute.

104
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,311
Let me be with you for a while.

105
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:01,477
Okay, but only for ten minutes.

106
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,104
Get lost!

107
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:24,710
You are totally shameless.

108
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,437
Don't be angry.

109
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,842
Go or I'll tell Madame.

110
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,506
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

111
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,447
Why? You'll never change.

112
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:33,985
Why can't you be like the Masseur?

113
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,214
He's such a gentleman.

114
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,323
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

115
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:42,793
Of no use to the world, or to me,

116
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,921
this unfeeling heaft God's given thee.

117
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:50,136
You rascal.

118
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:53,630
What are you doing?

119
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,839
You're so spoiled, if I dropped you,
people would thank me.

120
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:59,969
Put me down, you bastard!

121
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,307
I'm going to drop you on your face!

122
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,713
Someone save me! Help!

123
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,184
Put her down right now!

124
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,312
On one condition:
You have to come to my house,

125
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,220
or I'll drop your Lenny-baby.

126
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,452
Okay, I'll come. Put her down.

127
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,724
And you!

128
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:20,332
Why are you smiling at him?

129
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,456
Is he your hero?

130
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:26,098
Come on, you rascal.

131
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,440
So when are you coming to visit?

132
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,471
What?

133
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,512
Get lost before I beat the hell out of you!

134
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,576
We've come, Ice Candy Man!

135
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,620
Welcome, welcome, happy spring!

136
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:20,622
You're beautiful.

137
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,989
Go on, you flatterer!

138
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:27,861
Come and fly a kite and
celebrate this spring festival.

139
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,832
Forget your creaking bones today.

140
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,460
You fly; I'll watch.

141
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:32,594
Look. Like this?

142
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,229
Careful, Shanta.

143
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,672
Don't break it.

144
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,641
I'll show you how to fly it.

145
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,560
There are many types of kites.

146
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,274
See that one?

147
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,638
That's the king of all kites.

148
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,712
I didn't know you were such an expeft.

149
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,714
It's just a hobby.

150
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,313
Even I want to fly it. Teach me.

151
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:31,558
Not so heaftlessly.

152
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,456
Treat the kite like a lover.

153
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,229
Woo it.

154
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,939
When it acts difficult, let it go.

155
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:45,535
And when you have control,
bring it closer.

156
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,272
Rascal!

157
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,927
Look!

158
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,157
They are going to cut our kite!

159
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,494
No way!

160
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:45,994
Look carefully as I cut their kite.

161
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,777
You've cut it!

162
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,408
What!?

163
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,378
They have to, to survive.

164
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,219
He wouldn't let us enter India.

165
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,330
A bowl of milk with sugar inside.

166
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,638
Sweet but invisible.

167
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,574
Understand?

168
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,162
Papoo, quiet!

169
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,178
Would you like a ride?

170
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:51,585
Yes.

171
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:53,893
But...

172
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:57,519
Sit in front. It's safer.

173
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:58,790
Good God!

174
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:00,899
Please sit.

175
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:15,944
Have a long life, children!

176
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,682
Oh, my back!

177
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,623
I'll help.

178
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,868
Just push the car. Push it!

179
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,345
What are you doing, Papoo?

180
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:50,779
You're a sweeper's daughter.

181
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,817
Finish your own work.

182
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:56,750
Stop hitting her!

183
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,517
Papoo's mother is beating her again.

184
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,724
Is everything okay at work, darling?

185
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:56,347
Did you say that, my sweet?

186
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,350
You should not lie.

187
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:19,164
Long live Pakistan!

188
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,163
Long live Pakistan!

189
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:10,487
Did you go?

190
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,022
Yes.

191
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,356
Did you pee?

192
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,334
The park has really changed.

193
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:27,167
Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs
are keeping to themselves.

194
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:33,041
Only the group around you remains the same.

195
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:35,175
Yes, Shanta.

196
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:41,479
We all hover around you,
like moths around a lamp.

197
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,749
Some moths!

198
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:50,830
You Hindus eat so many beans,
it's not surprising your yogis levitate.

199
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:55,661
They probably faft their way to Heaven.

200
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:09,308
- Can I go?
- Yes, go.

201
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,450
So today he's become Allah's telephone.

202
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,857
Nobody has as many sidelines
as our Dil Navaz.

203
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,219
Thank you, Allah, for letting me
connect your followers to you.

204
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,108
Holy man,

205
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:43,238
we have three daughters.

206
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:47,876
My wife wants to know
if Allah will grant her a son.

207
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:11,603
Seven.

208
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:13,545
Eight.

209
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:15,414
Six.

210
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:17,807
Allah!

211
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,383
Do you hear me?

212
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:22,316
This poor woman wants a son.

213
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:24,389
She has three daughters.

214
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,718
Do you call this justice?

215
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,091
Allah's been very busy lately.

216
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,288
On one side, independence.

217
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,626
On the other side,
Muslims and Hindus fighting.

218
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:37,926
Allah!

219
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,069
There is no limit to your generosity.

220
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,470
For you, this son-less woman
is a queen

221
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:49,446
and will be son-less no more!

222
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:58,390
What happened?

223
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:14,630
Holy man,

224
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,107
telephone Allah and ask him,
after the British divide India,

225
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:20,474
what will happen to us?

226
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:22,671
Sorry, the line is cut off now.

227
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,780
Why is your Allah's line cut off
for the Sikhs?

228
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,944
You idiot, this is a private line.

229
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:31,613
If you want to ask questions,
telephone your own God.

230
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:33,525
Wait a minute.

231
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:35,924
I'll just ask Allah.

232
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,361
Allah, have mercy on us,
have mercy on us.

233
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,626
Allah says,

234
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:47,228
''When the time for division comes,
there is going to be a huge storm,

235
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:50,672
and you will all fight like animals.''

236
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:53,969
I have to go.

237
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,348
I have an appointment
with our Muslim Leader, Jinnah.

238
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,389
Papoo is getting married.

239
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,997
Yes, Janoo.

240
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:15,157
Her Father's arranging her marriage
to a Christian.

241
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,129
Good God, it shouldn't be allowed.

242
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,641
Times are bad.

243
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:27,102
He's becoming a Christian.

244
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:35,480
Anyway, these days, his Hindu Gods
don't count for much in Lahore.

245
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,827
Okay?

246
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,398
Keep the box in your cupboard.

247
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,890
You look lovely.

248
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,534
Give this to Papoo,
not her mother.

249
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,032
Wake up, Papoo.

250
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:47,967
Wake up!

251
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:17,095
Lame-Lenny, will you ever find
a bridegroom?

252
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:19,393
Of course, stupid.

253
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:25,067
Ice Candy Man, Masseur,
Zookeeper, Hari, and even Cousin Adi.

254
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,201
Lenny-baby, come quickly.

255
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:29,143
Papoo's bridegroom is here.

256
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:42,550
Papoo's getting married
to a young boy.

257
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:18,790
In the name of the Father

258
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,594
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

259
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:38,714
Why are they marrying Papoo
to that old man?

260
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,648
Fear is making people do crazy things
these days.

261
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,063
Come here, Chotay!

262
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:28,756
And take Madam's order!

263
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,600
Two rotis, one daal,
one mattar paneer.

264
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,209
And make sure it is hot.

265
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:40,140
And what will Lenny-baby have?

266
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:43,437
Not here.

267
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:45,673
And what's that?

268
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,881
Bloody English pudding.

269
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:53,752
Do you Parsees think
you are English or what?

270
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:55,587
Shame on you!
Leave her alone.

271
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,423
Don't take your anger out
on the child.

272
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:04,261
Why express sorrow?

273
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:06,337
Why cast a tear

274
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:08,702
when stars are so far

275
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,433
but friends are so near?

276
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:14,301
Well said!
Come and eat.

277
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:18,044
Just like a Mughal poet.

278
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,984
Forget the Mughals.
Talk about today.

279
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:28,491
I feel that when the British divide India,
they will give Lahore to Pakistan.

280
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:30,254
There are more Muslims here.

281
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,992
Lahore will stay in India.

282
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:36,464
Hindus own most of the business here.

283
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,868
But Muslims are greater in number here.

284
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,131
So what?

285
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:47,109
People don't matter; money does.

286
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:49,444
Money or no money,

287
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:53,244
we'll put the fear of God
up your Hindu trousers.

288
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:57,188
It might just be the other way around.

289
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,695
Are you stupid?
Do you know what I want?

290
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:11,097
The same?

291
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,636
No, not the same.
Bring me lamb chops.

292
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:15,239
Let him be.

293
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:17,001
You're too soft-heafted, Hasan.

294
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:22,808
Hurry up, or I'll break your legs.

295
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:25,341
W-w-what about us?

296
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,748
We Sikhs own m-more land
than the Hindus or Muslims.

297
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:28,853
Total lies.

298
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,621
Are you calling me a liar?

299
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:33,850
If you want to save your lands,
Sher Singh,

300
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,620
become friends with the Muslims.

301
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:39,822
Even the British say you Sikhs
are a headache,

302
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:41,660
a bloody nuisance.

303
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,030
We think you're bastards as well.

304
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,500
Listen.

305
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,199
Once India is divided,

306
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:52,367
all Muslims left on the wrong side
of the division line

307
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,637
will have their balls cut off.

308
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:55,976
Have you gone mad?

309
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,844
We've lived together like brothers
for centuries.

310
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:01,544
We share the same language,
food, and enemies.

311
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:08,451
The Sikhs are the fighting arm
of the Hindus,

312
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:11,256
and they are ready to use it
against us Muslims.

313
00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:15,331
Behold the fighting arm
of the murderous Sikhs!

314
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,260
Don't fool yourself.

315
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,099
Sikhs have a tradition of violence.

316
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,332
Haven't you seen the paintings
of their Gods?

317
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:26,000
Holding severed heads,
dripping with blood?

318
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:27,304
You sister-fucker!

319
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:36,179
Don't talk rubbish.

320
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:40,018
Our holy Koran lies
in their Golden Temple in Amritsar.

321
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:43,787
The Sikh faith came about to bring Hindus
and Muslims closer.

322
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,462
So why fight amongst friends?

323
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,794
We'll stand by each other,
won't we?

324
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:55,098
Yes, we'll stand by each other.

325
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,170
Won't we, Tota Ramji?

326
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,214
Yes, why not?

327
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,064
Sit, Lenny-baby.

328
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,668
No.

329
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:37,164
Don't go too far.

330
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,339
Refugee camp to the right.

331
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,707
Keep right for the refugee camp.

332
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:04,133
Good afternoon.

333
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,470
Please come in and sit down.

334
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,611
A cup of tea?

335
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:15,014
No, thank you.

336
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:27,056
Even the Malhotras and Guptas have left.

337
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:29,797
When?

338
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:32,994
Two hours ago,

339
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,730
to Amritsar City.

340
00:46:44,649 --> 00:46:46,241
How are you, Jaswant?

341
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:49,549
Good afternoon.

342
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:58,292
Have you heard the news?

343
00:46:59,197 --> 00:47:01,222
Gurdaspur City has been given to India.

344
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:08,996
Playing God under the ceiling fans
of Lahore Hotel.

345
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:31,652
The bastards!

346
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:35,461
They break my country into two pieces

347
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,061
and hand it to us and say,
''Happy Independence.''

348
00:47:59,824 --> 00:48:03,555
Could we leave some of our belongings
with you?

349
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,393
Yes, yes.

350
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:11,424
Bring whatever you want.

351
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:13,764
We'll keep them with the Kapoors' things.

352
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:15,304
Please don't worry.

353
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:27,210
Lenny-dear, go play with Ayah.

354
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:35,644
It's twelve hours late.

355
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:37,220
Any news about the train
from Gurdaspur?

356
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:39,948
Trust in Allah, brother.

357
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:08,939
Today on August 15th,
the eve of India's independence,

358
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:12,736
there are repofts of bloodshed
in Gurdaspur City.

359
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:16,105
That means the Muslims there
are being butchered.

360
00:52:17,882 --> 00:52:20,043
The real bloodshed will staft now.

361
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:24,678
Millions of Hindus will run from Pakistan
and millions of Muslims from Hindustan.

362
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,847
The Apocalypse is here.

363
00:52:27,759 --> 00:52:32,696
Sher Singh, if the situation worsens here,
you can go to Amritsar.

364
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,195
I'm not going anywhere.

365
00:52:34,332 --> 00:52:35,731
Lahore is my home.

366
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:39,302
Whoever must go will go.

367
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:53,879
A train just arrived from Gurdaspur City

368
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:56,748
filled with dead bodies,

369
00:52:56,888 --> 00:52:59,482
all the Muslim men in it butchered,

370
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:04,161
and four sacks filled
with women's breasts.

371
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:09,563
Our Dil Navaz's sisters
were on that train.

372
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:19,402
We now play for you Prime Minister Nehru's
speech given earlier today in New Delhi

373
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:22,240
on the auspicious occasion
of India's independence.

374
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,510
These politicians speak
with such twisted tongues.

375
00:53:56,447 --> 00:54:00,781
Some independence they give us,
soaked in our brothers' blood.

376
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:57,766
Ayah?

377
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:00,571
Yes, Madame?

378
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:04,044
Some of our friends are leaving Lahore
for Amritsar.

379
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:06,411
You have relatives there,
don't you?

380
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:08,651
Yes.

381
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:11,448
Things might get out of control here.

382
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:14,251
We think you should go
with them.

383
00:55:14,392 --> 00:55:16,223
But, Madame,

384
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,124
the Parsees aren't taking sides.

385
00:55:19,263 --> 00:55:21,356
Everyone knows that.

386
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:24,559
As long as I'm with you,
I'm safe.

387
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:29,338
As you wish.

388
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,873
This is your home, Shanta.

389
00:56:09,614 --> 00:56:15,018
Can I ask Ice Candy Man
how his sisters got in the gunny sack?

390
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:17,017
No! Absolutely not!

391
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:34,162
Lenny-baby,
just ask him how he is.

392
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:46,373
Ice Candy Man.

393
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:49,713
Ice Candy Man!

394
00:56:56,861 --> 00:57:01,594
Ice Candy Man, did you see your sisters
in the gunny sack?

395
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:02,960
Keep quiet, Lenny-baby!

396
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:06,728
It's all right.

397
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:09,032
How are you, Dil Navaz?

398
00:57:12,443 --> 00:57:14,502
Are you okay?

399
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,817
That's the Delhi Gateway.

400
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:27,856
That's the Lahori Gateway.

401
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:30,552
And there' s the Mochi Gateway.

402
00:57:32,129 --> 00:57:35,621
Hasan, don't you live there?

403
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:41,033
And that's Shalmi,
where the Hindus live.

404
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:49,336
What are these Sikh fuckers doing here?

405
00:57:51,749 --> 00:57:53,717
Why don't they go to India?

406
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:56,342
It's not so easy to leave one's home.

407
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:42,565
Long live India! Death to Pakistan!

408
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,937
Kill the Muslim bastard!

409
00:59:42,326 --> 00:59:44,521
I shouldn't have brought you here.

410
00:59:44,662 --> 00:59:46,687
I want to go home.

411
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:50,030
Don't worry, Lenny-baby.

412
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:53,102
As soon as things quiet down,
I'll take you home.

413
00:59:58,409 --> 00:59:59,774
Look, The Hindu tenement is burning!

414
01:00:10,454 --> 01:00:13,981
There goes the arsenal
the Hindus had intended to use on us.

415
01:00:24,535 --> 01:00:26,628
Thank God!

416
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:28,829
Where did these bastards come from?

417
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:51,126
They've sprayed the building
with petrol instead of water.

418
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:54,657
Great! The firefighters must
be Muslim.

419
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:14,417
Stay here.
I'll see if I can help.

420
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:01,656
This is not only
about Hindus and Muslims.

421
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:07,330
It's about what's inside us.

422
01:02:09,106 --> 01:02:11,097
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs--

423
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:17,009
we are all bastards,
all animals,

424
01:02:19,283 --> 01:02:23,845
Like the lion in the zoo
that Lenny-baby is so scared of.

425
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:32,491
He just lies there,
waiting for the cage to open.

426
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:36,857
And when it does,

427
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,270
then God help us all.

428
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,046
Marry me.

429
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:57,443
If you are with me,

430
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:03,390
then the animal that's within me
will be controlled.

431
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:17,333
You know how much I love you.

432
01:03:31,055 --> 01:03:34,183
I'll marry you, Ice Candy Man.

433
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:49,933
Let's go.

434
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,894
It's all right, my baby.

435
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:39,415
Are you banishing the demons?

436
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,812
Yes, my darling.

437
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,280
Ayah, sit with her.

438
01:06:33,537 --> 01:06:35,402
Is Lenny all right?

439
01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:37,473
Yes, she's fine.

440
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:40,367
Janoo?

441
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,977
Hmm.

442
01:06:42,112 --> 01:06:43,238
Janoo?

443
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,813
Hmm?

444
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:32,941
Many, many congratulations.

445
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:06,809
The Masseur
can kiss Nanny better.

446
01:10:07,651 --> 01:10:09,585
Come and see the refugees next door.

447
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:13,918
Yousaf says
they're fallen women.

448
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:45,045
Look, fallen women.

449
01:10:51,228 --> 01:10:53,128
You, come here!

450
01:11:03,173 --> 01:11:05,164
Was your mother raped?

451
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,410
When Hindus attacked our village,
they killed everyone.

452
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:14,005
I hid under the dead bodies.

453
01:11:14,718 --> 01:11:17,414
They killed your mother?

454
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:20,049
Yes.

455
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,214
Are you Hindus?

456
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:25,021
No, Parsees.

457
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:29,161
Want to play marbles?

458
01:11:35,338 --> 01:11:40,173
After the Hindus left,
I went to look for my mother.

459
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:42,437
She was in a mosque.

460
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:46,777
Her hair was tied to the ceiling fan.

461
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:49,215
She was naked.

462
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:55,455
It's my bifthday.

463
01:11:55,592 --> 01:11:56,923
Do you want some cake?

464
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,290
Cake? What's that?

465
01:12:12,042 --> 01:12:14,237
Remember Kirpa Ram,

466
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:15,742
that miserly Hindu money-lender?

467
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:20,481
Well, we packed him off to India.

468
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:23,916
You know what we found
hidden in the walls of his house?

469
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:25,684
What?

470
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:27,847
900 gold guineas.

471
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:38,890
Open your hand.

472
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,980
Keep it. It's for you.

473
01:12:59,089 --> 01:13:00,056
No.

474
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:03,559
But I brought it for you.

475
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:04,660
Please keep it.

476
01:13:05,195 --> 01:13:06,685
I don't want it.

477
01:13:16,606 --> 01:13:17,971
Where is Sher Singh?

478
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:20,599
He seems to have disappeared.

479
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:22,609
Who's guarding the lion in the zoo?

480
01:13:23,313 --> 01:13:24,280
Nobody.

481
01:13:26,316 --> 01:13:29,479
After the atrocities the Sikhs committed,
it's good he's left.

482
01:13:30,587 --> 01:13:32,384
Muslim refugees here want revenge.

483
01:13:33,289 --> 01:13:36,053
And you, do you also want revenge?

484
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,423
What's it to you?

485
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:40,222
What kind of Muslim are you?

486
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:42,422
If you want to know, I'll tell you.

487
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:44,760
Yes, I've thrown grenades
at Hindus and Sikhs

488
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:46,596
who I've know all my life.

489
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:50,228
I want to kill someone for each breast
they cut off my sisters.

490
01:13:52,509 --> 01:13:54,067
You're right, brother.

491
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,668
There are some things
that can drive one mad.

492
01:13:59,449 --> 01:14:01,383
God preserve us now.

493
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:06,585
I've sent my family to Delhi,

494
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:09,283
and soon I'll join them.

495
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,585
And you, Hari?

496
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,957
Where will you go?

497
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:22,631
Where can I go?

498
01:14:24,574 --> 01:14:27,566
I'm becoming a Muslim.

499
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:34,039
Good. A number of you Hindus
are convefting.

500
01:14:35,652 --> 01:14:37,347
While you're at it,
change your name.

501
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:46,021
Yes, when our friends want to kill us,
then we have few choices.

502
01:14:49,132 --> 01:14:51,600
I should leave Lahore.

503
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:58,333
Madame says she'll send me
to Amritsar.

504
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:02,840
Maybe that's best for me.

505
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:07,610
You don't have to go anywhere.

506
01:15:08,218 --> 01:15:09,549
Don't worry.

507
01:15:09,686 --> 01:15:11,449
I'm here.

508
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:27,464
Lenny-baby, go to your room.

509
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:54,194
Don't cry, Shanta.

510
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:57,565
Here.

511
01:20:52,295 --> 01:20:54,263
Why don't we get married?

512
01:20:58,034 --> 01:21:00,502
So what if I'm a Muslim?

513
01:21:02,572 --> 01:21:05,803
I'm yours and always will be.

514
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:10,643
Let's go to Amritsar.

515
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,247
I'll become a Hindu.

516
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:15,417
Marry me, Shanta.

517
01:21:19,122 --> 01:21:20,146
Yes.

518
01:22:19,749 --> 01:22:22,809
Sher Singh,
it's me, Hasan.

519
01:22:34,463 --> 01:22:36,795
These days,
one can't be too sure.

520
01:22:38,201 --> 01:22:40,192
I didn't mean to scare you.

521
01:22:41,871 --> 01:22:44,101
It's all right.

522
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,801
Even a sneeze is a cause
for worry these days.

523
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:54,614
I've made arrangements for us
to cross the border to Amritsar.

524
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,149
Will there be any danger?

525
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:57,946
No.

526
01:22:58,087 --> 01:23:02,148
Ahmed Ali is doing good business
hustling Hindus and Sikhs out of Lahore.

527
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,350
He wants money in advance.

528
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:07,360
All of you should get some rest.

529
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:09,726
It's a long journey ahead.

530
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:15,633
Son, what you've done for us,
Have a long life, son.

531
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,932
How can we ever thank you?

532
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,869
Sher Singh is like my brother.

533
01:23:21,711 --> 01:23:24,179
Have a long life, son.

534
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:29,717
May the ten Sikh Gurus bless you
Madame, he's becoming a Hindu.

535
01:24:34,216 --> 01:24:35,581
Madame?

536
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,515
What is it, Shanta?

537
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:42,219
Madame, I'm getting married.

538
01:24:42,925 --> 01:24:44,222
Really?

539
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:46,322
To whom?

540
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:47,895
Dil Navaz, Ice Candy Man?

541
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:51,124
No, no, to Hasan the Masseur.

542
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:54,362
Madame, he's becoming a Hindu.

543
01:24:56,138 --> 01:25:00,438
We'll leave Lahore and go to Amritsar
and get married there.

544
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:02,441
Madame, you're not angry,
are you?

545
01:25:02,578 --> 01:25:05,069
Angry?
No, no, not at all.

546
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:07,546
This is very good news.

547
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:08,809
Does Lenny know?

548
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:10,384
No.

549
01:25:11,087 --> 01:25:12,748
When are you leaving?

550
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:14,947
Hasan says really soon.

551
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:18,060
Don't tell Lenny,
or she'll come in your trousseau!

552
01:25:19,028 --> 01:25:21,553
But Lenny-baby...

553
01:25:21,697 --> 01:25:23,324
Don't worry.

554
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:25,730
I'll take care of everything.

555
01:25:26,836 --> 01:25:28,929
Okay, Madame, I'll go now.

556
01:25:29,071 --> 01:25:31,266
Shanta, wait.

557
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:57,957
Madame, but this is gold.

558
01:25:58,401 --> 01:25:59,993
Keep it carefully.

559
01:26:00,636 --> 01:26:02,467
This is for you too.

560
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:11,346
Make sure Hasan talks with us
before you leave.

561
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:35,088
Hari, why did you cut
your pigtail?

562
01:27:35,898 --> 01:27:37,889
Lenny-baby, don't call me Hari.

563
01:27:38,033 --> 01:27:39,967
My name is Himmat Ali now.

564
01:27:40,102 --> 01:27:41,899
Where is Nanny, Hari?

565
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:43,664
Sorry, I mean Himmat Ali.

566
01:27:43,806 --> 01:27:45,171
At home.

567
01:28:15,271 --> 01:28:17,705
What did they do to you, my friend?

568
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,612
No.

569
01:28:30,986 --> 01:28:32,715
Lenny-baby, let's go!

570
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:34,552
No.

571
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,658
Come on. Let's go!

572
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,393
We shouldn't be here.

573
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,588
But the Masseur!

574
01:28:42,731 --> 01:28:44,130
He's dead.

575
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,044
Get inside! Hide in my bedroom!

576
01:29:00,182 --> 01:29:01,911
Phone my husband!

577
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:05,008
Praise Allah!

578
01:29:05,154 --> 01:29:06,951
Praise Allah!

579
01:29:17,533 --> 01:29:19,000
The police are coming.

580
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:20,658
We are the police.

581
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:25,465
What are you bastards up to?

582
01:29:25,608 --> 01:29:28,133
Where are all the Hindus?
Get them out.

583
01:29:28,277 --> 01:29:30,177
There are no Hindus here.

584
01:29:30,312 --> 01:29:32,644
This is a Parsee house.

585
01:29:32,781 --> 01:29:34,009
Where is Hari the gardener?

586
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:38,278
Hari has become a Muslim.

587
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,684
Now his name is Himmat Ali.

588
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:42,550
Tell him to recite the Kalma.

589
01:29:47,129 --> 01:29:50,792
There is no God but God,
and Mohammed is his prophet.

590
01:29:52,568 --> 01:29:55,401
Let's see if you're a proper Muslim.

591
01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:58,301
Undo your salwar.

592
01:29:59,508 --> 01:30:00,770
Get away!

593
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:02,240
I vouch for him.

594
01:30:02,378 --> 01:30:04,243
Why don't you ask the barber?
He circumcised him.

595
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,938
There's no barber here.

596
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:11,115
Great!

597
01:30:11,253 --> 01:30:13,448
The barber did a good job
on his penis!

598
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:18,321
Bastards!
Using religion for private fun.

599
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,427
Shame on you!

600
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:20,585
Where's Moti?

601
01:30:22,097 --> 01:30:23,155
Here he is.

602
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:25,630
He's become a Christian.

603
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:27,668
Yes, Mr. David Masih.

604
01:30:29,972 --> 01:30:32,770
The priest married his daughter
to a dwarf.

605
01:30:32,908 --> 01:30:34,034
I was there.

606
01:30:35,344 --> 01:30:38,404
So he's become a black-faced gentleman.

607
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:41,107
Mr. Latrine Cleaner,
David Masih.

608
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:45,050
Now he'll sail off to England
and marry a white woman.

609
01:30:45,187 --> 01:30:47,519
Where's the Hindu woman, that nanny?

610
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:50,848
She's gone.

611
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:52,017
She's gone nowhere.

612
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:55,592
I told you, she left Lahore.

613
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:58,222
He's lying!

614
01:30:58,367 --> 01:31:00,631
Why are you lying, Imam Din?

615
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:03,397
If that is so, then swear by Allah.

616
01:31:04,907 --> 01:31:08,138
Don't take Allah's name
and defile it with your difty tongue.

617
01:31:08,277 --> 01:31:11,576
So you're not ready
to take an oath, liar.

618
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:20,886
I swear by Allah, she's gone.

619
01:31:26,228 --> 01:31:28,560
What the hell's going on here?

620
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:30,255
Get out of this place!

621
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:37,770
It's all right, Madame.

622
01:31:39,942 --> 01:31:42,638
Don't be scared, Lenny-baby.
I'm here.

623
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,080
I know what will make Lenny-baby smile.

624
01:31:50,486 --> 01:31:51,612
Ice cream.

625
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,825
Tell me where Nanny is.

626
01:32:02,765 --> 01:32:04,665
I've come for her.

627
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,665
She's here, isn't she?

628
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,039
You know I'll do anything for her.

629
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:15,732
Where is she?

630
01:32:17,179 --> 01:32:19,773
She's inside in Mummy's bedroom.

631
01:32:29,825 --> 01:32:31,656
She's hiding inside.

632
01:32:32,828 --> 01:32:35,160
Ice Candy Man, Ice Candy Man, I lied!

633
01:32:35,297 --> 01:32:37,197
She's not here! She left!

634
01:32:37,466 --> 01:32:40,594
I lied! She's gone to Amritsar!

635
01:33:59,648 --> 01:34:00,945
Madame!

636
01:34:02,084 --> 01:34:03,881
Madame, tell Hasan!

637
01:34:59,975 --> 01:35:05,345
Two hundred and fifty years
of the British Empire ended in 1947,

638
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:09,246
but what's there to show for it,
except a country divided?

639
01:35:09,384 --> 01:35:13,753
The massacres and kidnapping,
vendettas and more violence,

640
01:35:13,889 --> 01:35:15,823
was it all wofth it?

641
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:19,689
Fifty years have gone by
since I betrayed my Ayah.

642
01:35:19,828 --> 01:35:21,887
Some say she married Ice Candy Man.

643
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:24,897
Some say they saw her
in a brothel in Lahore,

644
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:27,866
others that they saw her
in Amritsar.

645
01:35:28,003 --> 01:35:30,335
But I never set eyes on her again.

646
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:37,401
And that day in 1947 when I lost Ayah,
I lost a large paft of myself.

647
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:47,311
Over one million people were killed
during India's division.

648
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:51,415
Seven million Muslims and five million
Hindus and Sikhs were uprooted

649
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,929
in the largest and most terrible exchange
of population known to history.
