Give me your goddamn burner now.

315
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,079
Give me your goddamn burner!

316
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:43,795
We know you don't give a shit about
yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious.

317
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:44,922
But you gotta think about the unit.

318
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,362
- You really fucked us on this one.
- Clady.

319
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,756
- Give me a minute, please.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:57,519
I can't afford to lose you.

321
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:00,800
Who'd do what you do?

322
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:04,726
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

323
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,317
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

324
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,721
Maybe

325
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:19,761
the clerk

326
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,643
forgot to put the disk
in the recorder today.

327
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:33,762
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom,
and you rendered aid to Washington.

328
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,080
I'll go outside.

329
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,400
Make some calls.

330
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:49,041
And maybe,

331
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:52,157
this won't be here

332
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,480
when I get back.

333
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,442
TOM: He was my partner back in the day.

334
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:52,361
We were black and white in a black
and white when it was still a big deal.

335
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:57,081
White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him
and the black cops 'cause of me.

336
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:58,802
Fuck them.

337
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,560
We made it.

338
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,446
Sorry. You tried to save him.
You did your best.

339
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:08,844
My best?
I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.

340
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:10,880
We should have dumped those guys.

341
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:15,324
How can they just wave a pen
and change what happens just like that?

342
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,319
We're the police.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

343
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:22,005
Doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.

344
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:23,520
What about the truth?

345
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:25,721
What about it?

346
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:30,405
You have to honor him, your friend.

347
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:32,079
"Honor him"?

348
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,920
I was going to knock him out
and he thought I was going to kill him.

349
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,076
Prick.

350
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,919
Don't turn your back on him.

351
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,279
Good can come from bad.

352
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,246
In my world, the real world,

353
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,235
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.

354
00:28:56,847 --> 00:29:01,523
See this? It's done. It's over.
It's taken care of. All right?

355
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,722
I won't give you another dose here,

356
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,277
but got a set of blues in your locker?

357
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:13,275
- No.
- Here's the thing.

358
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:14,800
- I gotta bury you.
- Not that.

359
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:19,677
In a nice, politically correct spot until this
Washington thing settles down a little bit.

360
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:20,802
No, Jack.

361
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:24,516
SUPERVISOR: Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

362
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:30,241
If there's a specific allegation
against an officer,

363
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,761
write it up, forward it to Internal Affairs.

364
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,797
Now, the temptation is to be
a good brother cop.

365
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,918
Don't be. None of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

366
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:43,240
There's your desk.

367
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:47,636
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?

368
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:48,996
(CHUCKLES )

369
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,486
Write it up and forward it. Okay?

370
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:54,765
- Okay.
- Okay.

371
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:06,079
You have a complaint?

372
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,477
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was
Rodney King, man.

373
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,285
Except there wasn't no video.

374
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,005
Dude looked just like you.

375
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:14,476
But black.

376
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:19,197
This ass been working longer than all
y'all cops disrespecting me.

377
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:22,359
He pulled me out of my ride, homes,
disrespected me in front of my old lady.

378
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,677
Tried to get her number and shit.

379
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,644
You get his badge number
or see his nametag?

380
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:29,366
Not with his boot on my throat
and his partner kicking me.

381
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:30,436
No, it was a little bit difficult.

382
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,245
Everybody comes here,
they have a complaint.

383
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:34,158
They sit down.
I done waited for my fucking five hours

384
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:35,805
and you gonna ask me,
do I have a complaint?

385
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:37,718
Obviously, I have a complaint.

386
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,520
You know what? This is some bullshit.

387
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,006
That's why I hate
all these motherfucking cops.

388
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:42,486
Fuck all y'all!

389
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:54,636
Wander has got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

390
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,160
You have a complaint?

391
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,166
Where to begin?

392
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,040
The black band.

393
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:04,882
Man down. Hurts, right?

394
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,596
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.

395
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:09,725
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.

396
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:15,118
You two worked Vice Special together.
Pushed a black and white in Southend.

397
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,879
Phonebook Tom,

398
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,557
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.

399
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:23,160
I heard you got your best confession
with a '91 directory.

400
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,920
You know Washington was holding
the asshole down.

401
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,606
Is this an interview?

402
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,086
Just a little back and forth.

403
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:34,797
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer,
so if there's something you'd like to ask...

404
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,078
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?

405
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,639
This is the interview.

406
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,597
Regarding yesterday's incident,
you were the first on scene, correct?

407
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes, sir.

408
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,965
- Three shooters, right?
- Two. Read the report.

409
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:53,561
What would you say if I told you
the pathologist recovered

410
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:56,480
three different calibers
from Terrence Washington's body?

411
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,443
Sounds like three shooters to me.

412
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,238
What were you doing there, Tom?

413
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,038
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.

414
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,366
Damn it!

415
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:16,166
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there?

416
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,477
Living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

417
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:19,966
Yes, it bothers me!

418
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:23,157
So, why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

419
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:26,523
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain,
nobody's getting away.

420
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:28,882
What happened to the video
from the store?

421
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,280
What video?

422
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:35,039
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,

423
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:38,324
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.

424
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,284
I'm going to pour gas on you,

425
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,439
I'm going to pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

426
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:46,599
Then I'm lighting the match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

427
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:49,755
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.

428
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:52,077
Your window's closed.

429
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:56,399
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.

430
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:02,279
WANDER: Get back in your office!

431
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:11,038
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

432
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,687
What the fuck are you doing
jamming my people at lunch?

433
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:16,406
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

434
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:18,557
You keep your dog on a leash.

435
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:21,116
Everybody knows
he can't make a move without you.

436
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,242
You go cry to Daddy?

437
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,646
Stop right there.

438
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,561
Stop.

439
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,726
Tom is a damn fine cop.

440
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:32,078
He bleeds blue.

441
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,598
You got an open case on him?

442
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:37,361
Vice Special?

443
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,646
You got one on me?

444
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:42,798
You formally investigating us?

445
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:47,518
This is a fishing expedition.

446
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:50,486
Because you know if you went to the Chief
and you asked him

447
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,762
to open a case on me
or anybody in my unit,

448
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:54,326
he would laugh you out of his office.

449
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,523
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

450
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:59,599
I have watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail

451
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:01,803
your way up through the pay grades
for 20 plus years.

452
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,878
I know exactly what you are.

453
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:07,600
You've got no business being
a commander.

454
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:11,321
You like Tom, don't you?

455
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:16,235
I saw the way you watched him
when he came in.

456
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:19,683
That's why you follow him around,
you want him to give you a blow job.

457
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:23,326
Like that hooker I caught you with
when we were sergeants.

458
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,886
- You remember?
- Shut up, Jack.

459
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:29,199
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?

460
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,877
It was the best head I ever had.

461
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,125
And what about you, Jack?

462
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:38,404
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.

463
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:42,366
It's a two-way street, buddy.
You can't ride the tiger forever.

464
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,798
Now get the hell out of my office.

465
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:46,718
Do the department a favor,

466
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:49,836
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.

467
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,597
Come on, Tom. Let's get out of here.

468
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:05,601
From his time on the street
to his time in your schools and homes,

469
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,996
Detective Washington was tireless

470
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,241
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family,

empties his clip into him.

and I'll tell you.

791
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:55,562
Where do they fucking stay?

792
00:53:57,807 --> 00:53:59,479
You're fucking crazy, man.

793
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:00,602
I don't know where they at.

794
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:03,281
Cats have been banned from the hood
for a minute, man.

795
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,483
If I catch them slipping,
I'm gonna bust they motherfucking head.

796
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,877
Answer the fucking question!
How do we find them?

797
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:14,046
The only cats I know that know them
is up in the County, man. High power.

798
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:17,119
- I'm going to book you into County.
- For what, man? For what?

799
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:18,276
(CHOKING)

800
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,040
Talk to your friends, find me Fremont and
Coates and you'll be out by tomorrow.

801
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:23,197
Otherwise, I'm gonna book you
for the dope and AK.

802
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:25,164
Fuck, man! Fuck, man!

803
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:26,236
(GROANS )

804
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,199
I ain't no fucking snitch, man.

805
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:35,085
I know that.
There won't be no jacket, no papers.

806
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,921
It's just you and me.

807
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,918
Fuck, fuck, fuck, man!

808
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:42,766
Come on, they ain't nothing to you.
I want them.

809
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:46,117
All right, man. Fuck it, man.

810
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:28,039
Mrs. Washington.

811
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:33,523
Can we talk outside?

812
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,121
Terrence had $50,000 in cash on him.

813
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,716
His death might be more than just
wrong place, wrong time.

814
00:55:51,207 --> 00:55:52,196
(SCOFFS )

815
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:53,640
Might be?

816
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:57,764
How many people knew he was
talking to Internal Affairs?

817
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,359
My husband had a good heart.

818
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:05,364
And when he started listening to it,
he became a pariah.

819
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:07,721
His eyes opened.

820
00:56:08,207 --> 00:56:09,845
When will your eyes open?

821
00:56:11,487 --> 00:56:14,126
Terrence always said
you were the worst one.

822
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:18,676
Because with all the shit going on
around you, you choose not to see.

823
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:21,440
- Look, I came here to help you.
- Help me?

824
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,087
You came to help yourself sleep at night.

825
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:26,317
That $50,000,
you think Terrence was stupid?

826
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:30,286
He knew he had a bull's-eye on his back
the second he went to Captain Biggs.

827
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,359
So we sold our house.

828
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,927
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.

829
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:38,400
To start over.

830
00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:41,758
Silly of us, wasn't it?

831
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,358
Anything else, Detective?

832
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,562
No.

833
00:56:57,807 --> 00:56:59,525

834
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:02,119
What the fuck?

835
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:06,160
- Hey. How's Complaints?
- Just missed your wife.

836
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:09,597
- Oh. She was here? That's cute.
- Yeah.

837
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:12,645
I got something for you.

838
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:20,915
That's for you.

839
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:23,606
- Is that it?
- That's it.

840
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:25,564
Yeah. That's it.

841
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:27,805
You keep it.
A nice little souvenir for yourself.

842
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,605
But, Tom, this is...

843
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,959
I mean, it's over.

844
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:37,398
Tom, this is over.

845
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:42,237
We got your back, Tom.

848
00:58:11,247 --> 00:58:12,839
- I got that name.
- Fire away.

00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:21,404
- Name.
- Scribble. They call him Scribble.

852
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,725
His real name's Winston or some shit.
I don't know.

853
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:27,805
- Man, get me up out of here.
- It's on its way.

855
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:32,124
Scribble. It's catchy.

856
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:34,198
I got a Metro unit tailing him.

857
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,480
Go get him, Disco.

858

- Make me proud.
- You're not coming?

- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Watch it! Watch it!
- You married, Diskant?

860

Engaged. And I'd like to see her again.

No. Why?

Do you want us to jam them?

867
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:09,685
That's a negative. Just keep eyes on
and call it out. We're en route.

868

You need to kick that shit.

to him. I got his card.

you know you got a no-bail warrant.

you're locked up until the apocalypse.

You really want to kick heroin in County?

896

Want to see the judge all sick,
shitting and puking yourself?

897
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:25,481
That would look real good. And for what?

898
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:27,364
You're just a rung on a ladder
I'm climbing.

899
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:28,675
What ladder, man?

900
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:32,047
How do I find Fremont and Coates?

901

Look, I ain't got no love for them
banana boat motherfuckers, man.

But them dudes are straight monsters.

903
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:41,597
They'll put me in a box
if they think I'm snitching.

904
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,564
I'm not asking to finger the guys
in open court.

905
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,285
I just want to find them.

906
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,562
Once I do, you're out of the mix.

907
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:50,318
I ain't seen them in a week, man.

908
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:51,556
You got a number?

909
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:55,560
No, I ain't got no number.
Them dudes drop phones all the time.

910
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:57,319
They call me, man.

911
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,443
Look man, your man making me nervous
back here. Could you...

912
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:01,040
Look at me. Look at me!

913
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:05,156
You wanna see that judge
or you gonna help me find them?

914
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:10,679
Look, I did business with them
one time in El Sereno.

915
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,277
Little bitty-ass house way up in the hills.
That's it.

916
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:19,726
Show me.

917
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:22,367
You expect me to leave my car
in the hood, man?

918
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:09,639
Someone had a party.

919
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,361
Smell that?

920
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,519
Want me to put it out?

921
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,957
No. Get the murder book.

922
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,159
This is Fremont.

923
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:23,636
And this is his buddy, Coates.

924
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:27,361
We found them.

925
01:03:27,447 --> 01:03:28,436
Great.

926
01:03:28,967 --> 01:03:30,525
Case closed.

927
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:34,404
These guys have been here a while.
There's no way they killed Washington.

928
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:35,761
You think?

929
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:39,036
Fuck you. I'm doing my best.

930
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:42,686
If Fremont and Coates
didn't kill Washington, who did?

931
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:43,756
Who're we chasing?

932
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:45,280
The assholes who smoked these guys,

933
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:47,801
harvested their DNA and planted it
in the market. That's who.

934
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:51,084
I'm with you.
But why do you frame two dead dudes?

935
01:03:52,487 --> 01:03:54,159
We're going to ask them.

936
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:56,961
Let's go.

937
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,000
What's up, man?

938
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:07,679
You know there's coyotes out here
and shit, right?

939
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:09,166
Y'all been gone a minute.

940
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:10,646
You know these guys?

941
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:15,082
No, man. I ain't never seen these dudes.

942
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:19,126
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you,
set up a meeting.

943
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,119
You tell them I can do for them
what Washington can't anymore.

944
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:24,038
They'll know what you mean.

945
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,241
All right, man. I'll hook it up.

946
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,522
- Will you take me back to my car?

- by powerful men with powerful secrets.
- Captain.

1421
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,438
They were afraid of Jack.

1422
01:37:47,607 --> 01:37:49,120
They asked me to help.

1423
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:56,043
One day, you will pass the Chief in the hall
and he will give you a nod.

1424
01:37:56,887 --> 01:37:58,639
And you will know why.

1425
01:38:01,807 --> 01:38:03,559
Because you were right, Tom.

1426
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:06,440
We do need you.
