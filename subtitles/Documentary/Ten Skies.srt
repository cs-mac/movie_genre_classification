Tom.

655
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:35,371
- How you feeling?
- Like it's good to be home.

656
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:38,545
Captain, we should talk.

657
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:42,039
Plenty of time for that.
You just get better first.

A lot of people
will be glad to see you.

Welcome back, Tom.

00:40:49,899 --> 00:40:51,862
Thanks, Dai.

happen to mention

662
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:03,231
how he, uh, busted out
of Skitter Central?

663
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:05,422
He did not.

I don't know about you, Cap,

but I'd be throwing a flag
on that play.
