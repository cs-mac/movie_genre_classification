00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,088
<i> What's a crossword tournament?</i>
<i>Most people don't know.</i>

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,003
<i> Give me spaces that need</i>
<i>to be filled in, and I wanna fill them in.</i>

3
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,805
<i> This is the longest-running</i>
<i>crossword puzzle tournament in the worid...</i>

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,278
<i>and there's nothing like coming here</i>
<i>for a good snowy weekend.</i>

5
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,339
<i>Well, Will is the progenitor.</i>
<i>He started the whole thing.</i>

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,080
<i>Without Will, there never would have been</i>
<i>a tournament like this.</i>

7
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:58,022
<i> Everything leads up to the tournament,</i>
<i>because there's one of these a year.</i>

8
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,619
<i>There aren't too many people my age who do</i>
<i>crosswords at all, let alone as fast as I do them.</i>

9
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:07,325
<i>It's sort of utter panic. Each puzzle,</i>
<i>I think, "Oh, my God. What if I can't do this?</i>

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,392
What if I make a mistake?
What if I leave something out?"

11
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,337
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

12
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,601
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

13
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,348
<i>#Adjectives on the typewriter #</i>

14
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,828
<i>#He moves his words like a prizefighter #</i>

15
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,732
<i># The frenzied pace of the mind</i>
<i>inside the cell #</i>

16
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,066
<i># The man on the street</i>
<i>might just as well be #</i>

17
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,737
<i># The man on the street</i>
<i>might just as well #</i>

18
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,408
<i># The man on the street</i>
<i>might just as well be ##</i>

19
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,712
<i> All right, here we go.</i>
<i>From the beginning.</i>

20
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,954
<i>From NPRNews, this is</i> Weekend Edition.

21
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,619
<i>I'm Liane Hansen, andjoining us</i>
<i>is puzzle master Will Shortz.</i>

22
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,663
<i>- Hi, Will.</i>
- Hi, Liane.

23
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,029
<i>My name's Will Shortz.</i>
<i>I'm the crossword editor of the</i> New York Times.

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,159
When you're in grade school,
you take aptitude tests...

25
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,672
to find out what you're good at
and what you want to do in life.

26
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,173
<i>I remember</i>— <i>This would have been</i>
<i>fourth, fifth or sixth grade.</i>

27
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,473
<i>I took this test, and, when I was done,</i>
<i>I turned over the paper...</i>

28
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,538
<i>and looked through the list of professions</i>
<i>to find out how I scored in that category.</i>

29
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,211
And not surprisingly, puzzle maker
was not one of their listed professions.

30
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,220
<i>Now, are you a puzzle player?</i>

31
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,756
<i>Uh, yeah. I'm an avid Scrabble player...</i>

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,758
<i>and I like word games and puzzles.</i>

33
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,422
<i>I'm blessed to work for the two greatest</i>
<i>news organizations in the country</i>—

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,522
The <i>New York Times</i>
and National Public Radio.

35
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,126
<i>And I know that whatever puzzle</i>
<i>I throw out there...</i>

36
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,138
for an intelligent, cultured audience...

37
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,698
is gonna be understood and appreciated by them,
and they're my kind of people.

38
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,768
<i> Daniel, it's time to meet Will,</i>
<i>and it's time for everyone to play.</i>

39
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,043
Well, Daniel, I'm gonna
name some categories.

40
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,108
For each one, name something
in that category...

41
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,952
that begins with the same
first two letters as the category.

42
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,323
For example, if I said Planets,
you might say Pluto.

43
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,761
Number one is Auto Makes.

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,492
- Auto— Uh, Auto Makes. Audi.
- Audi. Excellent.

45
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,365
<i>Well, of course,</i>
<i>I've spent my whole life on puzzles.</i>

46
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,700
<i>I've been making puzzles</i>
<i>since, uh, I was eight or nine.</i>

47
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,104
<i>And I sold my first one</i>
<i>when I was 14.</i>

48
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:33,476
When I was a kid, I used to joke about
majoring in puzzles when I got to college.

49
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,980
Well, I was lucky enough
to go to Indiana University.

50
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,246
<i>And if you're accepted,</i>
<i>you can major in anything you want.</i>

51
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,618
<i>I found this old-fashioned word</i>
<i>called "enigmatology"...</i>

52
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,522
<i>that was in the unabridged dictionaries...</i>

53
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:51,553
<i>and I convinced the people that puzzles</i>
<i>were a serious field of academic inquiry.</i>

54
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,226
I devised an entire curriculum
for myself in puzzles.

55
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,134
<i>I figured from the beginning</i>
<i>that it would mean a life of poverty...</i>

56
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,138
<i>because puzzles don't pay much.</i>

57
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:05,940
<i>But I wanted to do puzzles so badly,</i>
<i>I was willing to live in poverty to do it.</i>

58
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,004
Excellent. Capitals of States.

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,574
- Um, Carson City.
- Oh, that was good.

60
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,485
Snow White's Dwarfs.

61
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,547
Oh, boy. Uh...

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,991
- Snoopy? Is that one of them?
- No, not Snoopy. No.

63
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,858
<i>Snappy's not one of them either.</i>

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,763
<i>So when I took over the job</i>
<i>at the</i> Times <i>in 1993...</i>

65
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,098
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I really understood puzzle solvers.</i>

66
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,675
It's addressed to "Mr. Will Shortz,
the smartass crossword puzzle hero."

67
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,234
"This one last Saturday
was ridiculous."

68
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,804
"You should be hanged by your cojones
for this Monday puzzle."

69
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,716
"Give me a break." "I couldn't solve it
even with the answers in front of me."

70
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,481
"Dear Sir or Madam."

71
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,318
"It's Monday, Mr. Shortz, not Friday."

72
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,360
"This is both idiotic
and completely unfair."

73
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:59,262
"This kvetching thing that's going on—
I can't seem to get a grasp on it."

74
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,597
"Who in the hell ever heard of three letters
in a single box?"

75
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,264
"The kvetchers cry: 'Oy vey'?
I don't get it."

76
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,705
"How is it used?
Is it a Northern thing?"

77
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:13,803
"Frogs hop, sir, but toads do not.
They waddle."

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,078
"You have managed to take
all the fun out of it. Congratulations."

79
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,585
"No wonder William F. Buckley
stopped doing these puzzles."

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,987
"You are sick, sick, sick indeed.
Sincerely"—

81
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,583
The best part of the week for me
is reading the mail.

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,628
"P.S. You're sick, sick, sick."

83
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,187
Hearing from sobbers
is the best part of the job.

84
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,825
You don't do this for the money
or for anything else.

85
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,835
<i>Those are all secondary things.</i>

86
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,964
<i>The biggest thing is to stretch people's brains</i>
<i>and bring joy to their lives.</i>

87
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,122
<i>#La-la-la la-la la-la #</i>

88
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,320
"Auctioned again."
Come on.

89
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,832
You tryin' to trick me
so I have to think about "auction"?

90
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,199
But it's not really about that.
It's just about selling, isn't it?

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,604
<i>My name is Jon Stewart,</i>
<i>and I tell dumb jokes for money.</i>

92
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,075
To-do. Come on! To-do!

93
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,840
<i>I am a, uh</i>—<i>a</i> Times <i>puzzle fan.</i>

94
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:26,283
I will solve in a hot— a hotel
a <i>USA Today...</i>

95
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,311
uh, but I don't feel good about myself
when I do it.

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,656
Uh, you feel like you're
doin' one of them circle things...

97
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,525
where you find the word
when you're on a plane.

98
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,055
"These are all flowers."
Uh-huh.

99
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,932
So, uh, the <i>Times</i> puzzle
is the one for me.

100
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,565
"Asps." Come on, Shortz!
Bring it!

101
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,177
"Pileup"!

102
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:58,206
<i>When you imagine crossword guy,</i>
<i>you imagine he's 13 to 14 inches tall...</i>

103
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,947
uh, doesn't care to go more than five feet
without his inhaler.

104
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,149
And yet, uh, he's a giant man.

105
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,057
<i>He's the Errol Flynn</i>
<i>of crossword puzzling.</i>

106
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,527
<i>But meeting him in person,</i>
<i>I definitely thought...</i>

107
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,587
"Geez, I was planning
on taking your lunch money...

108
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,897
but now I believe you could best me
in a physical joust, if you will."

109
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,494
So I, uh— I backed off immediately.

110
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:25,533
<i>L</i>— <i>I respect, uh, very much</i>
<i>those that create the puzzles.</i>

111
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,478
I don't know—
I don't know how they do it.

112
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,880
Quite frankly, I don't know
why they do it.

113
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,074
<i>"Dunkin'Donuts."</i>

114
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,610
<i>Put the "D"at the end,</i>
<i>you get "unkind donuts."</i>

115
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,386
Which I've had a few of in my day.

116
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,268
<i>My name is Merl Reagle.</i>
<i>I'm a syndicated crossword puzzle constructor.</i>

117
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,333
<i> Merl is a great guy.</i>
<i>We've been friends for years.</i>

118
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,936
<i>He's like me in many ways.</i>

119
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,914
He was a puzzle head
from when he was a child.

120
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,747
<i>He started making crosswords</i>
<i>when he was in his teens.</i>

121
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,845
<i>Normally I'm either</i>
<i>thinking of puzzles...</i>

122
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,584
or cluing them here
or cluing them there...

123
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,821
<i>or thinking of themes for puzzles.</i>

124
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,193
Noah's Ark right there.

125
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,825
You switch the "S" and the "H" around,
and that's "No, a shark."

126
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,234
<i>And hopefully, there is</i>
<i>part of the day available...</i>

127
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,764
for me to actually do normal things
with the people I love.

128
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,801
<i>Every crossword is a collaboration</i>
<i>between the puzzle maker and the editor.</i>

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,974
<i>I get 60 to 75 puzzles submitted to me</i>
<i>every week.</i>

130
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,076
<i>So, you know, I go through the mail</i>
<i>and pick out the ones that I like best.</i>

131
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:45,112
<i>On average, about half the clues</i>
<i>in the</i> Times <i>crossword are my own.</i>

132
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,524
<i>And I change clues, first of all,</i>
<i>for accuracy...</i>

133
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,495
and as a matter of style—
<i>New York Times</i> style.

134
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:56,558
But I'm also making the clues fit
the intended level of difficulty.

135
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,002
So if I've determined something
is a Monday puzzle...

136
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,198
I'm gonna try to make all easy clues.

137
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,538
If I've determined this is a Friday
or a Saturday puzzle...

138
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,635
<i>I'm gonna try to make everything</i>
<i>challenging.</i>

139
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,647
<i>When crossword puzzles had begun in 1913...</i>

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,243
<i>they eventually got so popular that an editor</i>
<i>had to be hired to do it every week.</i>

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,517
<i>Margaret Farrar wanted to do</i>
<i>real journalistic things in her life...</i>

142
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,048
<i>but she was told, okay, you have to edit</i>
<i>the crossword puzzle from now on...</i>

143
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,061
<i>which she didn't want to do.</i>

144
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,791
So she finally thought, okay,
I'll sit down and actually do this.

145
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,733
And by doing that over the course
of a couple of years, she standardized puzzles.

146
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,761
It's amazing what we still use today
from those days.

147
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,366
The rule about one sixth of the diagram
can be black squares.

148
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,377
<i>The fact that it's all-over interlocked.</i>

149
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,005
<i>You can't have little islands of words</i>
<i>separated from everything else.</i>

150
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,015
<i>No two-letter words.</i>

151
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,916
<i>Symmetry</i>— <i>the fact that if you turn</i>
<i>a crossword puzzle upside-down...</i>

152
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,887
<i>the arrangement ofblack squares</i>
<i>stays the same.</i>

153
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,947
<i>And there's word-choice rules.</i>

154
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,858
You can't use, usually, bodily functions
in puzzles, you know.

155
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,659
"Urine" would bail me out of a corner
a million times a year.

156
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,099
Same with "enema."
"Enema"— talk about great letters.

157
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,137
<i>But you gotta keep those words</i>
<i>out of puzzles...</i>

158
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,368
<i>because it doesn't pass</i>
<i>the "Sunday morning breakfast"test.</i>

159
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,377
<i>I mean, there are people solving,</i>
<i>on Sunday morning, the big Sunday puzzle.</i>

160
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,379
They've waited all week for this.

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,438
They're sitting there relaxing,
and here comes, you know—

162
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,642
"Rectal"? I don't think so.

163
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,017
<i>As a result of these rules, she became,</i>
<i>like, the first lady of crosswords.</i>

164
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,615
<i>When the</i> New York Times <i>decided</i>
<i>to start running a crossword puzzle in 1942...</i>

165
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,682
<i>she was the one</i>
<i>they picked to do it.</i>

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,923
<i>#Broadway papa #</i>

167
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,625
<i>#Broadway papa #</i>

168
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,634
<i># You sure do puzzle me ##</i>

169
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:41,662
<i> Cities are where we leave</i>
<i>the imprint ofhuman interaction.</i>

170
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,232
<i>What the city offers,</i>
<i>particularly this city</i>—

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,473
especially this city—
is a sense of grids.

172
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,480
You know, it's all about boxes.

173
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,416
<i>You live in a box, and you ride in a box</i>
<i>to go to work in a box.</i>

174
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,513
<i>And we have this wonderful newspaper</i>
<i>that's boxy shaped...</i>

175
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,323
<i>that has in it this page which is</i>
<i>my favorite page in the whole newspaper.</i>

176
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,525
And there are a set of boxes
in which you kind of practice...

177
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,262
the wordplay of this particularly
exquisite language.

178
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,897
<i>You know, I don't drink coffee.</i>
<i>I don't smoke cigarettes.</i>

179
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,601
I don't need to have a drink
at the end of the day.

180
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,136
What I need to do is do the <i>New York</i>
crossword puzzle, in ink, every day.

181
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,343
<i>It's almost like going home.</i>

182
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,447
<i>You know how your parents always</i>
<i>live one place for an eon?</i>

183
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,257
Well, the Marriott in Stamford has been
the place where it's always been held.

184
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,264
<i>Two, one. Start your pencils.</i>

185
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,391
<i>Crossword puzzles.</i>

186
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,562
<i>And this is the first crossword puzzle</i>
<i>tournament in the United States.</i>

187
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,629
<i>They hope the first annual.</i>

188
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,733
<i> The crossword tournament</i>
<i>in Stamford started in 1978.</i>

189
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,838
I got together a few friends of mine—
crossword-constructing friends—
to be the officials.

190
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,544
<i>149 contestants</i>
<i>showed up that first year.</i>

191
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,145
<i> Will Shortz,</i>
<i>the 25-year-old tournament coordinator...</i>

192
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,556
<i>has a degree in enigmatology</i>—
<i>the study of puzzles.</i>

193
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,459
I spend 10, 12 hours a day on puzzles...

194
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,554
either making puzzles
or solving puzzles.

195
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,692
<i> It was just a wonderful</i>
<i>and exhausting event.</i>

196
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,896
<i>It's an institution now.</i>

197
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,135
<i>If Will hadn't have wanted tojust,</i>
<i>basically meet other puzzlers</i>—

198
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,336
I think that's the reason
he started it—

199
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,175
<i>just to have some fun</i>
<i>with all ofhis friends.</i>

200
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,307
<i>I mean, it's a</i>—<i>it's a labor oflove.</i>

201
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,841
<i>"Really go for."Five letters.</i>

202
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,547
<i>"Boffo review."Four letters.</i>

203
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,182
<i>"Director Craven." Three letters.</i>

204
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,428
<i>My name's Al Sanders.</i>
<i>I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado.</i>

205
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:48,229
<i>I work at Hewlett-Packard</i>
<i>as a project manager there in an R& D lab.</i>

206
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,064
<i>We have three kids</i>—
<i>Matthew, Grace and Connor.</i>

207
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,129
<i>Ages 14, 9 and 11.</i>

208
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,231
<i>He's a very good dad, yeah.</i>

209
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,367
<i>I think that, you know, I think</i>
<i>they've grown up...</i>

210
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,811
<i>with a very nice,</i>
<i>loving relationship with their dad.</i>

211
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:06,341
And I think that that will help them,
you know, when they become parents too.

212
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,409
<i>Growing up, I was an only child...</i>

213
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,923
<i>so I spent a lot of time, you know,</i>
<i>reading and that kind of stuff.</i>

214
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,516
I used to love to watch game shows.
Always loved trivia.

215
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,461
So I always did pretty good, you know,
in a kind of testing situation.

216
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,830
<i>In some ways, I think that's why</i>
<i>I still enjoy puzzles so much.</i>

217
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,461
'Cause the school environment,
it's very structured...

218
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,404
<i>and it's very, um,</i>
<i>artificial in a way.</i>

219
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,670
<i>At the end, you get your report card,</i>
<i>and you did great.</i>

220
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,906
<i>You got your straight A's or whatever</i>
<i>and, you know, cool. That was great.</i>

221
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,971
<i>In real life, it's obviously</i>
<i>a lot more complicated than that.</i>

222
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,754
It's kind of late tonight, so I'm a little tired.
We'll see if I can do it, but—

223
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,782
We'll see if we can get at least
below 2:30 on this one.

224
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,352
So, okay? So, ready, set, go.

225
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,731
I got the long entry there,
so that's good.

226
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,438
This is about cheese, it looks like,
so everything has to do with cheeses.

227
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,075
Um. I'd better stop talking
and keep goin' here.

228
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,344
<i>I'd say crosswords to me</i>
<i>are probably an obsession.</i>

229
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,085
<i>Um, certainly in the couple of months</i>
<i>before the tournament...</i>

230
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,151
<i>I kind ofhave this phase</i>
<i>I seem to have worked my way into...</i>

231
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,663
<i>where everything leads up</i>
<i>to the tournament.</i>

232
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,722
<i>Because there's one of these a year.</i>

233
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,767
Down. See? I had to stop.
Bad news.

234
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,985
<i>I think I've got a chance.</i>

235
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,079
<i>I- I've been in the finals</i>
<i>for a number of years...</i>

236
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,182
<i>and I know people must think,</i>
<i>"Oh, great. Al's in the finals again.</i>

237
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,251
<i>There's another third-place finish. "</i>

238
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,990
<i>So I kind ofhave a little something</i>
<i>to prove there at least.</i>

239
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:13,077
<i>You know, the whole puzzle calendar</i>
<i>pretty much revolves around Stamford.</i>

240
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:18,048
<i>And, um, you know, there's nothing else like it</i>
<i>in the crossword worid, so you gotta be there.</i>

241
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,210
<i>They always talk about the winners.</i>

242
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,949
<i>They announce the former champions</i>
<i>at the beginning of the tournament.</i>

243
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,856
<i>Sure, comin'in the top three</i>
<i>for five or six years in a row...</i>

244
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,123
<i>it's great and it's really cool,</i>
<i>but there's just something special...</i>

245
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,289
<i>about actually being a champion</i>
<i>that, uh</i>—

246
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,529
<i>And it's not like, you know, winning</i>
<i>a major in golf or something, but it's</i>—

247
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,436
<i>But in the crossword puzzle worid,</i>
<i>it kind ofhas that same cachet.</i>

248
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,270
<i>So it would be somethin'</i>
<i>that you'd remember forever.</i>

249
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,802
<i>So I really hope sometime</i>
<i>in the next few years...</i>

250
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,976
<i>l- I can</i>— <i>I can close the deal</i>
<i>and win one of these things.</i>

251
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,418
Oh. 2:02.

252
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,049
I can never get under two minutes. Dang it.

253
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,059
Someday, I'm gonna get
a 1:59 outta here...

254
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,722
but that's my second-fastest one
ever, so—

255
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,631
I didn't stop and check,
but I do have it all filled in so—

256
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,033
Yeah, that was
a pretty good one there. So—

257
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:18,004
We're doing a puzzle
that is about the word "wordplay."

258
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,102
The way I thought we would
get into the puzzle—

259
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,478
Since "wordplay"
is an even number of letters...

260
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,612
and crossword puzzle diagrams are almost
always an odd number of squares on a side.

261
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,554
Since you can't put it
in the center of the diagram...

262
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,717
what we'll do is, we'll put it as clo—

263
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,784
We'll put it like this.

264
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,853
<i>One of the great things about</i>
<i>the</i> Times <i>crossword...</i>

265
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,491
<i>is that it's made</i>
<i>by many different people.</i>

266
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,697
Each year, I publish about 110
different constructors.

267
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,434
<i>And I think the puzzle is much better</i>
<i>than if I made all the puzzles myself.</i>

268
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,136
<i>First of all, it takes a long time</i>
<i>to make a great crossword.</i>

269
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,671
<i>And with so many different voices,</i>
<i>so many different constructors</i>
<i>sending puzzles to me...</i>

270
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,979
<i>I get lots more diversity.</i>

271
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:04,512
<i>The puzzle wouldn't be nearly as good</i>
<i>if one person made it.</i>

272
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,651
The basic idea of this puzzle is
that I wanted to think of words or phrases...

273
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:13,027
that contain the word "word"
in a nonword context.

274
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:17,125
And I wanted to think of words that contain
the word "play" in a nonword context.

275
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,136
I thought of words like "Playa del Rey"...

276
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,435
the area of California where I'm—
I used to be from.

277
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,976
"Playa del Rey"
starts with the word "play"...

278
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,569
and has nothing to do
with the word "play" in English.

279
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:32,549
And "cross swords," as if
to start dueling with somebody with swords.

280
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,714
"Cross swords"
has the word "word" in it also...

281
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,452
and it actually looks like "crosswords"
with an extra "S."

282
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,427
So that was the idea— that we could
somehow do a wordplay puzzle...

283
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,398
about the words "word" and "play" that
did not involve the actual words themselves.

284
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,801
<i> What's it feel like</i>
<i>to actually be in the puzzle?</i>

285
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,604
<i>Oh, man. That's</i>—
<i>Call it a pinnacle of our career.</i>

286
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,613
It was a thrill, a total thrill.

287
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,672
<i>I was actuallyjust surprised.</i>

288
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,208
<i>'Cause I always thought of us</i>
<i>as being pretty underground...</i>

289
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,246
<i>and not really</i>
<i>in the intellectual set.</i>

290
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,122
<i>But, um, it was exciting, flattering.</i>

291
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:21,128
"Bikini parts" has to end in an "S," I think,
so maybe "odyssey" is spelled wrong.

292
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,863
- Maybe it's not "odyssey."
- Feels like it's "odyssey," but—

293
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,073
<i> I definitely started equating</i>
<i>crossword puzzles with songwriting.</i>

294
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,974
<i>And it really helped my process,</i>
<i>because I think what it did...</i>

295
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,845
is it gave me this sense of faith
that writer's block is not really real...

296
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,282
and that if you sit there
and work on it long enough...

297
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,116
just like when you do a crossword,
something's gonna come out, you know?

298
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,021
It's the same thing that Emily's talkin'
about when you stare at a clue...

299
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:50,960
and all of a sudden the answer just pops up, and
you're, like, "I didn't even know I knew that."

300
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,329
<i> I mean, for me, writing a song,</i>
<i>you wanna make it general enough</i>
<i>so that people can relate to it...</i>

301
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,766
<i>but also specific enough</i>
<i>so that it's interesting.</i>

302
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,997
So there are all those things
you can play with—

303
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,872
obscurity, clarity,
generalization, specificity.

304
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,537
And those are things that you sort of
grapple with as you're writing a song.

305
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,947
<i>#I'm tryin'to tell you somethin'</i>
<i>about my life #</i>

306
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:16,215
<i>#Maybe give me insight</i>
<i>between black and white #</i>

307
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,122
#And the best thing
you've ever done for me ##

308
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,650
Right from the start,
Merl loved the idea of making puzzles...

309
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:28,826
with as few black squares and as many
wide-open white squares as possible.

310
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,802
<i>I have now put my theme answers in...</i>

311
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,203
where they will go
for maximum use of the space...

312
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,300
so that the diagram
still breathes a little.

313
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,937
And now I'm just looking at it...

314
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,006
to see if the down possibilities
have any problems.

315
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,986
You want to sniff out these tough areas
immediately when you're constructing.

316
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,580
And the only spot I have here
that's even remotely like that...

317
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,593
is this blank-Y-blank-blank-Y.

318
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,892
Right there. I mean,
there are words that go in there.

319
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,161
"My way." "Pygmy."
A couple of other things.

320
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:06,330
But the thing is that this word next to it—
A- blank-blank-A-blank.

321
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,238
If—All the ones I've said for here,
this is a consonant.

322
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,300
"My day." That's a "D."
"Pygmy." That's a "G."

323
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,813
Uh, so if that's a consonant...

324
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,748
this has to be a vowel.

325
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:23,277
And how many vowels can you think of
that go A-vowel-blank-A-blank...

326
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:27,416
and still are gonna bleed
into this really important area...

327
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,426
so that words can come down?

328
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:35,228
And the only one I can think of
for this is a fragment like "by any."

329
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,066
I need that to be a vowel.
Like "by any means possible."

330
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,937
Then from here— consonant-vowel—
then almost anything I want.

331
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,671
This is gonna be almost anything—
I'm just gonna make sure that I can
come down from here.

332
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,681
So what I'm thinking of is that this
is gonna be a word that ends like this.

333
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,775
And that this is gonna be a word
that either ends with "S" down here.

334
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,343
Or it could be something rather colorful.
I'm not sure.

335
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,788
But this is gonna be like—
something like a "G"...

336
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,326
and maybe this is gonna be
an "E" also.

337
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,353
Um, I just thought of something
that's gonna work nice.

338
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,131
<i> Nine-letter word</i>
<i>for "cocktail with a cherry."</i>

339
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,934
<i>Fifteen-letter word</i>
<i>for "resistant to moisture,"say.</i>

340
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,475
<i>Five-letter word for "clued in."</i>

341
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,455
Great. Oh.

342
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:38,125
<i>I'm Ellen Ripstein.</i>
<i>We're in the back of Park West Village.</i>

343
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:43,259
<i>I went to the very first tournament in 1978,</i>
<i>and I came in in the thirties.</i>

344
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:48,466
<i>So really, just at the tournaments,</i>
<i>as I gradually started getting better...</i>

345
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,169
you know, I guess I realized,
"Gee, I must be really good at this."

346
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:56,408
But it still sort of amazes me, 'cause
when I see a Saturday <i>Times</i> puzzle...

347
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,949
and I do it in 10 minutes,
and then on the forum...

348
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,783
they're saying it took all afternoon,
that just seems so strange to me.

349
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,948
What was their problem?
Why couldn't they do the puzzle?

350
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,993
Or I guess I've just accumulated
a lot of useless knowledge...

351
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,325
that often is in the puzzles.

352
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,497
For 18 years in a row,
I was so close to the top.

353
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,974
I was in the finals, I think, 11 times—
the top three— and didn't win.

354
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,273
<i>So then, every year, you know,</i>
<i>I kept not winning...</i>

355
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,113
<i>until finally, um, in 2001,</i>
<i>one of the contestants was having lunch...</i>

356
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,618
with a friend of his who worked
for the <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

357
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,154
and telling him about this tournament
he was about to go to.

358
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,282
<i>So the</i> Wall Street Journal
<i>did a front page piece on me...</i>

359
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,123
<i>a week before the tournament</i>
<i>with a picture and everything.</i>

360
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,028
<i>And this is just mind-boggling.</i>
<i>I'm just a little nerd girl...</i>

361
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,532
<i>and here I am</i>
<i>on the front of the</i> Wall Street Journal.

362
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,967
This tournament,
we had ABC News, CBS—

363
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,234
<i>uh, you know, just tons of press.</i>

364
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,470
<i>So the top three were me,</i>
<i>Al Sanders and Patrick Jordan...</i>

365
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,534
<i>who are all really good.</i>

366
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,773
But it wasn't people who've won.

367
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,181
<i>So Patrick finished the puzzle first...</i>

368
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,414
<i>and they were saying that all the air</i>
<i>just got sucked out of the room.</i>

369
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,786
Because Patrick is nice, and people
would like him to win...

370
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,850
but, God, you know, they really
wanted me to win already. And then—

371
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,385
<i>- Patrick's in</i>—
<i>- But hold on a minute.</i>

372
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,865
<i>With a mistake. With a mistake.</i>

373
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,494
There was a bad crossing,
and he had made a mistake.

374
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,095
<i>So, you know, everyone's</i>
<i>just holding their breath.</i>

375
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,506
<i>Oh, she's so close. She is so close.</i>

376
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,943
<i>She's lookin'it over.</i>
<i>The second hand</i>— <i>It is comin'up.</i>

377
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,313
<i>I fill in the last letter</i>
<i>and turn around and</i>—

378
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:44,253
I'm crying just even thinking about it.
And the place just went totally nuts.

379
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,916
They're going, "El-len! El-len!"

380
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:51,861
<i>A guy pulled out a banner that said</i>
<i>"R-R-R-Ripstein. This is your year."</i>

381
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,991
And I was going, "Are you sure? Are you sure?
Would you check the puzzle?"

382
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,001
And they were checking. "No, no. It—"

383
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,597
And I was just sobbing.
It was so great.

384
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,905
<i> In a dramatic,</i>
<i>come-from-behind, last-second victory...</i>

385
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,911
<i>Ellen is the winner.</i>

386
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,676
- Are they sure?
<i>- Hollywood couldn't have scripted a better finish.</i>

387
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,378
Are you sure?

388
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,986
<i>You know, it is a kind of nerdy thing,</i>
<i>but it's</i>—<i>it's neat.</i>

389
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,121
Although, I had a boyfriend once
who was just—

390
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,428
You know, he would sort of
try to put me down...

391
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,435
and I would say, "Well, what are you
the best in the country at?"

392
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,404
You know? At least, I'm...
worth something.

393
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,312
Mmm, let's see.

394
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,320
Let's say "trysts."

395
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,983
This can't be a "U" anymore. Um.

396
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,059
Is "redtop" a word? "Redtop"?

397
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,397
Well, I think it's a word,
but I'm sitting in here.

398
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,927
In a second, I will go in the other room
and look it up just to see.

399
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,573
First we'll look in the little dictionary.

400
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,305
<i>'Cause that's where</i>
<i>we want it to be.</i>

401
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,042
If it's common enough
to be in a little dictionary, then it's—

402
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,550
Then we got somethin'.

403
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,553
"Redtop.

404
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:26,148
"A grass grown in the cooler parts
of North America...

406
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,689
I'll bet you
our lawn guy knows that word.

407
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,756
<i>I'm going to show you something</i>
<i>that I don't show many people.</i>

408

And this is only because
you asked very, very politely.

<i>a record of my time every day.</i>

410

And I do this...
because I'm an obsessive creep...

411
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,211
and I do this because I'm a nerd, and I do it
because I'm competing with myself.

412
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,775
<i>But I'm also doing it to kind of measure</i>
<i>my mental deterioration</i>—

413
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,912
to see how much slower I get
over the years...

414
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:01,687
uh, to see how close I am getting
to actually losing my marbles.

415

at the <i>New York Times.</i>

417
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,832
Um, that's a job that's called
the ombudsman at many other papers.

418
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:15,134
The <i>Times</i> being the <i>Times,</i> they have to have
a more pretentious title, so I was Public Editor.

419
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,369
<i>I can say this more easily</i>
<i>now that I no longer work there.</i>

420
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:22,311
I think I can say with more credibility,
the <i>Times</i> is the most important
news medium in the worid.

421
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,407
<i>There's nothing else like it,</i>
<i>and the puzzle fits into that.</i>

422
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,418
<i>There's no other puzzle like it.</i>

423
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,614
I don't think you would find anybody—
If you walked into that room in Stamford...

424
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,818
and you asked any of 500 people there,
"What's your favorite puzzle?"

425
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:39,330
They'd all say the <i>Times,</i>
because it's the gold standard,
as the way that I think the newspaper—

426
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,388
Although the newspaper may do
many things wrong...

427
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,457
it's the gold standard
of American newspapers too.

428
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,766
<i>One of the things that was interesting to me</i>
<i>once I started going to Stamford...</i>

429
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,604
<i>was realizing what was the nature</i>
<i>of the person who is really great.</i>

430
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:54,475
I don't mean good, like me,
at an amateur level, but really, really great.

431
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,346
And overwhelmingly, the two professional
groups that seem to dominate...

432
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,475
<i>are musicians</i>
<i>and people in the math professions.</i>

433
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,579
<i>And by that I mean computer programmers,</i>
<i>actuaries, auditors and such.</i>

434
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,682
<i>I've asked people, "What would you think</i>—
<i>Who would you think would be the best?"</i>

435
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,728
And they say, oh, copy editors
or history teachers or English teachers.

436
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,729
But, no, it's these two groups.

437
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,265
What I think it is
is their ability to assimilate...

438
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,996
a lot of-of-of coded information instantly.

439
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,004
In other words, a piano player,
likeJon Delfin...

440
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,165
the greatest crossword puzzler
of our time.

441
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:26,574
<i>He sits down, and he sees three staffs of music,</i>
<i>and he can instantly play it.</i>

442
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,672
<i>He's taken all those notes, and he's absorbed</i>
<i>what they mean instantaneously.</i>

443
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,185
<i>And if you have that kind</i>
<i>of a cast of mind...</i>

444
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:38,712
<i>and then add to it a lot of, you know,</i>
<i>a wide range of sort of ordinary...</i>

445
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,157
and extraordinary information—
and if you can spell—

446
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,354
you'd be a really great crossword puzzler.

447
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,762
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
No. Four minutes and five seconds.

448
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,766
That's pretty good.

449
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,429
<i> One across.</i>
<i>A three-letter word. "Doberman doc."</i>

450
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,271
<i>Four across. A four-letter word.</i>
<i>"Antony of antiquity."</i>

451
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,108
<i>Eight across.</i>
<i>A five-letter word. "Match play"?</i>

452
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,218
<i>Whatever image that I had of myself</i>
<i>when I was younger...</i>

453
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,731
<i>about what I would be at 50</i>
<i>or in general as a grown-up...</i>

454
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,324
<i>it's not what happened.</i>

455
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,234
<i>Um, I was on the academic track</i>
<i>when I was in school...</i>

456
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,172
and-and I was supposed to be a lawyer
or a teacher or an accountant.

457
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,233
And-And somehow I'm a piano player.

458
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,541
How did that happen?

459
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,844
<i>I've been solving puzzles</i>
<i>since I'm a kid.</i>

460
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,218
<i>Give me spaces that need to be filled in</i>
<i>and I want to fill them in.</i>

461
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,417
<i>I started competing in 1985...</i>

462
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,426
and did okay.

463
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,428
<i>The year after that,</i>
<i>I made it into the final...</i>

464
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,430
<i>and I've been there</i>
<i>every year since.</i>

465
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,022
<i>You give the accompanist your music.</i>

466
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,160
"Here you go. I will be singing 'Gimme Gimme'
from <i>Thoroughly Modern Millie. "</i>

467
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,569
- "On My Own" from <i>Les Misérables.</i>
- "Rock of Rages" from <i>Leader of the Pack.</i>

468
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,573
"Where the Boys Are"
by Connie Francis.

469
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,041
"La Isla Bonita" by Madonna.

470
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:10,138
"Crossword Puzzle" by Maltby and Shire.
It's from <i>Starting Here, Starting Now.</i>

471
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:15,312
<i>#I am sitting here doing</i>
<i>the Sunday</i> Times <i>crossword puzzle #</i>

472
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,219
# Somehow the words won't come #

473
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,452
<i>#I am staring at squares</i>
<i>but my eyes never focus #</i>

474
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,460
<i>#And my mind's feeling strangely numb ##</i>

475
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,621
<i>It's sort oflike dealing with puzzles.</i>

476
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,962
<i>Because I'll show up in a room</i>
<i>like I am today...</i>

477
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,594
<i>and people will hand me a piece of music</i>
<i>that I may have never seen before...</i>

478
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,865
<i>or heard before</i>
<i>or even heard ofbefore...</i>

479
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,931
<i>and I have to play it for them</i>
<i>right away.</i>

480
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,035
I don't get to rehearse it.
I don't get to even think about it.

481
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,309
<i>So I get to solve this little puzzle</i>
<i>for 90 seconds.</i>

482
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:55,085
<i> A lot of sitting at the piano</i>
<i>and playing for people when they walk in...</i>

483
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,857
a lot of that is really craft
and-and-and-and trickery.

484
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,694
<i>But I was in a room one day</i>
<i>and somebody came in...</i>

485
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,758
<i>and brought in one of my favorite songs</i>—
<i>"It Might As Well Be Spring."</i>

486
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,805
<i>She started to sing it.</i>
<i>I could tell that she knew the song...</i>

487
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,806
<i>and she really knew what she was doing.</i>

488
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,570
<i>So I started to reharmonize it a little bit.</i>

489
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:17,547
And she sang the song
like we'd been doing it for years.

490
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,674
And when we were finished...

491
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:24,017
she turned away
from the people at the table...

492
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,319
and she said to me,
"That was beautiful."

493
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,328
<i>When there's no rehearsal...</i>

494
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:36,265
<i>when a stranger walks into a room with</i>
<i>a piece of music that I've never heard...</i>

495
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,566
and puts it in front of me
and I play it and the singer sings it...

496
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,573
and we manage to connect...

497
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,168
<i>l</i>— <i>I resist the word "art,"</i>
<i>but it's art.</i>

498
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,592
I like this puzzle.

499
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,402
Well, it's not one of my funniest
puzzles in the worid...

500
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:19,307
but I think if it's, um—

501
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,368
I think it's fine
for a Monday or a Tuesday.

502
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,041
<i> A great puzzle</i>
<i>is based on an original idea.</i>

503
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,108
It takes that theme.
It's fresh, it's novel, it's fun.

504
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:33,385
It carries the idea through to its limit,
whatever that limit is.

505
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,450
Just one more note about projecting
the presidential results...

506
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,495
before all the polls are closed.

507
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,054
For a while today,
before any polls closed...

508
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,761
we thought the <i>New York Times</i>
had been particularly flagrant.

509
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,532
<i>Take a look at the</i> Times
<i>crossword puzzle.</i>

510
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,972
<i>The clues is the same</i>
<i>for numbers 39 and 43 across.</i>

511
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:59,349
<i>Thirty-nine across</i>— <i>"Clinton."</i>
<i>Forty-three across</i>— <i>"Elected."</i>

512
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,682
<i>But surely the</i> Times <i>wouldn't</i>
<i>go out on a limb like that.</i>

513
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,121
<i>No. The crossword editor</i>
<i>is much too diabolical.</i>

514
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,217
<i>So rearrange a few words</i>
<i>and the answer to 39 and 43 across is</i>—

515
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,855
<i>"Bob Dole elected."</i>

516
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,992
<i>In this, uh, election day '96 puzzle...</i>

517
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,003
uh, to make it clever...

518
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,699
<i>it was</i> blank <i>"elected."</i>

519
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,471
<i>And</i> blank <i>is seven letters, and it could</i>
<i>be "Clinton"or it could be "Bob Dole."</i>

520
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:31,072
<i>And it turns out it can be both,</i>
<i>because they figured out seven...</i>

521
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,140
<i>down-word answers...</i>

522
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:37,916
<i>where at each point,</i>
<i>the corresponding letter fit the clue.</i>

523
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,924
<i>So in the first one, it could "B"or "C"...</i>

524
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,926
<i>and the second could be "O"or "L"...</i>

525
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,053
<i>the third one could be "B"or "l"...</i>

526
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,462
<i>the fourth one would be "D"or "N."</i>

527
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,502
<i>I mean, that's an amazing thing, you know,</i>
<i>just to be able to think of that.</i>

528
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,902
<i>Half the time I do these things just to see</i>
<i>what people are thinking about.</i>

529
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,407
<i>So I worked it and I made a copy</i>
<i>and sent it to Dole...</i>

530
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,809
<i>after calling him and telling him</i>
<i>we both won after all.</i>

531
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,178
<i> Of course, the whole election</i>
<i>of'96 was a puzzle to me.</i>

532
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,912
<i>I got the early edition</i>
<i>of the</i> Times <i>that day, and I won.</i>

533
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,978
So, of course,
I liked the earlier edition.

534
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,989
But then he got the regular edition...

535
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:17,255
and he also got
four more years in the White House.

536
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,991
<i> The Sunday</i> Times <i>crossword</i>
<i>puzzle had a reputation ofbeing formidable.</i>

537
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,432
<i>And at some point in my life,</i>
<i>we began to get the Sunday</i> Times.

538
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,300
<i>And when I was president, I think</i>
<i>I worked more than ever before.</i>

539
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,365
<i>I worked no telling how many hundreds</i>
<i>and hundreds of crossword puzzles.</i>

540
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,410
<i>Well, yeah, I find it very relaxing,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

541
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,708
And l— I really found it relaxing
in the White House.

542
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,582
Because, you know, just for a moment you
just take your mind of whatever you're doing.

543
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,486
I sometimes did them at lunch
if I was eating alone.

544
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:51,326
<i>Sometimes you have to go at a problem the way</i>
<i>I go at a complicated crossword puzzle.</i>

545
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,627
Sometimes I picked up the Saturday
<i>New York Times</i> crossword puzzle...

546
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:59,466
and I'll go through way over half the clues
before I'll know the answer to one.

547
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,938
And then you start with what you know
the answer to and you just build on it.

548
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,908
And eventually,
you can unravel the whole puzzle.

549
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,674
And so, I rarely work a puzzle
of any difficulty...

550
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,944
from one across and one down
all the way to the end...

551
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,144
in a totally logical fashion.

552
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,813
And I think a lot of difficult,
complex problems are like that.

553
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,017
You have to find some aspect of it
you understand and build on it...

554
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:25,586
until you can unravel the mystery
that you're trying to understand.

555
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,690
<i>Nearly anybody can learn</i>
<i>nearly anything they need to know.</i>

556
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,295
<i>Nature has something to do with it, but</i>
<i>I think nurture has something to do with it.</i>

557
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:39,071
<i>I mean, I think nature</i>
<i>made Einstein's massive brain...</i>

558
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,271
<i>and made him what he was.</i>

559
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:47,750
But nurture can make nearly everyone
seem to be above average intelligence...

560
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,049
if they have the right
sort of nurturing early...

561
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,784
as well as the right kind of formal schooling
and academic challenges...

562
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:58,557
and adults who believe in them
when they're children.

563
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:04,499
I really believe it's a little bit of both,
but I think most of us are, um—

564
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,936
we're all capable of doing more
than we think.

565
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,104
Thirty-one. "Animal
on a Florida license plate."

566
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,668
That's a manatee.
I know that.

567
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,882
<i>"Member of the E.U." Three letters.</i>

568
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:23,184
<i>A four-letter word for "a Syrian foe."</i>

569
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,848
<i>Eight-letter word for "a pizza order."</i>

570
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,626
<i>Average time for a Sunday</i>
New York Times...

571
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,492
<i>I'd guess on the six to eight</i>
<i>minute range.</i>

572
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,724
Let's rock. Go.

573
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,999
<i>I'm Tyler Hinman here at Rensselaer</i>
<i>Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.</i>

574
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,701
<i>And, uh, we got coming up in three weeks</i>
<i>the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament.</i>

575
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,068
<i>I started out in puzzles</i>
<i>way back in the day.</i>

576
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,047
<i>I had a magazine called</i>
Children's Fun Puzzles, <i>you know...</i>

577
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,175
where you had rhymes you had to figure out—
a fat cat rhyme, something like that.

578
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,220
<i>Fill in the blanks of those words.</i>

579
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,222
<i>And then in ninth grade, I got handed</i>
<i>a crossword during a study hall.</i>

580
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,918
I did it, failed miserably
and I was hooked.

581
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,828
<i> Artificial intelligence is</i>
<i>the attempt to engineer machines...</i>

582
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,166
- that are as smart as we are.
<i>- Is there a computer program...</i>

583
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,138
that can solve the <i>New York Times</i>
crossword puzzle?

584
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:19,176
- Not perfectly.
<i>- What do you mean, not perfectly?</i>

585
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,337
Because there's a lot of—
They try to get in new fresh clues...

586
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,847
and they use wordplay, which is obviously
very difficult for a computer.

587
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,508
<i>- So your answer's no.</i>
- Right.

588
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,485
I would suspect that people who are
really good at crossword puzzles...

589
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,955
do these under severe time constraints,
do them very rapidly.

590
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,118
Uh, these are probably
very, very intelligent people.

591
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,424
Yeah, if you reference pop culture
or something like that...

592
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,727
or if you use wordplay or pop culture,
it's very difficult for a computer to figure out.

593
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,427
<i>- It does slow you down as well, right?</i>
- A little bit, yeah.

594
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,268
If I hadn't heard of it, that would probably be,
"Oh, I don't know that one."

595
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,103
- You can solve it perfectly.
<i>- Most of the time.</i>

596
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:55,669
- So in this particular arena, humans
are still superior to machines.
<i>- Indeed.</i>

597
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:59,842
<i>There probably is an element of</i>
<i>what we would call "fluid intelligence."</i>

598
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,882
<i>Why puzzles?</i>

599
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,588
I don't know.

600
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:16,122
It's, uh, just the way it worked out.
It's kind of the way I'm wired.

601
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,702
<i>Like with video games</i>
<i>and that kind of thing...</i>

602
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,933
<i>I tend to get a little, uh</i>—
<i>I guess psychotic is the word.</i>

603
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:28,138
Like if l— if I don't do well in something
and I feel like I should be doing well...

604
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,409
then, you know, l—
that really gets to me.

605
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:35,213
<i>Anyone who spends their life</i>
<i>doing something they genuinely enjoy...</i>

606
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,277
<i>whether it's for a lot of money or not...</i>

607
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,722
<i>especially if they're living hand-to-mouth,</i>
<i>having trouble making a living...</i>

608
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,986
as long as they're doing what they like,
I have great respect for that.

609
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,994
I think everyone should do that.

610
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:50,090
<i> Being rational creatures,</i>
<i>we-we arejust intrinsically driven...</i>

611

to solve these kinds of problems.

612
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,831
And, uh, I would suspect the most
rational among us...

613
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,068
<i>tend to be even drawn to them</i>
<i>like an addiction.</i>

614
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,805
<i> Yeah, I guess it's kind of a gift,</i>
<i>but it's one I've worked for.</i>

615
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,177
<i>I got good predominantly</i>
<i>because I practiced...</i>

616
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,580
<i>and I just</i>— <i>I care about it</i>
<i>and I had the drive.</i>

617
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,778
Done.

618
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,447
<i>Hey, Merl, this is Will.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

619
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,150
I think this is probably a Tuesday
rather than a Monday.

620
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,216
Uh, but that's perfectly fine.

621
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,560
And you know, if you'd, uh, um, want to
send me a few clues that are slightly harder...

622
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,861
so I can run this on a Tuesday,
that's great.

623
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,834
But really, this is just, uh—
it's just great work.

624
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:30,033
And, uh, so the answer is yes.
Turn off your plans to do another puzzle.

625
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,837
And, uh, I'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

626
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,502
Uh, this is a Merl Reagle,
and he's very, very good.

627
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,606
He's one of the very best constructors.
But this is a waste of his talent.

628
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,653
He should be a Friday and Saturday guy
'cause he's really so clever.

629
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,214
Using Reagle on Tuesday is like using
Barry Bonds in Little League.

630
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:52,024
<i> His on-base percentage</i>
<i>now is better than.560.</i>

631
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:57,432
<i>Little will argue now</i>
<i>that he's the game's best player.</i>

632
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,197
<i>Three balls, two strikes and one out.</i>

633
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,399
<i>Here's the pitch from Mussina.</i>
<i>Swung on and missed! Strike three!</i>

634
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,635
<i>Mussina strikes out Bonds.</i>

635
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,909
<i> Pitching is probably more than</i>
<i>50% mental and the rest being physical.</i>

636
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,279
<i>I think I first started</i>
<i>doing 'em in college.</i>

637
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,342
<i>The school paper</i>
<i>actually had a puzzle in it.</i>

638
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,853
<i>And that's how we got started</i>
<i>working on 'em.</i>

639
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:22,586
And, uh, at the beginning, obviously, uh,
I knew very little, and it was hard for me to do.

640
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,221
<i>And you just have to keep doing 'em.</i>
<i>And it's been now 15-plus years.</i>

641
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,765
<i>And now, uh, I try to do one</i>
<i>as often as I can.</i>

642
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,893
<i>A brilliant performance by Mike Mussina.</i>

643
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,928
<i>A complete-game shutout.</i>
<i>Yankees win 5-0.</i>

644
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,237
<i> Well, every time I go out</i>
<i>on the mound, I want to finish the game.</i>

645
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,972
<i>It only happens occasionally,</i>
<i>and those games are really special.</i>

646
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,573
<i>Puzzles can be the same way.</i>
<i>You can go through it to a certain point...</i>

647
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,777
<i>and then you bring in help</i>
<i>from behind you to help close it out.</i>

648
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,287
<i>Those days are fun too.</i>
<i>Sometimes we'll sit down as a group...</i>

649
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,687
and try to plow through it
as fast as we can.

650
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,488
<i>So whoever's doing the writing</i>
<i>doesn't even get to look at the clues.</i>

651
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,723
<i>Theyjust</i>— <i>They're writing so fast because</i>
<i>three people are leaning over your shoulder...</i>

652
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,731
<i>firing out answers at you.</i>

653
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:06,031
<i>The puzzle, whether it's the</i> Times
<i>or any other puzzle we get to pick up, is...</i>

654
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,037
for me, a ball-season thing.

655
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:11,666
And, uh, the <i>Times</i> puzzle
is the ultimate puzzle.

656
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,542
<i>It's the one that everybody who does puzzles</i>
<i>tries to get to the level that they can do this one.</i>

657
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,638
<i>If you can do this puzzle...</i>

658
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,980
<i>I can tell you you can probably do</i>
<i>any puzzle they throw at you.</i>

659
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,053
<i>"Former Yankee Grba,"three letters.</i>

660
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>"Ace," 11 letters.</i>
<i>"Sole attachment,"five letters.</i>

661
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,633
<i>- What's a crossword tournament?</i>
<i>Most people don't know.</i>

662
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,869
<i>It's hard to go back to the gym</i>
<i>and people say, "What'd you do this week?"</i>

663
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,104
And you say, "Well, I won
a crossword puzzle tournament."

664
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,615
And they go, "Oh, yeah. So, uh—"

665
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:55,118
People don't know
how to respond to that.

666
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,850
<i>So I was working near Times Square</i>
<i>before the "Disneyfication"of it...</i>

667
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,018
<i>I was going to work</i>
<i>and working on puzzles all day.</i>

668
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,893
<i>And then I was coming home</i>
<i>and I was doing puzzle work on the side...</i>

669
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,159
<i>to try and earn some extra income.</i>

670
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,862
So my life was pretty much nothing but
puzzles for about a year and a half there.

671
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,930
<i>I needed more of a non-puzzle scene</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

672
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,498
<i>And I thought the only way</i>
<i>I'm gonna force myself to get that...</i>

673
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,341
<i>is to move back to where</i>
<i>there is no puzzle scene.</i>

674
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:26,747
So I moved down here to Fort Lauderdale
where I already had some friends...

675
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,012
and I liked the weather and so forth.

676
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:33,489
And I've been very happy here.
And I plan to stay here, you know, indefinitely.

677
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,195
<i>- Oh.</i>
- That wasn't pretty.

678
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,132
- All right.
- Good ball.

679
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,363
Go get 'em, dear.
Don't steal my multi-ball.

680
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,429
<i>I'm Brian Dominy.</i>
<i>I grew up in Dublin, Georgia.</i>

681
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,499
<i>I met Trip about two years ago.</i>

682
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,544
We hit it off pretty quickly
after we met.

683
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,240
And, uh, we started dating immediately.

684
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,681
<i>And we moved in together</i>
<i>towards the end of 2004.</i>

685
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,083
<i>You wait. He's gonna win this game.</i>

686
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,981
<i>- Or not.</i>
- Now you jinxed it.

687
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,424
Good. You deserved it
after that last one.

688
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,322
- All right, well, that was a rare victory.
- Well done.

689
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,491
- Yes. Well, done, dear.
- Yes.

690
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,798
<i>He's just an incredibly driven</i>
<i>and focused person.</i>

691
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,862
When he sets his mind to something,
he's relentless.

692
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,671
<i>He does all that he can to make sure that</i>
<i>he wins. I mean, it's all about winning.</i>

693
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,180
<i>He really wouldn't be doing this</i>
<i>ifhe didn't want to win so badly.</i>

694
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,740
<i> When I won, I was</i>
<i>the youngest person to ever win.</i>

695
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,752
<i>And, uh, at the moment,</i>
<i>I still have that record.</i>

696
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,118
<i>I was 24 when I won.</i>
<i>It was great.</i>

697
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,657
<i>It was something I'd been hoping to do</i>
<i>for a number of years...</i>

698
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,956
<i>and, uh, it was just great</i>
<i>to fulfill that.</i>

699
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,289
4:50.

700
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,796
<i>That took me a bit longer</i>
<i>than I expected.</i>

701
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,830
<i>It was a hard puzzle. Uh, there were</i>
<i>a lot of very tricky clues in that.</i>

702
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,504
<i>And there was at least one entry where,</i>
<i>after I filled it in...</i>

703
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,812
I had to stare at it for several seconds
to figure out what it meant.

704
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,752
Galionegee.
G- A-L-I-O-N-G-E-E.

705
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,517
A man-of-war's man.

706
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,822
That is—
That means nothing to me.

707
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,385
<i>You know, if I'm going out with Brian</i>
<i>somewhere or something...</i>

708
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,159
I try to turn the word part
of my brain off...

709
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,599
and just relax and have fun
and not think about work.

710
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,638
But still, I mean, there's a part of me
where it's always on.

711
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,731
I mean...

712
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,801
I remember the first time we went by someplace
that had the word "intercoastal" on it.

713
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,075
I pointed out that that was an anagram
of the word "altercations."

714
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:42,175
Um, it's nice being with somebody
who can appreciate that.

715
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,881
<i> Trip is a little intimidating</i>
<i>at first because he is so bright.</i>

716
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,256
<i>Um, when I first met him, I admit</i>
<i>I was a little intimidated myself.</i>

717
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,353
But the more we got to talking,
uh, the more I got to know him.

718
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,594
He's really just a genuine, uh—
genuinely sweet guy.

719
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,126
I've always been intrigued
by the letter "Q." but, uh—

720
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,663
And some letters are just boring, you know.
"N" is a boring letter, but—

721
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,609
<i>"Q"is, of course, most commonly</i>
<i>followed by a "U."</i>

722
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,136
But there are a lot of exceptions. You have to
be careful about that when you're solving.

723
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,616
Because otherwise, you'll end up
with a country "quitar" or Q-tips...

724
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,846
or something like that.

725
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,321
Uh, "on the Q.T."
Or "I.Q. Test."

726
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,986
But, uh, uh, Q's a very good letter.

727
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:29,062
<i> My predecessor</i>
<i>was 36 years older than me.</i>

728
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:34,503
<i>And anytime you saw any modern culture</i>
<i>in the old puzzles, it just came as a shock.</i>

729
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,698
<i>"What's a TVshow doing in here?"</i>

730
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,299
<i>And really,</i>
<i>puzzles didn't really have that.</i>

731
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:43,335
My feeling was crosswords should have
everything that's being covered in the <i>Times.</i>

732
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:46,611
And, of course, that's gonna be
classical music and art and history...

733
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,743
<i>and old subjects like that.</i>

734
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:54,280
<i>But it includes sports, popular music,</i>
<i>movies, TV, cartoons, everything.</i>

735
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,349
Why, there it is.

736
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,988
<i>One of the things you have to do is get rid</i>
<i>of the rest of the paper when you do this...</i>

737
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,363
'cause by then, it's not important
in your life any longer.

738
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:08,770
<i> # Can you find the hidden "H"</i>
<i>where it's hiding #</i>

739
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:12,104
<i>#Is it on the ground</i>
<i>or in the sky #</i>

740
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,667
You always fold it over.
You have to fold it over.

741
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:19,512
I got to tell you. I mean, I was gonna do it in—
in pencil, but it's Tuesday.

742
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,484
Yeah, that's right.
What do you think of that?

743
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,080
Sometimes we make our band members
use pencils, I've noticed.

744
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,284
- Why do we do that?
- 'Cause we don't trust them.

745
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,759
Very bravely, I'm a pen guy, actually.

746
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:36,129
Uh, and, uh, it comes back
to haunt you once in a while.

747
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,604
- All right.
- Here we go.

748
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,768
You know what, I'm so confident,
I'm gonna do it in glue stick.

749
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,811
<i>"I.C.B.M."is the first answer.</i>

750
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,780
And his clue is "warhead weapon briefly."
Seems all right.

751
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,876
"Warhead weapon briefly"? It's gotta be
"I.C.B.M." Come on. Everybody goes for that.

752
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,945
"Warhead weapon."

753
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,788
It's gotta be an I.C.B.M. Or a M.R.
Gotta be "I.C.B.M."

754
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,422
This is probably "Norma Rae."
R- A-E.

755
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,160
"She helped Theseus
escape the labyrinth."

756
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:15,035
Don't get— Don't get cute with me, Will,
'cause I'll come over there.

757
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:19,974
"East northeast is 737 heading, perhaps."
And he's abbreviated "perhaps."

758
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,034
East north—

759
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,147
- East.
- East northeast.

760
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,207
This is the standard crossword position.

761
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,753
<i>"Never On Sunday</i> star."
"Melina Mercouri."

762
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,187
You have to be old like I am
to remember that movie.

763
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,055
So you lean back, you put it
on your knee and fill it in.

764
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,290
"Main arteries"? How can that
not be "aortas"? How can it not?

765
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,128
No, it's not?
"F" it is.

766
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,134
Come on! Bring it!

767
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,501
"Cross swords." "To duel with," yes.

768
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:52,633
- "Duel with."
- "Cross"—

769
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,734
- "Cross swords."
- Yeah.

770
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,545
And—wait.
"Duel with" is "cross swords"...

771
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,949
which is also "crosswords."

772
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,218
So they're playing with us here.
Um, that's wonderful.

773
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,852
<i>"Duel"? "Cross swords."</i>
<i>See, what you've done here, Will...</i>

774
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,658
if I may, the triple "S."

775
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,925
You think that's cute?
That's not cute.

776
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,990
I can take you
with your triple consonants.

777
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:22,402
<i> It's wordplay. It's not too hard,</i>
<i>but it's very clever.</i>

778
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:28,035
And there's the wordplay or the word
"word" in all the big clues, like "Playa del Rey."

779
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,045
That's what's going on here.

780
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,978
Now wait a minute.
What the—

781
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:37,715
<i># Can you find them</i>
<i>Here they are ##</i>

782
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,331
<i> I get there, like, around</i>
<i>3:00 or 4:00 on a Friday.</i>

783
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:52,835
<i>You check in. It's usually snowing</i>
<i>out or everybody's freezing</i>
<i>when they come in the front door.</i>

784
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,064
<i>It's like you haven't</i>
<i>seen anybody for a year.</i>

785
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,072
Everybody's doing,
"Boy, it's great to see you."

786
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,267
<i>It's not just the warmth of the hotel.</i>

787
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,437
<i>It's the warmth of all these people</i>
<i>coming together, you know...</i>

788
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:08,382
<i>gonna be sharing in this little</i>
<i>orgy of puzzling for 48 solid hours.</i>

789
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:13,981
<i>After 28 years, the Stamford Marriott</i>
<i>is, uh, a very special place.</i>

790
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:18,391
<i>There are so many wonderful memories</i>
<i>tied up in this hotel...</i>

791
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,987
<i>that it's a great place to walk into.</i>

792
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,330
Without him, we'd just be at home
doing puzzles like everybody else.

793
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,427
<i> It's a family reunion.</i>

794
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:31,804
<i>It's the screwed-up crossword family</i>
<i>getting together.</i>

795
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,673
<i> Crossword puzzle solving</i>
<i>is such a solitary pursuit...</i>

796
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:40,012
<i>that when you're in a room with other</i>
<i>people who love it the same way you do...</i>

797
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,381
it's like finding a lost tribe.

798
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:46,411
<i> You see people that you don't</i>
<i>see often, and it's a nice camaraderie.</i>

799
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,015
<i>I think it's friendly competition.</i>

800
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,084
Although if someone's plane couldn't
get here because of the weather...

801
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,461

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,352
<i>Here are the rules of the competition.</i>
<i>There are seven puzzles that everyone does.</i>

829
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,866
<i>There's no elimination in this tournament.</i>
<i>Everyone does all seven puzzles.</i>

830
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,424
<i>We'll start the clock.</i>
<i>That will be our official time.</i>

831
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,097
<i>If you finish a puzzle early,</i>
<i>raise your hand...</i>

832
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,697
<i>a referee will come by,</i>
<i>pick up your paper.</i>

833
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,677
<i>You get, uh, 10 points for every answer</i>
<i>that you enter correctly.</i>

834
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:53,114
<i>Twenty-five bonus points for each full minute</i>
<i>by which you beat the time limit.</i>

835
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:57,119
<i>If either you leave a letter out</i>
<i>or you make a mistake...</i>

836
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,553
<i>that will cost you 195 points.</i>

837
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:03,491
<i>The champions generally spend</i>
<i>a little extra time after they finish a puzzle...</i>

838
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,723
<i>Iooking it over, making sure</i>
<i>that every square is filled...</i>

839
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,096
<i>and that nothing silly</i>
<i>has been put in a square.</i>

840
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,828
Everyone ready?

841
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,914
<i>#Saturday morning #</i>

842
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,922
<i># Who's gonna play with me #</i>

843
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,857
<i># 6:00 in the morning, baby #</i>

844
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,329
<i>#I got a long, long day ahead of me #</i>

845
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,027
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

846
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:52,301
<i># The parents are sleeping soundly #</i>

847
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,072
<i># The neighbors are dead as wood #</i>

848
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:00,105
<i>#I'm getting up and coming over #</i>

849
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:03,209
<i># We gotta rock the neighborhood #</i>

850
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,813
<i>#Nothing's ever gonna</i>
<i>happen 'round here #</i>

851
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,724
<i>#If we don't make it happen #</i>

852
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,127
<i>#Sleep away the day if you want to #</i>

853
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:18,861
<i>#But I got something</i>
<i>that I gotta do ##</i>

854
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,978
<i> I'm actually not keeping</i>
<i>track of anything this year.</i>

855
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:32,514
I forgot to write down my time
on the first puzzle.

856
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,142
And I say, "Okay, that's a sign."

857
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:39,882
Hopefully, I didn't screw that one up,
'cause that would—Yeah.

858
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,584
If I did screw up, I don't want to
find out about it till much later...

859
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,991
so I'm just not totally deflated
for the rest of the tournament.

860
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,428
<i> I felt good on that puzzle. I think</i>
<i>I might have been the first one to finish.</i>

861
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,432
<i>I finished right before the minute.</i>

862
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,300
So if you finish at 2:53 and you take
10 seconds, you're gonna lose a whole minute.

863
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,135
<i>So I just raised my hand and turned it in</i>
<i>and didn't check.</i>

864
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,371
<i>So if I made a stupid mistake on that, then</i>
<i>it's all over. So hopefully, I didn't, but</i>—

865
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,005
I had to erase too many times. I mean,
obviously, one across, I think everybody—

866
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:07,242
- Which one was that one?
- "Part of Q. E.D."

867
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,251
Oh, right.

868
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,253
<i>I just missed the minute.</i>

869
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,552
But that's, you know, ohh!

870
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,522
<i>- Thirty-one, right?</i>
<i>- 1005.</i>
<i>- 645.</i>

871
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,496
- 840.
- 2110.

872
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,624
<i>We're entering for each puzzle...</i>

873
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,294
the number of words and letters
the contestant got wrong...

874
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,430
and the number of minutes
ahead of the deadline he or she finished.

875
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,737
<i>The faster you are, uh,</i>
<i>the higher your score is.</i>

876
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,505
<i>But if you make errors,</i>
<i>that detracts from your score.</i>

877
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,570
These are done.
Kindling? Who needs kindling?

878
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,275
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

879
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,921
<i>Oh, here's a question. If you finished</i>
<i>that one at two seconds</i>—

880
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,924
- Shoot it up.
- You would—

881
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,926
- You gotta. You gotta.
- Just go for it.

882
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,725
Before I look at the clock, I check for blanks.
Not for errors, but for blanks.

883
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,629
'Cause those are obvious.
You can see those right away.

884
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,067
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

885
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:35,268
<i>This is a 25-minute puzzle</i>
<i>by David Kahn.</i>

886
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,865
<i>But this is the puzzle that's</i>
<i>gonna rip your heart out.</i>

887
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,004
<i>Everyone ready?</i>
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

888
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,145
<i>Oh, a piece of cake.</i>

889
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,147
- Everybody loved it, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

890
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,547
No hard words.

891
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,108
I got about two words into it and boom,
my head exploded.

892
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,018
So it's all over for me.

893
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:02,320
<i>Uh, I lost time on that one.</i>
<i>I got really stuck on one side.</i>

894
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,657
So I was three minutes behind
Trip and Tyler.

895
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:10,291
<i>So right now I'd say I'm gonna have to</i>
<i>do some catch up on 'em to make the finals.</i>

896
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,531
Yeah, it was real hard. It was, uh—
I mean the theme wasn't that bad. It was—

897
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:18,506
<i>It was actually pretty gettable from the title.</i>
<i>It was three-letter abbreviations...</i>

898
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,009
<i>for the days added into normal phrases.</i>

899
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,274
<i>So, like, "electronic lock"</i>
<i>became "electronic wedlock"...</i>

900
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,282
<i>or "set pieces"became "sunset pieces."</i>

901
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,342
<i>But the</i>— <i>the one for "Tuesday"</i>—

902
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,787
<i>They changed "batboy"</i>
<i>into "battue boy"</i>— <i>B- A-T-T-U-E.</i>

903
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,257
<i>I've never heard of that word in my life.</i>
<i>So I was</i>—

904
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:38,920
When I left, I was convinced
I had an error in the puzzle...

905
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,293
'cause there's something
that wasn't clickin', but, um...

906
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,958
apparently there's no errors,
but it was still— still slow.

907
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,393
<i>Oh, that one was a toughie.</i>

908
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,304
Only had three minutes left.
That's unusual for me.

909
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,308
But I just hope it was accurate.

910
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:58,507
Hmm, I think I'm okay,
you know, but... I'll find out later on.

911
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,687
<i> It's always possible</i>
<i>I made careless mistakes I didn't know about.</i>

912
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,689
<i>Uh</i>—<i>So I don't know.</i>

913
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:12,694
<i>Uh, we'll see tomorrow morning</i>
<i>when the interim scores are posted.</i>

914
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,253
Um, you know—
I don't think I'm 90th...

915
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,697
but, you know, you never know.

916
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,498
<i>Tomorrow means everything.</i>
<i> I am going to go in...</i>

917
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:26,531
uh, maybe play a game,
await a phone call...

918
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:31,171
and, uh— I don't know— try not to think about
how little sleep I'm probably gonna get.

919
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,977
<i>Our next performer is our</i>—<i>a double act:</i>

920
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,883
The Hill-Scallies.

921
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,683
<i>Thanks. Oh, I just want one.</i>

922
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,155
Look, we're a little <i>verklempt.</i>
Talk amongst yourselves.

923
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:50,529
<i>Interestingly that I see them every year,</i>
<i>and they look the same.</i>

924
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,228
I mean, you know them.
They look the same from year to year...

925
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,740
and then I suddenly realize, I've known
these people for 27 years, some of them.

926
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:03,575
They've changed. So have I,
but you don't see the change from year to year.

927
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:10,586
<i>This is hard to say.</i>
<i>In 1981 I lost my husband...</i>

928
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,419
and it was on Sunday afternoon here,
right after the competition.

929
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,925
He had a heart attack.

930
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,019
<i>Some people said, "Do you know,</i>
<i>isn't it hard to come back here?"</i>

931
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:24,829
<i>But he wanted me to do it</i>
<i>and was very proud of the fact that I have won.</i>

932
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:28,234
<i>And in his memory,</i>
<i>I would not stop coming back.</i>

933
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:32,206
<i>But it's a little bit hard for me to walk out</i>
<i>the front of the</i>— <i>front door there.</i>

934
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,505
I like to go out the other way...

935
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:40,106
um, and I can still picture him
coming through the door.

936
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:45,211
<i>There were people who we've lost</i>
<i>who aren't back, and</i>—

937
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:48,883
l—The place is haunted.
I can still see faces of—

938
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:52,485
I can still see people here who—
who are no longer here.

939
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:56,828
Not an unpleasant kind of haunting
for that— in that respect.

940
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:02,497
<i>#Home is where I want to be #</i>

941
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:07,942
<i>- #Pick me up and turn me round #</i>

942
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:13,950
<i>- #I come home, I'm born with a weak heart #</i>

943
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:18,078
<i>#I guess I must be having fun #</i>

944
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:23,888
<i>#But the less we say about it</i>
<i>the better #</i>

945
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,624
<i>#Let's make it up as we go along #</i>

946
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:35,169
<i>#Feet on the ground</i>
<i>Head in the clouds #</i>

947
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,698
<i>#I'm okay</i>
<i>I know nothing's wrong #</i>

948
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,607
<i>#Hi-ho #</i>

949
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,741
<i># Got plenty of time #</i>

950
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,417
<i>#Mmm, here #</i>

951
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,116
<i>#Hi-ho #</i>

952
00:59:55,191 --> 01:00:00,857
<i># You got light in your eyes #</i>

953
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:07,970
<i>#And you're standing here beside me #</i>

954
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:12,474
<i>#I love the passing of time #</i>

955
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:18,913
<i>#Never for money</i>
<i>Always for love #</i>

956
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:22,975
<i># Cover up and say good night #</i>

957
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:27,318
<i>#Say good night #</i>

958
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:34,929
<i>#Home is where I want to be #</i>

959
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,764
<i>#But I guess I'm already there #</i>

960
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:45,905
<i>#I come home</i>
<i>You lifted up your wings #</i>

961
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,741
<i>#I guess this must be the place ##</i>

962
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,183
- I have to make up three minutes.
- And I have four.

963
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,556
I'm just gonna verify the report I just heard.

964
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:09,121
I beat him? I'm in on— on four?
I didn't know that.

965
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,359
Oh, my gosh, a three-way tie.

966
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,699
<i> It's a three-way tie for first.</i>
<i>That's gonna be epic.</i>

967
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,540
<i>What's your strategy now for</i>—

968
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,009
Um, well, I'm going to read every clue.

969
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,249
<i>- This is bizarre.</i>
<i>- What happened?</i>

970
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,950
There's a three-way tie for first place right now.
I thought I was a minute behind Tyler.

971
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,188
Apparently, I got him by a minute on Puzzle 4,
which I didn't know.

972
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,196
So, because of the tie-break rules right now...

973
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,700
I'm in first, Tyler's in second,
and PatrickJordan's in third...

974
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:48,931
<i>but we all have the exact same score, and</i>
<i>we're all three minutes ahead of everybody else.</i>

975
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:54,033
I'm essentially tied for fourth with, uh, Kiran,
uh, but I'm three minutes behind.

976
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,738
There's three people
that are tied for first place.

977
01:01:56,813 --> 01:02:00,408
All I can do is, uh, go as hard as I can
to the last puzzle and— and...

978
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:05,147
you know, if somebody opens the door, great,
but I don't think it's gonna happen.

979
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,357
<i> He is one of the people</i>
<i>who's three minutes behind.</i>

980
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,759
<i>So that means,</i>
<i>because of the tie-break rules...</i>

981
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,027
<i>he would have to beat one of us</i>
<i>by three minutes on this puzzle.</i>

982
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,228
Al's fast, but three minutes
is a tough order for anybody.

983
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:23,636
So, as I say, I think really at this point
it comes down to...

984
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:27,733
<i>the three of us just playing defensively here,</i>
<i>taking an extra minute and doing what it takes...</i>

985
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,973
<i>andjust, uh, hoping we don't make an error.</i>

986
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,175
Well, we think Tyler's
been shorted by a minute.

987
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,244
- On four.
<i>- We'll check it out.</i>

988
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,223
We were lookin' at the scores this morning,
and Trip and I and Tyler...

989
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,282
<i>and everyone had all been pretty much</i>
<i>talking last night...</i>

990
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,624
<i>and we're all pretty sure</i>
<i>Tyler was a minute ahead...</i>

991
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,427
<i>and then Trip— and, uh, Trip was behind</i>
<i>and</i>—<i>by one minute and second.</i>

992
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,298
And then we knew Patrick was probably up there.
We didn't know exactly where.

993
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,167
So then lookin' at the scores this morning,
all three were showing as tied.

994
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,434
<i>And, uh, I wasn't really thinking about it...</i>

995
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,103
<i>'cause I was a little preoccupied with, uh,</i>
<i>where I actually was in the standings.</i>

996
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,112
But, um, I realized this surprised me too...

997
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,774
'cause I'm pretty sure I finished that
between the third and fourth minute.

998
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,786
Doug? Doug?
I'm gonna talk to Doug.

999
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,788
Hopefully it's a moot point.

1000
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:17,417
Yeah, but, you know, it's right to get—
it's right to get this fixed.

1001
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,223
Okay, so give me all the information I need
to do this investigation.

1002
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,491
He's standing right there. Ask him.
You got his contestant number.

1003
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,125
He should get one credit
for one more minute on Puzzle 4.

1004
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:29,638
<i> So it's 25 points.</i>
<i>If I get into the final, it isn't a big deal...</i>

1005
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,572
<i>but if one of the two guys</i>
<i>in fourth and fifth, uh, beats me...</i>

1006
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,974
<i>by three minutes,</i>
<i>then suddenly it becomes a very big deal.</i>

1007
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:39,413
For those of us that keep close track of it,
I mean, we know very well who has what times...

1008
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,416
and we just figured, it ought to be right.

1009
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,181
So, um, I know it's important to Tyler,
so I thought that, um...

1010
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,245
<i>it just seemed like the right thing to do.</i>

1011
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:07,940
All right. I believe we're ready for Puzzle 7.
Judges?

1012
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,310
<i>This is a 45-minute puzzle</i>
<i>by Patrick Merrell.</i>

1013
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,584
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

1014
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,938
<i>- So?</i>
<i>- So, I think I got it.</i>

1015
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,383
I don't know. I'm about to confirm an answer,
but I'm pretty sure it's right.

1016
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,945
I gained— I finished, like, in eight minutes,
so I gained a minute on Trip and Tyler.

1017
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:38,153
But, um, I don't know— I don't know how
Patrick did. I'm sure he was in there too, so—

1018
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:43,426
Um, it wasn't—wasn't that hard of a puzzle,
so I'd— I'd be stunned if anyone made a mistake.

1019
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:47,435
<i>I almost screwed that up a number of times.</i>
<i>I left a square blank until my check, uh...</i>

1020
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,596
so that was good to see.

1021
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:53,073
The only thing that's working against Tyler
potentially is his young age, being only 20.

1022
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,543
I mean, the others on the stage
have had so much more life experience...

1023
01:06:56,612 --> 01:07:00,878
plus they've just solved more puzzles
during their time on Earth than he has.

1024
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,884
- I screwed that up twice. I put "fratern—"
- "Fraternit—"

1025
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,442
- That didn't work.
- And then "frat house."

1026
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,455
- You too? Same mistakes.
- Yes.

1027
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,651
The clue was something like, "where a freshman
might rush," or something like that.

1028
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,717
And I'm like, "Oh, that's easy.
I've been there. 'Fraternity."'

1029
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,628
I got down to the "N,"
and I realized, no, that ain't gonna fit.

1030
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,895
So I erased. It starts with F-R-A,
so I'm, "It's gotta be 'frat' something."

1031
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,163
And I went, "Oh, 'frat house."'
I write in "frat house."

1032
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:25,105
That also turns out to be wrong.
I mean, you gotta be kidding me.

1033
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,665
It was actually "frat party."

1034
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,179
<i>I don't think there's gonna be any surprises.</i>
<i>I think it's gonna be the top three.</i>

1035
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,739
It should be me,
Patrick and, of course, Tyler.

1036
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,286
Ah, phooey.

1037
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,845
Yeah.

1038
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:45,155
Wait. I made up the grid upside down.
Wait, it's okay!

1039
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:50,358
<i>What's going on in the room right now</i>
<i>is that people are double-checking...</i>

1040
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,994
the fastest finishers this morning.

1041
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,233
<i>- We're double-checking</i>
<i>everybody that's 25 and greater right?</i>
- Correct.

1042
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:01,242
<i>Oh, l</i>— <i>There was another error?</i>
<i>There was another error?</i>

1043
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,978
<i>Coming up on 11:00 in the morning. We'rejust</i>
<i>beginning to find out who the finalists may be.</i>

1044
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,848
<i>The excitement is palpable.</i>

1045
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,554
<i>It's the combination oflogic and rage.</i>

1046
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:23,997
On the one hand, everything works out
beautifully, except if it doesn't.

1047
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,399
At which point, of course,
you can just tear the thing up.

1048
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,098
Yeah, the level of player has gotten much higher.
All right, Tyler Hinman—

1049
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,767
<i>I mean, I first met him here when he was 16,</i>
<i>and you couldjust tell, you know...</i>

1050
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:37,244
he was someone
that had that competitive spirit...

1051
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:40,043
and had the speed—
that he was gonna be up there.

1052
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,050
<i>He's just been</i>
<i>absolutely phenomenal this year.</i>

1053
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,315
<i>It used to be Trip. If Trip was on,</i>
<i>nobody could touch him, you know?</i>

1054
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,321
<i>And now Tyler is right there.</i>

1055
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,790
<i>And then Patrick Jordan</i>— <i>I mean,</i>
<i>he didn't always come here, but he's no surprise.</i>

1056
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,829
- Congratulations, Patrick. Well done. Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

1057
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,662
<i>I've been in the finals, like, the last four years,</i>
<i>but I always come in third place.</i>

1058
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,894
So it's— it's kind of embarrassing, you know?

1059
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:04,201
So at least this year I can flail on the final puzzle
in my own, uh, private little worid here.

1060
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,935
I don't have to do it in front of—
in front of everyone.

1061
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:10,604
But, I mean, sure, I'd— I'd love to be up there,
you know? That's always my goal, but...

1062
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,341
you can't do it every year, you know, so—

1063
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:17,875
I told Patrick, since it's not me he would be
up against, he can go ahead and win.

1064
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:23,084
Although I think Tyler is just like a tiger there.
He is so hungry for this.

1065
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,218
<i>This is a very tight matchup.</i>

1066
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,694
Patrick came within one letter
of winning this tournament once.

1067
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,563
If he hadn't made an error, he would have won
the tournament back in the year that Ellen won.

1068
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:35,468
And you've seen what a hotshot Tyler is.
So this really could go any way.

1069
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,597
<i>All right. Here are the results.</i>

1070
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:41,370
<i>Starting in the "A"division,</i>
<i>the top people are all tightly packed together.</i>

1071
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:46,938
In third place at this point,
with 11,840 points...

1072
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,110
<i>- Al Sanders.</i>

1073
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:02,189
<i>In second place</i>—
<i>11,890 points, Trip Payne</i>—

1074
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,391
<i>Whoo!</i>

1075
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,765
<i>And in first place at this point...</i>

1076
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:18,108
<i>with 11, 915 points and only 20 years old...</i>

1077
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,672
<i>- Tyler Hinman.</i>

1078
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,616
<i>Uh, yeah. I just had a little mini heart attack,</i>
<i>as did Tyler, 'cause that</i>—

1079
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,092
when we heard that,
it's like we knew somebody had blown it.

1080
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,152
We didn't know which of the three of us had.

1081
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,528
And, uh, it was Patrick obviously.
We don't know what happened.

1082
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,727
He must have made an error,
because we think he was fast enough, so—

1083
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,895
<i>Who's that?</i>

1084
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,372
- That was my dad.
<i>- What'd he say?</i>

1085
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,432
Uh, just that they're on their way.

1086
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:52,173
Well, right now the "C" final round
is taking place.

1087
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,378
<i>These are people whose</i>—
<i>are at the top of their particular skill division...</i>

1088
01:10:56,452 --> 01:11:01,515
<i>and they've got noise coming in</i>
<i>from earphones that they're wearing...</i>

1089
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,525
<i>so they can't hear anything that's being said,</i>
<i>and it's nerve-racking.</i>

1090
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,222
You've got 500 people watching you,
and for most people—

1091
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,789
they're not used to doing anything
with 500 people watching them...

1092
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,995
<i>to say nothing of a hobby</i>
<i>they usually do all by themselves...</i>

1093
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,867
<i>with nobody else</i>
<i>looking over their shoulder.</i>

1094
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,744
<i>I'm just watching Tyler hop around.</i>

1095
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:26,838
I'm still a little bit in shock.
I need to— I need to just get, you know—

1096
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,349
think about this, uh— this puzzle,
and just, like, not—

1097
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:32,012
<i>- Nervous?</i>
- A little bit. A little bit.

1098
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,853
Although, strangely enough, not as nervous
as I was in the "B" final a few years ago...

1099
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:37,915
and this is for much greater stakes.

1100
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:41,554
And, uh— I don't know—
I guess 'cause I've done it before on a lower level.

1101
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,532
I don't know why.
And I guess 'cause I know I have the ability.

1102
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:49,093
<i>#Every time she walks down next to me #</i>

1103
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:53,267
<i>#She makes my poor old heart skip a beat ##</i>

1104
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,788
<i>Well, there's a difference</i>
<i>between just solving at home...</i>

1105
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,887
and solving at this event
and then solving on here.

1106
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:19,923
<i>There's somethin'about being up on stage</i>
<i>solving in big letters...</i>

1107
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,095
with a— a pen you never use.

1108
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,265
It's a whole different experience.
And maybe it's the nerves...

1109
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,003
or the alien nature of it—who knows?

1110
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:32,639
But it's— there's some guys that just are up here
in their element, and some guys who aren't.

1111
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:36,674
<i>- That's Trip.</i>
<i>- Trip, you'll be on the left.</i>

1112
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:40,415
<i>Al, you're on the right.</i>
<i>Tyler, in the middle.</i>

1113
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,617
<i> Trip Payne, he's been here before.</i>
<i>He's very outgoing.</i>

1114
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,490
<i>He'll hit himself on the head or fall down</i>
<i>ifhe stumbles a little.</i>

1115
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,224
<i>Tyler Hinman's only 20 years old.</i>
<i>How he know so much...</i>

1116
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:52,495
<i>to be in the top of the "A"division</i>
<i>is amazing.</i>

1117
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,536
<i>And Al Sanders has been, like...</i>

1118
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:58,869
<i>the leader almost every time</i>
<i>we come into the end of this event</i>
<i>and yet he has never won this event.</i>

1119
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,533
He's never even come in second.

1120
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:04,409
<i>Tyler, you'll have a two-second start over Trip.</i>

1121
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,472
<i>- Yes-s-s!</i>
<i>- Trip, you'll have a five-second start over Al.</i>

1122
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,518
<i>All right!</i>

1123
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,747
All right. I believe we're ready.

1124
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,991
<i> It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>for a crossword puzzle championship.</i>

1125
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,050
Let's play too.

1126
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:27,196
On your mark— Let me get the clock.
On your mark, get set...

1127
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,669
<i>Tyler, begin.</i>

1128
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,038
<i>Trip, begin.</i>

1129
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,806
<i>- Al, begin.</i>

1130
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,293
<i>To win at Stamford</i>— <i>I will admit...</i>

1131
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,420
<i>it's gone through my head many times</i>—

1132
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,829
<i>what it would be likejust to, you know,</i>
<i>finish that final puzzle...</i>

1133
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,266
<i>announce, "Done"and turn around</i>
<i>and see people clapping.</i>

1134
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:03,327
<i>If I were to do it this year</i>
<i>or in the next couple of years...</i>

1135
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,339
<i>I'd have the record</i>
<i>for the youngest champion...</i>

1136
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:09,503
<i>I'd have the trophy, I'd</i>—
<i>I'd have $4,000</i>— <i>which would be very nice</i>—

1137
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,944
<i>and, you know, in small circles, fame, really.</i>

1138
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,484
<i> Any year that I don't win the tournament,</i>
<i>I admit that I'm not happy about it.</i>

1139
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:22,615
<i>I try to keep a</i>—<i>a smiling face on,</i>
<i>but, you know...</i>

1140
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:26,183
<i>there's a part of me that expects to win,</i>
<i>even though I know that's not logical.</i>

1141
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,128
<i>Nobody can win every year.</i>
<i>There's too many good people...</i>

1142
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,666
<i>and there's too many variables</i>
<i>in the puzzles.</i>

1143
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:36,397
<i>But there's part of me that thinks, you know,</i>
<i>"You're good enough to win. You should win."</i>

1144
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,033
<i>And that part of me is upset when I don't.</i>

1145
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:44,306
<i> You know, the big hurdle</i>
<i>for me to get over, though, is that final puzzle.</i>

1146
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:47,780
<i>'Cause every year it's like, "Okay, you know,</i>
<i>this is, like, the fourth time I'm up here.</i>

1147
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:51,342
<i>"Surely I've gotten now to where I can,</i>
<i>you know, get over this hump...</i>

1148
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,878
<i>and get out there andjust, you know,</i>
<i>go kick butt on this puzzle. "</i>

1149
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,755
<i>Then every time it starts off,</i>
<i>I'm lookin'at those clues, and it's like</i>—

1150
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,590
<i>I look at the first 20 clues,</i>
<i>and I don't have any idea.</i>

1151
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:06,430
<i>And Trip's over there, you know, writin'away,</i>
<i>and it's like, "Oh, God, here we go again."</i>

1152
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,461
<i>Trip and Al both got "sit"first though.</i>

1153
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,973
<i> Well, Trip is waiting</i>
<i>to see if it's "house-sat."</i>

1154
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,499
<i>I mean, he's</i>— <i>He knows enough</i>
<i>to not fall into that trap.</i>

1155
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:22,016
<i>Al's got "SteveJobs"...</i>

1156
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,177
<i>and "Ute."</i>

1157
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,347
<i> Trip is doing well</i>
<i>in that upper left-hand corner as well.</i>

1158
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,687
<i>The clue on this one</i>— <i>for one across</i>—
<i>is just brutal</i>—

1159
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,992
<i>"Stark and richly detailed, as writing."</i>

1160
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:38,726
<i>That screams "Zolaesque"to me.</i>

1161
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:45,129
<i> You think they put six down in there</i>
<i>just for us this year, Merl?</i>

1162
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,232
<i>- "So just shut up"?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1163
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,170
<i>- No, I mean, just</i>—<i>sojust shut up.</i>
<i>- Yeah. I see.</i>

1164
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:54,682
<i>Well, I thought the other one, the last puzzle</i>—

1165
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,775
<i> "Unbeknownst to me."</i>
<i>Huge breakthrough there...</i>

1166
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,320
<i>by Al Sanders on the right.</i>

1167
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,380
<i>No mistakes I see yet.</i>

1168
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:09,320
<i>Meanwhile, Tyler working in the lower right</i>—

1169
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:12,697
<i>It's hard for me to see, but it looks good.</i>

1170
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,736
Yes. It is good.

1171
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:19,433
<i>And Al, just about wrapping up</i>
<i>that lower left-hand corner.</i>

1172
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,840
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- He can get "I got took."</i>

1173
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:27,678
<i> And he's got the</i>— <i>that "Sioux."</i>
<i>That</i>— <i>That's just a hard word down there.</i>

1174
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:32,914
<i>- There he goes.</i>
<i>- Yeah. Now he realized it</i>—
<i>what the "body work"is: Short for "tattoo."</i>

1175
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:36,014
<i>- Yeah. I'm sure he's having a "fun time"now.</i>
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

1176
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,423
<i>Trip is, uh, doing</i>—

1177
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,461
<i>- All over the place, as usual.</i>
<i>- Yeah, scattershot.</i>

1178
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:43,123
<i>He's going for the words he knows</i>
<i>and then filling in from there</i>—

1179
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,897
- That's good.
- As opposed to trying to fight through each area.

1180
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,904
- He's got, uh—
- He's got "ramified."

1181
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,167
<i>That's the toughest word in that corner.</i>

1182
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,435
<i>Tyler's got the bottom done.</i>

1183
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:57,239
<i>Hejust got "SteveJobs"</i>
<i>up in that upper left-hand corner.</i>

1184
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:01,578
<i> Yeah, but Al is just closing in. All</i>—
<i>All Al has to do is get that little corner</i>—

1185
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,086
<i>- Yep.</i>
<i>- And then figure out what the heck one across is.</i>

1186
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:09,214
<i> And he sh</i>—
<i>lfhe gets the "Z"here, he's got it nailed.</i>

1187
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:13,193
<i>- That's the hard</i>— <i>He's got the "fob."</i>
<i>- Good. F-O-B: "fob."</i>

1188
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,788
<i>"Ramified"he's got, and... there it is.</i>

1189
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:20,392
Done.

1190
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:27,872
<i>Shh! Quiet.</i>

1191
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:39,076
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1192
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,229
Against his competition—
speed being of the essence—

1193
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,894
<i>did not go through that last check.</i>

1194
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:58,201
<i> Well, he had that perfect,</i>
<i>yet he had that hard corner to do...</i>

1195
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:02,039
<i>andjust didn't go back</i>
<i>to check, uh, one across.</i>

1196
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:09,412
<i> So Tyler, now, just fixed</i>
<i>from "game show"to "quiz show scandal."</i>

1197
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:13,580
<i>So that's a big help to him.</i>
<i>He's got that upper right he's unfinished yet.</i>

1198
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:16,624
<i>And Trip is just having "long 'I."'</i>

1199
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,991
<i>He's trying different letters in there,</i>
<i>seeing what looks good.</i>

1200
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:23,623
<i> Yeah. The clue for this</i>
<i>is "one of two hi-fi components"...</i>

1201
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:28,227
<i>And, uh, he hasn't caught on</i>
<i>to what that means yet.</i>

1202
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:33,104
<i>- Should get the "hog"though.</i>
<i>- And he doesn't know what "a pole in China"is.</i>

1203
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:36,235
Oh, good God!

1204
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:40,111
<i>"Zolaesque"has just fallen.</i>

1205
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:45,779
- And Tyler is closing in here.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1206
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:49,187
<i>- And one letter</i>— <i>He's got it.</i>
- Done.

1207
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,365
<i> I can't believe that a guy</i>
<i>that's seven years old is gonna win this.</i>

1208
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:01,902
<i>I mean, Hi, Tyler. How are ya doin'?</i>

1209
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,905
<i>Well, I hope you can read all this.</i>

1210
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:13,346
<i>As soon as you get out of the way, we can.</i>

1211
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,852
Done.

1212
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,321
<i>All right. Here are the results.</i>

1213
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:33,891
<i>In third place</i>— <i>finishing first</i>
<i>but having two blank letters</i>—

1214
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,995
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- Is Al Sanders.

1215
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:45,240
<i>Second place</i>—<i>perfect in 12 minutes</i>
<i>and 14 seconds</i>—<i>is Trip Payne.</i>

1216
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:50,081
<i>And our new champion</i>—

1217
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,121
<i>perfect in 10 minutes and 27 seconds...</i>

1218
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,385
<i>the youngest champion</i>
<i>in the history of the event</i>—<i>is Tyler Hinman.</i>

1219
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,511
<i>Guess where I got hung up.</i>
<i>I got hung up here and here...</i>

1220
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,517
and here and here
and pretty much over here.

1221
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,519
Yeah.
This was a mother.

1222
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:30,115
The two downs— I had those in my head,
so l— I think I thought I had put those in.

1223
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:34,060
<i>And I had said, "Done,"so as far as I know,</i>
<i>I was over at that point, you know.</i>

1224
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:37,565
And... I just looked back, and I just remember
grabbin' those headphones and just—

1225
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,465
You know? Oh, I was so mad.

1226
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,095
- What are you studying in school?
- Um, I.T. Major. With a—

1227
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,503
- Where are you at? What school?
- R.P.I. Rensselaer.

1228
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,066
<i>How do you feel?</i>

1229
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,635
Good. I feel good.

1230
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:58,276
Yeah, that sums it up. Words are failin' me.
I'm just glad they waited until now to do so.

1231
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,323
<i>A day without the puzzle?</i>

1232

<i>Crossword puzzles are something</i>
<i>that feed into a basic human need...</i>

1234
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,273
<i>to figure things out.</i>

1235
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:22,071
<i> It allows you to be open-minded</i>
<i>and lets you think about...</i>

1236
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:25,670
<i>other parts of the language that maybe</i>
<i>you weren't necessarily thinkin'about.</i>

1237
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,477

<i>the fact that it's always there for you</i>—

1238
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,484
is very, very appealing.

<i>but, you know, words</i>— <i>they connect us.</i>

<i>Language is it. This is the</i>—

1242
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:44,955
the most powerful force, I believe,
on Earth is the English language.

<i> The ability to communicate</i>

1244
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,170
<i>I think it's profoundly important.</i>

1245
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:55,608

1247
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,610
of having crosswords
that speak people's language...

1248
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,984
<i>and somebody who will use puzzles</i>
<i>that are just jam-packed...</i>

1249
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:10,218
<i>with interesting, lively,</i>
<i>juicy, fun vocabulary...</i>

1250
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,226

<i>that someone will wheel me in in a wheelchair...</i>

1252
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:20,499
and I'll have drool coming down
the side of my mouth...

1253
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:26,507
and, um, I just hope the event is still goin' on
and people are having a great time.
