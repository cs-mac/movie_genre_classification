1
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:06,517
The framework for the next phase

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:07,685
of the talks is in place.

3
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:09,253
The Iranians have signed off on Vienna.

4
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,488
Though not on the venue.

5
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,323
- We just need to finalize the schedule.
- And the venue.

6
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,125
Schedule determines available venues.

7
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:15,660
We'll get into it, sir.

8
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,730
If it were up to me, I
would lock the Iranians in

9
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:22,100
the back room of a clam
bar until we had a deal.

10
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:26,337
It might have to be a Wiener
Schnitzel bar in Vienna, sir.

11
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,471
All right. Thanks, everybody.

12
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:34,645
- Uh, Matt...
- Yeah?

13
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,214
how's that speech coming along?

14
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,282
I'll have a draft for
you by the time you land.

15
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:39,784
Good.

16
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:41,119
Sir...

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,087
the policy stances you asked for

18
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:45,723
are very much at odds
with the administration.

19
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:47,291
Again?

20
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,794
I can soften them.

21
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,062
Nah.

22
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,830
I want a clear, bold vision.

23
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,632
Yes, sir.

24
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,100
Oh, and Matt...

25
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,603
you know I count on your discretion.

26
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,605
Of course.

27
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:02,740
Yes.

28
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,276
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

29
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,744
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

30
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:07,979
And you're bad at it.

31
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,147
Look, if I were lying,

32
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,782
which I am not, you would never know.

33
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,817
So the secretary just
wanted to shoot the breeze?

34
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,619
- We have a rapport.
- Oh, please.

35
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,255
You know, you're just... you're
just jealous that the big guy is

36
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:18,589
taking an interest in me.

37
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,526
Wait, that man would eat
his young for a leg up.

38
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:24,361
You're mistaking cozy for something else.

39
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:29,333
You wanted to see me, Mr. Secretary?

40
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,735
Yes. Come in.

41
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,446
I am sorry,

42
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,513
but I have to cancel our weekend.

43
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:46,751
Is it your wife?

44
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,654
No, it's personal business.

45
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,322
Can I ask what?

46
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,690
You can ask me anything.

47
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,393
It's an estate matter

48
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:58,496
relating to my family's old
cattle ranch outside Caracas.

49
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:01,698
I... I need to handle it personally.

50
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:06,636
Okay, then.

51
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:09,839
When I get back...

52
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,812
I'll make it up to you.

53
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:17,213
You better.

54
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,324
You're good to go, Mr. Secretary.

55
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,025
Thanks, Fred.

56
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,261
Mike and Tony'll have your
back while you're down there.

57
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:31,496
If they can keep up.

58
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,398
Hope you boys like riding horses.

59
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:39,269
- Happy trails, sir.
- Thanks.

60
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,050
Oh, great.

61
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,390
Pretty rough, huh?

62
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,568
Are you all right? Are you all right?

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,645
We have hit severe C.A.T.

64
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:23,648
I think the stub trim's broken completely.

65
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,049
What the hell is going on?

66
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,951
I've lost pitch control.

67
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,586
Can you get it back?

68
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,321
The stabilizer's failed completely.

69
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,756
I cannot keep us in the air.

70
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:37,795
So it goes.

71
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,997
All right, trying to push and roll,

72
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,666
losing altitude fast.

73
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,434
No, no, no, no, no...

74
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,338
Play back that last part.

75
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,739
Yeah.

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,807
...keep us in the air.

77
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,346
So it goes.

78
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,315
- "So it goes," huh?
- He's pretty calm

79
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,150
for a guy who thinks he's about to die.

80
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,452
The NTSB didn't find
the comment remarkable.

81
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:02,820
Well, they didn't have reason to.

82
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,433
I once had a wing drop that
sent me into an uncontrolled roll

83
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,428
at 1,000 feet... I didn't
know if I had room to bail.

84
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,994
Whoa, you never told me this.

85
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,763
Well, I... the point is, uh,

86
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,599
everything slowed. All I felt was calm.

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,867
Okay, Iceman, but you were a pilot

88
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,469
and Marsh doesn't exactly

89
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,438
sound calm to me... more
like he isn't surprised.

90
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,640
You know, like he crossed someone

91
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,408
and is expecting payback.

92
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,477
You've seen too many spy movies, Isabelle.

93
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,678
And lived a few.

94
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,946
What about you, babe?

95
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,381
Does this... does he sound like a guy

96
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,649
who suspected foul play?

97
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,517
Well, George thought it was. I...

98
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:35,286
Two months after Marsh's plane went down,

99
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:38,222
George stood right over there and said

100
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:40,324
that crash wasn't an accident...

101
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,859
and that somebody in the CIA

102
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,328
- was behind it.
- No matter how wigged out George was,

103
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,663
he was a damn good analyst.

104
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:48,633
Three days later, George
dies in a car crash

105
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:50,701
that anybody with basic tradecraft skills

106
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:52,637
could have made look like an accident.

107
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:53,804
It reeks of foul play.

108
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,274
And yet here's this 2,000-page NTSB report

109
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:00,711
that concludes Vincent Marsh's
plane crash was an accident.

110
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:04,581
Well, we owe it to George to see
if we can prove it wrong. Gimme.

111
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,585
Okay...

112
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,921
The NTSB's conclusion seems irrefutable.

113
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,556
The R-47 jackscrew

114
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:13,991
in the tail assembly failed,

115
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:17,528
taking out the horizontal
stabilizers, resulting in

116
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,530
an unrecoverable dive.

117
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:21,499
A broken screw? Seriously?

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,833
Well, the R-47

119
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,068
is more like a-a rod.

120
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,169
It's about an inch in diameter.

121
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,438
Says it was rated for ten years.

122
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,840
Was at eight and a half
at the time of the crash.

123
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,043
It's not crazy that it
would fail a little early.

124
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,279
Well, the C-600 jet has a
pretty great safety record.

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,249
Only one crash in the
past 15 years, in Dubai.

126
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,017
Wait a minute... I remember that.

127
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,453
I was on the Middle East desk at the time.

128
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:45,122
Uh, some... Iranian scientist died?

129
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,857
Yeah, their top nuclear physicist.

130
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,694
Right. There was speculation
that Mossad was behind that.

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,229
It was also stabilizer failure.

132
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,198
- The R-47 jackscrew.
- Is that a coincidence?

133
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,400
Well, there's a whole section on it here.

134
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,952
Let's see, the investigators looked hard

135
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:00,042
at the Dubai crash,
comparing it to Marsh's.

136
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,239
Right, at the time, the
screw was rated for 15 years.

137
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,674
Was changed to ten after.

138
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,076
But they emphasize the only connection

139
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,377
between Dubai and Marsh

140
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,646
is the failure to recognize
the weakness of the alloy

141
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,347
used in the screws in the first place.

142
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,884
So... if someone sabotaged Marsh's plane,

143
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,554
they knew that the investigators
would look at the Dubai crash

144
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:19,657
and assume it was a similar
issue with that screw.

145
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:21,292
Which is exactly what happened.

146
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,961
Okay...

147
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:27,264
so how do you sabotage an R-47 jackscrew?

148
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,801
The jackscrew's concealed behind

149
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,267
the main plate and the tail section,

150
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:32,703
- so...
- You're familiar with this type of plane?

151
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:34,505
There are some design similarities

152
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,973
to the F/A-18's I used to fly.

153
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,608
And I knew every inch of that plane.

154
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,276
- I'll study up on this.
- For now,

155
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:42,079
who could have access to that main plate?

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,581
Okay, you'd have to

157
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,149
remove the plate to get to the jackscrew

158
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,685
and then reattach it... pretty big job.

159
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:50,287
- Given security, because it was Marsh's plane...
- Right.

160
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:52,289
...it could only have been
a legit maintenance worker.

161
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,725
And of all the maintenance
workers, it would have to be

162
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,527
someone not just rated for airframe,

163
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:57,962
but with an expertise

164
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,498
in tail section hydraulics as well.

165
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,999
One of these five guys.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,101
So if the plane was sabotaged,

167
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:06,355
one of them did it.

168
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:14,359
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

169
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,098
Doesn't feel real

170
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,602
until the POI's go up on the whiteboard.

171
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,627
I'll run deep background
on them... quietly.

172
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,695
Is this what you do all
day at Langley, Isabelle?

173
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:31,796
Pretty much.

174
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:33,431
But it was more fun when Elizabeth was

175
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,133
- still around.
- Yeah,

176
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:38,203
hopped up on caffeine, solving mysteries

177
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,971
the rest of the world didn't know about.

178
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,073
If you screw up, people die.

179
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,275
That sounds really fun.

180
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,809
Just like old times, yeah?

181
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,045
Except now I'm Secretary of State

182
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,513
and my boss is the president.

183
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:49,781
He's not just

184
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:53,051
Director Dalton in the
funny bow tie anymore.

185
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,552
I think he...

186
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,553
Conrad, hey.

187
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:57,188
Sorry to interrupt.

188
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,556
Uh, do you have a minute, Bess?

189
00:07:58,557 --> 00:07:59,990
Sure.

190
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh, uh...

191
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:04,763
let me just go get some more coffee.

192
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,532
Oh, please.

193
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,601
What's up?

194
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,836
I, uh, wanted to check with you about

195
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,605
that Dubai crash.

196
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,940
Well, UAE prelim report
said it was an accident.

197
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,511
What do you think?

198
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:23,715
Five Iranian nationals dead.

199
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,184
UAE is neutral toward Iran.

200
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,019
No reason to doubt the report.

201
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,288
And Abolfazi?

202
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,490
Just a coincidence he was on board?

203
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:37,128
Definitely bad for
Iran's nuclear ambitions.

204
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,698
You think Mossad had
something to do with it?

205
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,933
I don't know.

206
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,002
It's good for us, too.

207
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,171
Yeah.

208
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,171
Guess we got lucky.

209
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:51,776
- Let me know if you hear anything, huh?
- Yeah.

210
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:53,078
Maybe we shouldn't

211
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,080
be doing this.

212
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,748
Of course we should.

213
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,150
What are we talking about?

214
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:00,618
If Marsh was murdered,

215
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:02,153
whoever's behind it had no problem

216
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:03,655
killing the secretary of state.

217
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,056
We have to consider the kids.

218
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:07,559
Maybe it's too dangerous
to go poking around.

219
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,594
You know what'd be dangerous?

220
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:10,595
Not knowing.

221
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:12,397
Are you about to quote Sun Tzu?

222
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,032
No, I'm more of a Patton guy.

223
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,068
But you do need to know your enemy.

224
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:18,570
It wouldn't be safe

225
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:22,039
for our family for us
not to look into this.

226
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,544
Maybe that screw just failed.

227
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:29,012
Maybe it was just an accident.

228
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,624
No, I'm not asking him out, that's insane.

229
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,792
Isn't it?

230
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:43,728
I mean, I can't ask him out.

231
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,497
How do you ask a guy like that out?

232
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,500
Two shots at a big brother
that I will never get back.

233
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,201
I have to break in my cleats, doofus.

234
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,970
Here? Like, now?

235
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,331
Do you actually think
that I should ask him out?

236
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,506
I have a big game tomorrow.

237
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,776
- Wait, your games are on Sunday.
- It's playoffs.

238
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,043
Quarterfinals are after school.

239
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:01,880
What? No. I have a seminar tomorrow.

240
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,194
Ah, I'm gonna miss it.
I'm so sorry, Noodle.

241
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,413
That's fine.

242
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,262
It's only quarterfinals.

243
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:08,887
I'll go.

244
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,522
I thought your security guy said you can't.

245
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,657
Well, it's the playoffs.

246
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:16,094
Yay. But no being diplomatic
about who you root for.

247
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,197
No worries there. I will shamelessly

248
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:20,532
cheer for you...

249
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,233
and jeer and hiss at the other team.

250
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,102
Oh, hey, no, you're right.

251
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,603
Yes, I am gonna ask him out.

252
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:28,072
Well, I don't know, I need to, like...

253
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,441
Bye, guys.

254
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,343
- Madam Secretary.
- Good morning.

255
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:35,013
We'd like to review the protocol
for tomorrow's Nauru coffee.

256
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,481
- Nay-who?
- Uh, Nauru.

257
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,516
It's one of our fellow
nations on Earth, ma'am.

258
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:39,818
Since when?

259
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,419
Mm, 3,000 years ago.

260
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,823
Uh, tiny, South Pacific
island, population 10,000,

261
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,192
but Godfrey Yispinza,
their president, is coming,

262
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:49,127
so we'll need full-on head of state moves.

263
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:52,430
Actually, Yispinza's
their foreign minister.

264
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:53,995
Might want to get our facts straight

265
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,100
- so we make those right moves.
- They are, ma'am.

266
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,269
- He's definitely the president.
- Foreign minister.

267
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,538
Seems my crack team has this under control.

268
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,006
I trust you to handle the planning.

269
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,300
- Thank you, Madam Secretary.
- Yes, Madam Secretary.

270
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,336
- Morning, Blake.
- Morning, Madam Secretary.

271
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:07,345
Get me Fred Cole in my office.

272
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:09,846
Uh, yes, but first, there's
someone else in your office.

273
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:12,217
Scary guy.

274
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,589
Russell...

275
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,091
you gotta stop intimidating my assistant.

276
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:22,193
I can say the same about you

277
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,362
- and the NTSB chair.
- What do you mean?

278
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,431
I got a call from Chairman Nelson.

279
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:28,700
Said you inquired about the Marsh report.

280
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:29,968
That's right.

281
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,237
Did you really ask if

282
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,539
they polygraphed the maintenance guys?

283
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,007
I just had a few questions.

284
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,009
You planning to question the report?

285
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,577
Of course not. But I'm sitting

286
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,112
in Marsh's seat... I'm interested

287
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:45,082
- in what happened.
- What happened is in the damn report.

288
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,952
You know, someone recently reminded me

289
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:50,054
that I'm fourth in line for the presidency.

290
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:53,391
So you don't get to come into
my office and push me around.

291
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,693
And I'm Chief of Staff
to the actual president.

292
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:58,029
It's my job to know everything

293
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,365
and to keep peace between
all the departments.

294
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,267
Through bullying and intimidation?

295
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,435
Madam Secretary...

296
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:09,172
don't go sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

297
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:12,509
Oh, Russell, get out of my office.

298
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,386
Westmore Prep's soccer field

299
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,321
is what we call a "rat trap."

300
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,857
Easily accessible, hard to escape.

301
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,992
360 degrees of open area,

302
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,194
lines of sight all around.

303
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,763
Mm. Yeah.

304
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,131
I see that.

305
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,199
And now I'm asking you to make it work.

306
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,201
I don't know if I can do that, ma'am.

307
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,571
Well, then we have a problem.

308
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,373
Because I am going to my
daughter's soccer game,

309
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,841
right there,

310
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,677
tomorrow at 2:30.

311
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,712
Due respect... but not on my watch.

312
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,516
Fred... you know my next move.

313
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,785
I don't want to have to let you go.

314
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,753
Ma'am...

315
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:59,055
I already lost one Secretary of State...

316
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:02,393
...I'm not losing another one.

317
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:05,496
Secretary Marsh died in a plane crash.

318
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,603
Wasn't your fault, Fred.

319
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,534
My job is to keep the secretary safe.

320
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:13,503
I don't make excuses, ma'am.

321
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:15,705
Okay.

322
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,408
How about this?

323
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,846
You take whatever precautions you need to.

324
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:24,082
Even embarrassing ones.

325
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,419
You could lock me in a bulletproof
bubble if you have to... just...

326
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,022
you get me to that game.

327
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,293
Ma'am, we really should go over

328
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,462
the seating chart for
the Nauru coffee tomorrow.

329
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,864
- Chart, huh?
- I know you're not a fan...

330
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:41,966
Uh, wait... cancel Nauru.

331
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:45,703
Bring in the, uh, Israeli
delegation instead.

332
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,872
- On one day's notice?
- Yeah.

333
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,941
Ma'am, the Nauru coffee

334
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,143
has been on the books for months.

335
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:56,014
Prime Minister Yispinza
is already here in DC.

336
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:59,584
Somebody has got to nail
down that guy's title.

337
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,618
Why Israel?

338
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,021
- Why now?
- Because the secretary said so.

339
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,589
But won't the Nauruans be offended?

340
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,224
Of course they will.

341
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,926
Which is why God created gift baskets.

342
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,195
How are we supposed to prep
for Israel in less than a day?

343
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,930
By not wasting any more time.

344
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:18,236
I'll get into it with the
Office of the Chief of Protocol.

345
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,407
- What is it?
- Uh, my landlord.

346
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,876
The pipes in my building burst. I gotta go.

347
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,110
Wait. You're lying.

348
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:27,712
No, I'm not.

349
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,313
- Dude!
- I'll talk to you later.

350
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:32,115
Wait... what about prepping for Israel?

351
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you have for me
on the secretary, Matt?

352
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,269
I don't have anything.

353
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,803
Of course you do.

354
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:56,507
Tell me...

355
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:59,476
what kind of mood she's in.

356
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,181
I'm...

357
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,416
I don't feel comfortable with this.

358
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,152
Well, you were comfortable coming
to me when you worked for Marsh.

359
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:09,854
That was different.

360
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,190
She's not conspiring against the president.

361
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,658
What is she doing?

362
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:19,130
I never agreed to spy on Secretary McCord.

363
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,197
I won't do it.

364
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,268
Well, then think of it as keeping tabs.

365
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,173
Come on, Matt, this is how it works.

366
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,842
You give me something,

367
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:33,711
and I give you something...

368
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:37,047
Don't you want an office in the West Wing?

369
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,889
I ran deep background
on our five mechanics,

370
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,987
called in favors, came
close to breaking laws.

371
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:55,189
- It's not one of them.
- Sorry.

372
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,457
No red flags,

373
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,726
no unexplained influxes of money

374
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,396
or secret bank accounts,
no suspicious behavior.

375
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:03,131
Well, then that's it, we're done.

376
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:06,968
If the plane was sabotaged,
it had to be one of them.

377
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,403
Maybe not.

378
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:09,571
Okay, you're the one

379
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,806
who said it had to be one of them.

380
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,609
I've been looking over
the design of the C-600.

381
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,944
What about it?

382
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:18,313
Marsh's pilot cites

383
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,949
a patch of severe C.A.T...
Clear Air Turbulence...

384
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,001
in the moments before the dive.

385
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,485
But turbulence can't take a plane down...

386
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,455
- even I know that.
- Yeah, right, but severe C.A.T.

387
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,591
is rough, and if there's
already metal fatigue

388
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:31,826
on a part, like the R-47 jackscrew,

389
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,394
the pressure can push it

390
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:35,797
- to the breaking point.
- Which is the NTSB's conclusion.

391
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,865
So what if it wasn't C.A.T.?

392
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,734
What if it was something else

393
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,803
and the pilot mistook it for turbulence?

394
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:45,106
Sabotage a different part of the plane

395
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:47,909
in order to put stress on the jackscrew?

396
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,310
Pilot says it's turbulence,

397
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,646
so the NTSB investigators
never questioned it.

398
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:54,182
They assumed the jackscrew
cracked, which caused the tail

399
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:56,401
to come apart, because
the plane was shaking.

400
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,686
But what if the tail breaking apart

401
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,189
is what caused the shaking?

402
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,892
Which, in turn, put
pressure on the jackscrew.

403
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,962
But wouldn't the investigators
have noted the order of events?

404
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:09,163
When the plane crashed,

405
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,832
everything was smashed to pieces.

406
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,935
So there's no way to know
what order they broke up in.

407
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,537
Well, look, I have...
no idea how any of this

408
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,640
would be achieved...
it's just a crazy theory.

409
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,808
No, it's interesting.

410
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,810
It's like a magic trick.

411
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,380
And then the pilot
unwittingly helps sell it

412
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,081
by reporting turbulence.

413
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:30,718
It would have to be a genius,
like a diabolical saboteur

414
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,286
out of a Bond movie.

415
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,689
If you were going to kill
the Secretary of State,

416
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,724
don't you think you'd want
to hire one of those types?

417
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,098
Apparently...

418
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,902
every pair of my shoes is out of fashion.

419
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:51,372
You really needed a magazine
to tell you that, Mom?

420
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,975
Guess I'll just embarrass you at your game.

421
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:56,244
She's already embarrassing me at this game.

422
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,446
Come on, Dad, stop going easy on me.

423
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:00,081
I'm not.

424
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,250
Stevie! What? What?

425
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:03,518
I have a date

426
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,253
with the cutest guy on Earth!

427
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,894
Are you guys okay?

428
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,304
Did you get my text?

429
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,306
Yeah. All 106 of 'em.

430
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:27,408
Oh, you counted them,
but you didn't respond?

431
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,744
Look, I drafted her remarks, okay?

432
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,579
Oh, what do you want, a Scooby snack?

433
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,115
Where the hell have you been?

434
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:37,085
I... I told you, I... my pipes burst.

435
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,086
Then let's see the pictures

436
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,654
of the flooding you took on your phone

437
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,323
- for the insurance claim.
- I don't have insurance.

438
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,624
It was a job interview.

439
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,694
That's why you've been so preoccupied.

440
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,529
But you already have a great job,

441
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,098
so it must be a greater job.

442
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,065
The White House?

443
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:53,634
No... I mean, no, no, absolutely not.

444
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:54,869
Oh, protest too much?

445
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,504
No! I mean... cut-cut it out.

446
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:59,172
It's a deputy spot.

447
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,943
Hey, I need to review
the secretary's remarks.

448
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:04,445
Did you get my messaging statement?

449
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:06,247
- Knock, knock.
- What is it, Blake?

450
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,849
The NASA administrator wants a meeting

451
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,017
- with Madam Secretary.
- NASA?

452
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,854
Does he know we only handle Earth?

453
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:15,022
He said it was urgent.

454
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,157
What's it about?

455
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:17,592
Time travel.

456
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:19,427
Excuse me?

457
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:21,162
You heard me right.

458
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:23,164
Okay.

459
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:25,500
Well... if you've got a time machine,

460
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,468
I'd sure like to borrow it.

461
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:31,606
You think that what I do doesn't matter,

462
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,741
that the space program is irrelevant.

463
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,476
The fact that my agency

464
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,712
is the only one in the entire government

465
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,747
currently driving a freaking SUV

466
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:43,584
across the surface of Mars isn't important.

467
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,652
Administrator...

468
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:47,054
No, no, please... call me Glenn.

469
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,157
Glenn...

470
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:51,959
my earliest memories are
of the Apollo missions.

471
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,729
I think NASA plays a vital role

472
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,230
in this country.

473
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,532
Thank you.

474
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,834
So how can I

475
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,769
help you...

476
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,405
with time travel?

477
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,908
The Gimbal-Solander telescope

478
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,410
is scheduled to be deployed next month.

479
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,980
It's next-gen lenses are so powerful

480
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:15,783
that they will be able to see back in time,

481
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:19,287
to the light that emanated
in the... in the milliseconds

482
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:20,488
after the big bang.

483
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,857
Now, of course, we're
placing it on the equator,

484
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,993
in a corner of the Earth
devoid of light pollution.

485
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,728
Let me guess:

486
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:31,666
On a remote island in the South Pacific.

487
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,234
Nauru?

488
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:36,938
It was supposed to be placed on Nauru...

489
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:39,373
until the State Department...

490
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,542
insulted Nauru's Chairman
of the Cabinet Yispinza

491
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:44,244
by unceremoniously canceling on him.

492
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:47,747
Chairman of the Cabinet?

493
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:53,020
There's been some debate
over Mr. Yispinza's title.

494
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,089
Doesn't matter what his title is.

495
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,124
He's threatening to cancel our contract.

496
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,361
But there is no better place on Earth

497
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,129
for the Gimbal-Solander.

498
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,331
Please...

499
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:06,000
make things right with Nauru.

500
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,102
I'll do my best.

501
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,704
Thank you.

502
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:11,671
Thank you.

503
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,409
Uh, Glenn...

504
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,245
what do you think you'll...

505
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:20,648
see in that billions-year-old light?

506
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:23,484
It's impossible to say.

507
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,186
Maybe God.

508
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:29,056
Or secrets of the universe.

509
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:32,392
The unknowable, Ms. Tolliver.

510
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,333
The briefing book

511
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,302
for the Israeli coffee, ma'am.

512
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:44,438
Oh... you really think
I'll be able to read all...

513
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:48,576
172 pages between here
and... Conference Room East?

514
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,812
Your communications department
came through on short notice.

515
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:54,015
Well, luckily, I'm pretty well versed

516
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,416
in Israeli geopolitics.

517
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,687
NASA guy likes you, you know.

518
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:03,090
- He does not.
- Trust me... years of spy training.

519
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:05,726
Plus, you know, I'm a woman.

520
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:08,195
- You should ask him out.
- I couldn't.

521
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,765
I noticed he wasn't wearing a ring.

522
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,700
Spy training's pretty impressive.

523
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,136
I'm not ready.

524
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:18,239
- I don't want to overstep.
- Too late.

525
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:22,408
Nadine, you deserve to be happy.

526
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,480
Besides...

527
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:29,350
maybe he'll let you drive the Mars Rover.

528
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,718
See you in there.

529
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,529
I am the writer.

530
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,872
Look, I'm in charge of the messaging.

531
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,031
Is-is that even a word?

532
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:45,066
I'm gonna punch you.

533
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,734
Hey! You need to work

534
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,135
- together.
- Great.

535
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:51,973
So I will write the
talking points, and then

536
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,607
you can... message them

537
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,842
however you want.

538
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,510
No. I'll craft the message first.

539
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:58,182
You sound ridic...

540
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,246
- What the hell was that?
- Uh...

541
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,648
Oh, my God, he was just here.
How can this be happening?

542
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,520
Maybe they got it wrong.
Do we have confirmation?

543
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,722
What is it?

544
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,493
Uh...

545
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:19,200
Uh, Secretary Marsh's plane...

546
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:21,402
went down in the Atlantic.

547
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:25,006
Coast Guard confirms.

548
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:27,607
There's no survivors.

549
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,949
Gather all the undersecretaries.

550
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,052
Get them all in here right now.

551
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,286
Jay, go!

552
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:40,254
Yeah, okay, yeah, come on,

553
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:41,821
all right, people come on.

554
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,395
Our challenges in the Middle East

555
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,363
are great, but our commitment

556
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:52,333
to a shared vision of peace and prosperity

557
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,602
in the region needs to be even greater.

558
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,837
Thank you all for coming.

559
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,205
Now eat.

560
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,245
Ambassador Dori.

561
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,147
Ah, Madam Secretary.

562
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:08,349
Your remarks were very gracious.

563
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,950
Thanks for saying that.

564
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,719
They often feel a little canned.

565
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,687
I know the feeling.

566
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:17,258
Sometimes I miss our old jobs.

567
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,260
Being under the radar.

568
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:22,663
I don't think I'll ever get used
to talking about what I'm doing.

569
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,468
Well, speaking of things
that you didn't talk about...

570
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:31,338
the C-600 crash in Dubai in 2003...

571
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,541
there were whisperings
that Mossad was behind that.

572
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:37,078
Were there?

573
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,013
If I remember it correctly,

574
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:41,916
the investigation concluded
it was an accident.

575
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,418
Iran's top nuclear physicist was on board.

576
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,452
A happy accident.

577
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,391
Well, hypothetically,

578
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:52,960
if it weren't an accident,

579
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:55,129
might you have engineered the means

580
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,731
by which pressure was
placed on the tail section,

581
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:00,468
over-stressing the R-47 jackscrew?

582
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:04,105
You have quite a knowledge
of avionics, Madam Secretary.

583
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:06,707
So, am I right?

584
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,310
Think of it as reminiscing.

585
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:11,579
We're just talking hypotheticals here.

586
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,349
If you wanted to overstress the jackscrew,

587
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,852
you would remove the tail plate and strip

588
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:20,187
the threads on the vertical stabilizer nut.

589
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:22,256
Tail plate. That's removed during...

590
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:23,491
Removed during fueling.

591
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:24,925
Right.

592
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:27,194
And subject to infrequent
inspections for wear.

593
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:31,232
Once the control starts to slip,

594
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:33,434
the plane would begin to shake.

595
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:36,137
And the pilot would likely
just report it as turbulence.

596
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:37,371
It would stress

597
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:40,040
the tail section to the point that even

598
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,476
a correctly-maintained
jackscrew would fail.

599
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:45,179
Hypothetically, of course.

600
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,381
Was the CIA involved?

601
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:50,417
You have to ask me?

602
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,720
U.S. had as much skin
in the game as Israel.

603
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,322
Please just tell me if anyone in the CIA

604
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,324
was read into it.

605
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:01,061
I think we have reminisced
enough, Madam Secretary.

606
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:03,463
A pleasure.

607
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:12,907
The fueling technician, John Castellano.

608
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:14,842
He has an honest face.

609
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:16,777
Hidden bank account. Caymans.

610
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,379
As buried as you get.

611
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,348
Well, trust me, you don't
want to know how I found it,

612
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,450
but I'm not at all
surprised the NTSB didn't.

613
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,886
Disgruntled Interpol finance agent?

614
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,289
Oh, I'm not telling. You
need plausible deniability.

615
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,690
Fine. Any activity?

616
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,991
Day before the crash,

617
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:33,260
half a million dollars
showed up in the account.

618
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,528
From where?

619
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,996
Untraceable.

620
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,465
Think it could be a coincidence?

621
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,334
Running drugs through the airport...

622
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,269
Or smuggling, money laundering.

623
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,604
No, we're not gonna know until we get him

624
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:44,772
into a room and break him.

625
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:46,073
You think that's a good idea?

626
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:48,441
No.

627
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,179
But we're all in now.

628
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,447
What makes you think he'd break?

629
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,917
The play's the thing.

630
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:03,457
That'd be a hell of a
bold move, unprecedented.

631
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,227
You sure you want to go there?

632
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:08,229
All in.

633
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,197
Bess.

634
00:27:10,198 --> 00:27:13,167
It could put the entire
administration at risk.

635
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,535
I don't know who I can trust.

636
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,505
Just get him in a room.

637
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:20,940
I don't care how you do it.

638
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,105
Hi, Matt.

639
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:33,007
Hey, Blake.

640
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:34,942
What can I do for you?

641
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:39,146
No, just... just saying hey.

642
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:41,748
- Please don't. Please.
- Sorry.

643
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,782
So, um, uh, what's up with
the secretary canceling

644
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:47,783
on Nauru and bringing in Israel?

645
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:50,252
Is this small talk, or
do you have an agenda?

646
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,621
- I'm just checking in with you, dude.
- Please don't.

647
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,456
What, we're-we're human beings, you know?

648
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:55,724
We're social creatures.

649
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,859
Okay, now you're just
making me uncomfortable.

650
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,213
Glenn.

651
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:14,315
I hope you don't mind me stopping by.

652
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,310
Not at all.

653
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:16,678
Had a meeting downstairs

654
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,914
about a joint satellite launch with Japan,

655
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:22,418
and just want to say thank you for...

656
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,019
making nice with Nauru.

657
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,790
Well, it's our job... making nice.

658
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,625
You're good at it.

659
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,660
Telescope is back on track.

660
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:34,296
And President Yispinza

661
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,632
is over the moon about that
state lunch you're planning.

662
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,866
President?

663
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:39,902
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and Prime Minister.

664
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:41,837
And foreign minister,

665
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:44,273
and chairman of the cabinet.

666
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,707
Small country.

667
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,109
Not enough politicians.

668
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,544
Ah.

669
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:50,078
He wears all the hats.

670
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,914
He also runs a fish and tackle shop.

671
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,619
Well, we'll be sure we
get the protocol right

672
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,988
for all of his positions.

673
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:04,526
I would love to hear about
how you plan a lunch like that.

674
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:07,396
Uh, perhaps over lunch?

675
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,932
Oh...

676
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:13,435
um, I-I really can't leave today.

677
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,271
The secretary is at her
daughter's soccer game,

678
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,974
and I'm holding down the fort.

679
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,242
Maybe another time.

680
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:23,412
I hold down the fort a lot.

681
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:26,614
Of course.

682
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:32,888
I actually ought to go check on my fort.

683
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,122
Yeah.

684
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:35,691
Thanks again.

685
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,092
You're welcome.

686
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,540
Come on, Wildcats!

687
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,274
Come on, Wildcats!

688
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:59,114
Clear it out of there!

689
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,649
Come on, girls!

690
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,751
Come on!

691
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,120
Yes!

692
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,355
Great save. Great save, guys.

693
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:07,589
Thataway!

694
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,693
John Castellano?

695
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,295
Ms. Barnes.

696
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,630
Ah, no. Call me Laura.

697
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:16,164
Thanks for meeting me here today.

698
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,200
I've just had appointments all over town.

699
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:19,868
It's-it's no problem.

700
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,336
I appreciate the opportunity.

701
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:22,871
Oh, I like your attitude already.

702
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:24,873
And I think the Jandermann Group will, too.

703
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,241
Mr. Jandermann likes positive,

704
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,643
can-do folks.

705
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:29,711
And from what I understand, he pays better

706
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:30,879
than my current employer, so...

707
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,080
Yeah, if you like that kind of thing.

708
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,016
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

709
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:36,451
So... let's talk fueling.

710
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:38,854
- Okay.
- Yeah.

711
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,093
Yes!

712
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,735
Whoa! What? What? No call?

713
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:54,970
Ah, that's a legal play, ma'am.

714
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:57,471
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm just...

715
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,780
Halftime! Ten minutes!

716
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,648
Good half. Great half.

717
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,621
- I want to... I want to go see her.
- Okay.

718
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:18,193
I can't get over you out there!

719
00:31:18,194 --> 00:31:20,095
Can you believe that dive stop I made?

720
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,997
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, no.

721
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:24,499
- Can you believe? Fred, did you see that?
- She was really great.

722
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,801
- Did you see that save?
- She was great.

723
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,636
Ma'am, uh, listen, can
you take a secure call?

724
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,404
- Sure.
- I can hang back with the team.

725
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:31,273
No, no, no, I want, I
want you to hang with me.

726
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,274
Come on, come on. Come on.

727
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:39,848
Baby.

728
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:46,054
Listen, Noodle, something's come up.

729
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:49,257
- Don't you have to take that call?
- Actually, no.

730
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:52,260
I need a favor.

731
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,428
That's all I have.

732
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,564
Do you have any questions
for me, Mr. Castellano?

733
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:57,366
Yeah. When do I start?

734
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,669
Hey, you know what? How about this?

735
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,137
Mr. Jandermann is heading back

736
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:03,972
to Houston tonight, but
I think I can get him

737
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:05,574
to sit down with you for a few minutes

738
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:07,776
in his hotel room, if you're free now.

739
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:09,678
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

740
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,979
Great.

741
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,401
I owe you one, Fred.

742
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:35,135
This never happened, ma'am.

743
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,208
Fancy place.

744
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,610
Yeah, Mr. Jandermann does all right.

745
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,814
You have a key?

746
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:48,148
Yup.

747
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,359
Have a seat.

748
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,729
So, he's, uh... he's here?

749
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,130
Oh, yeah. He'll be right up.

750
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,439
Yeah, something feels off about this.

751
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,143
Sit down, Mr. Castellano.

752
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,582
Sit.

753
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,088
Do you know who I am?

754
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,122
What the hell is sh...

755
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:29,823
Who am I, Mr. Castellano? Say it.

756
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:33,562
You're-you're the...

757
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:35,430
you're the Secretary of State.

758
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,399
That's right.

759
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,935
Did you know my predecessor, Vincent Marsh?

760
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:48,142
Did you kill Secretary
of State Vincent Marsh?

761
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,812
I'm gonna ask you again.

762
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,405
Did you kill Secretary
of State Vincent Marsh

763
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:08,977
by sabotaging his C-600 jet?

764
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:11,479
As you fueled the plane,
you opened the tail plate

765
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,614
and stripped the vertical

766
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,781
stabilizer nut, isn't that right?

767
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,553
I see it is.

768
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:21,089
And you received $500,000 for your trouble

769
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,258
in a numbered Cayman account.
I take it that wasn't...

770
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,359
lottery winnings.

771
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,994
I don't even know what's happening here.

772
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,996
- I don't want to be here.
- You're free to go

773
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:29,197
anytime you like.

774
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:31,132
Problem is, if you do, we can't guarantee

775
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,934
you won't be grabbed
up and thrown in a hole

776
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:34,069
for the rest of your life.

777
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,004
I don't want that any more than you do.

778
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:40,241
Now, obviously, somebody put
you up to sabotaging that plane.

779
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:41,943
If you tell me the truth,

780
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:45,480
I can make sure that you're treated fairly.

781
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:47,549
How do I know I can trust you?

782
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,551
You don't.

783
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:52,954
But I am the Secretary of State

784
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:56,156
and you don't have any better options.

785
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:59,926
Let me help you, John.

786
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,502
They said I couldn't talk to anybody.

787
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,571
- Who?
- I don't know.

788
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:11,506
Then how did they communicate with you?

789
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,175
Phone.

790
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,744
I get this call

791
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:21,381
saying my kid's life's in danger
I don't do exactly as they say.

792
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:25,787
And they send me an e-mail

793
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:28,523
with a live video link

794
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:32,260
of my daughter in her preschool playground

795
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:36,663
with one of those laser red
target dots on her forehead.

796
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:39,767
My four-year-old girl.

797
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,768
Male or female voice?

798
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,006
I don't know.

799
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,275
It was one of those, uh,

800
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:50,745
electronically altered voices.

801
00:35:50,746 --> 00:35:53,014
Said I, um...

802
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:56,484
I don't do exactly as they say, she's dead.

803
00:35:56,485 --> 00:36:00,388
If I called the cops
or talked to anybody...

804
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,357
they'd kill my whole family.

805
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,392
When I saw the half mil in the bank,

806
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:05,960
that's when I knew it was for real.

807
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:08,196
And the instructions
for sabotaging the plane?

808
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:11,432
E-mail.

809
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:15,103
You know, I'm just a fueler.

810
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,338
I didn't know exactly what it would do.

811
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,534
Not that I didn't have some idea.

812
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:25,213
When I saw that the plane crashed...

813
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:28,349
I'm sorry, but what was I supposed to do?

814
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,804
Did you have any other communications

815
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:30,718
with these people?

816
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,686
No. No.

817
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,389
I-I didn't even touch the money.

818
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,125
No matter what the circumstances were,

819
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:39,661
you were a part of the assassination

820
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,196
of the Secretary of State.

821
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:46,301
Now, if I have you arrested,
it'll tip off whoever hired you.

822
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,736
That's why I'm letting you go.

823
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:52,674
And then, as long as you stay quiet,

824
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,710
and never speak a word of any of this,

825
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,879
I can protect you.

826
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,748
And I can protect your daughter.

827
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,884
That's the only way.

828
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:04,752
Okay.

829
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:08,156
Ms. Barnes will contact you
about getting into your...

830
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:10,525
computer and your e-mails.

831
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,126
You'll cooperate.

832
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:14,662
Yes.

833
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,530
Now go.

834
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:33,880
Now what?

835
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,987
Special delivery.

836
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:40,455
What?!

837
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,789
Security sent them up.

838
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,990
From an admirer of yours.

839
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,397
Lose the smirk, Blake,

840
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:50,632
and get back to your desk.

841
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:07,694
_

842
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:15,723
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

843
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,158
No, not really.

844
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,559
It's important.

845
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,734
What's wrong?

846
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,306
Ma'am, I need to come clean.

847
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:35,677
I kind of spied on Secretary
Marsh for Russell Jackson.

848
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,211
"Kind of"?

849
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:40,848
Marsh was going to run against
Dalton in the next cycle.

850
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:43,284
He never acknowledged it directly,

851
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,720
but he had me writing all of these speeches

852
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,056
with policy positions that
were completely out of whack

853
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:49,324
with the administration.

854
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:52,393
Said he wanted to have them, just in case.

855
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,362
That's a hell of a dilemma, Matt.

856
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:56,331
You're telling me. I, uh...

857
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:58,666
I was popping antacids like Tic Tacs,

858
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:01,569
wrestling with whether to be loyal to Marsh

859
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,572
or Dalton.

860
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:06,774
I decided that, ultimately,

861
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,477
we all serve at the
pleasure of the president.

862
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,145
So you told Jackson.

863
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:12,580
How'd he take it?

864
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:16,017
How do you think?

865
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,252
Give me a little more
poetry in this section.

866
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:20,855
- You got it.
- Vincent,

867
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:22,957
we need to talk.

868
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,358
Thanks, Matt.

869
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:34,235
You're planning to run, aren't you?

870
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:36,070
Excuse me?

871
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,306
Against Dalton in the next cycle.

872
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,142
Where'd you get that?

873
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:42,844
Not denying much?

874
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:45,079
I'm not dignifying the question.

875
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,782
You know, I tried to convince
Dalton not to go with you,

876
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:52,085
but the old boys in the party
thought it was your turn.

877
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:54,355
What do you want?

878
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:56,190
I'm just putting you on notice.

879
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:59,761
You don't back-stab the
president of your own party

880
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:02,028
without consequences.

881
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:11,339
Is that a threat, Russell?

882
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,708
It's a guarantee.

883
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,812
I speak for the president on this.

884
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:20,915
- As you might imagine, he's pretty upset.
- And he'll have

885
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,651
no compunction whatsoever
slitting the throat of someone

886
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,186
who has been a staunch ally

887
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:27,221
and helped get him elected?

888
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:30,123
So it goes.

889
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:34,095
"So it goes."

890
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,863
He said that?

891
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:36,998
Yeah.

892
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,200
It was an odd turn of phrase.

893
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:41,469
It stuck with me.

894
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,070
Why does it matter?

895
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,606
And he specifically said
the president was upset?

896
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:48,142
Yeah. Of course the president was upset.

897
00:40:48,143 --> 00:40:49,877
You tell anyone else?

898
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:52,146
No.

899
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:55,817
But when Marsh's plane went down,

900
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,618
I-I couldn't help but wonder

901
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,754
if they had something to do with it.

902
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:02,824
I-I mean, I felt like a
crazy conspiracy theorist.

903
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:05,059
I was relieved when the
NTSB report came out.

904
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,696
I bet.

905
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:10,830
So why tell me now?

906
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:16,936
Because now Jackson wants me to spy on you.

907
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,240
Really?

908
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:22,243
Yeah, in exchange for a
job at the White House.

909
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:23,811
I tried to tell him no,

910
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:26,680
but he made me promise to think about it.

911
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:31,552
Tell him you'll do it.

912
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,687
What?

913
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,121
Why?

914
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:37,558
Now that I know that he's spying
on me, I can use a double agent.

915
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,994
No, no, no, I-I don't think
that-that's a good idea.

916
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:42,930
Matt, you've been dishonest.

917
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,165
Think of it as your penance.

918
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:55,276
The stabilizer's failed completely.

919
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:58,212
I cannot keep us in the air.

920
00:41:58,213 --> 00:42:00,548
So it goes.

921
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:02,950
Trying to push and...

922
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:06,521
When his plane was going down,

923
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:08,256
Vincent Marsh was thinking

924
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,825
Jackson and Dalton were behind it.

925
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,994
That doesn't mean he was right.

926
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:15,263
Ambassador Dori didn't deny

927
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:17,965
that the CIA was involved
in the Dubai crash.

928
00:42:17,966 --> 00:42:21,869
If they were, then Dalton
knew how to sabotage a C-600

929
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,871
and get away with it.

930
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,406
Maybe he tapped me

931
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,309
because he didn't think
I'd ever suspect him.

932
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,778
Your loyalty is your soft spot?

933
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:32,980
Maybe I'm Secretary of State

934
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:34,649
because he wanted to keep me close,

935
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,884
which would explain
Russell making overtures

936
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,352
to Matt about spying on me.

937
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:44,625
I'm calling the President of
the United States a murderer.

938
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:49,863
Now is really a time for you to
start talking me off the ledge.

939
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:53,701
I'm sorry, babe.

940
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:56,503
I got nothing.

941
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:00,673
What's my next move?

942
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:11,284
They need me in the Situation Room.

943
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:26,500
Bess.

944
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,369
North Korea's acting out again.

945
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,737
Let's catch you up.

946
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:45,666
