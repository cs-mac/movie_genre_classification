3

<i>♫ is just because of the

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,570
<i>♫ then the moon is
the waiting tide. ♫</i>

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,800
<i>♫ When the clouds
scatter, Ooh... ♫</i>

<i>♫ the moon shines over
the world's haze. ♫</i>

<i>♫ The world becomes
silent at this moment ♫</i>

<i>♫ and drops (forget) all

19
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,810
I wonder what kind of treasure
it is to be so powerful.

20
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,810
Can you let me see it?

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,460
I know! It is some kind of rare
treasure from the strange lands, right?

22
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,100
Like, fruits that
have super powers?

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,920
It is something not
of this world.

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,690
It took a very long time
to get our hands on it.

25
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,470
- Let me take a look at it!
- No-no-no.

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,180
Anren, stop teasing. Just
let me take one look.

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,980
Not even one look.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,500
Please, please, just
one look, please.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,340
Fine-fine-fine.

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,630
You're hurting my bones
from your shouting.

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,130
How about this!

32
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,270
If you are able to abide to a
condition, besides one look,

33
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,610
I will even give it to you!

34
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,930
What condition?

35
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,350
Marry me and be my wife. Okay?

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,460
No?

37
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,350
Pretend I didn't ask. It belongs to the
Princess now, so I won't let you see it.

38
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,260
- Just one look?
- Definitely not.

39
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,460
Fine, I agree.

40
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,400
You're serious?

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,360
I can now look at it, right?

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,060
What's the rush?

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,920
This stuff I originally planned to give you during the Qixi
Festival (Lunar's July 7th) as my proof of love to you.

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,050
Then wouldn't it be
more meaningful?

45
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,020
You're being serious? Are you
trying to trick me again?

46
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,760
Shouldn't I be the one who's scared
since you might run off with it.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,700
Then I'd really be at a loss.

48
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,660
I'm not you. I wouldn't
go back on a promise.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,620
Right now besides Brother
and Sister-in-Law,

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,750
the one I can trust

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,190
is only you.

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,140
Qianru, every time I finish your soup I
feel something running through my organs,

53
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,960
a rush of warmth, like
some kind of energy.

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,780
What can I do to repay you?

55
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,580
I don't need you to repay me.

56
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,940
I only ask that you can be by my side, a
day more is a day earned being with you.

57
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,230
We cannot cheat our time when the
heaven's have decided our time.

58
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,990
If there comes a day when
I leave, let's promise

59
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,300
that in the next life we
will be together again.

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,790
This time when I cross over the Styx,
I will drink less of that soup

61
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,090
and come find you in the next
life and take care of you.

62
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,700
I can't ask much for
the next lifetime.

63
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,190
I just wish that I can be with you
this lifetime and live everyday well.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,310
Qianru, is it because you're taking
care and worrying about me everyday;

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,870
hence, you feel tired already?

66
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,430
An De,

67
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,040
if one day I turned old

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,380
and became a white haired
wrinkly old woman,

69
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,620
would you still
love me like now?

70
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,250
Qianru, what are this nonsense
you're talking about?

71
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,280
When we first met, I was
like a disabled person.

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,440
But you never avoided me and,
instead, willingly became my wife.

73
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,890
How can I then leave you just
because you turn into an old woman?

74
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,410
That is because you
don't know that I am...

75
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,690
Never mind.

76
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,340
It's not like what
you are thinking.

77
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,270
Enough.

78
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,240
Qianru,

79
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,890
no matter what happens in
the future, I promise you

80
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,940
that I will always be by your
side, never leaving you.

81
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,340
Fei Yue, you're cousin
is here to visit you.

82
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,310
- Who? - Your cousin.

83
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,910
He's currently playing chess with
Second Young Master in the garden.

84
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,850
Cousin? When did
I have a cousin?

85
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,010
Unless it's...

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,580
The logic of the game of chess is
to move one's chip to gain victory.

87
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,370
Master Meng's chess skills are impressive.
You really are a very smart person.

88
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,120
Brother Liu also
hasn't lost to me yet.

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,760
You are also interesting.

90
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,960
I've never heard Fei Yue
talk about having a cousin.

91
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,600
Maybe she doesn't
want you to know.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,170
Zhu...

93
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,100
Cousin, so it was really you.

94
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,930
Zhu (Pig) Cousin?

95
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,990
You're the one who's the pig.

96
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,510
I didn't inform her beforehand
and just came here.

97
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,990
For Fei Yue to curse me as
pig head is also not wrong.

98
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,080
Brother Liu, do you know about
me and Fei Yue's relationship?

99
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,680
I think it's that you want to marry
Fei Yue and Fei Yue doesn't want to?

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,350
Doesn't want to?

101
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,040
She didn't tell you the truth.

102
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,960
Sect Leader, it's not proper to talk
here. Let's go to another place.

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,250
For Sect Leader to personally come here,
is it because I did something wrong again?

104
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,310
I am here to look for
the female thief.

105
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,420
Any new discovery?

106
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:25,740
Nothing yet. Fei Yue, about the cloth I asked you to
place in a corner, did anyone else know about it?

107
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,490
I only told Little Miss about it but
I didn't tell her where I put it.

108
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,030
I checked the cloth the past few days and
it's still there without any changes.

109
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,310
I already took the cloth away.

110
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,380
Why?

111
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,390
I have my own plan. But for you, have you thought about
how to respond to Meng Anren's wedding proposal?

112
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,160
He said that during the Qixi Festival, he will give me
the treasure that he was supposed to give the Princess.

113
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,060
If it's not the Magical Fruit, then I will continue to
get entangled with him until I get the Magical Fruit.

114
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,560
What if it's really
the Magical Fruit?

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,460
Then I'll get the Magical
Fruit and just go.

116
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,320
Just doing that... won't that
make you go against your promise?

117
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,600
<i>This stuff I originally planned to give you during
the Qixi Festival as my proof of love to you.</i>

118
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,910
<i>This way, won't it
have more meaning?</i>

119
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,850
<i>Are you telling the truth? You won't
be intentionally tricking me again?</i>

120
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,870
<i>The one who should be afraid now is me. What if
you get the object and just run off with it?</i>

121
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,330
<i>Then I'll really be someone who paid
with his wife and also lost a soldier.</i>

122
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,830
<i>I am not you so I won't do things
like going against my words.</i>

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,890
<i>Right. Other than Brother and Sister-in-law,
the only one left that I can trust</i>

124
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,700
<i>is you.</i>

125
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,380
But...

126
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,790
But I don't want to marry him.

127
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,200
When I was playing chess with him earlier, I don't know if it's
due to his arrogance; hence, he doesn't want to lose to me.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Or it's because of you; hence,
he treats me as an enemy.

129
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,910
But if he is really willing
to change for the better,

130
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,000
will you still lie to him and pretend
you're sincere when you are not?

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,130
Sect Leader, what should I do?

132
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,500
Just like you said, maybe this person
is not as bad as we think he is.

133
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,780
And also humanity's love
relationships are not my forte.

134
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,080
Whether it's just playing along or
turning a fake act into reality,

135
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm afraid it's up
to you to decide.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,980
Think about it clearly.
I'll go now.

137
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,100
Fei Yue!

138
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,900
Little Miss

139
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,420
What are you doing?

140
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,320
Cross-stitching to
make fragrant pouches.

141
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,180
This is really pretty.

142
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,250
Qixi Festival is near already. Every
Qixi, girls will make a fragrant pouch

143
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,540
to give to their lover as
a proof of their love.

144
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,750
Oh right, you should
make one for Anren, too.

145
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,100
I...don't think I
need to anymore.

146
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,200
You should still make one. The
two of your are engaged already.

147
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,920
But... I... I don't
know how to make these.

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,470
No problem. I'll teach you.

149
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,520
It doesn't matter if you didn't sew it well, the
important thing is that you were the one who made it.

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,350
It's the thought that counts.

151
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,950
Like this. Look at me.

152
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,760
Making an 'X', I can do that.

153
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,960
Why is it so ugly?

154
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,020
<i>Fei Yue, it doesn't matter
if you didn't sew it well,</i>

155
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,940
<i>the important thing is that you were the one
who made it. It's the thought that counts.</i>

156
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,950
I heard from Xiao Hong that
your sewing skill is bad.

157
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,670
The fragrant pouch you made for Second
Young Master allegedly looks ugly.

158
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,320
Who said that? I think
it's quite good.

159
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,820
And also, Little Miss said that
what's important is the thought.

160
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,850
Look at my fingers, their
all full of needle pricks.

161
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,620
- Second Young Master
- What's wrong?

162
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,950
Fei Yue,

163
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,010
I've been looking for you.

164
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,210
Why are you looking for me?

165
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,910
Didn't I say earlier that I'm giving you
a present during the Qixi Festival?

166
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,630
I must do what I said.

167
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,420
This a treasure that is one
of its kind in this world.

168
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,960
Look at it once you're
back in your room, okay?

169
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,810
If it's really the Magical
Fruit, will I really marry him?

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,020
Magical Fruit! It's
really the Magical Fruit!

171
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,920
<i>Fei Yue,</i>

172
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,990
<i>will you marry me?</i>

173
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,990
<i>I will.</i>

174
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,450
<i>I'm willing to marry you.</i>

175
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,880
No way... If I caused him to faint
from shock, won't my sin be greater?

176
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,580
Let's open it first.

177
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,340
"In the evening, at the pavilion beside the
lake. Won't leave if I don't see you."

178
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,080
What is he doing?

179
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,120
- Are you Miss Fei Yue?
- Right, it's me.

180
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,720
Look there.

181
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,080
I've let you wait long.

182
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,300
This is really the gift
that belongs to you.

183
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,890
Open it.

184
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,280
Everyone, this is
my beloved girl.

185
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,370
She hopes that I give
her a rare treasure,

186
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,700
then she'll be
willing to marry me.

187
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,340
But I always hoped that my
sincerity can move her.

188
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,620
In everyone's eyes, I am
a treacherous official.

189
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,220
But from this day on, I want
everyone to be my witness.

190
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,280
For Fei Yue, I am willing not to do
any deceitful things from now on

191
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,000
- and get rid of my bad nicknames.
- Good...

192
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,020
Meng Anren, what is it
that you really want?

193
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,230
Fei Yue, marry me, okay?

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
<i>Marry him...</i>

195
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,100
<i>Marry him...</i>

196
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,890
Fei Yue!

197
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,140
Let's go back to the palace.

198
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,890
Fei Yue!

199
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,660
Fei Yue!

200
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,120
Fei Yue, what's wrong with you?

201
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,630
I did everything
to make you happy.

202
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,230
You...even if you are not
moved, you shouldn't get mad.

203
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,270
I am not mad. It's just that what
you did is putting me at a loss.

204
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,320
I don't know how
to respond to you.

205
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,930
I know already. Maybe because there were a lot
of people there earlier; hence, you were shy.

206
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,030
Now that there are only the
two of us, please answer me.

207
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,790
Can you accept me?

208
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,080
I don't know what's good in me

209
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,490
that's worthy of you
doing all these for me.

210
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,810
Do you really want to marry me?

211
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,430
Until now, I'm still suspicious.

212
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,310
I know. I've never been serious to any
woman or any relationship before.

213
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,760
But since I saw my Big Brother
marry my Sister-in-law,

214
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,230
my thoughts changed.

215
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,970
I saw my Big Brother
happy everyday.

216
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,660
I never saw his face
having so many smiles.

217
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,910
From that point on, I also wanted
to try to treasure someone.

218
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,400
I want to get the
same happiness.

219
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,600
But I haven't decided if I'm
going to marry you or not.

220
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Millet! Sweetened millet!

221
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,260
♫<i> then the moon is
the waiting tide. ♫</i>

222
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,640
Wait for me for a while.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

223
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,210
♫<i> the moon shines over

♫<i> and drops (forget) all

<i> Who’s infatuated with the shine of freedom? ♫</i>

227
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,100
Here, sweetened millet,
it's still warm.

228
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,300
- How did you know I like these?
- Of course I know.

229
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,860
The most important things
are those that we like.

230
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,230
Now, I want to use
something you like

231
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,180
in exchange for
something I like.

232
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,110
- Why is this with you? Give it back.
- I won't.

233
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,450
You made this for me
so I'm wearing it.

234
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,390
No way. It's too ugly.
Hurry and give it to me.

235
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,070
Who said it's ugly?

236
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,210
I like it. I'll
carry it everyday.

237
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,810
This is your thought.

238
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,300
This is a thought that you
were willing to endure pain

239
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,560
from a needle
pricking your fingers

240
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,890
but still finished the
fragrant pouch for me.

241
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:52,100
♫<i> Asking the moon, how
long more must I wait? ♫</i>

242
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:58,110
- Here. ♫<i> Unknowingly sitting
on the cold window sill. ♫</i>

243
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,750
♫<i> Suddenly, he put on the moon’s
color and entered my dream. ♫</i>

244
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,150

245
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,250
Look. ♫<i> Fulfilling my
lifetime of true love. ♫</i>

246
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,470
There.

247
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,720
Thank you Buddha for allowing me and
An De to meet here in the temple.

248
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,810
We are here today to repay
you for fulfilling my wish.

249
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,820
Thank you, Buddha.

250
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,660
When I came here previously, I
was usually carried by others.

251
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,560
Right now, I can walk in by myself.
The feeling is really very good.

252
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,290
Don't overdo it. If you feel tired already,
we can rest here first before going back.

253
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,020
Don't worry. I'm fine. Let's go.

254
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,540
- Husband... - Taoist Master...

255
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,130
Taoist Master, I beg you to let
my wife go. Taoist Master...

256
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,300
Taoist Master, even if she's a monster,
but she never really harmed anyone.

257
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,990
- Taoist Master... - Humans and
monsters cannot fall in love. Get lost.

258
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,300
- Taoist Master... - Husband!

259
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,490
- Taoist Master... - Husband...
- It's right to catch her...

260
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,380
Let's take another
path home instead.

261
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,450
What's wrong?

262
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,630
I really don't understand.

263
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,670
If both love each other, why can't
humans and monsters be together?

264
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,230
Since monsters came to the human world,
they mainly bewitch healthy males

265
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,150
to get their spirit energy
and are never sincere.

266
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,170
Don't generalize. All creatures
have spirits (soul).

267
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,720
Humans can have feelings. Why
can't monsters have feelings?

268
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,930
Humans and monsters are
two different beings.

269
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,260
How can they fall in
love with each other?

270
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,010
An De, if one day,

271
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,910
I became a snake, a fox,
or a weird creature,

272
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,670
then do you think my feelings
for you are sincere or fake?

273
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,830
Wife, why are you doing this?

274
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,430
I know that you are kind. You
feel hurt for those lovers.

275
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,620
But humans are humans, monsters are
monsters, they are two different beings.

276
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,030
They must not have romantic relationship
with each other. They must not.

277
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,050
- Go get some logs and bring them here.
- Yes.

278
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:47,050
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to
you by Gone With the Shirt Team</i>

279
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,990
Sect Chief, there's movement.

280
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Sect Chief's hunch was correct.
It was indeed her.

281
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,510
Fei Yue was always cursing that Meng Anren, but she
didn't know that the one who was lying to her the most

282
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,710
was the one she considered as
her true sister, Miss Fan.

283
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,300
Whether Fan Qianru is really the thief who stole the
Magical Fruit still lacks one important evidence.

284
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,790
Why do we need more evidence? When Sect Chief went to the
Meng Mansion and noticed that the cloth had been replaced,

285
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,140
while she's the only
one who knew about it.

286
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,650
If she's not the thief,
then who else would it be?

287
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,770
That may be correct.
But to cure An De,

288
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,920
she's willing to use up her powers.
This is the legendary story of

289
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,340
the Golden Fox who stayed in the human world
for hundreds of years to wait for her lover.

290
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,230
How can a person like this be someone
who wants to destroy the world

291
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,170
and will covet the
Magical Fruit?

292
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,120
So she is the
legendary Golden Fox?

293
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,840
If she's not the one who stole the
Magical Fruit, then who could it be?

294
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Things are getting complicated.

295
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,610
Should we tell Fei
Yue about this?

296
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,680
While we still don't have evidence that
Fan Qianru is the female fox thief,

297
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,940
I don't want to destroy
their relationship.

298
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,940
Sister... your white
hairs are increasing.

299
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,710
Don't tell me anymore.
Just pull them out.

300
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,560
How can that be okay? This
is also not a good method.

301
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,700
Maybe you should eat something
to supplement your health.

302
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,190
It won't work. Just do as I say.

303
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,000
If even a small problem like
my hair would make me worry,

304
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,650
then things I should worry
about everyday would be many.

305
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,120
Sister, what are you worried about?
You can tell me.

306
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,160
I can help you share the burden.

307
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,810
I am worried about
you and Anren.

308
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,420
How come we got
involved in this?

309
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,620
Because I am the matchmaker.

310
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,510
If you hadn't went with
me to Meng Residence,

311
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,500
then you and Anren wouldn't
have that deep destiny.

312
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,510
Me and An De are sincerely wishing
that the two of you marry soon.

313
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,460
A few days ago, he said that the Emperor was going on an outside
trip so he needs to take care of some things in the palace.

314
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,000
I haven't seen him for
several days already.

315
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,250
Several days? That can't be...

316
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,250
He visits An De everyday.

317
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,800
This Anren... Don't worry,
I will talk to him.

318
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,810
Don't do that, Sister.

319
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,190
Maybe he's really busy.

320
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,880
On the contrary, you appear sick.
You should rest more.

321
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,630
Don't worry anymore
about our problems.

322
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,860
Prime Minister Zhao, are you still insisting
to send more troops to suppress the rebels?

323
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,260
Training troops for thousands of days are for this type of situation.
We must suppress the rebellion to bring stability to the government.

324
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,120
Of course, I will
send military troops.

325
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,880
Prime Minister Zhao, right now
there are a lot of calamities

326
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,910
and they need a lot of money
to help the affected.

327
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,510
I think that you should listen to
Minister Meng's suggestions...

328
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,960
I will think about Minister
Meng's suggestions.

329
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,260
The two of you
need not say more.

330
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,120
Prime Minister, stopping the rebellion
and bringing stabilization is important,

331
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,680
but helping those affected by calamities also need to be addressed
now. Right now, the government's fund is not enough to address both.

332
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,310
Regarding increasing the troops, I hope that
Prime Minister can consider the citizens

333
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,130
and think about
delaying it for now.

334
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,400
I also feel for the
calamity affected citizens.

335
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,210
But it's just that the war on the
front lines is very intense.

336
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,800
It's the best chance to suppress the
rebels and should not be delayed.

337
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,290
If we missed this chance and
His Majesty would blame us,

338
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,060
this responsibility
is not yours to bear

339
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,810
but it's mine.

340
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,200
If that time you allowed
me to lead the troops,

341
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,750
I would definitely bear
the responsibility now.

342
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,920
But at that time, you, Prime Minister Zhao,
would not give up the rights to the military.

343
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,630
Minister Meng and I have
something different.

344
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,980
What you think
highly of is power,

345
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,040
while I think highly of
are promises and loyalty.

346
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Since His Majesty gave me the full
responsibility with regards to the rebels,

347
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,570
I will surely do my best

348
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,710
and will definitely not
disappoint His Majesty.

349
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,050
Prime Minister...

350
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,950
Saying words that sound to be reasonable in a stern and powerful
way and dignified but are all hypocritical to the highest level.

351
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,200
Suppressing the rebellion saves citizens, but giving
help in calamity stricken areas also saves citizens.

352
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,450
Why should we prioritize his
suppression of rebellion?

353
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,270
If at that time you were the one who led the troops,
the rebellion would have been suppressed already.

354
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,230
Right. In terms of tactics
and intelligence,

355
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,720
Minister Meng is way
better than that Zhao Gao.

356
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
This Prime Minister
position should be yours.

357
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,720
Master Meng...

358
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,720
Master Meng!

359
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,390
Princess! What a coincidence!

360
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,320
Why are you so happy? I've already
heard about the matters in the court.

361
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,790
Princess knows that I am not someone who cares much
about the state of the country and the citizens.

362
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,550
Don't lie to me anymore. Right now, there are calamities
everywhere and the citizens are waiting to be saved.

363
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,280
But my Royal Brother gave all the money to Zhao
Gao to fund his suppression of the rebels.

364
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,560
You must be worrying about how to get funds
to help the calamity stricken areas, right?

365
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,120
His Majesty likes him so I
can't do anything about it.

366
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,750
He is a loyal subject,
an old subject.

367
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,860
But if the rebel suppression was
given to me from the start,

368
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,160
we surely wouldn't
have this problem now.

369
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,710
You also know that among us siblings,
the Emperor loves me the most.

370
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,860
Do you want me to say some good
words to my Royal Brother for you

371
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,880
and let the calamity fund
be given to the citizens.

372
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,660
If Princess is willing to
help the affected citizens,

373
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,430
then I will be forever grateful.
I am thanking you now.

374
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,760
Just by saying is not enough.
How do you plan to thank me?

375
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,410
What does Princess want?

376
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,320
Just tell me. Gold, silver, pearl, treasure,
make-up, or perfume? I'll give them all to you.

377
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,460
I want...

378
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,640
this one.

379
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,990
This one's so ugly. Why
would you like it?

380
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,880
Your taste is really
getting worse.

381
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,330
If my taste is bad then
wouldn't your taste be worse?

382
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,020
But it really does
look quite ugly.

383
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,560
I have never seen such a
poorly made fragrance pouch.

384
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,320
Not talking about he embroidery,
even her sewing is not straight.

385
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,100
Just return it to me then.

386
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,240
Who gave you this?

387
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,010
I get gifts from a lot of women every
year. How can I remember all of them?

388
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,000
If you don't remember it already,
then this belongs to me.

389
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll look for another one tomorrow that is
more well made and will fit your high status

390
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,070
and then gift it to you.
Is that okay?

391
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,840
What if I must have this?

392
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,760
What's going on?

393
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,200
Don't think I don't know. During the day of the Qixi
Festival, you and her were at the lake side. I saw it all.

394
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,630
She's called Feng Fei Yue.

395
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,700
I thought that you would never
really fall for any woman.

396
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,130
But looking at it now,

397
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,550
I might be wrong.

398
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm just fooling her.

399
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,080
Really?

400
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,060
But I can see that when you are
with her, you laugh happily.

401
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,980
She's really stupid.

402
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,130
She can't differentiate between what's true
and fake. If not, why would I lie to her.

403
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,780
Fine.

404
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,920
Then I want to see how
you will trick her.

405
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,330
If it will make me happy, then I will definitely
say good words for you in front of Royal Brother.

406
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,550
What calamity funds? Just
give them to the citizens.

407
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,540
But if you can't,

408
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,070
then I'll report you
to Royal Brother

409
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,780
and have you killed.

410
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,840
It's really beautiful here.

411
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,940
Yes. So beautiful.

412
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,900
It's just sad that sometimes
when flowers blossom,

413
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,650
the good scenery
doesn't last long.

414
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,290
Close your eyes.

415
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,220
Close my eyes?

416
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,730
Why?

417
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,250
I told you to close them,
so just close them.

418
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,120
Raise your arms.

419
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,220
Despite closing one's eyes, one can still
smell the bursts of a flower's fragrance.

420
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,400
One burst of wind blowing by,

421
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,250
you can then hear the sound of
bursts of flowers falling down.

422
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,620
Isn't it the scene you see
with your eyes closed

423
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,650
more beautiful than when
your eyes are open?

424
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,870
Are you willing to marry me?

425
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,320
I'm willing.

426
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm willing to marry you.

427
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,620
Princess!

428
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,370
Meng Anren, I'm really
impressed with you.

429
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:59,010
You can't find any other person who is
as mean and lowly as you in this world.

430
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,100
The truth is I have a more darker damaging
technique. Do you want to try it Princess?

431
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,370
What do you mean by this?

432
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,420
How come you still cannot get it until
now? This woman is really so dumb.

433
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,600
You think I will like you?

434
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,200
I've already seen a lot of women
with features like yours.

435
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,100
I will never marry you.

436
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Anren, you must be lying to me. You're
just playing a joke with me, right?

437
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,960
You swore once that you would never
marry even if you had to die

438
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,680
and you even conspired
with Zhao Gao to frame me.

439
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,200
You think I have forgotten
about all these?

440
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,490
You did all of these

441
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,080
just to take revenge on me?

442
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,450
Right.

443
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,960
I already let you hit me once. I won't let
you have the chance to slap me again.

444
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:18,170
<i> Timing and subtitles brought to
you by Gone With the Shirt Team</i>

445
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,030
Grandma...

446
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,480
Being a Mythical Fox of Qing Qiou, you failed to find the Magical
Fruit and even got yourself followed by more disastrous debts.

447
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,350
You even have the face to
come crying back here?

448
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,890
Grandma, it's all my fault.

449
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,770
It's all because I'm
so dumb and stupid!

450
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,990
Why did I believe his words?

451
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,120
But... other than Qing Qiou...

452
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,670
I really don't know where to go?

453
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,680
At the start, you were courageously moving forward.
But right now you want to hide and retreat?

454
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,420
What's that? Dare to do it, dare to
live with it. You better go back there!

455
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,740
- Grandma... - Go back!

456
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,720
Grandma, don't drive me away...

457
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,880
Grandma, don't be like this.

458
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,100
Why are you doing this?

459
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,020
If you don't sharpen a knife it will not slice fast.
A soft hammer will not be able to hammer iron.

460
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,040
If she doesn't go through this experience,
how can she learn to be good and grow up.

461
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,750
This is her time to train. We
must not become soft-hearted.

462
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:05,030
♫<i> Your tenderness
slashed open my wound ♫</i>

463
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:11,930
♫<i> Turned the whole night sky into fresh red. Heartache so
splendid that you can’t open your mouth to say a word ♫</i>

464
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,340
♫<i> My suspicions took me to a never ending fall from
grace. Didn’t have enough time to undo all the silence ♫</i>

465
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:27,470
♫<i> Didn’t have enough time to undo
all the silence and finally drown ♫</i>

466
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:35,330
- Magical fruit... ♫<i> Not begging you to understand.
Just begging you not to make me cry. ♫</i>

467
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,590
Magical fruit...

468
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,630
Give me back the
Magical Fruit...

469
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,170
Magical fruit...

470
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,380
Give me back the
Magical Fruit...

471
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,900
Give it back...

472
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,000
- Magical fruit?
- Magical fruit...

473
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,230
Magical fruit...

474
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,650
- Fei Yue...
- Give it back. Magical fruit...

475
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,340
Wake up. Fei Yue

476
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,950
You're awake.

477
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,450
How come I can still see
you even if I'm dead?

478
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,570
You're not dead.

479
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,710
Then why are we here?

480
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,450
I am the one who
brought you back here.

481
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,070
You still have a fever.

482
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,680
- Second Young Master, the medicine
is here. - Okay, give it to me.

483
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,290
Hurry and drink it.

484
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,920
You can hate me but you
must drink the medicine.

485
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,380
Do you know that your body
is very weak right now?

486
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,430
Continue to brew the medicine.
Brew it until she drinks it.

487
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,700
I won't drink the medicine
you made even if I die.

488
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,340
You listen.

489
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,670
I'll leave Fei Yue to
your care from now on.

490
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,260
Brew medicine for her to drink. If she
doesn't drink it, I will blame it on you.

491
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,700
If she doesn't drink it once, I'll
hit (with planks) you 10 times.

492
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,260
Doesn't drink it twice, I'll hit
you 20 times. Do you understand?

493
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,280
- Yes, Young Master. - Go then.

494
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,450
How's that?

495
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,110
I won't fall for
your trick again.

496
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,660
- Get away! - Hey, Fei Yue.

497
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,990
- Fei Yue, what are you doing?
- Get lost.

498
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,660
Where are you going?

499
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,730
A place where I won't see you.

500
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,550
- Young Master - No need.
- Okay.

501
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,150
- Miss, what's wrong with you?
- Fei Yue, come.

502
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,420
- Are you okay? - Get lost.

503
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,660
Fei Yue!

504
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,240
Get out of the way...

505
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,350
Fei Yue!

506
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,540
- Fei Yue... - Get lost.

507
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,970
Disperse quickly!

508
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,720
- Men! - Second Young Master!

509
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,500
- Call the Royal Physician!
- Yes.

510
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,940
How is it?

511
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,920
The fever is due to a cold.

512
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,590
And also, Miss seems to have experienced
great shock or provocation,

513
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,330
such that her anger is accumulating in her
heart and causing disarray in her pulse

514
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,400
and weakens her breathing.

515
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,930
This...

516
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,990
But Master Meng shouldn't
be too worried.

517
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,420
As long as you prevent Miss to
experience anymore shock or provocation,

518
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:20,900
let her take her medicines on time daily, and let her
recuperate peacefully, she will be cured in no time.

519
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,160
- Thank you, Doctor.
- No need to be polite.

520
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,550
Hurry. Escort Royal Physician Zhang
back and get the medicines, too.

521
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,610
- Yes, Young Master.
- Sorry to have troubled you.

522
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,950
Please.

523
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,440
Meng Anren!

524
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,470
Sister-in-law.

525
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,490
What scene (act) are
you acting now?

526
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,940
Yesterday, the two
of you happily left.

527
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,960
Just one night and everything
was different. Why is that?

528
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,900
There are some things...I
don't know how to say it.

529
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,620
What do you mean by not knowing how
to say it? I understand everything.

530
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,750
Fei Yue is a naive, nice girl.
She doesn't do schemes.

531
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,140
If you treat her well,
she will treat you well.

532
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,030
You exerted a lot of effort
just to make her like you.

533
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,410
Are those really just
to hurt her feelings?

534
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,560
If it's like that, then why
did you still bring her home?

535
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,060
I like Fei Yue very much. She's
simple, naive, just, and kind.

536
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,320
She also treats you very well and I can see that
you also treat her differently from others.

537
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,390
I also sincerely want to
bring you two together.

538
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,950
But since you cannot treat her
well, then just let her go.

539
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,110
Don't...

540
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,650
Royal Physician said that she cannot have
any more provocation. I'll go on ahead.

541
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,260
Wait a moment.

542
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,050
Think about my words well.

543
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,040
There are people and things that once you let
them pass by, they won't return anymore.
