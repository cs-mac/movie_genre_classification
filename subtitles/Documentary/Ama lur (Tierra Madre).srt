1
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,997
I'm going to call.

2
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,668
"Transplant Coordination"

3
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,430
National Transplant
Organization.

4
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,807
- Manuela, Ramony Cajal Hospital.
- Yes.

5
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,018
We've got a possible donor.

6
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,438
We've done the first EEG,
and the family has agreed.

7
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,565
Give me the details.

8
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,318
Male, 35 years old.

9
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,694
Blood group?

10
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,950
"O" positive.
Weight, about 70 kilograms.

11
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,995
"Liver"

12
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,169
"Liver Recipients"

13
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,804
Not a single drop!

14
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,432
- With Dodoti Diapers...
- Dodotis!

15
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,520
you won't feel a drop!

16
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,607
- Mom!
- What?

17
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,359
The movie is starting.

18
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,071
I'm coming.

19
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,828
Eve Unveiled

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,788
They always change the title!

21
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,875
"All About Eve" should be
"Todo Sobre Eva."

22
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,962
But that sounds odd.

23
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,762
What are you writing?

24
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,473
Nothing.

25
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,058
Future Pulitzer winners.

26
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,977
All About My Mother

27
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,479
Eat up. You have to put on
a few pounds.

28
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,317
Someday you may have
to work the street to keep me.

29
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,196
You don't need pounds for that.
You need a big dick.

30
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,865
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

31
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,369
- You asked.
- I was joking.

32
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,873
- And you?
- What about me?

33
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,919
Would you prostitute yourself
for me?

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,299
I've already done
just about everything for you.

35
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,511
Eat up!

36
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,430
Autograph fiends!
They're not people.

37
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,225
They're little beasts
that run in packs like coyotes.

38
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,851
They're your fans.

39
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,603
They're nobody's fans.

40
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,689
They're juvenile delinquents,
mental defectives.

41
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,982
Fans, indeed!

42
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,402
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

43
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,905
Well, there's one indoors
right now..

44
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:44,660
I brought her back to see you.
Come in, Eve.

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,537
I thought you'd forgotten
about me.

46
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,996
Not at all.

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,998
Margo,
this is Eve Harrington.

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,501
- How do you do, my dear?
- Hello.

49
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,920
Would you like to be
an actress?

50
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,589
it was hard enough
becoming a nurse.

51
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,843
if you were an actress,
I'd write parts for you.

52
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,428
I was in an amateur group
when I was young.

53
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,597
I wasn't bad.

54
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,475
I must have a picture
somewhere.

55
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,353
I'd love to see it.

56
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,607
I'll look for it later.

57
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,196
Look, Esteban.

58
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,284
I found a picture.

59
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,248
We were doing a show
based on texts by Boris Viian.

60
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,669
Cabaret for intellectuals.

61
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,098
Happy birthday!

62
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,144
- Already?
- it's midnight, sweetheart.

63
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,148
"Music for Chameleons."
How did you know I wanted it?

64
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,400
I know you like Capote.

65
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:03,655
Read me something,
like when I was little.

66
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,076
"Preface.

67
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,412
I started writing
when I was eight."

68
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,373
See? I'm not the only one.

69
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,959
"I didn't know
that I had chained myself for life...

70
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,962
to a noble
but merciless master.

71
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:24,134
When God hands you a gift,
he also hands you a whip...

72
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:28,722
and the whip is intended
only for self- flagellation."

73
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,974
That's enough
to put you off writing.

74
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,935
Don't be so lame.

75
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,979
it's a wonderful preface.

76
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,274
How do you want
to celebrate your birthday?

77
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,610
I'd like to see
one of your seminars.

78
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,195
Why?

79
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,157
I'm writing a story about you
for a competition.

80
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,662
And I'd like to see you act
in those organ donation courses.

81
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,873
Well, I'd have to check
with Mamen.

82
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,167
She's the psychologist
in charge of the seminar.

83
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,587
Fine. Do it.

84
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,382
I don't think I like you writing
about me.

85
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,968
Your husband is dead, ma'am.

86
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,345
That's impossible.

87
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,139
We just saw him in the ICU.
He seemed to be breathing.

88
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,644
We've explained that, ma'am.
A machine is breathing for him.

89
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:19,439
Would you like us
to contact your family?

90
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,942
I don't have any family.

91
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,862
Just my son.

92
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,739
My God!
How am I going to tell him?

93
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,242
When he was alive,
did your husband say anything...

94
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,786
regarding organ donation?

95
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,706
Did he care about such matters?

96
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,126
When he was alive,
he cared only about living.

97
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,964
But I presume he was concerned
with the lives of others.

98
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,549
I don't understand.

99
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,595
What my colleague means
is that your husband's organs...

100
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,014
could save other patients lives.

101
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,641
But we need
your authorization for that.

102
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,978
You could give him
a transplant?

103
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,233
Not exactly.
The other way around, actually.

104
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:16,622
Now we'll discuss
what happened in the simulation.

105
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,542
Look when you cross the street!

106
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,961
- What were you thinking?
- I had an idea.

107
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:08,632
An idea!
Give him the tickets.

108
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,346
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?

109
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,266
No, you look better than ever.

110
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,936
Look, that must be
the gentleman you were expecting.

111
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,356
You aren't Mr. Huntleigh!

112
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,277
Neither are you!

113
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:48,213
These fingernails will have
to be trimmed.

114
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,506
The jacket, Doctor.

115
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,301
Ask her to let go of me!

116
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,761
Please!

117
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,432
Let her go.

118
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,022
Get up.

119
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,027
Lean on my arm...

120
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,446
Miss Du Bois.

121
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,947
Thank you.

122
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,532
Who ever you are...

123
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:21,288
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

124
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,050
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

125
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,844
Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

126
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,973
Watch your language!

127
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,192
Stella, come here.

128
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,782
I'm never coming back
to this house.

129
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,953
Never!

130
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,210
I'd like to get
Huma Rojo's autograph.

131
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:13,757
- in this weather?
- What's that got to do with it?

132
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,722
What if nobody comes out?

133
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,726
Let's wait a while.
it's my birthday.

134
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,146
Look, autumn's here already.

135
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,693
- So long.
- See you tomorrow.

136
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,321
Nina Cruz really moved you,
didn't she?

137
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,658
No, not her. Stella.

138
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,121
Twenty years ago, we did Streetcar
with the drama group in my town.

139
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,456
I played Stella.

140
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,667
Your father was Kowalski.

141
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,920
Someday you'll have to tell me
all about my father.

142
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,922
All I know is
he died before I was born.

143
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,050
- it isn't an easy story to tell.
- I guess not.

144
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,761
Or you'd have told me by now.

145
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,806
I nearly asked for that
as a birthday present.

146
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,850
I'm not sure
it would be a nice present.

147
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:09,813
You're wrong.
it would be the best one.

148
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:16,320
Then I'll tell you everything
when we get home.

149
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:21,408
Working in theater
is worse than being a nun!

150
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,204
You think not being able to get stoned
all day is being a nun!

151
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,290
Yeah, I do!

152
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,920
Alfonso XII Street, number 30.

153
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:38,509
Come on, forget about it!

154
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,834
My son!

155
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,864
Tomorrow I turn 17,
but I look older..

156
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,909
Boys who live alone with their mothers
have a special look...

157
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,496
more serious than normal,
like an intellectual or a writer..

158
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:55,169
in my case that's normal,
because I'm also a writer..

159
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:02,176
"Intensive Care Unit"

160
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,929
This is Lola, at Ramony Cajal.

161
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,599
Yes?

162
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,143
We've got a possible donor.
He's in the ICU.

163
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,936
They've done the first EEG...

164
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,689
but the mother hasn't given
her consent yet.

165
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,357
Can I have the details?

166
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,484
I don't have them.
it's Manuela's son.

167
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,322
The Manuela that I know?
The coordinator?

168
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,868
Yes. He's dead.
it's awful.

169
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,392
Unfortunately...

170
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:59,399
the resultof the EEG
is what we'd feared.

171
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:11,078
We have to make a decision
immediately.

172
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:16,375
"Consent by next of kin"

173
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:49,825
"Operating Room"

174
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,121
"Heart"

175
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,095
it's from the hospital!

176
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,805
We have to go.
We have to call.

177
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:17,811
- I'll do it.You calm down.
- I am calm- - but call them.

178
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:25,777
"Alvedro Airport, Coruna"

179
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:03,565
"Regional Hospital, Coruna"

180
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,666
"Three weeks later"

181
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,297
We're outside now,
sweet heart.

182
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,841
We're out at last.

183
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,593
He looks great.
Who'd have believed it?

184
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,679
He certainly didn't.

185
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,556
I feel I can breathe
like before.

186
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,225
- Even better.
- With an 18- year- old's heart!

187
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:44,439
- I'll fix you some apple fritters.
- No, he has to be careful.

188
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,861
Last night, Mom showed me
a picture of when she was young.

189
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,988
Half of it was missing.

190
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:56,952
I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half.

191
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,302
I was worried.

192
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,679
I thought you'd never call.

193
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,848
I called
as soon as I got to Madrid.

194
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,558
I mean in Argentina.

195
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,935
I called you loads of times...

196
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:25,355
but I must have got
your aunt's number wrong.

197
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:30,819
I wasn't in Argentina, Mamen.
I went to Coruna.

198
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,998
Why did you got here?

199
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,085
I went after my son's heart.

200
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,130
Who told you?
How did you know?

201
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,715
I looked in the files...

202
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:55,177
until I found the name and address
of the transplant recipient.

203
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,513
You shouldn't have.

204
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,182
It was wrong,
and the best way to go crazy.

205
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,309
- Look at me, damn it!
- I know that.

206
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,312
The best thing for me
is to quit the NTO and leave Madrid.

207
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:09,483
- I didn't say that.
- But you think it- - and you're right.

208
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,485
I think I won't even unpack.

209
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:15,447
You're in no shape to travel alone.
You're ill.

210
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,075
You have to rest up
and get better.

211
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,952
I'll stay here tonight.

212
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,539
- Then come home with me.
- I want to be alone, Mamen.

213
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,168
- Try to be reasonable.
- How?

214
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,971
Seventeen years ago,
I made this same journey...

215
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:43,183
but in the opposite direction,
from Barcelona to Madrid

216
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,602
I was running away then too...

217
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,230
but I wasn't alone.

218
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,900
I was carrying Esteban
inside me.

219
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:55,028
I was running away
from his father then...

220
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,783
and now. I'm going
in search of him.

221
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:08,852
- Shall I keep going?
- Yes, go on.

222
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,896
Stop!

223
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,735
Son of a bitch!

224
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,954
You're crazy, you faggot!

225
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:02,341
Son of a bitch!

226
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,478
- What did you do?
- I hit him with a stone.

227
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,649
- Help me get him up.
- Get up. Come on.

228
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,443
Come on, Juan. Get up.

229
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,613
Are you all right?
Stand up.

230
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,074
Let's get moving.

231
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:31,078
come on, quickly.

232
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,166
What a fucking useless psychopath!

233
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,586
Look.

234
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,048
See that bonfire
where the "tops" are?

235
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,716
Ask for Ursula.

236
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,427
Tell her Agrado sent you.
She'll fix you up.

237
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,931
Agrado!

238
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,474
it's you!

239
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:56,103
Manolita!

240
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,732
You're hurt.

241
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,026
No, no, it's your blood.

242
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,904
it isn't because you saved my life,
but how I've missed you!

243
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,283
Eighteen years- - not a word,
not a letter, not a fucking call.

244
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,493
I thought you were dead, bitch!

245
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,287
You can tell me every thing
at home.

246
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:17,624
We'll stop by a drugstore first.
Can we get a taxi here?

247
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,626
Over there.

248
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,212
With any luck,
we won't get mugged on the way.

249
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:27,759
- You got the knife?
- Yes, and a rock in my purse.

250
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:33,265
Hey, there, bonanit.

251
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,768
Look, I'm sorry I woke you.

252
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,396
- Hey, come over here.
- No. What do you want?

253
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:42,941
- We're not going to eat you.
- What do you want?

254
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,902
Let me do the talking.

255
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,614
Povidone- iodine,
approximation sutures...

256
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,950
Thrombocid,
sterilized gauze and- -

257
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:55,120
- You got any alcohol?
- No, I drank it all last night.

258
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,955
I mean for disinfecting.

259
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:01,793
No. I've got Vaseline, condoms
and lots of bandages.

260
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:05,881
- Anything else?
- Alcohol, please.

261
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:09,176
Oh, Manolita!
The Barceloneta!

262
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:12,221
Those were the days!
You remember?

263
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:17,017
Yes.
Please, don't move your head.

264
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,479
You know anything
about her?

265
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,564
About who? Lola?

266
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,400
- Unfortunately.
- What happened?

267
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,319
I took her in.
She was in a bad way.

268
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:30,447
As usual,
with all the shit she takes.

269
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,616
I came back from working
the Field all night...

270
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,910
and she'd cleaned the place out.

271
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,121
Watches, jewelry, '70s magazines
that were my inspiration.

272
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,915
300,000 pesetas.

273
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,667
What hurt most was...

274
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,962
she took a statue of the Virgin
that my mother gave me.

275
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,256
What for?
She doesn't believe in anything!

276
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,677
Unless she's in a satanic sect
and wanted it for some ritual.

277
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,679
I see she hasn't changed.

278
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,348
To do that to me,
with all she owes me!

279
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,852
Since we met in Paris 20 years ago,
I've been like a sister to her.

280
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:05,607
We got our tits together.
You know better than anyone.

281
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,236
- You never saw her again?
- No, and I don't want to.

282
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,155
Are you looking for her?

283
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,242
Yes.

284
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:19,621
We've got unsettled business.

285
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:24,042
Why did you go off like that?

286
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:29,506
Won't you tell me any thing?

287
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,843
I can't.

288
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,095
Some other day.

289
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:36,638
All right.

290
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,266
Just don't disappear again.

291
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,019
I like to say good- bye
to the people I love...

292
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,274
even if it's only
to cry my eyes out, bitch.

293
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,924
I can't believe it.

294
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,143
I look like the Elephant Man!

295
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:26,271
Don't exaggerate.
it's just a bit swollen.

296
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,650
A bit swollen?
Where can I go with a mug like this?

297
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,485
Come and eat something.

298
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:34,112
Why did you go
To all this trouble?

299
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,032
Salad- - how wonderful!

300
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,910
it really hurts to chew!

301
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,453
I won't be able to suck.

302
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,413
You shouldn't work today.

303
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,165
What can I do?

304
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,209
Lola cleaned me out.
I have to work.

305
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,795
Look, caramel spread!
And meat pie!

306
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,171
And my provoleta.

307
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,923
I have to work too.

308
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,050
if you want,
we can look together.

309
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:58,345
Oh, yes!

310
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,931
Since you left,
I haven't had a decent meal.

311
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,934
Well, also, as a model,
I have to watch my figure.

312
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,854
The worst thing about this work
is you've got to look cute...

313
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:13,068
and keep up with the latest advances
in surgeryand cosmetics.

314
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,741
You look terrific!

315
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,119
Nothing like a Chanel
to make you feel respectable.

316
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,121
You look it.

317
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,373
Don't I look a bit of a slut
in this suit?

318
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,583
All the better.

319
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:32,045
These nuns only help
whores and transvestites.

320
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,881
is that a real Chanel?

321
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:38,677
No! How could I buy a real Chanel
with all the hunger in the world!

322
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:41,221
All I have that's real
are my feelings...

323
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,016
and these pints of silicone
that weigh a ton.

324
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,102
I feel so old, Manolita,
and it isn't my age.

325
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,563
it's because of the beating.

326
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:54,109
The beating I've taken
for the last 40 years!

327
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,403
- Hello.
- Come in.

328
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,572
Are you looking for someone,
or can I help?

329
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,699
We want to see the girl
who goes to the Field.

330
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,493
The cute one.

331
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,703
Sister Rosa. She's inside.
Go on in.

332
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:08,332
Thank you.

333
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:19,676
Rosa, look. Visitors.

334
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,973
What happened to your face?

335
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,643
Nothing. A beating.
Occupational hazard.

336
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,811
- Can we talk?
- Ofcourse.

337
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,148
Let's go next door.
it's quieter.

338
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,234
My friend and I want
to quit the street...

339
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,860
but we need towork.

340
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,905
Cleaning stairs, whatever.
We don't care.

341
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,323
There isn't much else.

342
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,868
Well, garbagecollector,
or learning handicrafts here.

343
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,830
Embroidered tablecloths,
dried flowers.

344
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,833
I think I prefer
garbagecollector.

345
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,709
What can you do,
apart from the street?

346
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,711
I've worked as a cook.

347
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,547
She's practically a surgeon.

348
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,507
Look at this face.
She did it.

349
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,426
Better than Pitan guy.
She's a compatriot of Lola's.

350
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,763
Really? Have you heard
anything about her?

351
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,765
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

352
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,809
She cleaned out my place.

353
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,394
She was here.

354
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,771
it must have been
about four months ago.

355
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,274
We helped her through detox

356
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,192
I cared for her
through with drawal...

357
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:19,862
but then she just disappeared.

358
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,906
I'd like to see her
before I goto El Salvador.

359
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,825
El Salvador?

360
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,493
Maybe I'll sign on.

361
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:30,122
I always thought I could
make it big in the Third World.

362
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,124
Then come with me.
I won't be so alone.

363
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,585
The street's getting worse here
everyday.

364
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:38,380
The whores were bad enough,
but the drag queens are wiping us out.

365
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,591
I can't stand the drag queens.
They're sleaze bags.

366
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,843
They confuse transvestism
with a circus.

367
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,720
Worse, with mime!

368
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,347
A woman is her hair,
her nails...

369
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,391
lips for sucking or for bitching.

370
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,269
I mean, have you ever seen
a bald woman?

371
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:56,523
I can't stand them.
They're all sleaze bags!

372
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,609
I doubt there are
many drag queens in El Salvador...

373
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,194
but they're
in the middle of a war.

374
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,530
Yeah? I didn't know that.

375
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,991
I'm replacing some nuns
who were murdered.

376
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,661
I'm not sure
what I need right now is awar.

377
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,789
You're terrible, Agrado.

378
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,833
So you were a cook.

379
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,959
Yes.

380
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,794
Who? This one?

381
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:21,423
The best!

382
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,197
What a surprise!

383
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,782
Hi, Mom.

384
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,200
Are we interrupting?

385
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:53,288
it doesn't matter.
We see you so rarely.

386
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,916
- This is Manuela.
- Pleased to meet you.

387
00:31:55,958 --> 00:32:00,337
Come inside.
Don't just stand there.

388
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,088
Mom, Manuela is a cook...

389
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,508
and as Florinda's gone,
I thought- -

390
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,553
Thank you, darling.
Vicenta and I can manage.

391
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,556
But how?
Dad alone needs two people.

392
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,141
- Where is he?
- Out with thedog.

393
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,685
- On their own?
- Ofcourse.

394
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:16,019
What if they get lost?

395
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,564
The dog knows the way home.
Don't worry.

396
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,108
What a shame!
I really wanted to see them.

397
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,819
We'll go look for them,
but first we have to talk.

398
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,028
Come into the studio.

399
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,447
I'm sorry you came for nothing.

400
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,741
- it's all right.
- Try her for a fewdays.

401
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,286
Think of Dad.
Manuela is a nurse.

402
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,704
- As well as a cook?
- Yes.

403
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,582
I prefer to look
after your father myself.

404
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,127
I understand.
Thank you anyway. I'll go.

405
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,044
Good- bye.

406
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,754
- Manuela.
- Yes?

407
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:47,342
Wait here.
I won't be long.

408
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,971
How dare you bring
a whore here!

409
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:54,057
it isn't easy to find help
who'll put up with you.

410
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,434
But a whore!

411
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,603
That's no reason
to be so rude.

412
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:01,023
I don't like strangers
to see me forging Chagalls.

413
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,691
Can't you understand?

414
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,777
Manuela isn't a whore anymore.
She's given it up.

415
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,738
How long have you known her?

416
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,490
Since this morning.

417
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:13,452
This morning?
You're incredible.

418
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,287
My work is to help people...

419
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,080
even if I've just met them.

420
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,082
Well, mine isn't.

421
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:23,086
Don't look at me like that.
it doesn't mean I'm intolerant.

422
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:26,131
- I'll make you a deal.
- A deal?

423
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:30,427
I'll give that woman a chance
if you don't go to El Salvador.

424
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:33,180
Mom, don't give me any more doubts.
I've got enough.

425
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,807
And so you should.
That trip is suicide!

426
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,976
No, it's parricide!

427
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,312
Well, I have to go.

428
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,939
Manuela's waiting.

429
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,359
Sure! Any whore, any Salvadoran,
is more important than your parents!

430
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,739
- Don't start, Mom.
- You should go see a psychiatrist.

431
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,493
it wouldn't do
either of us any harm.

432
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:57,204
Didn't you want to see
your father and the dog?

433
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,164
Another day.

434
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:02,793
Are you all right?

435
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:06,672
Good- bye, Mom.

436
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,724
- Hello, Vicenta.
- Rosa, love.

437
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,352
- You're so thin.Aren't you eating?
- Yes, I am.

438
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,981
- Did you see a blonde girl downstairs?
- No.

439
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:28,652
- So long.
- Take care- - and eat!

"A Streetcar Named Desire"

441
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,587
I'm sorry about my mother.

442
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:50,257
I'm sorry.

443
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,967
Shall we go?

444
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,554
I can't deal with my mother.
She drives me crazy.

445
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,640
- Have you got parents?
- They're dead.

446
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,893
So you're alone.

447
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,811
I guess so.

448
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,605
You look awful.

449
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,441
I don't feel very well.

450
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:11,487
I want to throw up.

451
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:15,741
I've got- -

452
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,495
Here.

453
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,956
Have you seen the doctor?

454
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:27,920
You should.
it may just be gastritis.

455
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:32,132
Can we go to your place
until this passes?

456
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,550
Well- -

457
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:35,260
Do you have a place?

458
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:40,807
I've just rented one,
but it's barely furnished.

459
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,396
it's quite a mess.

460
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,149
I moved in four days ago.

461
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,943
You want to lie down
for a while?

462
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,737
No, I'll just sit here on the sofa...

463
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:54,947
until it passes.

464
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:59,076
I'm going to take this off.

465
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:03,539
Who's this handsome boy?

466
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,000
My son.

467
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,420
I thought you were alone.

468
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,590

Don't touch the notebook,
please.

come on, baby.
The worst is over.

472
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,224
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

473

00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,293
You shouldn't be here.

481
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,128
Nina's gone.

482
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,549
What?

483
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,305
Where's Nina?

484
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:30,227
I don't know.
I just saw her run out.

485
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:36,066
She said she'd wait for me
in her dressing room!

486
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:40,195
I can't believe it.

487
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,700
it's only been two weeks.

488
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,954
She can't do this to me.

489
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,793
Have you got a car?

490
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:58,172
No. Where do you want to go?

491
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:01,216
I don't know.

492
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,467
Can you drive?

493
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,846
Yes.

494
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:11,894
Don't tell anyone,
but Nina's got problems with junk.

495
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:15,272
Do you know where she'd go
to score at this time?

496
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,608
No, but it's easy to find out.

497
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,193
Thank you.

498
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,777
Who ever you are...

499
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:25,824
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

500
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:28,202
I can't drive.

501
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,995
Nina does the driving.

502
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:34,458
- Want one?
- No, thank you.

503
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,379
I started smoking
because of Bette Davis.

504
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,381
To imitate her.

505
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,968
At 18, I was smoking
like a chimney.

506
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,095
That's why
I called my self Huma.

507
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,849
Huma's a very pretty name.

508
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,143
Smoke is all there's been
in my life.

509
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,646
You've had success too.

510
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,315
Success has got no taste
or smell.

511
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:02,528
And when you get used to it,
it's as if it didn't exist.

512
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:07,157
God, where has that girl gone?

513
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:40,482
I think that's her!

514
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:45,237
You stay here. I'll go.

515
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,331
He's a son of a bitch.
He rips everybody off.

516
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,876
Yeah, and since I'm not
from here- -

517
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,752
Don't touch me.

518
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,796
Listen, Nina.

519
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,257
Huma's waiting for you.

520
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,467
Who the fuck are you?

521
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,471
She's in the car.

522
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,530
I got everything.

523
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,366
- Fuck, my purse!
- Yeah, I got a purse.

524
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:35,245
Ecstasy, too.

525
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,564
- Who is it?
- it's Rosa.

526
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,316
- Hello.
- How are you?

527
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,236
- Are you alone?
- I just got up.

528
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:08,612
This late?

529
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:12,199
I was out late last night.

530
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,951
- Some breakfast?
- No, thanks.

531
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:17,204
- Aren't you hungry?
- So you're back on the street.

532
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,415
Just when I'd found
another way for you to earn money.

533
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,292
Tell me.
I'm not a whore.

534
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:25,254
I've been fucked around a lot,
but I'm not a whore.

535
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:27,089
Why did you lie to me?

536
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,259
it was Agrado's idea.
The dress was hers too.

537
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,555
So tell me: What's this other way
for me to earn money?

538
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,099
I'm dying of curiosity.

539
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,726
How much would you charge
to rent me a room?

540
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,062
To rent you a room?
Why?

541
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,731
I'm going to leave the center
for a few months.

542
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,401
What about El Salvador?

543
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:49,987
I don't feel well.

544
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:52,197
I can't travel like this.

545
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,494
Why do you want to move in here
if you're ill?

546
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:02,374
I'm pregnant.

547
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,585
Pregnant?

548
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,420
What are you going to do?

549
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,256
Have it, ofcourse.
What do you expect?

550
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,717
I thought it'd be
less of a scandal here.

551
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,886
Can't the father
help you out?

552
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,555
The father!
God knows where he is.

553
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,932
But you know who he is,
don't you?

554
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,768
Of course.
Who do you take me for?

555
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,979
I'm sorry.

556
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:28,442
it was your compatriot Lola.

557
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:35,115
That lousy, fucking bitch!

558
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:39,328
What's come over you?

559
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,914
What's come over me?

560
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,625
How far along are you?

561
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:47,169
Three months, I think.

562
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,795
But I'm very worried.

563
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:52,883
Worried?
I'm not surprised!

564
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,760
I had bleeding this morning.

565
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:58,639
Have you seen a doctor?

566
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,433
I'm going
to the Hospital del Mar tomorrow.

567
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:04,228
I wanted to know
if you'd come with me.

568
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,812
Yes, of course.

569
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:09,358
Thank you.

570
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:12,402
What about the room?

571
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:14,321
I'm sorry.

572
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:18,408
You can't stay here.

573
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:39,263
Good evening.
May I come in?

574
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,598
Hello!
I was expecting you.

575
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,600
I didn't know
where to send your purse.

576
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:45,185
Here it is.

577
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:48,814
Thank you.

578
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,317
is everything there?

579
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,945
Yes, everything.

580
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,822
- Thank you for last night.
- Not at all.

581
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,324
I'd love to talk more,
but I'm short on time.

582
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,577
- Can I help you?
- Could you button this?

583
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,078
Ofcourse.

584
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,665
What was your name?

585
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,667
Would you like
to work for me?

586
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,920
- Doing what?
- Everything.

587
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:15,424
Everything except sleep with me.
I've got enough with Nina.

588
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,594
Well, the truth is
I was looking for a job.

589
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:22,514
I need a personal assistant.
Someone I can trust.

590
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:26,310
- You don't know me.
- What I saw last night was enough.

591
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,270
But Nina hates me.

592
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:31,482
Nina hates everyone,
including herself and me.

593
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,610
Well...

594
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:36,403
when do I start?

595
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:41,325
- Right now, if you can.
- All right.

596
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,535
Ask Nina what she wants
for dinner.

597
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:46,330
- I'll just have an esqueixada.
- Anything else?

598
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:50,167
Could you get a tranquilizer for Nina?
She's real edgy today.

599
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:54,838
- I've got Lexatin.
- Terrific!

600
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:20,030
Don't mention the father.

601
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,491
Why do you dislike Lola so much?

602
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,493
Lola's got the worst of a man...

603
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:27,830
and the worst of a woman.

604
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,999
I'll tell you a story.

605
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,253
I had a friend
who got married very young.

606
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,547
After a year, her husband
went to work in Paris...

607
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:39,591
and he was to call her
when he got settled.

608
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,343
Two years passed.

609
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:45,472
The husband saved some money
and came to Barcelona to open a bar.

610
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,975
She came here to join him.

611
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:51,186
Two years isn't a long time...

612
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,730
but the husband had changed.

613
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:56,150
He didn't love her anymore.

614
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,694
The change was more physical.

615
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,905
He'd gotten a pair of tits
that were bigger than hers.

616
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,576
Oh, I see.

617
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:08,829
My friend was very young.

618
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,165
She was in a foreign land.

619
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:14,751
She had no one.

620
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,838
Apart from the tits,
the husband hadn't changed that much...

621
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,384
so she ended up accepting him.

622
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:27,598
Women will do anything
to avoid being alone.

623
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:31,018
Women are more tolerant,
but that's good.

624
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:33,270
We're assholes...

625
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:36,273
and a bit lesbo.

626
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:38,817
Listen to the end
of the story.

627
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,403
My friend
and her husband with the tits...

628
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:45,449
set up a bar here,
on the Barceloneta.

629
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:49,661
He spent the day in a tiny bikini,
screwing everything he could...

630
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,705
and giving her a hard time
if she wore a bikini...

631
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:54,291
or even a miniskirt.

632
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,043
The bastard!

633
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:02,049
How could someone act so macho
with a pair of tits like that?

634
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:08,722
Sit down.

635
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,308
- Who is the patient?
- She is.

636
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,728
Well?

637
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,730
My sister is pregnant.

638
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:19,983
We reckon she's about
three months along.

639
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:23,111
This is her first checkup.

640
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:26,198
Yesterday and today
I bled a little.

641
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,452
Lie down on the couch,
and strip from the waist down.

642
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:34,164
Don't worry.

643
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:40,462
- Put this on.
- Thank you.

644
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:44,007
According to the ultrasound,
the fetus seems to be fine.

645
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,717
Do you live together?

646
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,177
- No.
- Yes.

647
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,887
Which is it?

648
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,850
She lives with our mother,
but she hasn't told her anything yet.

649
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,685
is your blood pressure
usually high?

650
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:57,938
Yes, I have hypertension.

651
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,608
There's a risk of miscarriage.

652
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,320
You must move
as little as possible.

653
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:07,531
But I've got to do my job.

654
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:13,036
Your only job now is to rest
and not do anything stupid.

655
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,664
Tell your mother
to watch her blood pressure.

656
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:18,959
She has to follow a salt- free diet
and rest.

657
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,086
I'll tell her.

658
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:25,007
Listen, Doctor, I work
with people who are high- risk...

659
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:29,303
so I'd like to have
an AIDS test as well.

660
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,346
What's your job?

661
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,557
She's a social worker.

662
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,893
When can we pickup
the results?

663
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:39,521
in two weeks' time.

664
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:41,857
You have to tell your mother.

665
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:44,443
You need to be looked after.

666
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:47,821
I found a job yesterday,
and I'm going to be busy all day.

667
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,907
Listen.

668
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,493
You've no right
to ask me to be your mother.

669
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:54,578
You've already got one,
even if you don't like her.

670
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,708
We can't choose our parents.
They are who they are.

671
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,086
Oh, God!

672
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:07,716
Please, don't blackmail me!

673
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:15,265
I don't know if I was right
to call the clinic.

674
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:17,768
What else could you do?

675
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,312
I can't believe her
and go on living with Stanley.

676
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,899
Then don't believe her.
What matters is you and your baby.

677
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,692
What if she told me
the truth?

678
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,069
Blanche?

679
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,530
Blanche is in no shape
to tell the truth...

680
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:34,284
even if she wanted to,
poor thing.

681
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,912
Where is my heart?

682
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:39,623
She means her jewel box.
it's heart- shaped.

683
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:44,503
I think it's here somewhere.
Look, here it is.

684
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:49,633
- I need a necklace.
- We'll look for it.

685
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:52,845
What's the gentleman's name?

686
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,721
Huntleigh.

687
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:56,890
Did he call
while I was in the bathroom?

688
00:50:56,932 --> 00:51:01,103
- No.
- How strange!

689
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,358
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?

690
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,904
No, you look better than ever.

691
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:17,452
- I'll look better with this necklace.
- Shall I help you?

692
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,621
So you're going on a trip.

693
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:24,585
You're so lucky.
I'm green with envy..

694
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,712
There he is.

695
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:31,967
That must be the gentleman
who's come for you.

696
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:40,642
"Two weeks later"

697
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:51,820
- Second call. Fifteen minutes.
- Come in.

698
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,947
- Aren't they here yet?
- I don't know where they are.

699
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,993
I was at the TV studio all day.

700
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,620
- Where's Nina?
- Wasn't she with you?

701
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,538
I just left her at home, in bed.

702
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,499
- in bed?
- What's wrong?

703
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,293
I think it's food poisoning.
She was so ill this morning.

704
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:08,795
Why didn't you tell me
when I called?

705
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:10,923
We didn't want to upset you.

706
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,883
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes.

707
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:17,137
She's got gastroenteritis,
but she'll be fine tomorrow.

708
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:18,347
So we cancel the show?

709
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,391
I'd like to speak to Huma,
please.

710
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,310
Yes, wait outside.

711
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:24,603
Five minutes.

712
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:27,773
All right!

713
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:31,318
- Tell me the truth.
- She's bombed. She can't even speak.

714
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,030
She went out after you did.
She didn't know I'd drop by.

715
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:38,408
She thought I'd be with you.

716
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,329
What do we do now?

717
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:47,501
If it won't give you a heart attack,
I could do her part.

718
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:50,754
I know it by heart
from hearing it over the loudspeakers.

719
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,923
But can you act?

720
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,593
I can lie very well,
and I'm used to improvising.

721
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,137
I've seen that.

722
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:02,099
My son said
I was a very good actress.

723
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,353
I didn't even know
you had a son!

724
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:09,481
Third call. Five minutes.

725
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:14,736
Huma, what'll we do?
We can't wait any longer.

726
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,909
Happy birthday, Blanche.

727
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:22,744
This is your present.

728
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:25,956
Thank you, Stanley.
Why did you bother?

729
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,917
I hope you like it.

730
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,460
Why, it's- -

731
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:32,504
A bus ticked.

732
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:35,841
A return ticket for Tuesday.

733
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:38,051
Are you insinuating
I should leave?

734
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:42,055
What do you think?

735
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,105
- Why did you do that to her?
- I'm sick of her insults.

736
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:54,067
I'm tired of you two whispering
behind my back all the time!

737
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,861
Please, don'tgo!

738
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,489
- Let go. You've torn my shirt!
- Brute!

739
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,241
Brute?
I was a brute when we met.

740
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:04,578
But I'd remind you
that it was never a problem for you.

741
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,997
One day you showed me
a picture of your house...

742
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,416
a mansion with lots of columns.

743
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,794
I pulled you down off those columns
and taught you to be happy.

744
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:15,672
We laughed
and were happy together...

745
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:18,884
until your sister Blanche
appeared.

746
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:22,054
What's wrong?

747
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:26,808
Take me to the hospital, please!

748
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:58,465
Congratulations on last night.
I heard you were great.

749
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:02,135
You can't imagine.
What a pity you were n't there.

750
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:05,556
I felt awful.
Agrado called to tell me about it.

751
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:07,850
She must have called
half of Barcelona!

752
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:11,979
Are you doing everything
the doctor told you?

753
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,440
- I just saw him.
- And?

754
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:20,988
- I went for my results.
- I forgot it was today.

755
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:31,915
I'm HIV positive.

756
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:36,461
We'll have the tests redone.

757
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:39,630
Why the hell
did you screw Lola?

758
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,926
Don't you know
she's been shooting up for 15 years?

759
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:48,140
What world do you think
you're living in?

760
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:56,690
I don't know.

761
00:55:56,732 --> 00:56:01,361
Have you spoken
to your mother?

762
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,701
Your colleagues?

763
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:10,996
No.

764
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:37,940
We'll go for your things now,
and you'll move in here.

765
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,777
Thank you.

766
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,372
- Hello.
- Hello, Alex.

767
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,250
You were terrific last night.

768
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,878
Thank you.

769
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:03,674
- Good evening.
- Here's Miss Goody Two- shoes.

770
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,968
- What's up?
- What's up?

771
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,719
You planned it all, you bitch!

772
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,513
Nina, don't be so rude.

773
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:13,100
Just like Eve Harrington.
You learned the part on purpose.

774
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:16,186
it's fucking impossible to learn it
over the loudspeakers.

775
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,105
You think I'm stupid?

776
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:20,774
The loudspeakers helped me
remember it.

777
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:23,152
I've known the part of Stella
for years.

778
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:26,405
- Really? What a coincidence!
- if you only knew.

779
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,823
What did I tell you?

780
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,908
Why were you here
that first night?

781
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,327
Or was that
a coincidence too?

782
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:36,832
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

783
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:42,296
I won't bother you anymore.
I'll get my things and go.

784
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:47,634
Manuela, I think you owe us
an explanation.

785
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:02,149
A Streetcar Named Desire
has marked my life.

786
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:07,446
Twenty years ago, I played Stella
with an amateur group.

787
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:10,908
That's where I met
my husband.

788
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:15,120
He was playing Kowalski.

789
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:20,501
Two months ago,
I saw your version in Madrid.

790
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,589
I went with my son.

791
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:29,426
It was the night
of his birthday.

792
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:31,803
It was pouring rain,
but we waited outside...

793
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:36,892
because he wanted
your autograph, Huma.

794
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,443
It was crazy
to wait in the rain...

795
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:51,824
but it was his birthday,
so I couldn't say no.

796
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:57,412
You two got in a taxi,
and he ran after you.

797
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:03,418
A car coming along the street
ran him down.

798
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,046
He was killed.

799
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,423
That's the explanation.

800
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:13,053
That's the explanation, Huma.

801
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,362
Move, Rosa.
I can't get past.

802
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:32,406
What are you doing here?

803
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,159
Hello. I came to pay you.

804
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,703
You left yesterday
without your money.

805
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:39,288
This is my sister Rosa.

806
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,248
- Hello.
- How are you?

807
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,709
Let me help you.

808
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,711
Let's get the elevator.

809
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:51,466
- Where's Nina?
- I left her with Mario. She says hi.

810
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,347
Leave the bags here.

811
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,434
You go and rest for a while,
Rosa.

812
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:03,061
- I'm not tired.
- Don't argue.

813
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:06,356
Sit down.

814
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:10,694
- Anything to drink?
- No, thank you.

815
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:15,032
She's like a little girl.

816
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,995
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking about your son.

817
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:23,290
I can remember his face
in the rain perfectly...

818
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:26,126
and the notebook
in his hand.

819
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:29,004
I can see him now.

820
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:32,132
I don't want to talk
about my son.

821
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,719
I can't.

822
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:41,558
Apart from apologizing,
Nina and I want you to come back.

823
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,894
Rosa's sick.

824
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,146
She needs someone
to look after her all day.

825
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:49,650
I can't leave her.
I'm sorry.

826
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,903
I don't know what I should do.

827
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:57,950
Why don't you check Nina
into a clinic?

828
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:05,207
if we don't fulfill the contract,
the company will sue me.

829
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,292
Find a replacement...

830
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,795
and finish your run
with the company.

831
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,674
I can't do the play
without Nina.

832
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:19,054
She's hooked on junk,
but I'm hooked on her.

833
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:30,357
- Who was it?
- Agrado.

834
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:33,318
And you let her in?

835
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,195
You should have said
we were busy.

836
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,947
I'm thinking of you.

837
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:40,200
come on, lie down here
and stop moving around.

838
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,994
What exactly
is wrong with you?

839
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,788
An accident.

840
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,415
What kind?

841
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:50,169
Why didn't I think of it before?
Agrado could take my place.

842
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,211
Of course!

843
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,214
The one you didn't want
to let in?

844
01:01:54,256 --> 01:02:00,095
That's something between us,
but she's perfect for you.

845
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:04,016
How old is Agrado?

846
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:07,227
Pretty old.
Between thirty and fifty.

847
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:08,812
is Agrado her real name?

848
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:13,275
No, it's a stage name.
Like Huma.

849
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,152
You know why
I took the name Huma?

850
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,695
Yes.

851
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:19,239
Manuela told me.

852
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,158
What else did she tell you?

853
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,452
Everything.
She told me everything.

854
01:02:23,494 --> 01:02:25,329
About you and Nina...

855
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,414
the junk...

856
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:30,042
and that it will end badly.

857
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,503
Really?
And what else did she say?

858
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,087
I'm very curious.

859
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:38,425
That as an actress,
you're wonderful...

860
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:43,597
but that as a person,
you'r every mixed up.

861
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,976
And what else?

862
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:52,564
That I shouldn't say anything.

863
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,608
What have you got
in the bag?

864
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,860
- Cava and icecream.
- What for?

865
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:59,363
To celebrate your success
last night, bitch.

866
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:03,450
Thank you. Come in.

867
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,455
Oh, what a surprise!

868
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:10,999
Three single girls
in an empty house...

869
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,460
always reminds me of
How To Marry A Millionaire.

870
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:15,921
- How are you, Sister Rosa?
- Huma, this is Agrado.

871
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:17,881
My pleasure. I'm "fans."

872
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,174
How are you?

873
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:22,886
Huma, you're a goddess,
a living legend.

874
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:25,055
Like I said, I'm "fans,"
in the plural...

875
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:28,559
but my Manuela was too much
the other night.

876
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,938
How I bawled
at the evening show!

877
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,023
Shouldn't you be
in El Salvador?

878
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:37,901
Yes, but I'm not going now.
I'm staying here.

879
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:40,404
Agrado, I don't work
for Huma anymore.

880
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:45,033
Before you came, we were saying
that you could take my place.

881
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:46,577
Me play Stella?

882
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:50,080
I see myself more as Blanche.

883
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,958
Replacing me, not Nina,
and much less Huma.

884
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,751
Thank you, Manuela,
but I don't- -

885
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:57,546
Try her for a few days.
She isn't as clueless as she seems.

886
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:02,593
I am, Huma, and worse.
Right now, I don't get this at all.

887
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:05,721
So I'll give you the bottle
to cheer us up a bit.

888
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:06,930
I brought ice cream.

889
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:11,018
come on, let's have a drink
and relax a bit.

890
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:15,147
I'll get the glasses.

891
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:19,485
I'll just have some icecream.
I can't drink alcohol.

892
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:21,195
Well, I'll have a drink.

893
01:04:21,236 --> 01:04:25,449
Hey, what's up with Manuela?
She seems very odd.

894
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:29,369
Success hasn't gone
to her head already, has it?

895
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:33,916
She wants to dump you
on Huma.

896
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,837
I think Prada
is ideal for a nun.

897
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:42,216
My problem is everything suits me,
so I'm very eclectic.

898
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,593
I've had chilblains
since I came to Barcelona.

899
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:46,053
Oh, really?

900
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,388
it's finished.
Should I get more?

901
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,933
I'd lovesome, but no.

902
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:54,102
- Where's the bathroom?
- Straight ahead.

903
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:57,773
Excuse me.

904
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:01,944
Fill me in on what's happening here.
I'm no stranger.

905
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,946
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- No, don't!

906
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,781
She can't keep her mouth shut.

907
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:07,991
I know very well
how to keep it shut.

908
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:11,411
I played along like an English lady
so she wouldn't catch on.

909
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:15,582
I'm a model of discretion,
even when I'm sucking someone's cock.

910
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:17,751
I've sucked a lot of cocks
in public places...

911
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:21,004
and no one's noticed,
except the person involved.

912
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:26,093
it's been ages
since I sucked a cock!

913
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,931
I love the word "cock."

914
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,726
And "prick"!

915
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,186
I have to go.

916
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:37,771
- Are you all right?
- What?

917
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,565
- Are you all right?
- Better than ever.

918
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:42,943
Can you help her
find a taxi?

919
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,737
I nearly forgot.
This is for you.

920
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:47,739
Thank you.

921
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:52,619
- Well, good- bye, girls.
- So long.

922
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:58,000
You have to teach me
how to bark.

923
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:02,296
I think I was a bit rude to Huma.
I said all sorts of things.

924
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,798
Really?
it doesn't matter.

925
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,301
They're very different for sisters,
aren't they?

926
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:10,554
- Are they sisters?
- That's what Manuela said.

927
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:12,556
Well, if she says so.

928
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:16,852
- I think you're all bullshitters.
- You have to get to know us.

929
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,520
Can you drive?

930
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,440
- I used to be a truckdriver.
- Really?

931
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,484
in Paris, before I got my tits.

932
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,403
Then I gave up the truck
and became a whore.

933
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:30,866
- How interesting.
- Very.

934
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,120
A check.

935
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:39,583
- 150,000.
- How generous!

936
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,588
What is it?

937
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,841
Huma's autograph,
for Esteban.

938
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:51,803
Dear Esteban: This is
the autograph I never gave you...

939
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:56,433
and not because
you didn't try..

940
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,938
I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before wine.

941
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:03,857
- You mean me?
- You and your friend, Mr. Mitchell.

942
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:06,944
He came to see me
and repeated the slander you'd told him.

943
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:10,531
- So I threw him out.
- You threw Mitch out?

944
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:13,992
He returned with a box of roses
to beg my forgiveness.

945
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:17,830
"Forgive me, " he said,
but somethings are not forgivable.

946
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:20,499
Cruelty is not forgivable.

947
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:24,169
it is the one unforgivable thing.

948
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:26,922
Well?

949
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,758
- Are you learning the part too?
- Of course not.

950
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,846
- You should, just in case.
- You think so?

951
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:35,305
May I have some privacy?

952
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:38,976
So you can get your fix?
Can't wait till the end?

953
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:42,229
if you know, why ask?

954
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,649
if you don't want me to tell Huma,
do it in the bathroom.

955
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,901
I don't need to see these things.

956
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,236
All right.

957
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:53,490
Keep an eye on the door.

958
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:00,873
I know that when you're young- -
well, you're no child- -

959
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,791
you don't value these things.

960
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:07,254
But you're cute,
nicely proportioned- -

961
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,339
kind of small, but cute.

962
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,924
You've lost weight- -

963
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:12,968
well, it's all the drugs- -

964
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,762
but the important thing is
you've lost weight.

965
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:17,598
You've got talent- -

966
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:19,850
limited talent,
but you've got it.

967
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:22,352
And, above all,
a woman who loves you.

968
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,354
And you trade it all for junk.

969
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:26,940
You think it's worth it?
Well, it isn't.

970
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:29,985
it isn't worth it.

971
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:35,365
I trade it for a bit of peace.
come on, help me.

972
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:44,291
You're getting flat
as a board.

973
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:48,212
Compared to you.

974
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:52,799
What a dirty habit!

975
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:54,968
Haven't you ever thought
of cutting it off?

976
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,762
I'd get no work.

977
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,139
The clients like us pneumatic
and well- hung.

978
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:02,309
Rheumatic?
Guys are so odd.

979
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:04,978
Not rheumatic. Pneumatic.

980
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,481
A pair of tits as hard
as newly inflated tires...

981
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:10,651
and a big dick as well.

982
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,402
Show me your cock.

983
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:14,905
That fix didn't agree with you.

984
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,657
Maybe I'll like it too.

985
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,952
You've got enough problems
as it is.

986
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:23,580
Go, you're on now.
And don't throw upon anybody.

987
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:27,251
The audience loves it.
They think it's because I'm pregnant.

988
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:30,337
You're not pregnant in this scene.
You've had a doll.

989
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:34,174
That's right.

990
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,973
Will you show me
your cock later?

991
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:44,601
I'll show it to you
and you can lick it.

992
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:49,273
Young people will try anything!

993
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:55,529
"Months later"

994
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,294
I'm going to call him Esteban.

995
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:12,796
Your son?

996
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:14,673
Why?

997
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,551
After yours.

998
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:21,096
This baby will belong
to both of us.

999
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,557
if only he did.

1000
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,226
if only we were alone
in the world...

1001
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:30,272
without any commitments.

1002
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:34,318
You and your son,
just for me.

1003
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,113
But you have a family.

1004
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:41,366
I'm going to fix your hair
and make you up a bit.

1005
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:44,536
- Why?
- I like to see you look nice.

1006
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,997
And I called your mother.

1007
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,041
She's coming
to see you today.

1008
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,542
My mother?

1009
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:55,547
You have a mother.
Don't you remember?

1010
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:58,175
What will I tell her?

1011
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:02,971
That you love her- -
I don't know.

1012
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:07,351
Come in, Huma.

1013
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:09,645
No, it isn't Huma.
May I come in?

1014
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:12,981
Of course, Mario.
Come in.

1015
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:17,194
- You're very early today.
- Yes.

1016
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:20,989
- What are you doing?
- Just a bit of ironing.

1017
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:22,991
is anything wrong?

1018
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,828
I didn't sleep very well
last night.

1019
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:28,914
I've been on edge all day.

1020
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:32,292
Would you give me
a blowjob?

1021
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:35,838
Can't you all get it into your heads
that I'm retired?

1022
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,090
I don't want you to think that...

1023
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,259
but since I've been
on edge all day...

1024
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,761
I think a blowjob
would relax me.

1025
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,889
You give me one.
I'm on edge too.

1026
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:49,184
Well, it would be the first time
I've sucked a woman's cock...

1027
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,228
but if that's what it takes- -

1028
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,480
The whole company
is obsessed with my cock!

1029
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:56,441
it isn't the only one around.
Don't you have a cock?

1030
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:57,484
Yes.

1031
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:01,905
Do people ask you to suck their cocks
because you've got one?

1032
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:02,990
- Do they?
- No.

1033
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,784
Well, then?

1034
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,662
Look, I'll suck you off
to show you how open- minded...

1035
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:11,915
and how sensitive
I am about these things.

1036
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:13,959
Where's the fucking phone?

1037
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,421
Hello?

1038
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:29,641
All right, don't worry.
I'll see to everything.

1039
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:32,269
Shall we goto my room?
in case Huma comes- -

1040
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:35,522
Huma can't come.
She's in the hospital, along with Nina.

1041
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:39,651
- What's happened?
- They nearly killed each other.

1042
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:43,071
Fuck!

1043
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:45,491
Here.

1044
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:47,284
We'll have to cancel
the performance.

1045
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,411
- Don't say anything.
- We have to say something.

1046
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:51,497
Yes, but it doesn't have
to be the truth.

1047
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:55,334
- I'll make something up.
- Right.

1048
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,754
And- -

1049
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:03,717
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello.

1050
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:07,304
Come in.

1051
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:15,270
- Where is she?
- There, in the bedroom.

1052
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:38,418
And here I was so worried,
thinking you were in El Salvador.

1053
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,754
I see you've learned to lie.

1054
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:43,090
I didn't know
how to tell you.

1055
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:45,175
What are you going to do now?

1056
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,427
Leave the order?
Get married?

1057
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,347
Mom, the things you ask!

1058
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,724
One never knows with you.

1059
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:55,477
At least, I don't.

1060
01:13:55,519 --> 01:14:00,983
Even this I had to learn about
through your friend.

1061
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:04,236
What would I have done
without her?

1062
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:05,445
How is Dad?

1063
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,157
Same as ever.
I don't know.

1064
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:11,076
Worse.

1065
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:15,956
if you don't mind,
I'd rather not tell him anything.

1066
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:20,294
He wouldn't get it anyway.

1067
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:24,423
- And Sapic?
- Fine.

1068
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:32,264
Rosa, I don't know
what to do.

1069
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:35,893
What do you expect me
to do?

1070
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:39,188
Nothing, Mom.

1071
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:43,567
You don't expect
anything from me?

1072
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,320
it isn't that.

1073
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:51,617
What I mean is
don't make it harder for me.

1074
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:06,423
Would you like anything?
I'm making tea.

1075
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:07,925
No, thank you.

1076
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:11,845
What exactly is wrong?
I didn't understand over the phone.

1077
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,848
According to the ultrasound,
she's got placenta previa.

1078
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:18,268
When the time comes,
she'll need a caesarian.

1079
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,604
in the meantime,
she must have complete rest.

1080
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,481
Do you think
I should take her home?

1081
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:26,109
I have to look after her father
as if he were a child.

1082
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:29,071
You're her mother...

1083
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,782
but I think
Rosa's better- off here.

1084
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:34,660
That's the impression
she gave me.

1085
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:36,829
if you need money,
just ask me.

1086
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:40,499
- And, please, keep me informed.
- Yes. Don't worry.

1087
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,917
Thank you very much.

1088
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:46,713
- I'll see you out.
- No, really.

1089
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,718
I don't know
what I did wrong with Rosa.

1090
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,264
Ever since she was born,
she's been like an alien.

1091
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:57,432
Do you have children?

1092
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:59,309
Yes, one.

1093
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:03,063
Do you get along well
with him?

1094
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:06,567
He died.

1095
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:10,362
I'm sorry.

1096
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:32,509
Due to reasons
beyond their control...

1097
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:36,638
two of the actresses
who triumph daily on this stage...

1098
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,975
cannot be here tonight- -
the poor things.

1099
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:43,437
So the show
has been cancelled.

1100
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,231
Those who wish
can get their money back...

1101
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:48,901
but for those who have
nothing better to do...

1102
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:52,404
it's a shame to waste the rare occasion
that you make it to the theater.

1103
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:53,906
if you stay...

1104
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:59,203
I promise to entertain you
with my life story.

1105
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:01,788
Good- bye. I'm very sorry.

1106
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:06,043
if I bore you, you can pretend
to snore- - like this.

1107
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:09,630
I'll get the idea, and you certainly
won't hurt my feelings.

1108
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:13,258
Honestly.

1109
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,344
They call me "La Agrado"...

1110
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:21,141
because I've always tried
to make people's lives agreeable.

1111
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:25,729
As well as being agreeable,
I'm very authentic!

1112
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,857
Look at this body!

1113
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:31,610
All made to measure.

1114
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:36,156
Almond- shaped eyes- - 80,000.

1115
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:37,991
Nose- - 200,000.

1116
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:41,662
A waste of money. Another beating
the following year left it like this.

1117
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:44,414
it gives me character,
but if I'd known...

1118
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:46,458
I wouldn't have touched it.

1119
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,626
I'll continue.

1120
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:51,296
Tits- - two,
because I'm no monster.

1121
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:55,634
70,000 each,
but I've more than earned that back.

1122
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:56,927
Silicone in- -

1123
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:58,220
Where?

1124
01:17:58,262 --> 01:18:00,639
Lips, forehead, cheeks...

1125
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:02,224
hips and ass.

1126
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,976
A pint costs about 100,000...

1127
01:18:04,017 --> 01:18:06,687
so you work it out,
because I've lost count.

1128
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,897
Jaw reduction- - 75,000.

1129
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,566
Complete laser depilation...

1130
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:13,110
because women, like men,
also come from apes.

1131
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:14,862
60,000 a session.

1132
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:19,158
it depends how hairy you are.
Usually, two to four sessions.

1133
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:24,663
But if you're a flamenco diva,
you'll need more.

1134
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:28,542
Well, as I was saying...

1135
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,961
it costs a lot
to be authentic, ma'am.

1136
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:33,172
And one can't be stingy
with these things...

1137
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:35,674
because you are more authentic...

1138
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:41,305
the more you resemble
what you've dreamed of being.

1139
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:53,232
I'll turn you around.

1140
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:56,069
- Please, be careful.
- Don't worry.

1141
01:18:56,111 --> 01:19:00,324
We'll lift up a bit.
That's it.

1142
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,367
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1143
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:05,036
if you can push it over here- -

1144
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:07,664
- I'll putt his away.
- Thank you.

1145
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:11,919
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

1146
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:18,383
To the Hospital del Mar,
please.

1147
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,136
Can we go
through Medinaceli Square?

1148
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:25,224
Aren't we meeting your mother
at the hospital?

1149
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:30,354
- I just want to see the square.
- All right.

1150
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:39,446
Stop here!

1151
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:43,867
I played here as a child.

1152
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,875
Sapic!

1153
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:06,348
Come here, boy?

1154
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:12,604
Hello, Sapic.

1155
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:15,983
That dog would go
with anybody.

1156
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:18,360
Do you have a dog?

1157
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:21,029
No, but I really like them.

1158
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:25,701
- How old are you?
- Twenty- six.

1159
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:31,165
- And how tall are you?
- Not very. Five six.

1160
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,044
come on.

1161
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:38,046
Go on.
Go back to Dad.

1162
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,965
come on.

1163
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:43,844
Good-bye, Dad.

1164
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:52,644
- You aren't in any pain?
- No.

1165
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:57,566
That's great.
Painless child birth.

1166
01:20:57,608 --> 01:21:00,194
When is she going
into surgery?

1167
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:03,947
in an hour and a half.

1168
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:08,285
I've got time to go check
on your father and come back.

1169
01:21:08,327 --> 01:21:11,163
You don't have
to come back, Mom.

1170
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:15,626
I want to be here
with you.

1171
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,212
Give Dad a kiss for me.

1172
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:22,466
I'm keeping this one.

1173
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:31,433
So long.

1174
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:35,062
Good- bye.

1175
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,942
I hope the third Esteban
is the definitive one for you.

1176
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:42,319
The third Esteban?

1177
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:44,571
Lola was the first...

1178
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,281
and your son, the second.

1179
01:21:46,323 --> 01:21:49,368
So you knew Lola
was the father of my son too.

1180
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:51,286
Of course.

1181
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:53,622
it didn't take a genius.

1182
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,083
Lola doesn't know
we had a son.

1183
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:58,961
I never told him.

1184
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:01,547
Did your son know?

1185
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:05,384
No, he didn't.

1186
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:08,679
Let's not talk about sad things.
This is a great day.

1187
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:14,810
They've put Videla in jail,
and your son's going to be born.

1188
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:18,981
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

1189
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:22,359
- if anything happens- -
- What could happen?

1190
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,403
Promise you won't hide anything
from the child.

1191
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:28,574
I don't have to.You can tell him
whatever you want yourself.

1192
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:31,451
Promise me.

1193
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:35,747
if it makes you happier.

1194
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,416
All right.

1195
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:41,086
I promise.

1196
01:22:57,603 --> 01:23:03,108
We are here today
to say good- bye to our sister Rosa.

1197
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:36,350
Manuela, I'm so happy
to see you.

1198
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:38,811
What a pity
it has to be here.

1199
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:41,939
it couldn't be
anywhere else.

1200
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:46,777
You aren't a human being, Lola.
You're an epidemic!

1201
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:49,446
I was always excessive.

1202
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:52,407
And I'm very tired.

1203
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:56,203
Manuela, I'm dying.

1204
01:23:56,245 --> 01:23:59,623
Come.

1205
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:02,376
I'm saying good-bye
to everything.

1206
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:06,588
I robbed Agrado
to pay my ticket to Argentina.

1207
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,800
I wanted to take a last look
at the town...

1208
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,426
the river...

1209
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:14,263
our street.

1210
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:18,809
And I'm happy
I can say good-bye to you too.

1211
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:23,105
Now I just have to see
Sister Rosa's child.

1212
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:26,567
My son.

1213
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,488
I always dreamed of having a son.
You know that.

1214
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:34,533
When I left Barcelona,
I was carrying your child.

1215
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:37,327
What?

1216
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:40,372
You mean you too-

1217
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:43,083
Did you have it?

1218
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,835
A beautiful boy.

1219
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:47,629
I want to see him.
Did you bring him with you?

1220
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:50,966
He is in Madrid,
but you can't see him.

1221
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:55,929
Even from a distance.
I promise he won't see me.

1222
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:58,724
it's the last thing
I ask of you.

1223
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:01,643
You can't see him.

1224
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:05,230
Please!

1225
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:13,071
Six months ago,
he was run over by a car.

1226
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:17,409
He is dead.

1227
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:29,129
I only came to Barcelona
to tell you.

1228
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:32,800
I'm sorry.

1229
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,078
The baby!

1230
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:03,163
Where have you been?

1231
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:05,040
Haven't you taken
Sapic out yet?

1232
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:09,920
- You weren't here.
- I'm here now.

1233
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:14,758
He is hungry.

1234
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,970
- The bottle is heating.
- Will you get it, please?

1235
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,180
Come here.

1236
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:22,808
Vicenta, don't let my husband
come in here, please.

1237
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,227
He is convinced
the baby is yours.

1238
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:28,730
Yes, I know.

1239
01:26:28,772 --> 01:26:30,858
He is very jealous.

1240
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,110
I told him
the baby was yours.

1241
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:34,903
I don't dare
tell him the truth.

1242
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:37,406
He wouldn't understand
anyway.

1243
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:41,493
if only he were mine.

1244
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:43,662
What is it?

1245
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,414
Who is that woman?

1246
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:47,791
it's Manuela,
the new cook.

1247
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,460
She's been with us
four days.

1248
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,922
We've fixed up this room
so she can be here with her child.

1249
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:56,842
Remember?
I told you.

1250
01:26:56,884 --> 01:27:00,179
- How old are you?
- Thirty-eight.

1251
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:04,308
- How tall are you?
- Five seven.

1252
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:05,642
All right.

1253
01:27:05,684 --> 01:27:09,980
Now you can go
for a walk.

1254
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:12,941
Go on.

1255
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:14,526
There you are.

1256
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:19,198
- The bottle, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1257
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:21,200
Thank you.

1258
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:25,871
No, no.
We're going to eat now.

1259
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:28,749
Yes?

1260
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:33,795
Don't tell anyone
about the antibodies.

1261
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:40,135
Do the nuns know?

1262
01:27:40,594 --> 01:27:44,223
All right.

1263
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:54,650
"One month later"

1264
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:20,342
Hello, Lola.

1265
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:24,346
Take him.

1266
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:33,814
What did the doctor say.

1267
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:38,902
He's fine.
You can see- - he's normal.

1268
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:42,823
You're with Dad.

1269
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:47,744
- Can I give him a kiss?
- Of course.

1270
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:54,710
My son, I'm sorry to leave you
such an awful inheritance.

1271
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,170
Don't say that.

1272
01:28:56,211 --> 01:29:01,842
There's no reason why
he should develop the disease.

1273
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,691
This is our Esteban.

1274
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:23,197
You called him Esteban too?

1275
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:28,452
Thank you.

1276
01:29:31,997 --> 01:29:34,500
He wanted to be a writer.

1277
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:39,379
This is his notebook.
He took it with him everywhere.

1278
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:44,218
He wrote this
the morning of the day he died.

1279
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:46,762
Read it.

1280
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:50,224
"Last night
Mom showed me a picture.

1281
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:53,268
Half of it was missing.

1282
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:59,608
I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half."

1283
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:04,279
Keep reading.

1284
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:08,826
"This morning
I looked through her drawers...

1285
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:12,579
and found
a bundle of pictures.

1286
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:15,791
They were all missing
a half.

1287
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:20,003
My father, I suppose.

1288
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:23,298
I want to meet him.

1289
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,718
I have to make Mom understand
that I don't care who he is...

1290
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,470
or what he's like...

1291
01:30:28,512 --> 01:30:32,141
or how he behaved towards her.

1292
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:36,687
She can't deny me
that right."

1293
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:44,528
Keep the picture.

1294
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:49,616
Thank you.

1295
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,549
I don't like just anyone
kissing the baby.

1296
01:31:05,591 --> 01:31:08,010
Who was that woman
in the bar with you?

1297
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:10,679
That woman is his father.

1298
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:12,514
What did you say.

1299
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:15,851
That was his father,
and he's very ill.

1300
01:31:15,893 --> 01:31:21,315
That monster is the one
who killed my daughter?

1301
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:25,819
Don't think about that,
Rosa.

1302
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:39,625
There are people who think
children are made in a day.

1303
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:44,254
But it takes a long time- -
a very long time.

1304
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:49,968
That's why it's so awful to see
your child's blood on the ground.

1305
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:55,724
A stream that flows for a minute
and yet costs us years.

1306
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:03,190
When I found my son...

1307
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:08,278
he was lying
in the middle of the street.

1308
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:21,250
I soaked my hands in his blood
and licked them.

1309
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:25,379
Because it was mine.

1310
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:30,884
Animals lick their young,
don't they?

1311
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:35,347
I'm not disgusted
by my son.

1312
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:40,144
You don't know
what it's like.

1313
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:45,065
in a monstrance
of glass and topaz...

1314
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:50,320
I would put
the earth soaked by his blood.

1315
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:57,744
Keep kneading.

1316
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:00,539
The sadness should go
into your hands.

1317
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:04,751
Work. You have to work.

1318
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:08,130
- You don't notice my cold?
- No, it's fine.

1319
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:12,676
come on.
You shouldn't be in here.

1320
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:13,969
Hello.

1321
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:16,054
I've got a bouquet
for Agrado and Huma Rojo.

1322
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:18,765
- Really?
- Yes. Sign here, please.

1323
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:23,687
- You sure it's for Agrado?
- Yes, it says so.

1324
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:24,730
Here.

1325
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:27,733
Know why they call me
Agrado?

1326
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:30,986
I've always tried
to make life agreeable for others.

1327
01:33:31,028 --> 01:33:34,448
Right.

1328
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:39,578
"Dear Agradoand Huma:

1329
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:41,830
Running away once again
with no good-byes...

1330
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:44,333
though I know how much
you like them, Agrado."

1331
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:47,628
The situation with Rosa's parents
is unbearable.

1332
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:50,631
The grandmother is afraid
a scratch will infect her.

1333
01:33:50,672 --> 01:33:54,927
I'm taking Esteban where he won't be
surrounded by hostility.

1334
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:58,430
Agrado, you know.
how much I love you.

1335
01:33:58,472 --> 01:34:00,808
Take good care
of yourself and of Huma.

1336
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:02,810
I'm sorry to miss
the opening...

1337
01:34:02,851 --> 01:34:05,979
but I'm sure the homage to Lorca
will be a great success.

1338
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,397
I'll write to you...

1339
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:10,484
but it's better
you don't know anymore.

1340
01:34:10,526 --> 01:34:12,820
Oh, and tear up the letter.

1341
01:34:12,861 --> 01:34:14,530
Your Manuela."

1342
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:18,408
"Two years later"

1343
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:24,414
I'm coming back to Barcelona
after two years...

1344
01:34:24,456 --> 01:34:26,291
but this time
I'm not running away.

1345
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:30,295
I'm going to an AIDS conference
organized by Can Ruti.

1346
01:34:30,337 --> 01:34:34,299
My Esteban has neutralized
the virus in record time...

1347
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:36,260
and they want to study
his case.

1348
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:39,972
I'm so happy.

1349
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:43,851
Mayi?

1350
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:49,690
Hey, she's mine too!

1351
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:52,484
You look beautiful!
Your hair's gotten so long.

1352
01:34:52,526 --> 01:34:55,654
- And so has yours.
- No, this is a wig for the play.

1353
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:58,282
Wait, your earring is loose.
I'll fix it.

1354
01:34:58,323 --> 01:34:59,658
Learn, you animal!

1355
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,536
An animal, but who
takes care of you like I do?

1356
01:35:02,578 --> 01:35:04,705
it's great about your son!

1357
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:07,457
So he's neutralized the virus
practically overnight.

1358
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:10,919
Yes. Esteban's case
proves the virus can disappear.

1359
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:14,798
They're still trying to find out why,
but it's a miracle.

1360
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,385
I knew it.
How I prayed for that child.

1361
01:35:18,427 --> 01:35:21,180
Why not stay with us
while you're in Barcelona?

1362
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:22,222
Of course.

1363
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:24,141
We're staying
with his grandparents.

1364
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:26,226
Rosa's mother
is looking forward to it.

1365
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:28,562
She's changed so much.

1366
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:33,817
- Third call, five minutes.
- I have to go.

1367
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:36,320
You've got Esteban's picture.

1368
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:38,739
Lola gave it to me
before she died.

1369
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:41,700
I was keeping it
until you came back.

1370
01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:44,286
Keep it.

1371
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:47,915
Thank you.

1372
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:51,210
And Nina?

1373
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:54,421
I have to go.

1374
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:57,299
Nina got married.
She's back in her home town.

1375
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:00,052
She's got a baby too.
it's fat and horrible.

1376
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:04,181
Really, really ugly.

1377
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:09,978
I'll see you later.

1378
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:13,315
"To Bette Davis,
Gena Rowlands, Romy Schneider...

1379
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:15,275
To all actresses
who have played actresses...

1380
01:36:15,317 --> 01:36:16,985
To all women who act...

1381
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:19,029
to men who act
and become women...

1382
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:20,948
To all the people
who want to be mothers.

1383
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:23,283
To my mother."
