On the 5th of September 1934...

5
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:30,512
20 years after the outbreak
of the World War...

6
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:40,530
16 years after the beginning
of Germany's suffering...

7

19 months after the beginning
of the German Rebirth...

8
00:02:53,545 --> 00:03:00,542

General Field Marshal

who has passed into Eternity.

30
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:29,406
The General Field Marshal is remembered
as the first soldier of the Great War.

31
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:35,512
And thoughts as well
to our fallen comrades.

32
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:44,027
I greet the high representatives
of foreign states...

33
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:48,966
who by their presence are participating
in this day for their political parties.

34
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:55,397
In sincere friendship the greeting
of the Movement is extended...

especially to the representatives
of the Armed Forces here,
now under the orders of the Führer!

36
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:12,157
My Leader:

37
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:20,098
Around you stand the flags and standards
of <i>this</i> National Socialism.

38
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,159
Only when they are threadbare...

39
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:27,934
will the people
be able to understand...

40
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:33,913
by hindsight,
the greatness of our time...

41
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,576
because of what you, my Leader,
mean to Germany!

42
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:55,801
You are Germany!

43
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,202
When <i>you</i> act, the <i>Nation</i> acts.

44
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:03,265
When <i>you</i> judge, the <i>People</i> judge.

45
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:23,287
Our thanks is the vow
to stand with you...

46
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:27,561

<i>Reich Minister Dr. Paul Josef Goebbels</i>

49
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:52,988
Thanks to your leadership, Germany
will be attainable as the homeland.

50
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:01,024
Homeland for all Germans in the world.

51
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:12,444
To us you were the guarantor of victory.

52

To us you <i>are</i> the guarantor of peace!

<i>Hail Victory.! Hail Victory.!</i>

55
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:42,638
From the proclamation of the Führer
read by Wagner

56
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:45,872
<i>Adolf Wagner, Gauleiter of Munich-Upper</i>
<i>Bavaria Adolf Bavarian Interior Minister</i>
<i>& SA-</i>Obergruppenführer

57
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:49,745
No revolution
that seems to be permanent...

58
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:53,809
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.

59
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,323
So the World will <i>not</i> live at war.

60
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,656
So also the people
do not live on revolution.

61
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:09,324
Nothing on this earth that has lasted
for thousands of years...

62
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:14,339
was assembled in mere decades.

63
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:20,835
The largest tree also has
the longest period of growth.

64
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:24,179
What braves the centuries...

65
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,084

through the centuries.

<i>and later Reich Minister</i>
<i>for annexed Eastern Territories</i>

It is our unshakeable belief
in ourselves...

68
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:42,701
that is our hope for the youth...

69
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:50,869
to carry on the work which has been put
before them in the stormy years...

70

of the revolt of 1918 in Munich...

71
00:29:56,449 --> 00:30:02,945

<i>of People Enlightenment and Propaganda</i>

Truth is the foundation...

74
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,057
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.

75
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:18,228
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...

76
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:24,300
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.

As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn
has begun at 51 locations.

79
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:38,484
Although this work
is in its early stage...

today there are already
52,000 men on the job...

<i>(DAF-</i> Deutsche Arbeitsfront)

95

All our work must be dictated
by a single thought...

96
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:54,833
that the German worker...

97
00:31:54,901 --> 00:32:01,238
be made an upright, proud

As the Leader
of the German legal service...

100
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:14,512
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...

101
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:17,522
is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.

102

And <i>for us our highest leader</i>
<i>is also the highest judge.!</i>

We know how sacred the principles

to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.

111
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:12,744
This comes
from the depths of the People...

112
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:17,078
and from these depths of the people...

113
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,248
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.

It may be good to possess power
based on strength...

00:36:09,748 --> 00:36:14,447
We work in the swamp.

155
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,717
And in the sand.

156
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,727
We dam the North Sea.

157
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:28,323
We plant trees.

158
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:30,801
We build roads...

159
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:36,865
from town to town,
and city to city.

160
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,877
We provide the farmer
with new soil...

161
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:47,283
forests and fields,
land and bread...

162
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,411
<i>for Germany.</i>

163
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:37,394
We didn't stand in the trenches.

164
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:40,734
Nor were we
under the shell fire of grenades...

165
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:44,537
and <i>still</i> we are soldiers.

166
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:46,440
Sharpen the hammers...

167
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,878
<i>axes, pick axes</i>
<i>and spades.!</i>

168
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:53,884
<i>We are the Reich's young manhood.!</i>

169
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:57,615
As once at Langemarck...

170
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:02,925
at Tannenberg...

171
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:07,291
before Lüttich (Liege)...

172
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,459
before Verdun...

173
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:15,872
on the Somme...

174
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:19,069
on the Ähne...

175
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:23,007
in Flanders...

176
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,011
in the West...

177
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,052
in the <i>East...</i>

178
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,281
in the <i>South...</i>

179
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:36,988
on land, on water,
and in the clouds.

180
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:46,027
Comrades, who were shot
by the Red Front and Reactionaries...

181
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:52,938
<i>You are not dead.!</i>

182
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:58,415
<i>You live in Germany.!</i>

183
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,525
My Labor Service Men.

184
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:15,590
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...

185
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:22,368
before me
and before the German people.

186
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:26,935
You represent a great idea...

187
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:32,473
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...

188
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:37,648
physical labor will not longer
be a divisive concept.

189
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,385
But it will instead bind us together
and, furthermore...

190
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:46,989
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...

191
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:51,297
that physical labor will be seen
as anything less...

192
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:55,328
than any other work.

193
00:39:55,407 --> 00:40:00,344
The whole nation passes
through your school.

194
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:04,508
The time will come
when no German...

195
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:10,180
can be admitted
into the community of the people...

196
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:15,522
until he has first become a member
of <i>your</i> group.

197
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:19,587
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...

198
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:23,361
by the thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...

199
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:28,262
which also sees you here
for the first time today.

200
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:38,038
And I know that just as you serve
this Germany proudly...

201
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:45,318
all of Germany today will see its sons
marching in you with proud joy!

205
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:28,210
Many of you here tonight knew me...

206
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:34,246
as an SA man...

207
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:38,318
marching in the rank and file...

208
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:42,264
in the first years of the Movement.

209
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:48,294
And Party Comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...

210
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:52,035
so I am still an SA man today!

211
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:07,947
We SA workers will always be true
only to the Führer...

212
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:11,392
and fight for the Führer.

We live again for this hour
which makes us proud and happy.

224
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:17,354
According to your command, my Leader,
a youth stands here...

225
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:23,422
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.

226
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:30,337
The young generation of our people
follows after you.

227
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:38,074
Just as you demonstrate the highest
self-sacrifice in this Nation...

228
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:42,413
so does this youth wish to be selfless.

229
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:46,854
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...

230
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:52,793
therefore we wish to be faithful.

231
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:58,095
Adolf Hitler,
the Leader of German Youth, attention!

232
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,953
My German youth.

233
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:27,587
After one year
I can greet you again here.

234
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:34,000
You standing here today
represent something...

235
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:40,270
that is happening all over Germany.

236
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:46,509
And we want that you,
German boys and girls...

237
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:55,380
will absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.

238
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:58,791
We want to be one people...

239
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:05,460
and through you,
to become this people.

240
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:09,470
We want a society with
neither castes nor ranks.

241
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:15,135
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.

242
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:19,375
We want to see <i>one Reich.!</i>

243
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:23,680
And you must educate yourselves
for this.

244
00:50:23,753 --> 00:50:28,019
We want this people to be obedient...

245
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,491
and you must practice obedience
in yourselves.

246
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,826
We want this people
to be <i>peace-loving...</i>

247
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:38,162
but at the same time <i>to be courageous.</i>

248
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:41,226
And you must, for that reason,
be both <i>peace-loving...</i>

249
00:50:59,922 --> 00:51:07,419
You must be both <i>peace-loving</i>
and strong.

250
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:23,212
We want this people
not to become soft...

251
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:26,737
but to become hard and, therefore...

252
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:32,311
you must steel yourselves for this
in your youth.

253
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:36,848
You must learn sacrifice...

254
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:43,331
and also never to collapse.

255
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:46,800
Whatever we create today...

256
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:50,066
whatever we do...

257
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:52,573
will all pass away...

258
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,872
but in you Germany will live on.

259
00:51:55,945 --> 00:52:00,075
And when we can no longer hold...

260
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:05,177
the flag <i>that we tore from nothing...</i>

261
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:08,451
you must hold it firmly in your fists!

262
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:26,003
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...

263
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:28,703
as we bind ourselves together.

264
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:35,445
For you are <i>flesh of our flesh</i>
<i>and blood from our blood.!</i>

265
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,816
The same spirit that governs us...

266
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:41,015
burns in your young minds.

267
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:54,402
And when the great columns
of the movement...

268
00:52:54,470 --> 00:53:00,807
sweep through Germany today...

269
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:07,372
then I know that you will close ranks...

270
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:17,150
and we know <i>that Germany</i>
<i>lies in front of us...</i>

271
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:19,660
<i>Germany marches within us...</i>

272
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:23,061

279
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:57,713
Ayear ago...

280
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:03,755
we met for the first time
on this field:

281
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:11,128
the first general review
of political leaders...

282
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:15,134
of the National Socialist Party.

283
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:19,502
200,000 men have assembled here.

284
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:27,002
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...

285
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:31,575
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.

286
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:49,701
It was the great calamity of our people
that drove us to the struggle...

287
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:57,040
brought us together...

288
00:59:57,111 --> 00:59:59,375
and left us greater.

289
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:03,041
Those who do not understand...

290
01:00:03,117 --> 01:00:07,952
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.

291
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:20,563
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...

292
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:25,901
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...

293
01:00:25,973 --> 01:00:31,070
amidst calamity and passion.

294
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:34,581
Others cannot understand...

295
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:39,142
that this is not
an order of the <i>State.!</i>

296
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,416
<i>They are deceiving themselves.!</i>

297
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:46,585
<i>The State does not order us.!</i>

298
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,151
<i>We order the State.!</i>

299
01:00:59,106 --> 01:01:03,770
<i>The State did not create us.!</i>

300
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:07,405
<i>Rather we created our own State.!</i>

301
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:16,451
No, the movement lives...

302
01:01:16,523 --> 01:01:22,325
and it is grounded hard and fast.

303
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:28,926
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...

304
01:01:29,002 --> 01:01:34,065
he will give his strengths
to the movement...

305
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:41,047
just as it was in yesteryear.

306
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,641
Then drum will join drum...

307
01:01:44,718 --> 01:01:46,811
flag will join flag...

308
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:51,984
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...

309
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:56,826
and after that,
this earlier divided people...

310
01:01:56,897 --> 01:02:02,199
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.

311
01:02:11,078 --> 01:02:17,347
It would be an outrage
if we were to lose...

312
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:22,184
what we have fought for...

313
01:02:22,256 --> 01:02:25,692
with so much labor,
so much worry...

314
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:29,422
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.

315
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:51,214
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...

316
01:02:51,285 --> 01:02:56,723
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.

317
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,727
That would not be so...

318
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:08,428
if it were not a cardinal command.

319
01:03:08,502 --> 01:03:13,633
And no earthly power
gave us that command.

320
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:20,470
<i>For the God, our God, who created</i>
<i>our people, gave us that command.!</i>

321
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:31,454
So it is our vow this evening...

322
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,925
that <i>each hour, on every day...</i>

323
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:42,094
to think <i>only of Germany</i>
<i>of the People and Reich...</i>

324
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:46,435
<i>and of our German nation.!</i>

325
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:49,839
<i>To the German people.!</i>
<i>Hail Victory.! Hail Victory.!</i>

<i>Feldmarshall Paul von Hindenburg</i>

01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:23,146

<i>Viktor Lutze, Storm Troopers (SA)</i>
<i>Chief of Staff</i>

331
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:15,970
My Führer (My Leader):

332
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:22,817
Just as we have always done our duty
to you in the past...

333
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:29,316
so too in the future,
we await your orders alone.

334
01:11:29,395 --> 01:11:34,162
And <i>we,</i> Comrades, know only to obey...

335
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:40,263
the orders of our Führer...

336
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:45,743
and to prove that we have remained
true to the Führer.

337
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:50,077
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler:

338
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:53,277
<i>Hail Victory.! Hail Victory.!</i>

339
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:04,360
SA and SS men:

340
01:12:07,433 --> 01:12:11,494
A few months ago...

341
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:17,099
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.

342
01:12:17,176 --> 01:12:22,614
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...

343
01:12:22,682 --> 01:12:29,110
had nothing whatsoever to do
with this shadow.

344
01:12:31,424 --> 01:12:38,694
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...

345
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:43,531
deceive themselves.

346
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:49,404
<i>It stands fast as this block here...</i>

347
01:12:49,475 --> 01:12:57,246
and nothing in Germany
will break it.

348
01:12:57,316 --> 01:13:04,085
And when anyone does harm
to the spirit of <i>my</i> SA...

349
01:13:04,156 --> 01:13:08,092
then the SA will not be harmed...

350
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,027
but those who do this harm...

351
01:13:11,097 --> 01:13:15,500
will injure only themselves!

352
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:31,609
And only a fool
or a known liar...

353
01:13:31,684 --> 01:13:36,781
could think...

354
01:13:36,856 --> 01:13:42,317
that I would ever
disband an organization...

355
01:13:42,394 --> 01:13:46,490
that took us so many years to build.

356
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:48,465
My Comrades...

357
01:13:48,534 --> 01:13:55,133
we stand fast together
for our Germany...

358
01:13:55,207 --> 01:14:00,543
and we <i>must</i> stand fast together
for <i>this</i> Germany.

359
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:05,476
And I hand to each of you
the new insignia...

360
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:09,009
placing them with confidence...

361
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:14,492
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.

362
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:22,990
For in the past you have proven
your loyalty to me a thousand times.

363
01:14:23,068 --> 01:14:30,236
In the time to come, it <i>cannot</i>
and <i>will not</i> be any different.

364
01:14:40,419 --> 01:14:48,690
And so I greet you as <i>my old,</i>
<i>faithful SA and SS men.!</i>

01:39:18,736 --> 01:39:25,005
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to and end.

421
01:39:25,076 --> 01:39:31,504
What appeared
like a show of political strength...

422
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:38,682
for millions of Germans
outside of our ranks.

423
01:39:38,756 --> 01:39:42,055
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...

424
01:39:42,126 --> 01:39:45,357
it was ultimately more.

425
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:49,264
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...

426
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:53,703
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.

427
01:39:53,771 --> 01:39:56,296
And, perhaps, a cross section of you...

428
01:39:56,374 --> 01:40:01,539
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...

429
01:40:01,613 --> 01:40:05,811
will return with courageous hearts

430
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:12,288
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.

431
01:40:18,796 --> 01:40:25,895
When our Party consisted
of only <i>seven</i> members...

432
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:28,063
it already had two principles.

433
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:33,406
<i>First</i>, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.

434
01:40:33,478 --> 01:40:37,471
And <i>second</i>, it would be,
uncompromisingly...

435
01:40:37,548 --> 01:40:41,814
<i>the one and only power in Germany.</i>

436
01:40:52,997 --> 01:40:57,593
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilized...

437
01:40:57,669 --> 01:41:04,598
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...

438
01:41:04,676 --> 01:41:10,012
which have always been not in the
majority, but rather in the minority.

439
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:25,959
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...

440
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:28,658
they can in the proudest self-esteem...

441
01:41:28,733 --> 01:41:32,328
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.

442
01:41:32,403 --> 01:41:35,964
The German people...

443
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:40,136
and subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers!

444
01:41:51,222 --> 01:41:54,157
The German people is happy...

445
01:41:54,225 --> 01:41:58,491
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...

446
01:41:58,563 --> 01:42:04,331
has been replaced by a <i>fixed pole.!</i>

447
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:23,486
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...

448
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:29,550
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...

449
01:42:29,627 --> 01:42:35,259
will never relinquish it!

450
01:42:47,278 --> 01:42:49,644
<i>Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof</i>
<i>(Reich Bishop of the United</i>
<i>German Evangelist Church)</i>

451
01:42:49,714 --> 01:42:55,152
There is always a part of the people who
stand out as really active fighters...

452
01:42:55,219 --> 01:43:02,819
and more is expected from them
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.

453
01:43:02,894 --> 01:43:09,231
For them it is not simply enough
to make the pledge: <i>"I believe.!"</i>

454
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:12,098
Rather, the affirmation: <i>"I fight.!"</i>

455
01:43:30,988 --> 01:43:38,690
For all time to come the Party will be
the source of political leadership
for the German people.

456
01:43:38,763 --> 01:43:43,928
It will in its teaching...

457
01:43:44,001 --> 01:43:47,437
and was ultimately in its organization
hard as steel...

458
01:43:47,505 --> 01:43:50,941
malleable in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety:

459
01:43:51,008 --> 01:43:55,342
yet it will be a training school
like a <i>holy order</i> for political leaders.

460
01:44:04,689 --> 01:44:11,652
It must be shown, however,
that <i>all upstanding Germans</i>
<i>become Nationalist Socialists.</i>

461
01:44:11,729 --> 01:44:17,133
Only <i>the best Nationalist Socialists,</i>
<i>however, are Party Comrades.!</i>

462
01:44:37,722 --> 01:44:47,222
Once, our enemies worried us and
persecuted us and, from time to time...

463
01:44:47,298 --> 01:44:53,259
removed the lesser elements
from the Movement <i>for</i> us.

464
01:44:54,071 --> 01:45:01,375
<i>Today</i> we must examine ourselves
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad.

465
01:45:09,654 --> 01:45:13,112
<i>And therefore, do not belong with us.!</i>

466
01:45:19,664 --> 01:45:21,655
It is our wish and will...

467
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:27,466
that this State and this Reich
last for thousand years.

468
01:45:27,538 --> 01:45:35,604
<i>We can be happy to know</i>
<i>that this future belongs entirely to us.!</i>

469
01:45:49,193 --> 01:45:53,061
<i>When the older ones among us falter...</i>

470
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:59,296
<i>the youth will stiffen</i>
<i>and remain until their bodies decay.</i>

471
01:46:18,923 --> 01:46:26,261
Only then, if we in the Party
with our most obedient dedication...

472
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:34,328
become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being...

473
01:46:34,405 --> 01:46:36,930
then the Party will materialize...

474
01:46:37,008 --> 01:46:43,140
into <i>an eternal and indestructible</i>
<i>pillar</i> of the German people and Reich.

475
01:46:43,214 --> 01:46:50,279
Then our <i>glorious</i>
and laudable Army...

476
01:46:50,354 --> 01:46:53,721
the old, proud,
standard bearers of our people...

477
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:56,851
who are equally tradition minded...

478
01:46:56,927 --> 01:46:59,623
will champion the Political Leadership
and the Party.

479
01:46:59,697 --> 01:47:05,795
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...

480
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:09,465
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...

481
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,634
<i>the German State, the German Reich.!</i>

482
01:47:25,756 --> 01:47:33,390
At this hour, tens of thousands
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.

483
01:47:33,464 --> 01:47:38,163
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...

484
01:47:38,235 --> 01:47:43,172
still others are already planning
the next review.

485
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:51,614
And again the people come and go and
they will be engrossed anew and happy...

486
01:47:51,682 --> 01:47:56,676
and inspired, for the idea and
the Movement live on in our people...

487
01:47:56,754 --> 01:48:00,019
and with the Movement
are symbol of eternity!

488
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:02,855
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the National Socialist Movement.!</i>

489
01:48:02,927 --> 01:48:05,088
<i>Long live Germany.!</i>

490
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:32,453
<i>Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess</i>
<i>at the Podium</i>

491
01:49:04,989 --> 01:49:08,925
<i>The Party is Hitler.!</i>

492
01:49:08,993 --> 01:49:13,157
<i>But Hitler is Germany,</i>
<i>as Germany is Hitler.!</i>

493
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:17,894
Hitler: Hail Victory!
Hail Victory!

494
01:49:19,069 --> 01:49:21,697
<i>"The Horst Wessel Song"</i>

495
01:49:21,772 --> 01:49:24,707
the NSDAP hymn and unofficial
German National Anthem
after <i>Deutschland Über Alles.</i>

496
01:49:24,759 --> 01:49:29,594
<i>Raise the banner</i>

497
01:49:29,664 --> 01:49:36,035
<i>The columns are closed tightly</i>

498
01:49:36,103 --> 01:49:45,842
<i>The SA marches</i>
<i>with a peaceful strong step</i>

499
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:55,914
<i>Comrades shot by the Red Front</i>
<i>and the Reactionaries</i>

500
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:07,124
<i>March in spirit together</i>
<i>in our columns</i>

501
01:50:08,369 --> 01:50:18,040
<i>Comrades shot by the Red Front</i>
<i>and the Reactionaries</i>

502
01:50:19,714 --> 01:50:29,055
<i>march in spirit together</i>
<i>in our columns</i>
