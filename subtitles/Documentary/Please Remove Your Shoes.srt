1
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:17,292
Your 10-year high school reunion.

2
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:21,128
Oh, everybody wants to make a good impression,
and I was making mine on-

3
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,772
Ted? Tad? Whatever.

4
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,321
I know, not exactly
Most Likely to Succeed...

5
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,719
but it's not like I had
a law degree to brag about...

6
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,788
or a Rittenhouse Square apartment,
or a fancyjob.

7
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:43,185
- Oh.
- Or a job, period.

8
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,391
- Man.
- Is that it?

9
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,843
Yes, baby, that's-that's it.

10
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,858
There are women- thinner women-

11
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,831
who have lace bras, silk thongs...

12
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,708
things designed to excite a man.

13
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,215
A thong would look ridiculous on me.

14
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,846
I wear cotton briefs.

15
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,339
My life is about working long hours...

16
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,928
planning trips I never take...

17
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,901
and settling for love found
on the pages of romance novels.

18
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,998
And because things like this
never happen to me...

19
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:28,067
the lawyer in me wants proof.

20
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:39,862
Hold on.

21
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,083
Is this Rose Feller?

22
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,001
Who is this?

23
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:55,686
My name's Todd.
I'm here with your sister.

24
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:59,522
Things like this,
on the other hand, happen all the time.

25
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,485
Those are my shoes.

26
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:39,992
You know, it is actually possible
to attend a reunion...

27
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:43,252
and not wind up passed out
on the bathroom floor.

28
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:51,692
1994 called.
It wants its hair scrunchie back.

29
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,801
- Oh.

30
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:57,158
How are the fashionable girls
wearing their hair these days...

31
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:00,515
when they pick up their drunk sisters
in the middle of the night?

32
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:06,652
Is that even a dress?

33
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,666
Just drive.

34
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,448
- Shit.

35
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,490
d Duh-nuh, duhhh-nuh
duh-nuh, duh-nuh d

36
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:34,655
- d Duh-nuh dd Oh!
- You're drunk!

37
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,779
Shh. Don't let Sydelle know.

38
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,984
Oops.

39
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,902
I was very clear.

40
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:46,067
You can only stay here
if there was none of your nonsense.

41
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:49,232
- Excuse me. I'm gonna go to bed.
- And throw up all over my white carpets?

42
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:51,533
Absolutely not.
Take your things and go.

43
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,068
Where is she supposed to go?

44
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:54,890
- I don't care. Take her home with you.
- No way.

45
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,137
- I don't care. Take her home with you.
- No way.

46
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,822
Gee, you two really know
how to make a girl feel special.

47
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,315
- I want to talk to Dad about this.
- Your father's asleep.

48
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,576
My Marcia and her husband are coming
for brunch tomorrow. He needs his rest.

49
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:07,932
I'm sure if he were given the choice of resting
up for your child or talking to his own...

50
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:09,850
he'd choose me.

51
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:13,303
Did you just raise your eyebrow?

52
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,988
I can't tell. It doesn't-

53
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,386
It doesn't move anymore.

54
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:25,386
"My Marcia's coming for brunch. "

55
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:28,839
To stuff her anorexic face.

56
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:36,798
What... is... this?

57
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,840
Rose Feller!

58
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,580
- Is there a man in this house?
- Shh!

59
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,498
- A human man?
- Shh, Maggie!

60
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,183
Oh.

61
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,677
- No, give me that!

62
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:56,170
- No! Ooh!
- Maggie! Maggie!

63
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:01,924
- Yummy. Yummy.
- Shh!

64
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,842
He's cute. Who is he?

65
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,336
- None of your business.

66
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,541
Well, I, for one...

67
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,528
am shocked...

68
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,405
and appalled.

69
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:19,762
Shh! Don't, Maggie. Shut up.

70
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,132
Life doesn't have
to be this hard, Mag.

71
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,831
If you just prepared a little, you know,
maybe went back to school?

72
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:34,434
Oh, right.
'Cause that worked so well the first time.

73
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,832
I mean the literacy place.

74
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,901
Retard "U. "

75
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,394
- If you just went back, finished up there-
- Right.

76
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,888
maybe it'll help you
figure out what you're good at.

77
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:48,340
I know what I'm good at.

78
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,546
- Besides that.
- Oh.

79
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:53,039
You have so much potential.

80
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:56,875
- You do realize I'm drunk, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,355
Remember Honey Bun?

82
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,507
How long did we have him for?

83
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,247
- A day.
- Mmm.

84
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:20,754
That was a good day.

85
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,604
Yeah.

86
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,826
- Oh. Good morning, um-
- Mmm.

87
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,950
- Is that English?
- Oh, Jim.

89
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:58,923
This is my sister, Maggie.

90
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,416
She just dropped by last night to visit.

91
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,334
Right.

92
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:11,773
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

93
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,788
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's not a problem.

94
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:22,514
Hey.

95
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,378
I could've sworn I had some 20s here.

96
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,283
Mm-hmm! Okay.

97
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,738
Hmm.

98
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,273
Sherbet.

99
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,576
Where does she get the time
to do this?

100
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,685
Okay.

101
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,699
I love you.

102
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,865
All right, Rose. What do you got?

103
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,318
Oh, shit!

104
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,332
There's a man in this picture?

105
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:56,209
Oh, shut up!
I had technical difficulties.

106
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,414
- Who's next?
- Trust me. Look, he's gorgeous.

107
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,963
- Thank you.
- And smart and totally... smoldering.

108
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,415
- Can you make that a full pound
of the hot sopresata?
- You got it.

109
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,525
Office romances can go very bad.

110
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,155
Well, they can also go very good.

111
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,553
You know, 30% of married women
met their husbands at work.

112
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,526
- Where did you get that statistic?
- Made it up.

113
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,540
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:21,143
All extracurricular activity happens
off-campus- his place or yours.

115
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:26,226
No, his. Mine's a little crowded
these days. Maggie.

116
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,815
- No!
-Just till she finds a job.

117
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:31,980
You say that like that's something
she's remotely capable of.

118
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,898
Why do you let her do this to you?

119
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,158
Because... she's my sister.

120
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,693
All right. What's your name?

121
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:48,954
Maggie May Feller. What's yours?

122
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,310
Some of you who had plans for the weekend
are, unfortunately, going to have to cancel.

123
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:56,722
The settlement discussions for the Donaldson
case have broken down completely...

124
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,982
so we'll need to start
gearing up for trial.

125
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,476
Simon, you should put together
a deposition schedule today.

126
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,682
And, Ellen, you should start drafting
a summary judgment motion.

127
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,805
I'll need to see that before we file it,
so you'll need to get it to me by Thursday, okay?

128
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,819
Let's get to it.

129
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,217
Listen, uh,
I'm supposed to go to Chicago...

130
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:16,573
to do some recruiting interviews
next weekend, but it's my kid's birthday.

131
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,491
- Can you go for me?
- Chicago?

132
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,409
- Yeah.
- It's cold there.

133
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,711
- Aw, come on. I promised I'd be the clown.
- I don't know.

134
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:26,451
If I could drag an associate along to help
with interviews so I don't fall behind.

135
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,465
Uh, Feller?

136
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:32,301
- Any interest? Chicago?
- Oh, gee, I don't know.

137
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:35,178
I mean, like you said,
it's... pretty cold there.

138
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:38,343
- Buy some mittens.

139
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,768
Rose. Your sister.

140
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:49,179
Guess who's in New York waiting for
her callback to be the next MTVveejay?

141
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,481
Well, uh-

142
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:54,358
Out of curiosity, um, how much
did it cost you to get up there?

143
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,180
Who cares? I'll make it back.

144
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,632
Oh, right, when MTV hires you
and makes you a great big star.

145
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,509
Would it kill you to be supportive?

146
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:05,195
I mean, would that just send you
into "anaphallic" shock or something?

147
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,455
Anaphylactic, Maggie, not "anaphallic. "

148
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,469
- Maggie May Feller!

149
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,730
I have to go. That's me.

150
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,127
- You're next.
- Excuse me.

151
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,580
- Welcome back, Maggie May.
- Thank you. It's good to be back.

152
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,840
Now, you see the screen
with the words on it?

153
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,772
Just read what it says...

154
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,457
andjust... look into the camera...

155
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:33,677
and give it that- that personality.

156
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,787
Just let it shine through.

157
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,253
Okay, whenever you're ready.

158
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,254
"It's Friday afternoon on"- Oh.

159
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,816
- Okay. Let's try again.

160
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,022
- Okay.
- Just relax.

161
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:03,022
"It's Friday afternoon on TRL and"-

162
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,242
Take it back.

163
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:12,804
"It's Friday afternoon
on TRL and later today"-

164
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,805
You okay, Maggie May?

165
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,792
Yeah.

166
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,684
Well? Are you famous yet?

167
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,849
Aposition in retail.

168
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,055
Employment history?

169
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,164
- dd

170
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,233
What was your last job?

171
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:56,535
- LuckyJeans for three weeks.
- Why'd it end?

172
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:02,385
Some crazy bitch with a coupon.

173
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,645
The coupon says 15%!
15% of the total!

174
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:08,522
15% of 42! Do the math!
What's your problem?

175
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:11,208
Okay, well, if anyone asks, just...

176
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,893
say it wasn't challenging enough.

177
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,058
And before that was the restaurant, right?
The Canal House?

178
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:33,169
- And before that?

179
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,854
Before that? The Gap.

180
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,457
Before that? The Limited.

181
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:43,430
Wanamaker's Fragrance,
Wanamaker's Accessories.

182
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,019
Oh, come on. You really don't
want to do this right now, do you?

183
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:49,184
No, but I also don't want you
on my couch for the next three months.

184
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,034
I'll let you do my resume
if you let me do your makeup.

185
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,678
- Forget it.
- Why?

186
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,172
I don't know- at some point today,
I have to face the world...

187
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,281
and I'd rather not do it
looking like a $20 hooker.

188
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:07,117
Oh, come on. I promise you'll
still look like you, just better.

189
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,008
Let's go pick out an outfit
for inspiration. Shoes.

190
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,981
- I don't have-
- Shoes!

191
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,954
You know...

192
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,598
you don't even wear most of these.

193
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:26,106
Shoes like these should not
be locked in a closet.

194
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:29,462
They should be living
a life of scandal and passion...

195
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:33,298
getting screwed in an alleyway by a billionaire
while his frigid wife waits in the limo...

196
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,847
thinking that he just went back into the bar
to get his cell phone.

197
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,148
- These are cute too.
- Please tell me you just made that up.

198
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,984
Look, if you're not gonna wear them,
don't buy them.

199
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,669
Leave them for somebody who's
gonna get something out of them.

200
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,971
I get something out of them.

201
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,643
When I feel bad,
I like to treat myself.

202
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,849
Clothes never look any good.

203
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,534
Food just makes me fatter.

204
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:03,699
Shoes always fit.

205
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:22,975
- Don't slouch.
-Something for you ladies?

206
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:25,852
I think we're gonna
just take a minute. Thanks.

207
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:29,304
- I thought I was getting a drink out of this.
- Patience.

208
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,854
Eww! Maggie, no.

209
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,431
How would you ladies like
to join us for something wet?

210
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,787
- What is that?
- It's a vagina.

211
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:08,048
You know what? Sydelle's right.
You're completely obscene.

212
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,829
Why, because I say "vagina"?

213
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,994
"Michael,
I don't know what's wrong with your girls.

214
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,487
My Marcia never uses the word 'vagina'!"

215
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,843
Oh, no, my Marcia
doesn't even have a vagina!

216
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,337
Oh, my Marcia has a vagina,
all right...

217
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:26,269
but my Marcia's vagina is made
of solid 2 4-karat gold.

218
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:30,584
My Marcia's vagina is so perfect,
it's in a museum!

219
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,434
What can I get you girls?

220
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:40,462
We'll have two stacks
of whole wheat honey pancakes...

221
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,284
and a side ofbacon, please.

222
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,065
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

223
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,367
Oh, and, uh, are you hiring?

224
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,285
I'll bring an application.

225
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,504
My Marcia never eats pancakes.

226
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:56,190
That's why my Marcia
still wears a m-

227
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,108
What?

228
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,272
I can't believe you just did that.

229
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,190
Did what?

230
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,259
"Are you hiring?"

231
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,520
God, Rose,
we were having fun for once.

232
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,493
- It's an opportunity.
- To do what?

233
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:16,233
To work the graveyard shift serving pancakes
to cops and whores and drunks.

234
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:19,398
I think you should work, so you don't
have to mooch off me for everything.

235
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,179
What are you talking about?
I just got us two rounds of drinks.

236
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,864
No. Cuervo Carl got the drinks, and only
because he hoped you'd sleep with him.

237
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,645
Well, I didn't.

238
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,426
You need a job, Maggie.

239
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:33,687
There's a whole world
of commerce out there...

240
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,701
that has nothing to do with sex.

241
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:38,098
Where people actually make money
without seducing anyone.

242
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,071
Obviously, or you'd starve.

243
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:46,154
You're not gonna look
like this forever, you know.

244
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,359
Eventually you'll be older...

245
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:52,483
and then all the men who foot your bill now
will be buying drinks for girls half your age.

246
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:54,497
And what are you gonna do then?

247
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,854
Well, you better think of something...

248
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,059
'cause middle-aged tramps aren't cute.

249
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,073
They're pathetic.

250
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,060
- Fine.
- What are you doing?

251
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,937
Sit down, Mag. Mag.

252
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,075
Your car's here, Miss Feller.

253
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,733
Mm-hmm.

254
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,747
Thank you.

255
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,145
Hey.

256
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,118
Danvers got busy.
He sent me instead.

257
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,091
Almond croissant? Still warm.

258
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,654
Hi. I was, uh, wondering
if you guys are hiring?

259
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,765
Hi.

260
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,492
Great.

261
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,889
Shit.

262
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,166
- You know about anal glands?
- What?

263
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:48,235
- Squeeze.
- Eww.

264
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:52,646
- Oh, you get used to it. Grab yourself an apron.
- We got all sizes.

265
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,113
Sorry.

266
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,126
Hello, Sydelle.

267
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,867
No, I can't come right now.

268
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:07,127
Look, I'll get there when I get there, okay?
Thank you.

269
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:10,867
Stepmother.

270
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,361
You can put it all in the basement.

271
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,197
I need this space. I'm converting it
to a nursery for my Marcia's baby.

272
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:21,512
- She's pregnant?
- She will be very soon.

273
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:23,430
- Maggie!
- Hey, Daddy!

274
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:25,444
- Yeah, hi, baby.
- Hi.

275
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,650
I thought I heard your voice.
What brings you here?

276
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,527
- I'm being evicted.
- Are you gonna wear that, Michael?

277
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:34,746
Because if you're not, you should go change.
We're already late.

278
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,664
- Mustn't be late.
- Mm-mmm.

279
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,829
- Stick around, Maggie, have dinner with us.
- Mmm, tempting.

280
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:42,419
- Yeah.

281
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:45,871
Well- Oh, try not
to burn the house down.

282
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:09,846
Don't look at me like that, my Marcia.

283
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,574
Shit.

284
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,413
dd

285
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:09,688
Mike, how do you stop
loving somebody when...

286
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,373
- they've stopped loving you?

287
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,415
We are within walking distance to three
of the best restaurants in the city.

288
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:22,059
- I've already eaten.
- Yeah.

289
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,361
Grease is not a food group, Feller.

290
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,484
- Bon appetit.
- Will you stay with me?

291
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:36,252
Okay, I'm not gonna start
with your butt first, okay?

292
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm gonna wait for us to get
to know each other a little better.

293
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,445
- All right. Here you go.

294
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,267
Okay.

295
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,692
Oh!  Shit.

296
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:56,775
Here we go, sweetie.

297
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,310
Oh, God.

298
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,681
No! Truce.

299
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,902
Damn it!

300
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,889
- They got you too, huh?
- What?

301
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:43,862
They tow on Saturdays.

302
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:47,027
Great. Do you know
where they take the cars?

303
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:50,095
Uh, yeah, it's this impound lot
down on South Street.

304
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:53,548
I'm parked around the corner.
I'm taking him. We'd be glad to take you too.

305
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:56,329
- Yeah.
- If you want.

306
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:58,343
Yeah, that would be great.

307
00:25:58,343 --> 00:26:01,028
Uh, you know, are we-
I mean, are we- are we in a rush?

308
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:04,864
'Cause I could stand going for a drink.

309
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,782
- Sure.
- All right. All right. Cool.

310
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:08,700
- There it is. What's your name?
- Maggie.

311
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:10,714
- Hey. Grant. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, I'm Tim.

312
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,111
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice way to end your day.

313
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:17,523
Yeah. My sister would kill me
if she knew I got her car towed.

314
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:37,374
Where is this place?

315
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,484
We're almost there.

316
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,678
We're in like Flynn.

317
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:02,692
All right, go ahead.

318
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,172
- There it is.
- All right, let's go.

319
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:13,625
- All right.
- All right. Thanks.

320
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:15,638
- All right.
- So, thanks for the ride.

321
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,228
Thanks for the drinks and the fun,
and, uh, we'll see you guys later.

322
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,242
Well- I mean, wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on.

323
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,160
Maybe we can go do something.

324
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,269
- You know, it's early still.
- No, I'm okay, actually. I'm just gonna go.

325
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,763
Yeah, but you can't just take the car.
You got to pay for it.

326
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,352
- Let me go!
- What are you doing? Hey, wait up! Wait!

327
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,846
- Grant! Leave it alone!

328
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,723
- Ow! God!

329
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,559
Aah!

330
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:02,150
What the hell is that?

331
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,068
It's Honey Bun Two.

332
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:06,466
You bought a dog.

333
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,767
No, I borrowed him.

334
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:10,877
I didn't want to be alone last night.

335
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,891
I had- I had a bad night.

336
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:15,384
So did I, Maggie, several of them...

337
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,398
but you don't see me stealing dogs.

338
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,426
I was scared.
There were these guys and-

339
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,919
- Of course there were.
- And I got home, and you were gone. I-

340
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:28,043
My plane was late.
I have to be in court in 20 minutes.

341
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:30,537
I missed two days of work for nothing,
which means I'm gonna have to work forever.

342
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,167
And now I'm getting a cold...

343
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:35,428
so I don't have room in my head
for your problems right now.

344
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:38,976
Just have my sheets cleaned
and the dog out...

345
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:40,894
by the time I get home.

346
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:55,183
My car has a boot on it!

347
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,156
How the hell did my car
get a boot on it?

348
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:00,937
Oh, I was trying to tell you.
I-I used it the other day-

349
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:04,389
Five years I've had that car,
not one ticket.

350
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,075
You use it-without permission-
for two days.

351
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:08,993
- Melanie Dillon.
- Melanie, it's me.

352
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,198
- Hi, Rose.
- There's an emergency,
and I can't make it to court.

353
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:13,692
- Can you send someone to cover for me?
- Got it.

354
00:29:13,788 --> 00:29:15,802
Thank you.

355
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,720
You ruin everything.

356
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:24,624
I can't take this anymore, Maggie.
I can't.

357
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,830
I want you out.

358
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,899
Now. Today,
before I get home from work.

359
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:34,023
- Where am I supposed to go?
- That is not my problem!

360
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:37,763
You are your problem!
You figure it out!

361
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,736
- How was Chicago?
- Cold.

362
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,750
Sorry I couldn't swing it.

363
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,340
- Things were kind of crazy around here.
- Yeah, I know.

364
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,353
I work here too.

365
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,203
You know, Jim...

366
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,560
if you say you're gonna be in Chicago,
you should be in Chicago.

367
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:06,916
And if you can't make it, if you know you're
gonna send Simon Stein in your place...

368
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,218
then pick up the goddamn phone.

369
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,632
Bitch.

370
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,471
It's okay, Honey Bun. Shh.

371
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,842
Is... Rose here?

372
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,391
Nope.

373
00:32:27,602 --> 00:32:29,424
- Oh!

374
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,534
Rose. Rose.

375
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,877
I liked you. I really liked you.

376
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,193
She won't even remember your name.

377
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,166
In fact, she can't even spell it.

378
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:50,330
Can you, Mag? Want to give it a try?
Come on, sound it out.

379
00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:53,687
Ji... immm.

380
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:56,276
Jim.

381
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:58,962
Pretty, but real stupid.

382
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:01,839
Shut up, you fat pig!

383
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:07,784
Did you honestly just say "fat pig"?

384
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:14,689
You are my sister...

385
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:19,101
and the best you can do is "fat pig"?

386
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,211
Get out of my life!

387
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,513
Oh!

388
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,980
Is there anything I can do?

389
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:44,994
I want 200 bucks.

390
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,405
That's the going rate, isn't it?

391
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:04,653
When's your next train to New York?

392
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:08,969
12:18.

393
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:03,344
Mrs. Lefkowitz?

394
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:10,345
All right already!

395
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:14,373
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was my son.

396
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:17,154
- I'll get my list.
- Okay.

397
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,894
I didn't know your son was here.
That's wonderful.

398
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,771
Yeah, well,
he said he wants to see me.

399
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:27,607
And where is he now?
He's on the beach, looking at bosoms.

400
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:30,196
Hey, Lewis, what's the matter?

401
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,210
You look like you just had a stroke.

402
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:35,471
- Hi, Mrs. Lefkowitz. Hi, Ella. I didn't see you.
- Hello.

403
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,540
- She's invisible.
- You look confused.

404
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,704
Well, who needs all these choices?
It's soap.

405
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,732
I say, when in doubt,
go for the simplest box.

406
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:49,664
Ah. You know, Sharla taught me
almost everything.

407
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,870
Cooking, dishes,
how to use a cell phone.

408
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:53,884
Never got around to the laundry.

409
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,898
You must miss her.

410
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:58,870
Mmm, every day. You?

411
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:02,802
Well, I didn't know your wife,
so, no, I can't say that I do.

412
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:09,707
Oh, finally,
a date with Lewis Feldman.

413
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,625
What do you mean?

414
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:14,310
He's had his eye on you
since he got here.

415
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:16,900
- That's ridiculous. He has not.

416
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:20,544
Anyway, it's not a date.
I'm just helping him with his laundry.

417
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:23,709
Why? What do you think dates look
like around here, bungee jumping?

418
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,914
Believe me, it's a date.

419
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:29,846
At least she's gone.

420
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:32,531
Where'd she go to anyway?

421
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,614
I don't know. My dad's, I guess.

422
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,834
Well, that's good. Gives Sydelle
one more thing to complain about.

423
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,492
Which one are you crying about-

424
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:50,369
the predatory prick
or the shit-for-brains tramp?

425
00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:54,972
'Cause neither one deserves your tears.

426
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:59,575
You know, Amy...

427
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:01,589
I'm sure you're right...

428
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,837
but sometimes I wish you'd just say...

429
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,042
"Boy, that sucks...

430
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:15,878
and I'm really sorry
it happened to you. "

431
00:37:20,098 --> 00:37:23,167
- Do you have them for every high holiday?
- Yeah.

432
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:26,427
The Passover one says,
"What makes this tuchis unlike any other?"

433
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,825
- My son, the joker.

434
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:32,277
Thinks it makes up for the fact
that I don't see him on the holidays.

435
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,867
- They go to her parents.
- Well, at least he's married.

436
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:38,703
- My son- 5 5, still single.
- Gay?

437
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:41,580
I wish. Immature.

438
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,785
Ella, tell me about your family.

439
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:47,046
Well, my husband Ira
was in real estate.

440
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,964
Died three years ago. Cancer.

441
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,416
- That's funny?

442
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,293
No, it's the way we do that-
the dead spouse intro.

443
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,307
Name, rank, when did he die, how.

444
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,513
But not the specifics.

445
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:02,390
Cancer's okay,
but no one ever says "lung cancer. "

446
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,500
Or, God forbid,"prostate cancer. "

447
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,993
How 'bout you? Have any kids?

448
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:09,487
No.

449
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:13,227
No, I don't have any children.

450
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:26,653
- Rufus? Is that Rufus?

451
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,434
Uh, is Shirley back
from Europe already?

452
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,119
Ooh, I thought she- I thought she
was boarding Rufus for another month.

453
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:34,037
She is. Yeah.

454
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:38,353
I just... walk... Rufus.

455
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:40,846
- Oh, you're with the Elegant Paw.
- No. No, I'm-

456
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,764
- Hi, Carol.
- Hey, Carol.

457
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,682
- Hi.
- Good girl, Molly.

458
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:48,422
- I'm... freelance. A... freelance dog-walker.
- Oh, I see.

459
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:51,779
Yeah, I work for kennels,
with kennels, and, uh...

460
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,272
with- for individuals... too.

461
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,574
- She's just what we need.
- Absolutely.

462
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,122
- How much do you charge?

463
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:02,903
Jesus! You saved my ass.

464
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:06,739
- Where did you find him?
- Oh, just... wandering around Rittenhouse.

465
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:10,575
You know, I give this girl a job.
She seems normal.

466
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:13,740
Next thing I know,
she's taken off with this dog.

467
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:18,247
You can imagine, something like this gets out,
and I'm out of business.

468
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:23,042
So, how does 200 sound for a reward?
Fair enough?

469
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:25,632
- I don't want a reward.
- What are you, a saint?

470
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,454
No.

471
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,235
Uh, I was thinking...
maybe instead of a reward...

472
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:32,824
you could offer your clients
my dog-walking services.

473
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:35,222
Exclusively.

474
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:38,482
We could split the proceeds.

475
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,705
- Not so much as the Winnebago he left her.

476
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:13,006
- Oh, it's horrible!

477
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:17,034
You won't be laughing when
you're eating government cheese.

478
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,952
Hello.

479
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,692
- Hello?
- Is this Ella Hirsch?

480
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,610
Yes, it is.

481
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:29,022
Did you have a daughter named Caroline?

482
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:31,323
Yes.

483
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:49,448
So, are you on vacation, or-

484
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:54,819
Yeah.

485
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:58,847
Mmm. Well, we've been
having wonderful weather.

486
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:05,943
I'm so glad you called.

487
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:11,314
I'm so glad you're here.

488
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:40,084
Mrs. Lefkowitz, this is
my granddaughter Maggie Feller.

489
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:45,262
- Hello.
- Hi.

490
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,098
Well, you must be starving.
I can, uh, fix you something to eat-

491
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:50,729
No, that's- I'm fine.

492
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:53,510
I just, uh-

493
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:58,401
- I'm really tired.
- Oh. Well, let me show you the guest room.

494
00:41:58,497 --> 00:42:01,661
Um, it's right through here.
Uh, this is the bathroom.

495
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:05,210
And I'll put out clean towels
and, uh, a washcloth.

496
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:07,703
The bed's made up...

497
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:10,388
and there are, um,
extra blankets in the closet.

498
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,950
- Is my grandfather around?
- Oh. No.

499
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:19,499
No, Ira passed away
over three years ago.

500
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,527
So, you'll call me
if you need anything?

501
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:25,636
Yeah.

502
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,337
Hey, you said you didn't have children.

503
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:47,022
I said I don't have children.

504
00:42:47,118 --> 00:42:50,091
I had a daughter.

505
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:52,297
Her name was Caroline.
She died.

506
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:54,119
What was she like?

507
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,832
Well, she was-
she was exactly like that.

508
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,325
Same eyes, same skin...

509
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:05,435
same face- identical.

510
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:10,901
But she had, um, health problems.

511
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:14,258
- She had mental health problems.
- Tsk.

512
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,559
Well, how'd she die?

513
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:22,985
Car accident.

514
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,108
A leave of absence? Why?

515
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,698
I'm just-
I'm not happy at that firm.

516
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,903
So instead you'll be walking dogs.

517
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:35,164
And running errands, and-
I think it'll be fun.

518
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,288
Are you okay?

519
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,206
You're not having-

520
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,042
- What?

521
00:43:45,138 --> 00:43:49,837
If you ever want to talk to someone,
Rose, I'll pay for it.

522
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:53,097
No questions asked.
If you're ever feeling-

523
00:43:53,193 --> 00:43:55,687
Crazy?

524
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:58,947
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

525
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:02,208
How is Maggie?

526
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:04,797
- You haven't seen her?
- No, she's still with you, isn't she?

527
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:09,688
Oh, yeah, she is. She's fine.

528
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:12,182
- Thanks for the coffee.
- All right. See you soon?

529
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:14,100
Yeah.

530
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:29,252
The number
you have called is no longer in service.

531
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,362
If you feel you have reached
this recording-

532
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,362
Hmm.

533
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,377
Well, good morning.

534
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:49,295
Did you sleep well?

535
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,213
Fine, thanks.

536
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:54,761
I have English muffins here.
I can make you any kind of eggs you'd like.

537
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:57,734
- I don't eat breakfast.
- Oh.

538
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,652
I drink coffee.

539
00:45:01,187 --> 00:45:05,119
So, my goodness. This is a surprise.

540
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:07,132
Such a lovely surprise.

541
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,393
After all this time.

542
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:14,709
- Yeah, what's up with that?
- I beg your pardon?

543
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:19,408
Well, were you always out of the picture,
or just after Mom died?

544
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:24,395
Oh, your grandfather and I were never out
of the- I mean, we were always there.

545
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,313
We-

546
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:29,861
And even after your mom died, I wrote.

547
00:45:30,149 --> 00:45:33,026
Birthday cards, every year.
And I never heard back.

548
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:35,998
Yeah, I know. You wrote
for a while. I just found them.

549
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:38,780
What do you mean,"just"?

550
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,711
I guess they got waylaid.
Thanks for the money.

551
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,972
You're telling me that your father
never gave you my cards?

552
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:48,178
Mm-mmm.

553
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,575
What must you have thought?

554
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,891
I thought you both were dead.

555
00:45:59,302 --> 00:46:01,412
Does this place have a pool?

556
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,289
- Oh! Sorry.
- Whoa.

557
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:06,782
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

558
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:09,180
Come on.

559
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,249
- Hey, check this out.

560
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:20,784
Hey.

561
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:25,387
Where'd she come from?

562
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:44,567
Hi, sweetheart.

563
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,569
Come on, come on.

564
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,530
Come on. Keep playing.

565
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,708
Rose! Rose Feller!

566
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,818
Oh, Stein.

567
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:29,928
How are you?

568
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:33,380
Man, you look great.
Not sick at all.

569
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,107
Why would I look sick?

570
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:37,504
Oh.

571
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,477
- That's one of the rumors.
- There are rumors?

572
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:47,094
How 'bout that? Lunchtime.

573
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,355
- Hey, how does, uh- How does Japanese sound?
- I'm not hungry, Stein.

574
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,615
Oh, there's no such thing
as not hungry for sushi. Come on.

575
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:56,205
We'll bill it to one of your old clients.

576
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:58,123
Uh, thank you.
You eat everything?

577
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,137
- What do you think?
- Okay.

578
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:04,356
- Um, two orders of uni, one masago.
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:48:04,452 --> 00:48:06,178
- Uh, two tako.
- Okay.

580
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,000
- Two hamachi.
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:12,028
Then also that cod thing. It was a special
once, but it's not on the menu anymore.

582
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:13,946
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Tara.

583
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:15,864
- Yes!
- Okay. Thank you.

584
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,837
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

585
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,139
- You just ordered for me.
- Yes.

586
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,344
- What am I, 12?
- Uh, I'm an expert orderer.

587
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:25,262
- It's a gift.
- Is it?

588
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:27,948
Absolutely.

589
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:31,017
What was the last
great restaurant you went to?

590
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:34,661
- I took my sister to Le Bec Fin.
- Uh-huh.

591
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:39,648
And you both got the... snapper,
right?

592
00:48:39,743 --> 00:48:41,757
Close. I got the snapper.

593
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:45,497
- She got three rum and Cokes
and the sommelier's phone number.
- [ Laughs ] Okay.

594
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:49,429
Well, I'll take you there,
and we'll get...

595
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:53,553
the foie gras
with Roquefort-stuffed fig...

596
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:56,142
Scottish wood pigeon with cabbage...

597
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:58,636
and porcini cassoulet.

598
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:02,280
And the chocolate mousse...

599
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,773
with raspberries
and hazelnut macaroon.

600
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,746
You'll want to eat with me
for the rest of your life.

601
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,788
- Ah.
- Here you go.

602
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,994
- Mmm.
- I know.

603
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,912
- The special, tara.
- Thank you.

604
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:19,830
Enjoy.

605
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,953
So -
What are the other rumors?

606
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:26,063
Ah. Um-

607
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,132
Rumor one: mysterious illness.

608
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:32,105
Rumor two: head-hunted
by Pepper and Hamilton.

609
00:49:34,982 --> 00:49:37,092
Here. Try some of this.

610
00:49:37,188 --> 00:49:40,257
- Rumor three?
- Um, soy?

611
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,462
Oh, come on.
What's rumor three?

612
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:49,751
Affair with a partner gone bad.

613
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,902
Don't worry.

614
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,108
Most people are betting on lupus.

615
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:10,082
Here.
Wasabi makes everything better.

616
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:17,562
- So, uh, what time Friday?
- Friday?

617
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:19,480
Dinner.

618
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:23,316
Oh, look, Simon, this was- this was
really nice, but, um, I don't think-

619
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:25,234
7:00 it is.

620
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,837
Thank you.

621
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:38,276
Mmm. That smells good.
What is that?

622
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,290
That's braised veal.

623
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:46,044
- Shit.

624
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,154
There's a paper towel on the counter.

625
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:56,593
Out of curiosity...

626
00:50:56,689 --> 00:50:59,566
how long is this vacation of yours
going to last?

627
00:50:59,758 --> 00:51:02,827
How come you don't have
any pictures of my mom around?

628
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:05,704
Don't you like thinking about her?

629
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,677
I don't need to have a picture
to think about my daughter.

630
00:51:16,924 --> 00:51:20,185
You put out pictures,
people ask questions.

631
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:23,158
They expect you to tell 'em everything,
and I don't do that.

632
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:25,651
'Cause Mom was sick?

633
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:27,953
Because she's gone.

634
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:32,076
Is that why you pulled away from us?

635
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,570
So that you didn't have to talk
about her with us either?

636
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:37,543
I didn't pull away. I was pushed.

637
00:51:39,844 --> 00:51:41,666
No, listen.

638
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:45,215
I'm not the one who didn't pass along
the letters. That was your father.

639
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,229
I'm not the one
who didn't want a relationship.

640
00:51:47,324 --> 00:51:50,106
He said that?"I don't want you to have
a relationship with my daughters. "

641
00:51:50,201 --> 00:51:52,119
- Oh, yes.
- When?

642
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:55,284
- At the funeral.
- Why? Why would he say that?

643
00:51:57,106 --> 00:52:01,038
Because he's irrational. Yeah.
He blamed me for everything.

644
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:03,915
Every bad day, every bad episode.

645
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:07,080
He did not want me near her.

646
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:09,094
And after she was gone...

647
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,546
he didn't want me near you
or your sister.

648
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,972
I just wonder-

649
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:25,589
If you had tried harder,
you know, or, like, tried again...

650
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,849
after he'd gotten over the whole...

651
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,822
shock and grief of it, you know?

652
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:39,398
'Cause it would have been nice
having a grandmother.

653
00:52:39,398 --> 00:52:41,316
Nice and...

654
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:44,385
maybe a little less lonely.

655
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,016
She sounds like a manipulative
little nincompoop.

656
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:56,660
- The girl lost her mother.
- So? You lost your daughter.

657
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,674
- It's not the same.
- It's worse.

658
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,935
A parent burying a child
goes against the law of nature.

659
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:05,771
Well, so does a grandparent
abandoning her grandchildren.

660
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:08,456
You said yourself
he didn't want you around.

661
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,333
What were you supposed to do,
break down the door?

662
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,251
Yes.

663
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:16,320
Shoelace.

664
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:20,923
For Caroline, yes.

665
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:24,088
For Caroline.
She was gone, cookie.

666
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:27,540
And you pushing your way into that house
wasn't gonna do a thing for her.

667
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:30,034
- She wanted me there.
- You don't know that.

668
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,390
- Yes, I do. I know.
- How?

669
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,938
I just do.

670
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:38,856
How?

671
00:53:41,254 --> 00:53:43,747
I've never told anybody this,
not even Ira.

672
00:53:43,843 --> 00:53:47,775
I'll take it to my grave,
probably tomorrow.

673
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:54,296
It wasn't a car accident.

674
00:53:54,392 --> 00:53:57,653
I mean, eh- it- it was a car...

675
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:02,256
and there was a crash, but-

676
00:54:03,886 --> 00:54:06,188
How do you know it was on purpose?

677
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:10,695
She wrote a note.

678
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:16,929
It came the day after the funeral.

679
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,614
What'd it say?

680
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,532
One line.

681
00:54:22,587 --> 00:54:25,272
"Please take care of my girls. "

682
00:54:25,368 --> 00:54:28,245
- And you didn't.
- [ Restrained Sobbing ] Mm-mmm.

683
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:30,355
You didn't because you couldn't.

684
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,561
Now you can, so you will.

685
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:36,972
Ella, bubbeleh, you did the best
you could in a very bad situation.

686
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:39,753
You got nothing to feel guilty about.

687
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,452
And you tell that
to Miss Hotsy-Totsy Pants.

688
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,303
So this is where all my boyfriends
have been coming from.

689
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:03,345
They took a vote. I don't know who
I pissed off, but somehow... I lost.

690
00:55:03,441 --> 00:55:06,701
Or won. Either way, it's official.

691
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:09,482
I am the captain of the softball team.

692
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,798
Yeah.

693
00:55:15,332 --> 00:55:18,880
Look, I know this isn't my business,
but I can't not say anything.

694
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:24,155
You have rights, legal options
for getting your job back.

695
00:55:24,251 --> 00:55:26,073
I don't want it back.

696
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,758
You don't?

697
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:30,964
I thought you loved it.

698
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,129
You were always the first one there in the morning
and the last one to leave at night.

699
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,773
I know. Not because I loved it.

700
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:39,691
Then why?

701
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:42,568
I don't know.

702
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:46,404
Maybe... I was scared of what
would happen if I wasn't there.

703
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,473
Oh, what? Like the place
would fall apart without you?

704
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:53,117
- With law freaks like you there? Never.

705
00:55:53,213 --> 00:55:56,377
No, I wasn't worried about the office.

706
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:59,638
I guess it was more... me...

707
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,611
and what would happen to me
without those people to please...

708
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,200
and those tasks to get done.

709
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:08,940
Like... maybe... those were
the things holding me together.

710
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,448
And without them, I'd...

711
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,462
fall apart.

712
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:19,969
But you didn't.

713
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:21,887
I guess not.

714
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:26,586
So what does hold you together?

715
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:38,094
For me, it's the law, politics...

716
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,108
the Sixers and good food.

717
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:44,999
If you ever want to join me
for a game or a meal...

718
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,972
I hope you'll give me a call.

719
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:05,713
Ella?

720
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,060
Oh. I was just looking for-

721
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:43,978
For what?

722
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:50,211
Sorry, I-

723
00:57:50,307 --> 00:57:53,568
Wrong dresser.
It's in the sock drawer.

724
00:57:53,664 --> 00:57:55,582
What is?

725
00:57:55,677 --> 00:57:59,513
My cash. That's what you were looking for,
right? That's what you want.

726
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,582
No. God.

727
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:06,131
Oh, well.

728
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:08,912
I guess after being absent
for some 20-odd years or so...

729
00:58:09,008 --> 00:58:11,885
I can't expect you to want
to have a relationship with me.

730
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,282
- How much?
- How much what?

731
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:18,789
Money, Maggie. How much money
were you hoping to get from me?

732
00:58:21,283 --> 00:58:24,352
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

733
00:58:25,886 --> 00:58:28,667
I want to go to New York.

734
00:58:28,763 --> 00:58:33,270
Maybe... act.
I think I'd be good at it.

735
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:36,435
Mmm, clearly.

736
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:38,449
- How much do you need?
- Three grand.

737
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:41,134
That you would not have found
in the sock drawer.

738
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,148
How much do you have?

739
00:58:46,696 --> 00:58:48,519
Well...

740
00:58:48,614 --> 00:58:51,971
I won't give you $3,000,
but I'll do this.

741
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:55,040
They need help over
at the Assisted Living Center.

742
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:59,355
You get that job, stop loafing around
here like some princess...

743
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:01,753
and I will match what you earn,
penny for penny.

744
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:10,384
You would do that?

745
00:59:11,822 --> 00:59:13,836
Why?

746
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:17,385
Because I'm your grandmother.

747
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:26,399
Oh, I don't think so.

748
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:30,235
Last time I ran anywhere was to my wedding.
Look what happened.

749
00:59:38,387 --> 00:59:41,455
- Is that Corinne?
- No.

750
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:43,373
- Who is it?
- Maggie.

751
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:45,771
Have we met before?

752
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:48,840
There's a pick-up line
with a little dust on it.

753
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:51,141
Fine. What's your sign?

754
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,443
I've been out of the game for a while.

755
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:55,936
What, like 7 0,80 years?

756
00:59:56,032 --> 00:59:58,909
Give or take.

757
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:00,827
Where's Corinne?
She's my number-one girl.

758
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:03,513
Well, excuse me, but what does
Corinne have that I don't?

759
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:07,924
- She reads to me.
- Oh.

760
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:12,239
You could do it, maybe nose her
out of first position.

761
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:15,980
Here.

762
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:20,871
I'm a little busy right now.

763
01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:24,323
Maybe you should wait for Corinne.

764
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:37,269
- Hello?
- Are the Sixers basketball or hockey?

765
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:44,174
Come on, Eric!

766
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,572
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

767
01:00:46,764 --> 01:00:49,065
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Get back, get back!

768
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:52,230
That's Reggie Miller!
You gotta get him!

769
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:54,148
- He'll make it every time.

770
01:00:54,244 --> 01:00:56,066
Boo! That's right.

771
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:58,176
- Boo!
- Good.

772
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:02,683
I can't believe we lost the game.

773
01:01:02,683 --> 01:01:05,081
- Why can't you believe it?
We've been losin' all season long.
- That's right.

774
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:07,766
We need a three-point man, a man who
can shoot the pill, a man who can thrill.

775
01:01:07,862 --> 01:01:10,067
I don't care if you have the best
three-point shooter in the league.

776
01:01:10,163 --> 01:01:13,040
- You got to get back on defense.
- But at the same time, you need
to put points on the boards too.

777
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,821
Look at the best teams in history-
the Celtics, the Bulls, the Lakers-

778
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:17,739
all great defensive teams.

779
01:01:17,835 --> 01:01:20,137
I mean, offense sells tickets,
but defense wins ball games.

780
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,534
- He's right.
Without defense, you won't win games.
- Thank you.

781
01:01:30,206 --> 01:01:32,412
Hmm.

782
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:37,207
I see you're a fan of the classics.

783
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,043
Um, what?

784
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:48,523
- Oh, that. That-That's my sister's.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

785
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,017
I hope you like cheap, almost-stale red.

786
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:52,935
It's my favorite.

787
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,004
What's she like- the sister?

788
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:59,168
She's, you know, a sister.

789
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,963
- You don't want to talk about your sister.
- I didn't say that.

790
01:02:07,128 --> 01:02:09,046
I don't want to talk about my sister.

791
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:13,074
Cheers.

792
01:02:20,266 --> 01:02:23,239
So what's he like,
this, um, Captain Jack?

793
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:27,555
"His fingers tangled in her curls...

794
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:31,487
"while his tongue plundered
the soft cavern of her mouth.

795
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,501
"She made no protest.

796
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:36,282
"Her furnace was alight.

797
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,255
"Jack drew his lips from hers
and urged her forward...

798
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:42,132
"so he could take
one shirt-veiled nipple...

799
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:44,050
"into his mouth.

800
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:46,831
"Kit's gasp urged him on.

801
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:49,324
"He licked the material
until it clung...

802
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,242
"to the ripe peak...

803
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,599
"then drew the turgid flesh
deep into his mouth.

804
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:59,394
"Kit moaned, her body
spasming in response.

805
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,558
Her eyes were closed,
her lips parted. "

806
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:06,970
Okay, um, embarrassing
as this is to admit...

807
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:09,367
I'm officially turned on.

808
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:32,033
Does this mean that I'm your bitch?

809
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:36,157
Do you want to be my bitch?

810
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,500
I have wanted to be your bitch
since my first day at Dommel.

811
01:04:46,994 --> 01:04:50,830
That Chicago trip- I was convinced it was
all gonna come together for me there.

812
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:55,625
- Was I unfriendly?
- Oh, no. I mean, not compared to, say, Stalin.

813
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,762
I'm sorry.

814
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:05,598
- Hmm. I was hideous.
- That's okay.

815
01:05:06,557 --> 01:05:08,476
You have plenty of time
to make it up to me.

816
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,258
- Go, go, go!

817
01:05:27,464 --> 01:05:28,998
Come on, come on!

818
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:33,505
- Yes! Go!

819
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:39,068
Yes!  Yes!

820
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:44,438
So, how's it going with Hotsy Tots?

821
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:47,027
- Oh, fine.
- "Fine," she says.

822
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:49,617
- What?

823
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:51,727
There's no "fine" with grandkids.

824
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,083
It's either the best day of your life
or sheer torture.

825
01:05:55,946 --> 01:05:58,248
- What do you do together?
- I don't know. We eat.

826
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:00,453
Huh! T hat's it?

827
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,563
Oh, do things she likes to do.

828
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:06,975
Read the fashion magazines, surf the Net,
watch the smut on the cable.

829
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:10,331
- I don't have cable.
- No cable?

830
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:13,400
And she wonders why she and the girl
aren't all buddy-buddy.

831
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:18,195
I don't need television to build
a relationship with my granddaughter.

832
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:20,880
You're new to this. Trust me.

833
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:22,990
It's all about surround sound.

834
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:30,374
I just needed
a little kiss to make me feel better...

835
01:06:31,142 --> 01:06:33,731
but now it wasn't working.

836
01:06:34,498 --> 01:06:35,937
- Maggie!
- Oh!

837
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,430
We're having Cosmopolitans.
Would you like one?

838
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:41,882
I wasn't getting
the same rush. Tonight, I needed more.

839
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,184
No, thanks.

840
01:06:44,664 --> 01:06:47,253
Meanwhile, uptown, Charlotte wondered
when relationships had gotten so complicated.

841
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:51,377
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

842
01:06:52,336 --> 01:06:54,254
- Ooh, whoops!

843
01:06:57,706 --> 01:06:59,144
Oh, my.

844
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:01,542
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.
I don't know what I want, but-

845
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:04,803
- I've seen this one.
- I can't.

846
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,967
- I want children and nice bedding and-
- It's funny.

847
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:11,899
That night, they made love
the Charlotte way-polite-

848
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:14,297
Oh, it was wonderful.

849
01:07:14,776 --> 01:07:16,215
- I thought so.
- Oh, you would.

850
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:18,229
- Now, walk up straight now.
- Thank you for everything.

851
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:20,147
- Good.
- Have a very wonderful day.

852
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:22,832
- Yes, and have a good sleep, and no sugar.
- Okay. And good night.

853
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:25,421
- Good night.
- Yeah.

854
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:27,915
Well-Yeah, okay.

855
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,504
Okay. Thank you. Good night.

856
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,218
What's up with Lewis?

857
01:07:51,794 --> 01:07:54,575
I don't know
what you're talking about.

858
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:57,644
I say go for it. Just jump him.

859
01:07:58,315 --> 01:07:59,849
Maggie!

860
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:02,247
Don't talk like that. Here.

861
01:08:04,932 --> 01:08:07,234
Half the fun of sex...
is talking about it.

862
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:10,111
Well, I guess I missed that half.

863
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:12,892
You never talked about sex?

864
01:08:13,563 --> 01:08:16,440
Occasionally with Ira.

865
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:18,742
Kind of.

866
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:21,427
Yeah, but what about girlfriends?

867
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:23,633
The first time you got laid.

868
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,647
You had to tell someone that.

869
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:28,907
It was my wedding night.
It was assumed.

870
01:08:29,483 --> 01:08:32,455
You missed out on one of the all-time
greatest conversations in life.

871
01:08:34,373 --> 01:08:35,908
Who'd you tell?

872
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:39,456
Rose.

873
01:08:39,936 --> 01:08:41,662
Well, maybe if I'd had a sister.

874
01:08:42,237 --> 01:08:44,155
Even when you were so small...

875
01:08:44,731 --> 01:08:46,649
you had a bond
that I'd never had with anyone.

876
01:08:48,183 --> 01:08:50,005
You still close like that?

877
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:53,458
Sure.

878
01:08:53,937 --> 01:08:56,047
- You don't talk about her.
- What do you want to hear?

879
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:00,938
We're totally fine. We're-We're tight.
We're thick as thieves.

880
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:04,198
Let's ask her down.
I'd like to know her too.

881
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:07,267
You know, I doubt she would come.

882
01:09:08,034 --> 01:09:10,336
She's, like, really busy.
She's a lawyer.

883
01:09:11,007 --> 01:09:12,254
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

884
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,076
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

885
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:17,720
What do you do
once they've all peed?

886
01:09:18,296 --> 01:09:20,789
mm. Give 'em a brush.
Take 'em all home.

887
01:09:21,556 --> 01:09:23,474
Make sure they have water to drink.

888
01:09:26,064 --> 01:09:28,749
- After that.
- Then I'm done.

889
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,736
- So what do you do?
- Whatever.

890
01:09:34,599 --> 01:09:38,339
- Shop for food, cook for my boyfriend.
- I know his name.

891
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:42,463
I know, but I've never really had a real,
live, grown-up boyfriend before...

892
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,627
and I'm gonna use the word
as often as I can.

893
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:48,408
All right, first of all,
he's not grown up.

894
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,518
None of them are.

895
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:54,546
You know, there's a consistency
to your cynicism which is truly beautiful.

896
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:57,231
Hmm. Just don't be surprised...

897
01:09:57,807 --> 01:10:00,204
if he turns out to be...
less than perfect.

898
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:02,794
And don't be surprised if he doesn't.

899
01:10:05,671 --> 01:10:07,205
- I gotta go.
- Good-bye.

900
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:09,123
- Have fun.
- I'll call you.

901
01:10:09,602 --> 01:10:10,561
All right.

902
01:10:11,425 --> 01:10:14,110
You sound too pretty,
Maggie, to be cleaning bedpans.

903
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,795
You're right. I am.

904
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:20,056
I have a grandson, a doctor over in Tampa.
I should introduce you.

905
01:10:20,823 --> 01:10:23,220
- You don't want to do that.
- Are you bad news?

906
01:10:23,796 --> 01:10:27,056
Well, you know,
I don't mean to be, but yeah.

907
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,605
Well, since you're not gonna
marry my grandson...

908
01:10:31,372 --> 01:10:33,098
you might as well read to me.

909
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:40,674
- I'm kind of a slow reader.
- Perfect.

910
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,359
I'm a slow listener.

911
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:56,114
"The... art... of...

912
01:10:58,895 --> 01:11:00,334
losing"-

913
01:11:02,252 --> 01:11:04,841
- You know, I should just get back to work.
- What is it, dyslexia?

914
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,430
- What are you, a teacher?
- Professor.

915
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,691
Retired.
Just take your time, Maggie.

916
01:11:11,554 --> 01:11:13,952
Listen to the words
as you're about to say them.

917
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:16,541
Nine times out of 10,
you'll hear a mistake coming...

918
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:19,034
and you'll correct it
before you make it.

919
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:22,583
Then again, you might make
a total ass of yourself.

920
01:11:38,982 --> 01:11:40,995
Oh, come on.

921
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:43,968
Poetry's supposed to be slow.

922
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,970
"The... art...

923
01:11:58,545 --> 01:12:00,847

disaster. "

956
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,366
Well, what do you think?

957
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:07,723
Good.

958
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,175
Unacceptable answer.
What's the poem about?

959
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:15,107
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. What's it about?

960
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:20,669
- Losing?
- What?

961
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:25,560
- Love?
- Ah.

962
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,862
And how about that?

963
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:31,602
Is the love lost already?

964
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:34,767
Is Bishop writing about it
as a possibility, a probability?

965
01:14:35,534 --> 01:14:36,972
What?

966
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,329
Well...

967
01:14:42,151 --> 01:14:44,069
in the beginning,
she's talking about...

968
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:48,193
losing real things, like keys.

969
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,467
And then she- she gets, like-

970
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,769
she lost a continent.

971
01:14:56,248 --> 01:14:58,550
- She's getting grandiose.
- Yeah.

972
01:14:59,221 --> 01:15:02,194
And the way she says it is like-
like it doesn't matter.

973
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,496
Ah.

974
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:07,181
Her tone-
would you call it detached?

975
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:11,880
I think she wants
to sound detached.

976
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:15,716
You know,
she wants to... sound...

977
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:18,114
like it doesn't matter...

978
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:20,607
'cause she knows, deep down...

979
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,196
how bad it's gonna feel to lose.

980
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:25,306
Lose what?

981
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:28,567
Or whom?

982
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,827
Is it a lover?

983
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:37,965
No.

984
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:44,678
It's a friend.

985
01:15:48,035 --> 01:15:49,569
A-plus.

986
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,309
Smart girl.

987
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,133
Oh, what a-a comfortable home.

988
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:18,339
It's very, uh, lived in.

989
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:20,353
Well, what can I get you?

990
01:16:20,832 --> 01:16:23,805
- I'll have a white wine, and he'll have the same.
- Oh, good.

991
01:16:24,573 --> 01:16:28,121
Why don't you just make yourself at home,
and I'll be right back.

992
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,518
- Hey, Dad!
- Hello, sweetie.

993
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:32,436
- Oh!
- Where's Maggie?

994
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:35,505
- Oh, not here.
- Oh, thank God. We don't need
her drama tonight.

995
01:16:36,272 --> 01:16:39,245
- Why isn't she here? Is something wrong?
- No, we just had a fight.

996
01:16:40,108 --> 01:16:42,890
- About what?
- Can we talk about this later?

997
01:16:43,753 --> 01:16:46,246
Yes. Bad enough she monopolizes
the evening when she's here.

998
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:48,931
Oh, let me see that ring.

999
01:16:51,425 --> 01:16:53,918
Oh, wow. Look at that.

1000
01:16:57,371 --> 01:17:00,248
Rose tells me you have a daughter
as well, Sydelle.

1001
01:17:01,015 --> 01:17:02,549
My Marcia? You'll meet her.

1002
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:05,714
You'll love her. Everyone does.
My Marcia's a decorator.

1003
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:07,632
Really?

1004
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:10,509
She's an absolute genius in her work.

1005
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,715
I'd like to say a few words.

1006
01:17:13,194 --> 01:17:16,071
Please. To Rose and Simon.

1007
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:18,756
We're all blessed to be a part
of your happiness.

1008
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:21,729
Your love bonds
notjust your two hearts...

1009
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,510
but the hearts of two families.

1010
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,716
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

1011
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,018
- Mazel tov!
- Thanks, Dad.

1012
01:17:29,497 --> 01:17:31,415
- That went okay.
- Yeah.

1013
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:33,621
Where's Maggie?

1014
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,922
Uh, it's hard to say.
She moves around a lot.

1015
01:17:36,498 --> 01:17:38,895
Well, I want to meet her eventually,
you know? She's your sister.

1016
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,772
- I want to know her.
- You will.

1017
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:44,170
What was the fight about?

1018
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:46,184
Mmm. Girl stuff.

1019
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:55,102
Oh, shit.

1020
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:58,363
Oh!

1021
01:17:58,843 --> 01:18:01,432
I should have used fresh vegetables
instead of frozen.

1022
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:03,925
I don't think so. They were great.

1023
01:18:04,405 --> 01:18:06,419
- Really delicious. They were good.
- Really?

1024
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,529
Yes.

1025
01:18:09,008 --> 01:18:11,981
- So, have you heard from Rose?
- No.

1026
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:14,858
- So she hasn't gotten back to you.
- About what?

1027
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:17,351
You were going
to invite her down, Maggie.

1028
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:19,461
I don't know
where you got that idea.

1029
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:22,338
Maggie,
I specifically asked you to.

1030
01:18:23,009 --> 01:18:25,982
So? Just because you specifically asked
doesn't mean I'm going to.

1031
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,339
You shouldn't smoke.
You have a family history of lung cancer.

1032
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:31,736
I have a family history
of car wrecks too.

1033
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:34,038
Does that mean I shouldn't drive?

1034
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:36,340
- That is not funny.
- It wasn't supposed to be.

1035
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:38,641
All right, what is the problem
between you and Rose?

1036
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:41,710
- Why don't you want her to visit?
- Why do you?

1037
01:18:42,477 --> 01:18:44,395
I mean,
am I not good enough for you?

1038
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,985
This has nothing to do with you.

1039
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,957
She's my daughter's daughter,
and I want to get to know her too.

1040
01:19:06,644 --> 01:19:08,179
What was Caroline like with you girls?

1041
01:19:08,754 --> 01:19:10,960
I mean, as a mom,
how do you remember her?

1042
01:19:11,631 --> 01:19:13,261
Why don't you ask Rose?

1043
01:19:13,741 --> 01:19:16,330
Maggie, please grow up.

1044
01:19:22,755 --> 01:19:24,290
She was special.

1045
01:19:24,673 --> 01:19:26,591
Different than the other moms.

1046
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:28,701
She used to surprise us.

1047
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,976
One time I opened up
my lunch box...

1048
01:19:35,414 --> 01:19:37,908
and there was a tiara inside.

1049
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:40,593
A tiara. With your sandwich?

1050
01:19:41,264 --> 01:19:42,703
Instead of a sandwich.

1051
01:19:44,812 --> 01:19:46,730
What was she like as a daughter?

1052
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:49,895
No tiaras.

1053
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:55,170
But I loved her so much.

1054
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:01,883
But loving her in the right way
was difficult, for me, anyway.

1055
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:04,760
I didn't know there was
a right way and a wrong way.

1056
01:20:05,431 --> 01:20:06,965
Neither did I.

1057
01:20:08,404 --> 01:20:10,418
I had ideas-

1058
01:20:11,089 --> 01:20:14,062
I had unwelcomed ideas
about how to keep her safe.

1059
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:16,651
Like?

1060
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:19,624
Like, I thought she should have been
on her medication all the time.

1061
01:20:20,391 --> 01:20:22,118
I thought that her relationship
with your father...

1062
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,515
was far too passionate
for her to handle.

1063
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:26,529
And as far as children
were concerned...

1064
01:20:27,009 --> 01:20:29,406
she was in no condition,
no condition at all.

1065
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:32,379
So you wish she never had me.

1066
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:37,078
You know what I wish, Maggie?

1067
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,394
I wish I'd kept my big mouth
shut long enough...

1068
01:20:42,065 --> 01:20:43,887
to hear what she wanted
out of life.

1069
01:20:53,093 --> 01:20:55,587
There she is! There's the bride!

1070
01:20:57,888 --> 01:20:59,135
Be strong.

1071
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:04,410
Stay right here.
I'll get your corsage.

1072
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:07,478
Corsage? What is this, a prom?

1073
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:09,780
- Ladies?
- Ah, thank you.

1074
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:15,055
- Who are these people?
- I have no idea.

1075
01:21:15,822 --> 01:21:18,507
- Except for my Marcia.
- Hello!

1076
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:21,480
Hey, you're not sticking around...

1077
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:25,028
to watch me ooh and ahh
over a Mixmaster Deluxe?

1078
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:27,809
It's good of you
to let Sydelle do this.

1079
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:31,166
- Oh, like gale force winds could stop her.
- Go easy on her.

1080
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:34,426
- Marcia's giving her a very hard time these days.
- Oh, what's she doing?

1081
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:37,016
Decorating in last year's colors?

1082
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:39,605
She joined Jews forJesus.

1083
01:21:44,592 --> 01:21:46,318
Yoo-hoo! Ladies, it's time...

1084
01:21:46,798 --> 01:21:49,771
for the entertainment portion
of our soiree.

1085
01:21:50,634 --> 01:21:53,223
Uh, everyone get where you can see.
Anita, Jackie, come on.

1086
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:56,196
Scoot.
Here we go.

1087
01:21:56,771 --> 01:21:58,306
Aw!

1088
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,895
We, who know Rose,
are so thrilled...

1089
01:22:01,566 --> 01:22:04,251
that this day has finally arrived.

1090
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:07,704
- Aw.
- There was a time we had our doubts.

1091
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:11,828
Oh, my goodness.

1092
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:15,376
All that time spent with her nose
buried in her book.

1093
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:17,965
- Oh, bookworm.

1094
01:22:18,445 --> 01:22:22,760
Of course, there were romances,
but for some reason or other, nothing stuck.

1095
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:26,500
- Oh!
- A little heavy.

1096
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:31,295
- Oh. One thing Rose always
had was a great appetite.

1097
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:33,981
For life!

1098
01:22:42,803 --> 01:22:44,242
Oh, God!

1099
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:47,023
Why would anyone want to marry me?
I'm disgusting!

1100
01:22:47,694 --> 01:22:50,475
The only disgusting person here
is your stepmother. She's hideous.

1101
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:53,832
So why is she giving me this party?
She hates me.

1102
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:56,421
Someone else should do it-
someone who I-loves me...

1103
01:22:57,093 --> 01:22:58,819
someone who can look at me
and say...

1104
01:22:59,298 --> 01:23:01,792
"All of this is nothing more
than the happiness you deserve. "

1105
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:04,093
Young lady.

1106
01:23:04,573 --> 01:23:06,587
Rose Feller,
don't you dare walk out on-

1107
01:23:07,258 --> 01:23:09,464
- I am talking to my friend!

1108
01:23:10,135 --> 01:23:12,628
She's crazy. She's crazy!
She's sick in the head!

1109
01:23:22,506 --> 01:23:25,575
Hands down,
best shower I've ever been to.

1110
01:23:33,151 --> 01:23:35,069
Engagement should be
a happy time, Rosie.

1111
01:23:35,549 --> 01:23:38,138
So should childhood and graduation.

1112
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:40,439
And happy hour.

1113
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:43,700
Did you know more suicides happen during
happy hour than any other time of day?

1114
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:46,577
- Is that true?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

1115
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:51,564
I love you, you know.

1116
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,593
- Who's Rose?
- There's this thing called privacy, Dora.

1117
01:24:14,772 --> 01:24:18,032
This from a girl who puts a postage stamp
on her bottom and calls it a swimsuit.

1118
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:34,081
The number
you have called is no longer in service.

1119
01:25:34,753 --> 01:25:36,862
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error-

1120
01:25:45,685 --> 01:25:47,699
Hmm.

1121
01:25:54,604 --> 01:25:56,042
Hey.

1122
01:25:59,207 --> 01:26:00,837
Are you dead?

1123
01:26:01,413 --> 01:26:03,235
What were you thinking,
going to the mall?

1124
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,728
The mall is for young people,
people with teeth.

1125
01:26:06,304 --> 01:26:08,605
Well, my son's finally getting married,
and the girl's a ninny.

1126
01:26:09,181 --> 01:26:12,346
"Shut up, Ma," he says.
"Just show up in something nice. "

1127
01:26:13,305 --> 01:26:14,839
- You know what I saw today?
- What?

1128
01:26:15,318 --> 01:26:19,250
Pants with "Juicy" written across the heinie.
I'm gonna wear that?

1129
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:22,223
Just wear something
you're comfortable in.

1130
01:26:22,895 --> 01:26:25,292
I haven't been comfortable
since the Dodgers left Brooklyn.

1131
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:29,224
What's your favorite thing
you ever wore?

1132
01:26:29,799 --> 01:26:31,909
- Ever?
- Yeah. In your whole life.

1133
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:35,553
My going-away suit
from my wedding.

1134
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:38,622
Black and white checks,
very fitted.

1135
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,307
I felt likeJackie Kennedy in that suit.

1136
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,130
Give me your credit card.
Give it to me.

1137
01:26:55,405 --> 01:26:56,939
Can I get you a size?

1138
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:03,652
No, I'm going to
the women's suit department.

1139
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:16,982
So?

1140
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,257
-Jackie Kennedy?
- Better. Jackie Onassis.

1141
01:27:26,381 --> 01:27:27,915
That looks so good on you.

1142
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,984
Oh, Maggie, you're so sweet.
Good job!

1143
01:27:38,272 --> 01:27:39,615
You ready?

1144
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:41,916
I don't know what to wear
to a Main Line wedding.

1145
01:27:42,492 --> 01:27:44,218
It doesn't matter.
Wear whatever you want.

1146
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:46,999
- Believe me, when the bride's
name is Lopey, it matters.
- Look, th-that looks great.

1147
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,109
- Come on.
- Really?

1148
01:27:49,588 --> 01:27:52,178
- Yeah. Come on. We gotta go.
- Okay.

1149
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:54,767
I can't believe you have
a friend named Lopey.

1150
01:27:55,342 --> 01:27:57,260
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm sorry. Wait.

1151
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:05,124
Are you okay? 'Cause if there's gonna be
any stabbing, I need a little heads up.

1152
01:28:05,796 --> 01:28:08,001
I'm fine.

1153
01:28:12,604 --> 01:28:14,331
Oh, my God.

1154
01:28:14,714 --> 01:28:17,016
Oh, shit. MyJimmy Choos!

1155
01:28:20,277 --> 01:28:22,290
Chewing gum?

1156
01:28:22,866 --> 01:28:24,400
Oh, that bitch. That bitch!

1157
01:28:24,976 --> 01:28:27,277
- No one will notice.
- Right. No one's gonna notice that.

1158
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:31,305
"Hi. Hi. Hi! Hi. I can talk, 'cause I
have a mouth. " My heel has a mouth!

1159
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:33,511
No one will notice.

1160
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:36,771
Oh, my God!
What happened to your heel?

1161
01:28:42,429 --> 01:28:45,690
Uh, best wishes, Lopey, Jordan.

1162
01:28:46,553 --> 01:28:48,088
Thanks, Simon.

1163
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:52,595
"Let the wind die down.

1164
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:56,719
"Let the... shed go black inside.

1165
01:28:57,678 --> 01:29:00,075
"Let evening come.

1166
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:04,007
"To the bottle in the ditch...

1167
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:07,555
"to the scoop... in the oats...

1168
01:29:09,665 --> 01:29:13,118
"to... air in the lung...

1169
01:29:16,186 --> 01:29:18,488
let evening come. "

1170
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:28,845
- [Jim ] Can I take that for you?

1171
01:29:29,517 --> 01:29:32,681
I hear you're getting married.
Congratulations.

1172
01:29:35,942 --> 01:29:37,668
Congratulations are for the groom.

1173
01:29:38,243 --> 01:29:39,778
You say "best wishes" to the bride.

1174
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:42,367
I guess my manners aren't
what they should be.

1175
01:29:43,038 --> 01:29:45,628
Gee, really?

1176
01:29:46,395 --> 01:29:48,313
Rose, I am really sorry.

1177
01:29:48,888 --> 01:29:51,382
I've felt horrible about myself
for two solid months.

1178
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,779
I've felt horrible
about myself my whole life...

1179
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:55,793
so you'll get no sympathy from me.

1180
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:05,000
You know what they called me
growing up?

1181
01:30:05,959 --> 01:30:08,356
Fudgie the Whale.

1182
01:30:09,027 --> 01:30:10,945
I'm still shocked
when a woman wants me...

1183
01:30:11,425 --> 01:30:14,781
and sometimes I do really stupid things
because I can't believe I can.

1184
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,042
- That thing with your sister-
- Was inexcusable.

1185
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:22,166
No matter what you weighed
in high school.

1186
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:24,755
You ruined everything.

1187
01:30:26,673 --> 01:30:28,591
I know.

1188
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:31,085
What we had... was really special.

1189
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:36,455
Oh, please! What we-

1190
01:30:40,387 --> 01:30:45,470
Because of you,
I have no idea where my sister is.

1191
01:30:46,812 --> 01:30:47,579
I can't reach her.
Her phone's cut off.

1192
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:50,265
She doesn't even know I'm engaged.
My own sister.

1193
01:30:51,032 --> 01:30:53,429
My best friend.

1194
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:56,882
And the worst part is,
I can't talk to anyone about it.

1195
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:00,046
If I tell my father, he'll get
all panicked and mad at me...

1196
01:31:00,718 --> 01:31:02,540
for not taking better care of her.

1197
01:31:03,115 --> 01:31:06,664
And if I tell Simon-
I can't tell Simon.

1198
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,349
Why not?

1199
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:11,363
Because...

1200
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:15,007
he'll hate her.

1201
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,843
And that, I couldn't bear.

1202
01:31:30,926 --> 01:31:32,269
Hi, Jim.

1203
01:31:34,283 --> 01:31:37,256
Here I am, trying to be patient,
trying to be understanding...

1204
01:31:38,023 --> 01:31:39,557
while you lose your freaking mind.

1205
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:42,818
- I'm not losing my mind.
- Ping-ponging between
comatose and homicidal.

1206
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:46,942
God, every day I wake up thinking,
"Maybe today's the day she'll come back.

1207
01:31:47,709 --> 01:31:50,010
- I'm right here.
- "Maybe today she'll look at me like she used to.

1208
01:31:50,778 --> 01:31:53,846
She'll- She'll look at me in the eye,
tell me what she's thinking. "

1209
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,148
- Simon?
- But no, no, no.

1210
01:31:56,628 --> 01:31:58,450
Today's the day
you look him in the eye...

1211
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:00,560
tell him what you're thinking.

1212
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:04,779
The guy who treated you
like a- like a disposable washrag.

1213
01:32:29,617 --> 01:32:32,111
This has nothing to do with him.

1214
01:32:32,878 --> 01:32:34,508
This is about you and me-

1215
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:39,207
you not talking to me, you not
telling me what's going on inside you.

1216
01:32:41,988 --> 01:32:43,619
Tell me.

1217
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:52,633
I won't marry you like this.

1218
01:32:54,935 --> 01:32:56,373
I won't do it.

1219
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:15,649
So this lady today, she, um- she heard
about how I shopped for Mrs. Lefkowitz...

1220
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:18,431
and she asked
if I'd do the same for her.

1221
01:33:19,006 --> 01:33:20,540
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

1222
01:33:22,362 --> 01:33:24,089
- Said she'd pay.
- Well, she'd better.

1223
01:33:31,281 --> 01:33:34,254
- Do you think there's other women
down here who would?
- Are you kidding? Scads.

1224
01:33:37,515 --> 01:33:40,775
I was thinking of doing it
maybe like... a business.

1225
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:47,009
Well, that's an excellent idea.

1226
01:33:50,653 --> 01:33:53,530
Um, I'm really terrible at numbers.

1227
01:33:54,393 --> 01:33:56,119
I mean, adding and stuff.

1228
01:33:59,476 --> 01:34:01,106
Well, I'm good with them.
I can help.

1229
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,477
I mean, if you like.

1230
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,272
Yeah. Sure.

1231
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:19,040
That'd be good.

1232
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,012
Gin.

1233
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:52,125
- Oh, no.
- Dad?

1234
01:34:53,755 --> 01:34:55,290
- Dad?
- You are not welcome here!

1235
01:34:55,769 --> 01:34:57,879
- Rose? You all right?
- Are you kidding?

1236
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:01,236
I'm fantastic. Turns out I have
a grandmother I never knew about.

1237
01:35:02,003 --> 01:35:03,633
It was in your own best interest.
Your father thought-

1238
01:35:04,209 --> 01:35:06,894
Why are you speaking? You do not
have any place in this conversation.

1239
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:11,209
- Excuse me, miss. This is my house.
- Sydelle. Please.

1240
01:35:19,169 --> 01:35:20,608
How did she find you?

1241
01:35:22,142 --> 01:35:24,252
How did she lose me?

1242
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:28,567
She said she sent birthday cards.

1243
01:35:29,143 --> 01:35:30,965
Please tell me you never got 'em.

1244
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:36,047
Our mother was dead,
our father was practically catatonic.

1245
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,979
- A grandmother might have come in handy.
- She was impossible, Rose.

1246
01:35:40,938 --> 01:35:44,583
Bossy, self-righteous, nosy about things
that weren't her business.

1247
01:35:45,542 --> 01:35:47,843
- Like what?
- Trust me. We were better off without her.

1248
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,049
Because she was bossy?
That doesn't make any sense.

1249
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,542
I didn't want to be around that,
and I didn't want you around it.

1250
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:54,556
- What?
- The judgment. The blame.

1251
01:35:55,036 --> 01:35:57,337
- For what? What-What'd she blame you for?
- Everything.

1252
01:35:58,009 --> 01:35:59,735
- What everything?
-Just everything.

1253
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:02,420
- Dad!
- For your mother, all right?

1254
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,530
For her death.

1255
01:36:08,845 --> 01:36:10,859
- She said that?
- She didn't have to.

1256
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:17,381
She wanted her protected
all the time. Drugged.

1257
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,737
But Caroline-
she didn't want to live that way.

1258
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:23,230
It made her foggy.

1259
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:25,916
She couldn't take it
if she was pregnant.

1260
01:36:26,491 --> 01:36:29,368
So... we hoped it would be enough-

1261
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:33,108
loving each other,
loving you and Maggie.

1262
01:36:35,697 --> 01:36:37,711
There were so many good days.

1263
01:36:39,438 --> 01:36:41,739
We thought it would be okay.

1264
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,424
Oh, God.

1265
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:46,630
I'm sorry, Rosie.

1266
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:49,795
I'm so sorry.

1267
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:53,055
Now, um...

1268
01:36:53,823 --> 01:36:56,700
the only opening on Thursday
she has is 5:00.

1269
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,001
- P.M.
- Yes.

1270
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:01,591
- That's right in the middle of dinner.
- Well, take it or leave it.

1271
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:04,468
- I'll take it if she won't.
- I'll take it. I'll take it.

1272
01:37:05,235 --> 01:37:06,386
- "Mrs. Stempel. "
- Ella.

1273
01:37:06,769 --> 01:37:09,742
Lewis! Are you looking
for a personal shopper too?

1274
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:12,715
No. A date, to the Tea Dance.

1275
01:37:13,386 --> 01:37:15,496
And I'd be honored
if you'd go with me.

1276
01:37:18,661 --> 01:37:21,634
- I'd love to.
- Pick you up at 4:00.

1277
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,730
- Lewis Feldman.
- Ooh.

1278
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:40,718
This place just keeps
getting better and better.

1279
01:38:03,734 --> 01:38:05,268
What are you doing here?

1280
01:38:08,913 --> 01:38:10,447
I live here.
What are you doing here?

1281
01:38:10,926 --> 01:38:13,036
You live here?
In an old folks home?

1282
01:38:15,242 --> 01:38:17,352
It's a retirement community
for active seniors.

1283
01:38:17,927 --> 01:38:20,516
Wait, so you-
you live with our grandmother?

1284
01:38:23,969 --> 01:38:25,887
How'd you find out about her?

1285
01:38:26,558 --> 01:38:29,627
I can't believe she wrote you
without telling me.

1286
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,655
It's so sneaky.

1287
01:38:35,381 --> 01:38:37,683
Does it offend
your strict moral code?

1288
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:43,341
So, how's it going for you down here?

1289
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,505
Who's buying your cocktails?

1290
01:38:47,273 --> 01:38:48,807
No one.

1291
01:38:49,287 --> 01:38:51,205
Oh, no.
Is your mojo failing you already?

1292
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,314
My mojo's fine.

1293
01:38:53,698 --> 01:38:55,808
I just haven't felt like drinking.

1294
01:38:56,383 --> 01:38:58,877
Right. Probably haven't
felt like stealing...

1295
01:38:59,644 --> 01:39:02,521
or lying or having sex
with inappropriate partners either.

1296
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:08,179
- Did you come down here just to abuse me?

1297
01:39:09,138 --> 01:39:11,152
Maggie! I hope you are prepared
to be exceedingly rich...

1298
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:13,166
because I booked you within an-

1299
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,098
Rose. Oh.

1300
01:39:20,838 --> 01:39:22,372
Oh, Rose.

1301
01:39:22,852 --> 01:39:24,386
Look at you.

1302
01:39:24,961 --> 01:39:26,784
Oh, look how lovely you are. Oh.

1303
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,825
Oh. Do you remember me?

1304
01:39:35,127 --> 01:39:36,565
Yeah.

1305
01:39:37,045 --> 01:39:38,579
I remember you too.

1306
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:40,593
You-You're exactly the same.

1307
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:42,991
Smiley and huggable and-

1308
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:46,251
- Ooh, and engaged?
- What?

1309
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,169
Oh, yeah.

1310
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,526
- Holy shit. To who?
- No one you know.

1311
01:39:52,389 --> 01:39:53,923
Champagne. Now, come with me.

1312
01:39:54,403 --> 01:39:56,513
Tell me all about it.

1313
01:40:00,157 --> 01:40:02,842
I can't believe you're marrying
somebody I haven't even met.

1314
01:40:08,213 --> 01:40:09,747
What's he like anyhow?

1315
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,309
Why? You want to screw him too?

1316
01:40:20,008 --> 01:40:22,214
I don't expect you to forgive me, Rose...

1317
01:40:26,817 --> 01:40:28,352
but I am sorry.

1318
01:40:37,846 --> 01:40:39,764
- Careful, Mrs. Haskell.
- I'm always careful!

1319
01:40:40,339 --> 01:40:43,024
She hit somebody last week.
It was a big to-do.

1320
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:46,669
And there's a store where you can buy
eight different kinds of hemorrhoid creams.

1321
01:40:47,532 --> 01:40:49,258
All right.
Here come the Queen Bees.

1322
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:52,518
Widows. They run the place.
Oh, watch out.

1323
01:40:53,286 --> 01:40:55,300
- Hello, ladies! This is my sister.
- Maggie.

1324
01:40:55,971 --> 01:40:57,409
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1325
01:40:57,889 --> 01:40:59,327
Yep. Have a good day.

1326
01:41:01,341 --> 01:41:03,355
This is the exercise pavilion.
Hey, guys!

1327
01:41:04,026 --> 01:41:05,561
- Hi, Maggie.
- This is my sister, Rose.

1328
01:41:05,944 --> 01:41:07,767
Hello, Rose!

1329
01:41:08,342 --> 01:41:10,835
Good, Lydia. A good stretch.
That's it. And left.

1330
01:41:11,507 --> 01:41:12,945
Looking good, Mrs. Klein.

1331
01:41:13,425 --> 01:41:14,863
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, ladies.

1332
01:41:15,343 --> 01:41:17,165
Hi!

1333
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,042
I call these guys The Bench.
They're all former lawyers.

1334
01:41:20,617 --> 01:41:23,398
- Gentlemen! Hey.
- Hi, Maggie.

1335
01:41:24,261 --> 01:41:26,659
This is my sister, Rose.
She's a lawyer, too, from Philadelphia.

1336
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:29,632
- Which firm?
- Uh, actually, no firm right now.

1337
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:33,084
I'm just... taking some time off.

1338
01:41:33,756 --> 01:41:35,674
- Me too.

1339
01:41:43,058 --> 01:41:45,360
- What are you doing, Ella?
- Sit down, girls.

1340
01:41:46,127 --> 01:41:49,675
I've got some things here
I thought you might like to see.

1341
01:41:50,634 --> 01:41:52,840
- Whoa.
- Oh, God.

1342
01:41:53,511 --> 01:41:54,950
- Look at you.

1343
01:41:55,429 --> 01:41:57,347
- These are great.
- Hey, look. Our old living room.

1344
01:41:57,922 --> 01:41:59,553
Mm-hmm.

1345
01:42:00,128 --> 01:42:01,471
Oh, God.

1346
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:04,444
Could Mom have been any prettier?

1347
01:42:05,115 --> 01:42:07,129
Oh, you look exactly like her.
Doesn't she?

1348
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,485
- I wonder if there's a picture of Honey Bun.
- That'd be pretty impossible.

1349
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:12,403
- Who's Honey Bun?
- Our dog.

1350
01:42:12,787 --> 01:42:14,130
- You had a dog?
- For one day.

1351
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:16,719
The greatest day.

1352
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:19,500
Mom woke us up really early.
It was a school day. It was still dark out.

1353
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:21,610
It was winter.

1354
01:42:22,089 --> 01:42:25,062
And she put us in our best party dresses and
dragged us down to the kitchen, which was-

1355
01:42:25,925 --> 01:42:27,843
- A mess.
- Covered, every counter, in fudge.

1356
01:42:28,419 --> 01:42:29,761
She'd been up all night making it.

1357
01:42:30,241 --> 01:42:33,022
We loaded it into the car,
and she drove us right past school...

1358
01:42:33,789 --> 01:42:35,324
straight up to New York,
to Lord & Taylor.

1359
01:42:35,803 --> 01:42:37,625
Which was closed, because we got there
at 8:00 in the morning.

1360
01:42:38,296 --> 01:42:40,598
- That's right, and we hung out in the car.
- Eating fudge for breakfast.

1361
01:42:41,269 --> 01:42:43,571
Mom had heard about Mrs. Fields.
You know, the cookie lady?

1362
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:46,736
And she figured that her fudge
was just as good as those cookies, so-

1363
01:42:47,503 --> 01:42:49,037
So she was gonna make a fortune.

1364
01:42:49,421 --> 01:42:53,161
When it finally opened, we went in
and, oh, God, she was so beautiful.

1365
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:56,901
- She was wearing this long, velvety gown.
- At 8:00 in the morning?

1366
01:42:57,668 --> 01:42:59,682
Well, by this time it was 10:00.

1367
01:43:00,354 --> 01:43:02,751
I guess she talked to some of the store people
about the fudge, but I don't remember.

1368
01:43:03,422 --> 01:43:05,532
Mmm, she spilled it,
all over the jewelry counter.

1369
01:43:06,203 --> 01:43:09,656
- There was a guy who just kind of looked at her.
- I don't remember a guy.

1370
01:43:10,615 --> 01:43:12,821
There was a guy,
and he looked at her.

1371
01:43:15,026 --> 01:43:17,807
Anyway, Mom said that we could
each get one present.

1372
01:43:18,671 --> 01:43:20,589
- And you got-
- A Nancy Drew book.

1373
01:43:21,164 --> 01:43:23,753
I asked for a puppy. And she got it!

1374
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:27,302
He was so cute.
I named him Honey Bun.

1375
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:30,466
Why'd you only have it for one day?

1376
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,343
- I guess Dad thought it was a bad idea.
- Why?

1377
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:36,412
I don't know. I think he thought
I was too young.

1378
01:43:37,179 --> 01:43:38,810
No. He was just mad.

1379
01:43:39,289 --> 01:43:42,837
- About a dog?
- No, about the whole day.

1380
01:43:43,892 --> 01:43:47,057
He didn't have any idea where we were,
and school had called.

1381
01:43:47,824 --> 01:43:49,934
- Oh.
- Really?

1382
01:43:50,605 --> 01:43:53,674
Yeah. He was really panicked
and really, really mad at her.

1383
01:43:54,537 --> 01:43:55,976
They had a huge fight.

1384
01:43:56,455 --> 01:43:58,757
I don't remember a fight.

1385
01:43:59,428 --> 01:44:01,730
You were in your room
with a record playing.

1386
01:44:02,401 --> 01:44:03,935
- I was?
- Yeah.

1387
01:44:04,511 --> 01:44:07,771
I put you in there and turned the music on
so you wouldn't hear them.

1388
01:44:08,635 --> 01:44:11,416
Why?
What were they saying?

1389
01:44:15,731 --> 01:44:17,266
He was saying...

1390
01:44:18,896 --> 01:44:20,718
she was unfit.

1391
01:44:21,293 --> 01:44:23,691
That's the word he used.

1392
01:44:24,362 --> 01:44:27,623
He said he was gonna... send her away.
Put her away. Something.

1393
01:44:28,582 --> 01:44:31,267
- He kept saying "away. "
- Mmm. And her?

1394
01:44:32,034 --> 01:44:34,048
"Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.
I'm a good mother. "

1395
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,117
He'd say,"away,"
and she'd say,"I'm their mother!"

1396
01:44:37,788 --> 01:44:40,186
So he was-he was gonna
have her hospitalized.

1397
01:44:42,967 --> 01:44:44,501
Yeah.

1398
01:44:52,557 --> 01:44:53,995
Oh, God. The poor guy.

1399
01:44:57,352 --> 01:44:58,790
When exactly was this?

1400
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:00,804
November 3.

1401
01:45:03,585 --> 01:45:05,887
No. No, it wasn't.
It was, like, months before that.

1402
01:45:06,558 --> 01:45:07,997
It was two days.

1403
01:45:08,476 --> 01:45:11,066
It was Tuesday,
and she died that Thursday.

1404
01:45:21,711 --> 01:45:23,533
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

1405
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:28,520
The car, the tree.

1406
01:45:34,274 --> 01:45:36,096
Was it even raining that night?

1407
01:45:40,028 --> 01:45:41,466
You were so little.

1408
01:45:43,864 --> 01:45:47,220
How do you tell a six-year-old
her mom left by choice?

1409
01:45:54,317 --> 01:45:55,851
Who told you?

1410
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:01,797
No one.

1411
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:13,593
- Oh, God. Why can't I just stay mad at you?

1412
01:46:14,456 --> 01:46:17,237
'Cause we're a pair,
like Sonny and Cher.

1413
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:19,634
They split up.

1414
01:46:20,114 --> 01:46:22,415
- But they remained quite close.

1415
01:46:33,636 --> 01:46:35,362
I'm not engaged anymore.

1416
01:46:39,582 --> 01:46:41,020
Simon dumped me.

1417
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:49,555
Why are you still wearing the ring?

1418
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:53,871
I like how it feels.

1419
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:00,871
- Do you know his name?
- Simon Stein.

1420
01:47:01,735 --> 01:47:03,173
- Doctor?
- Lawyer.

1421
01:47:03,653 --> 01:47:05,667
- Oh. Nice.
- So you call information-

1422
01:47:06,146 --> 01:47:09,407
"Simon Stein in Philly"-
Get his number, make a call.

1423
01:47:10,366 --> 01:47:11,804
And say what?

1424
01:47:12,284 --> 01:47:14,393
"Hey, jerk, you broke my sister's heart.
Come down here and make it right. "

1425
01:47:15,065 --> 01:47:16,503
Maybe not that, word-for-word.

1426
01:47:16,983 --> 01:47:19,860
- He broke up with her.
He's not gonna want to come.
- Well, you don't know that.

1427
01:47:20,531 --> 01:47:22,065
Men can be very confused.

1428
01:47:22,641 --> 01:47:25,806
Yeah, too many options-
be an astronaut, be a playboy.

1429
01:47:26,669 --> 01:47:28,874
Often a man needs help
making the right choice.

1430
01:47:29,546 --> 01:47:32,039
Yeah, how am I supposed to help him?
He doesn't even know me.

1431
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:34,245
He knows your sister.

1432
01:47:34,724 --> 01:47:36,834
And loves her, or he wouldn't have
proposed in the first place.

1433
01:47:37,505 --> 01:47:41,533
- So?
- So, what if he learns she was in trouble?

1434
01:47:42,588 --> 01:47:44,123
Or sick.

1435
01:47:44,698 --> 01:47:46,136
Or pregnant.

1436
01:47:47,575 --> 01:47:49,013
Dora!

1437
01:47:49,493 --> 01:47:51,699
Don't look so shocked,
Miss Comes-To-Florida-

1438
01:47:52,178 --> 01:47:54,096
To-Milk-Your-Grandmother-
For-All-She's-Worth.

1439
01:47:54,767 --> 01:47:56,685
We know all about you.

1440
01:48:05,029 --> 01:48:07,426
- So, dog walking.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

1441
01:48:08,194 --> 01:48:11,550
It's not forever. It's just to keep me busy
till I figure out my next move.

1442
01:48:12,509 --> 01:48:14,811
Well, when you figure it out,
I hope you'll let me know.

1443
01:48:15,482 --> 01:48:18,263
You know, down here, if you don't have
successful grandchildren to brag about...

1444
01:48:19,126 --> 01:48:20,661
you're screwed.

1445
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:21,620
What are we reading today?
A little Emily Dick? A little-

1446
01:48:21,715 --> 01:48:23,538
What are we reading today?
A little Emily Dick? A little-

1447
01:48:45,691 --> 01:48:47,225
Did they move him?

1448
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:51,828
He died.

1449
01:48:52,308 --> 01:48:53,746
This morning.

1450
01:49:01,514 --> 01:49:02,953
Bummer.

1451
01:49:05,638 --> 01:49:08,323
- Were you on duty?
- No, I-I don't work here.

1452
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:10,529
This is his chart.

1453
01:49:11,008 --> 01:49:13,598
You're his grandson, the doctor.

1454
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:17,338
Who are you?

1455
01:49:19,927 --> 01:49:22,996
Um, nobody.
I-I just- I read to him sometimes.

1456
01:49:26,736 --> 01:49:28,270
You're Maggie.

1457
01:49:30,955 --> 01:49:32,490
He talked about me?

1458
01:49:35,271 --> 01:49:36,805
Just a little.

1459
01:50:12,097 --> 01:50:13,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

1460
01:50:14,015 --> 01:50:15,549
Who's Fred Astaire?

1461
01:50:19,002 --> 01:50:20,632
That's Lewis.

1462
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:25,043
You're a very good dancer, Lewis.

1463
01:50:26,769 --> 01:50:28,783
Know what else I'm good at?

1464
01:50:42,209 --> 01:50:43,744
Simon.

1465
01:50:44,223 --> 01:50:45,949
What are you doing here?

1466
01:50:46,525 --> 01:50:48,347
I came as soon as your sister called.

1467
01:50:54,868 --> 01:50:56,403
Should you be drinking?

1468
01:51:12,034 --> 01:51:13,569
- So you're not pregnant.
- No.

1469
01:51:14,048 --> 01:51:16,350
- Never were.
- Don't you think I would tell you
if I were pregnant?

1470
01:51:16,925 --> 01:51:18,939
I don't know.
You know, I hope so, but, frankly...

1471
01:51:19,419 --> 01:51:21,816
there were a lot of things
you weren't telling me back there.

1472
01:51:26,036 --> 01:51:29,680
I promise, anything I kept from you
had nothing to do with us.

1473
01:51:30,735 --> 01:51:32,845
It was about Maggie.

1474
01:51:33,516 --> 01:51:36,489
I was protecting her
because that's what I do.

1475
01:51:37,256 --> 01:51:41,092
You need to know this, because
if by some insane stroke of fate...

1476
01:51:42,147 --> 01:51:43,777
you do decide to marry me...

1477
01:51:44,257 --> 01:51:46,558
she will make your life a living hell.

1478
01:51:47,326 --> 01:51:48,860
You'll be begging me
to kick her out...

1479
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:50,970
commit her, kill her, anything.

1480
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:52,888
And I'll want to...

1481
01:51:53,367 --> 01:51:54,902
but I never will.

1482
01:51:57,203 --> 01:51:59,601
Because without her...

1483
01:52:00,368 --> 01:52:01,903
I don't make sense.

1484
01:52:06,985 --> 01:52:09,958
You look good.
You look like you.

1485
01:52:20,987 --> 01:52:23,384
- I can't believe I'm in Florida.

1486
01:52:27,124 --> 01:52:28,563
- You'll come back?
- Yes, I promise.

1487
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:30,481
- Now, you hold her to it.
- I will.

1488
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,166
Okay, don't buy a wedding dress.
It's gonna be my gift to you.

1489
01:52:33,837 --> 01:52:35,564
No way.

1490
01:52:36,139 --> 01:52:38,920
You'll have me in some
hootchie-mama monstrosity.

1491
01:52:39,687 --> 01:52:42,277
Look, I'm good at this. Trust me.

1492
01:52:49,373 --> 01:52:51,387
Are you sure this is the right place?

1493
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:54,552
Only oneJerk Hut
in Philadelphia, ma'am.

1494
01:53:09,896 --> 01:53:11,334
Michael.

1495
01:53:11,814 --> 01:53:13,061
Ella.

1496
01:53:15,938 --> 01:53:17,568
This is my friend, Lewis Feldman.

1497
01:53:18,047 --> 01:53:21,020
- Lewis, this is Michael Feller, father of the bride.
- Pleased to meet you.

1498
01:53:21,883 --> 01:53:24,185
Welcome. Rose will be
so glad you're here.

1499
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,295
Ella!

1500
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:30,419
- Oh.

1501
01:53:30,802 --> 01:53:32,241
I'm so glad you're here.

1502
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,159
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1503
01:53:34,638 --> 01:53:35,885
Yes? Perfect.

1504
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:38,570
She gets really mad
if you leave the lid off the ice cream.

1505
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:40,680
I know.

1506
01:53:41,063 --> 01:53:43,173
- Don't even think about using her toothbrush.
- Mm-hmm.

1507
01:53:43,845 --> 01:53:45,667
- And she hates the look of raw chicken.
- I know.

1508
01:53:46,242 --> 01:53:47,968
And if she starts humming
"Hava Nagila"...

1509
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,462
she's, like, really, really mad-
like, mad.

1510
01:53:51,037 --> 01:53:53,722
Mag- Maggie, I know. I know her.

1511
01:53:57,366 --> 01:53:59,189
- Okay.
- Okay.

1512
01:53:59,668 --> 01:54:01,107
Mm-hmm.

1513
01:54:01,586 --> 01:54:03,504
I wore them in 1952.

1514
01:54:06,669 --> 01:54:08,395
- Old.
- But not to you.

1515
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:11,368
- Right.
- And if I didn't give them to you?

1516
01:54:12,039 --> 01:54:14,437
- Borrowed.
- Mm-hmm. And look at the flowers.

1517
01:54:15,204 --> 01:54:16,834
- Blue.
- Yeah.

1518
01:54:18,656 --> 01:54:20,478
So, uh, Simon-

1519
01:54:23,835 --> 01:54:25,849
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1520
01:54:36,494 --> 01:54:38,412
They are so lovely.

1521
01:54:38,987 --> 01:54:41,385
You should be very proud.

1522
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:45,988
I'm afraid I can't take much credit.

1523
01:54:48,577 --> 01:54:50,687
Well, it's not always easy
taking care of yourself...

1524
01:54:51,262 --> 01:54:53,948
and someone else
at the same time.

1525
01:54:58,647 --> 01:55:00,852
I owe you an apology, Ella.

1526
01:55:05,264 --> 01:55:06,702
Many, in fact.

1527
01:55:10,251 --> 01:55:12,456
I owe quite a few myself.

1528
01:55:15,142 --> 01:55:16,580
You'll be entering from-

1529
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:19,457
Oh, yeah, just along here
and, um, down these stairs.

1530
01:55:20,128 --> 01:55:22,622
- And will someone be escorting you?
- My dad.

1531
01:55:23,389 --> 01:55:25,115
- That's nice.
- Dad.

1532
01:56:05,873 --> 01:56:07,983
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Michael.

1533
01:56:20,929 --> 01:56:23,519
And now, a very special moment.

1534
01:56:24,286 --> 01:56:26,012
Young lady?

1535
01:56:26,587 --> 01:56:30,136
Uh, this isn't in the program,
'cause it's a surprise.

1536
01:56:30,999 --> 01:56:33,013
I surprise Rose a lot.

1537
01:56:35,506 --> 01:56:36,945
Uh, usually, she hates it.

1538
01:56:37,424 --> 01:56:39,246
I think, or I hope...

1539
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:41,452
that she likes this.

1540
01:56:45,288 --> 01:56:48,357
It's a poem by e. e. cummings.

1541
01:56:49,124 --> 01:56:51,042
For you.

1542
01:56:59,002 --> 01:57:01,207
"I carry your heart with me.

1543
01:57:01,879 --> 01:57:03,605
"I carry it in my heart.

1544
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,811
"I am never without it.

1545
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:08,783
"Anywhere I go, you go, my dear.

1546
01:57:09,551 --> 01:57:11,565
"And whatever is done by only me...

1547
01:57:12,044 --> 01:57:14,442
"is your doing, my darling.

1548
01:57:16,168 --> 01:57:17,510
"I fear no fate...

1549
01:57:17,798 --> 01:57:19,908
"for you are my fate, my sweet.

1550
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:23,840
"I want no world, for, beautiful...

1551
01:57:24,415 --> 01:57:27,100
"you are my world, my true.

1552
01:57:27,868 --> 01:57:30,073
"Here is the deepest secret
no one knows.

1553
01:57:32,663 --> 01:57:34,197
"Here is the root of the root...

1554
01:57:34,677 --> 01:57:36,115
