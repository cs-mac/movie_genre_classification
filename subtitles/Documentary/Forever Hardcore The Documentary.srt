1
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,675
Clear.

2
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,677
Clear.

3
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,677
Clear.

4
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,880
Akcm, this one's a feeble piece of shit, too.

5
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,751
Boyfriend not the killing machine
you hoped for?

6
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,834
...but you built a great punching bag.

7
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,631
Maybe we can skip right to the fine?

8
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,030
Do you know what's wrong
with Mother Russia?

9
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,552
Do you know what's wrong
with Mother Russia?

10
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,149
Too goddamn hot.

11
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,553
Too goddamn hot.

12
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,557
Too goddamn hot.

13
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,119
As you wish.

14
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,080
I used to be in charge of all this shit.
And now...

15
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,797
Great jacket! Where can I get one?

16
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,319
You! Come here!

17
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,112
You got a light?

18
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,112
The fuck you think I have arms for?

19
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,751
You're free to go now.

20
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,435
You want a puff?
-Yeah.

21
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,594
Ella.

22
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,078
Ella, you whore!

23
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,117
Take him to Jimmy.

24
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,039
Is this Jimmy?

25
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,716
I'm not going back in there!
That thing's destroyer-class!

26
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,911
What's wrong with his hand?

27
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,438
Who is he? Is he a robot?

28
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,672
He's cute.

29
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,794
I know how to make him feel better.

30
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,593
No, I know a better way.
Lift him.

31
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,875
No, the lower one.

32
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,758
Bye-bye.

33
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,193
I'm not with them!
I'm not with them!

34
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,870
Jimmy, you asshole!

35
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,234
You want Akan? Here's your Akan.

36
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,912
And here's your Akan.

37
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,919
We can go now.

38
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,318
I don't hear a "no."

39
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,431
Gentlemen, please go
check that shit out.

40
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,634
Freeze!

41
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,269
Baby, the gag reflex is psychological.
It's all in your head.

42
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,599
Leave.
