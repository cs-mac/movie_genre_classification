Just turned blue,
so I went to the doctor

154
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:29,949
- Well, you didn't mean
what you just said, did you?
- When?

155
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,527
Just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world

156
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,429
- and having it be an act of cruelty
- I meant it at the time

157
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,229
Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago

158
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:45,103
Well gosh, kind of a lot's happened
since then We're not even married

159
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,268
I know It's funny
you should mention that

160
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:51,176
- It's funny?
- Do you love me?

161
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,648
- Of course I love you
- Good

The Rock is the most famous and
was the most feared prison ever built

Is it really true that there's
never been an escape?

166
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:26,838
Ah, that's true From 1936
until '63 when the prison closed,

167
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,850
there were 14 attempts

168

to shore... alive, at least

Will you do something for me?
It's really... It's really important

cordially invite you

Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

183
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,635
Like being a caged animal

Spend a couple of years in there...
What's the matter, fellas?

00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:28,669
- Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour's over, Bob

We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity

you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about

By your ninth birthday,
I was runnin' black ops into China,

Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs covered so well on CNN?

It was my men on the ground that made those hits
possible by lasing the targets

Twenty of them were left to rot outside

No benefits were paid to their families
No medals conferred

even given a goddamn military burial

[Womack]
All right

306
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:17,170
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families

307
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,874
Tell 'em somethin' Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover

308
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:25,181
If this comes out, the city of
San Francisco will be in chaos, anarchy

309
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:28,745
Wait a minute, wait a minute
What is the potential casualty rate

310
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:33,557
for a single rocket armed
with VX poison gas, Gen Peterson?

311
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,257
- Sixty or seventy
- Well, that's not so bad

312
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:41,530
Thousand
Seventy thousand dead

313
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:44,265
- Oh
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

314
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,933
it's lethal up to 100 feet

315
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:50,375
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere

316
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,744
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius

317
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,374
Get the point?

318
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:59,318
What did Hummel mean by
your "counter measure," General?

319
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,016
Standard poison is countered by napalm
It consumes it upon detonation

320
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:07,186
Now, the problem with VX poison gas
is that it's designed specifically

321
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:10,561
to withstand napalm; that's
where thermite plasma comes in

322
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,965
- Gen Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems

323
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:17,163
can burn hot enough to consume VX,
but they're still in the test phase

324
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:21,073
It's not operational
Hummel knows this

325
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:24,271
We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch

326
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,008
What's it gonna take
to equip a flight of F-18s

327
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,710
with thermite plasma
within the next 36 hours?

328
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:33,254
- An act of God
- Excuse me?

329
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,721
All right We can try

330
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:39,726
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative

331
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,228
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative Uh, Admiral?

I am pregnant, and I am unmarried

Likewise,
a frontal seaside attack

If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch

Our only alternative is an attack
from within the prison

We penetrate the island through tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected

373
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,392
and emerge in its center, that way,
we can jump the marines from behind

If you know the system, it will take you
wherever you need to go

740
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:57,308
There's an intake pipe here, below
low tide Is that our best access?

741
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:00,751
- Yes, that's exactly where I came out
- Then beneath the cistern

742
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,288
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system

743
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:08,259
- How many feet is that?
- Ehh 57 paces

744
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:10,489
Where do we go from there?

745
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,997
[Muttering]
Where do you go from there?

746
00:54:16,103 --> 00:54:18,537
That's a good question

747
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,933
- I have no idea
- What?

748
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:27,343
I mean I'll know
when we're all inside

749
00:54:27,448 --> 00:54:31,009
No You're not goddamn goin'
Show us on the blueprints

750
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:34,519
I can't!
My blueprint was in my head

751
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:38,057
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

752
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:41,355
just waiting
for the tides to be right

753
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:43,623
But don't worry
It'll all come back to me

754
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:46,859
You're not going anywhere, Mason

755
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:48,457
Wait a second

756
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:52,972
This piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have

757
00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:55,837
If he's not going, then why the hell
did we get him out of jail?

758
00:54:55,943 --> 00:54:59,140
- He's smart
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you

759
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:03,205
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes

760
00:55:03,317 --> 00:55:05,251
He'll fuck with you

761
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:09,118
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there

762
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:15,951
Now, Womack you're between
the Rock and a hard case

763
00:55:17,264 --> 00:55:20,097
Hmm
How's your bowling arm?

764
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,231
Dr Goodspeed, the goal
is to take out the launchers

765
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:27,500
then neutralize
the VX chemical rounds

766
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:30,202
Well, we know the poison's
being kept in the prison morgue

767
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,768
from the satellite thermal imagining,
which is right here... these dots

768
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:35,974
Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?

769
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,074
No, sir,
but I've studied them

770
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,677
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification

771
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:44,690
Got a really neat layout here
of the chem round as well as the rocket

772
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:47,352
- So let's get rolling
- That won't be necessary

773
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:51,891
Oh, it's very necessary, sir

774
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,866
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine

775
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:57,664
An ecological disaster, sir

776
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,171
Plus, the devices themselves
are complicated

777
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:03,107
That's why you're coming with us

778
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:06,473
I am?

779
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,811
You're the expert
What's your problem?

780
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:14,149
You mean I'm going...
going out there under the water?

781
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:19,214
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit

782
00:56:19,326 --> 00:56:21,351
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

783
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,625
- Define "combat," sir
- Shep?

784
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:27,598
An incursion underwater
to retake an impregnable fortress

785
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:30,431
held by an elite team of US Marines
in possession of 81 hostages

786
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:34,166
and 15 guided rockets
armed with VX poison gas

787
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:38,506
Oh In that case, no, sir
Excuse me

788
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:42,048
[Retching]

789
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,879
[Gagging, Coughing]

790
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,476
- Here
- Ah, thank you

791
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:49,647
[Gasping]

792
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:52,156
You don't look too good

793
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:54,887
In fact, you look like shit

794
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:59,159
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass

795
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:03,032
You all right? I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?

796
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:05,435
I don't know

797
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:08,565
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

798
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,734
but nothing prepares you for it

799
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,075
Now I'm...
I'm responsible

800
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,877
for a whole city

801
00:57:16,984 --> 00:57:20,886
- [Faucet Creaks, Water Splashing]
- Look, I know this isn't easy for you

802
00:57:20,988 --> 00:57:23,354
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of situation

803
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:25,357
and believe me,
it'll come back to you

804
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:28,121
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backin' you up

805
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:31,629
Okay
You're right

806
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:36,026
I'll be on the wire
I'll help talk you through it

807
00:57:36,136 --> 00:57:40,539
There's something else
It's terrible

808
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:44,600
N-No, it's wonderful
except it isn't

809
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,442
My girlfriend's pregnant

810
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:52,781
and she's
just flown in to see me

811
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,616
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight,

812
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,556
and I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center

813
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:15,306
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank Lou Linstrom

814
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:19,175
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer

815
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:23,113
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer

816
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:25,515
Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions

817
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,953
We've spoken to the President,
and I know that you're aware
of his stance on terrorism

818
00:58:30,057 --> 00:58:34,289
- So what we'd like to do...
- This isn't about terrorism
This is about justice

819
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:37,261
It's about reminding people who found it
politically convenient to forget

820
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:41,323
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank
- Well, let me tell you what is:

821
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,199
15 VX gas rockets into
the heart of San Francisco

822
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:46,499
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money

823
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:49,303
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen

824
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:55,577
What's the word from Mojave?

825
00:58:55,682 --> 00:59:00,415
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma

826
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,579
That is the word

827
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,195
Green light to SEAL incursion

828
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:29,249
Fall in!

829
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:33,012
All right Listen up
Mr. Mason will run point for us

830
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,213
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip

831
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:39,918
You breathe, he breathes with you
You piss, he helps Understood?

832
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:44,623
Dr Goodspeed is our specialist
When he neutralizes the threat,

833
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:48,531
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry

834
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:52,435
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
we're in the fight of our lives,

835
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:54,700
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander

836
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:56,799
in the Vietnam War,
I shit you not

837
00:59:58,145 --> 01:00:00,841
Any questions?

838
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:02,710
Let's load up!

839
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:14,293
After you, ace

840
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:39,451
Pass out and activate
the Minicams

841
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,953
Everything set here?

842
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,649
Minicams operational?

843
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:47,955
Roger that, sir
We are on line

844
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:55,824
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

845
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:00,973
Let's see, we have, uh,

846
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,010
one quart of kerosene
and a squeeze bottle,

847
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:12,880
three washers
and waterproof matches

848
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:16,319
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized

849
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,551
Now, this is atropine
If you come in contact with the gas,

850
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:21,991
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart

851
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,495
Don't fuck with me on this
It may save your life

852
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:33,664
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 2-7-5 Range; 6,000 meters

853
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:39,477
FBI Command Center?

854
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:42,810
Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on

855
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:45,214
- Nope
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend

856
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:49,152
- Actually, he's my fianc
Where is he?
- Classified, lady

857
01:01:49,256 --> 01:01:52,225
Okay, well you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then

858
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:54,486
Hey, where are you...
Goddamn it

859
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:02,093
Decoy choppers commencing
run to Alcatraz

860
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,031
I just lost one, sir
I just lost one

861
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,801
We only got two flying in
I just lost one

862
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:10,103
Shit

863
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:23,353
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers

864
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:26,551
- Your day?
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?

865
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,527
I don't... I don't know
anything about you

866
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:32,462
- I know something about you, Godspell
- Goodspeed

867
01:02:32,566 --> 01:02:35,592
Goodspeed,
Godspeed, Godspell,

868
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:39,035
you never went
to any anti-terrorist school

869
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:42,040
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed

870
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:48,109
- We're going dark
- Night vision!

871
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:52,240
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

872
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,549
heading around Treasure Island

873
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:59,022
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing

874
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:05,988
Decoys?

875
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:09,068
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander

876
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:16,108
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone

877
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:21,608
Stanley's not a very good swimmer
I mean, he can't even snorkel

878
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:25,182
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

879
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:29,016
- Good to go!
- [Muffled Words] Good to go!

880
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:41,258
So the SDUs have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water

881
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:54,411
Major, I want the perimeter
patrolled to the west end of the island

882
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:56,539
Yes, sir
Hendrix, you lead the patrol

883
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:00,108
- Aye, sir
- Let's move! Move out, move out!

884
01:04:56,876 --> 01:05:00,334
The Eagles are on the Rock
They've entered the cistern room

885
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:11,286
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason
You sent us into a room with no exit

886
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,462
Any ideas, Dillinger?

887
01:05:16,563 --> 01:05:19,191
Figure it out soon
We're sitting ducks

01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:23,235
- Real tight on time
- You stand by the door
Until I open it

889
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,533
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that

890

You're shitting me

I just hope it hasn't been changed

- Commander, you said never
leave his side, but, uh...

- Stand fast, Lieutenant
- Have a nice day

No motion sensors tripped

- Well, tell them to stay out there

Sweep forward!

- That's a no-no That's the subway

- That'll drop you into the tunnels
- Do it!

905
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:41,496
Sir, the Eagles
have breached the tunnel system

906

You enjoying this?

907
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:53,476
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

908
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:57,647
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom

909

Though it's less of a problem these
days Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal

some sort of reflective device

Possibly a prism

926
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:59,637
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

927
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,869
send the beam
back to its source

going to move the prism

you will order them to safety their

stories Where does Mason fit in?

1021
01:17:50,945 --> 01:17:53,675
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files

1022
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:56,511
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border

1023
01:17:56,618 --> 01:17:59,815
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him

1024
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:04,415
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm

But he never did

use his daughter as leverage

about the JFK assassination

And Mason's angry, he's lethal
He's a trained killer

1033
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:39,158
And he is the only hope
that we have got

- I'll fire
- No, you won't

1040
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:04,341
- Throw down
- You're not the sort

1041
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:06,352
Let's find out

1042
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:12,519
I could; you, no

1043
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:15,858
Besides, your safety's on

1044
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:19,525
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

1045
01:19:19,634 --> 01:19:23,035
[Gasps]
Not yet

1046
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:28,370
- He's got all the guns now, sir
- Shit!

1047
01:19:28,476 --> 01:19:31,570
You're right, I don't use guns,
and I don't kick down doors

1048
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,909
- This is what I do
- I haven't got my glasses

1049
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:38,247
What it says is,
"Chemical Weapons Specialist"

1050
01:19:38,353 --> 01:19:39,820
That's right

1051
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:43,084
I got a lunatic up there,
man, with 15 missiles

1052
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,125
armed with some
really funky stuff

1053
01:19:45,226 --> 01:19:50,789
That lying Womack
You could've told my daughter

1054
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:55,426
It was classified
Look, I'm in the same situation

1055
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:58,733
They've got my girlfriend
in the city with a baby on the way

1056
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,332
Look, I can defuse the rockets
I really can

1057
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:06,072
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now

1058
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:16,485
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1059
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:19,685
Shit, we got a rodent problem
Flush the pipes

1060
01:20:19,794 --> 01:20:22,388
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island

1061
01:20:22,497 --> 01:20:25,125
- Check every access you can find
- Sir!

1062
01:20:30,905 --> 01:20:33,396
Even if you escape
from the island

1063
01:20:33,508 --> 01:20:36,375
you can't escape the rockets

1064
01:20:36,477 --> 01:20:38,809
So, where are you gonna go?

1065
01:20:38,913 --> 01:20:41,643
Go where?
What're you gonna do?

1066
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:46,649
[Stanley]
Show me where
the morgue is, Mason

1067
01:20:46,754 --> 01:20:48,984
[Mason]
I'm out of here

1068
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:54,152
[Stanley]
What about your daughter? Mason?

1069
01:20:56,097 --> 01:20:57,564
Rodents located

1070
01:20:57,665 --> 01:21:01,726
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1071
01:21:01,836 --> 01:21:04,066
I don't think you do

1072
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:19,316
Move!

1073
01:21:22,356 --> 01:21:23,914
Ooooh!

1074
01:21:43,044 --> 01:21:47,037
- They're on to us
- Burn 'em out

1075
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:51,447
This mother's gonna blow big

1076
01:22:32,593 --> 01:22:36,620
I don't understand How could we lose
radio contact all of a sudden?

1077
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:39,291
We've lost coms
Still got 'em on locaters

1078
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:50,507
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1079
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:54,980
- How do you like your choices?
- I don't

1080
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:58,745
That's what I thought

1081
01:22:58,853 --> 01:23:00,753
Come on

1082
01:23:00,855 --> 01:23:03,619
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz

1083
01:23:03,724 --> 01:23:07,285
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1084
01:23:07,395 --> 01:23:10,387
Oh, really? Yeah, wow
You know, I like history, too,

1085
01:23:10,498 --> 01:23:13,626
and maybe when this is over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together,

1086
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:18,103
but right now, I just... I just...
I wanna find some rockets

1087
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:21,266
Don't tempt me

1088
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:24,902
We are going to the morgue

1089
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:50,234
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best

1090
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:52,829
Your best?

1091
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,376
Losers always whine about their best

1092
01:23:56,477 --> 01:24:00,413
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen

1093
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:03,849
Carla was the prom queen

1094
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:07,546
- Really?
- Yeah

1095
01:24:09,223 --> 01:24:12,056
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir

1096
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,719
Come on, come on,
you can do it, Doc

1097
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:22,430
Shit! Aaaaaah!

1098
01:24:22,536 --> 01:24:25,096
You must never hesitate

1099
01:24:48,129 --> 01:24:50,962
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket

1100
01:24:51,065 --> 01:24:53,363
Him, but not the rocket

1101
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:56,163
Any other news, professor?

1102
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:01,199
The rocket!
Not the rocket!

1103
01:25:07,882 --> 01:25:10,043
Aaah! Uhhh!

1104
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:17,989
I got a little something for ya

1105
01:25:27,568 --> 01:25:30,002
Yaaaah!

1106
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:45,410
Uh, yeah, okay, that's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen

1107
01:25:47,221 --> 01:25:53,456
Mason the second you don't
respect this, it kills you

1108
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:55,461
Put it over there

1109
01:26:06,574 --> 01:26:09,441
You've been around a lot of corpses
Is that normal?

1110
01:26:09,543 --> 01:26:12,774
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing

1111
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,374
- Yeah, that happens
- Can you do something about it?

1112
01:26:17,485 --> 01:26:20,147
Like what?
Kill him again?

1113
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:22,654
Listen, I'm just a biochemist

1114
01:26:22,757 --> 01:26:27,057
Most of the time, I work in a glass jar
and lead a very uneventful life

1115
01:26:27,161 --> 01:26:30,892
I drive a Volvo, a beige one
But what I'm dealing with here

1116
01:26:30,998 --> 01:26:34,627
is one of the most deadly substances
the earth has ever known

1117
01:26:34,735 --> 01:26:37,135
So what do you say
you cut me some friggin' slack?

1118
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:47,146
[Hissing]

1119
01:26:53,454 --> 01:26:55,422
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration

1120
01:26:55,523 --> 01:26:58,287
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable

1121
01:26:58,392 --> 01:27:00,485
What exactly
does this stuff do?

1122
01:27:00,594 --> 01:27:04,655
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people

1123
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:09,099
Really? What happens
if you drop one?

1124
01:27:09,203 --> 01:27:12,172
Happily, it'll just
wipe out you and me

1125
01:27:12,273 --> 01:27:15,606
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor

1126
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:19,008
It stops the brain from sending messages
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds

1127
01:27:19,113 --> 01:27:22,173
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know

1128
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:26,982
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system

1129
01:27:27,087 --> 01:27:28,714
Do not move that!

1130
01:27:31,225 --> 01:27:34,285
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe

1131
01:27:34,395 --> 01:27:37,421
you spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out

1132
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:43,026
- But that's after your skin melts off
- My God

1133
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:46,470
Well, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

1134
01:27:46,574 --> 01:27:50,908
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips

1135
01:27:51,011 --> 01:27:54,378
so the rocket'll splash
down after 500 feet

1136
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:57,508
All right, let me have that
You can let go of it

1137
01:27:57,618 --> 01:28:00,280
All right, just back away
Just back away!

1138
01:28:00,387 --> 01:28:04,050
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in

it's Blackbird, over

1140

Blackbird One, this is Blackbird
Come in, goddamn it!

Somebody's still there
Let's move!

1142

Rats alive! Close on the morgue!
Close on the morgue!

1143

Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1144
01:28:23,611 --> 01:28:27,012
Frye, Darrow, hustle up
We got more company!

1145
01:28:30,584 --> 01:28:35,317
[Hummel]
Hold it! Converge
on the morgue! Move out!

Come on Time's up

1149

We have to find them!

- I'm too old for this!
- Where's it go?

I've no idea

1154
01:29:20,067 --> 01:29:22,661
Sir, all the guidance
chips are gone

1155

Captain, I guess you didn't quite
take care of the rat problem

1156
01:29:25,873 --> 01:29:27,340
No, sir

1157

Well, there are two dead men who
strongly suggest you go finish the job

- No, I don't know where it goes

01:29:45,059 --> 01:29:48,324
Well, we're picking up speed
Do you know how to slow it down?

01:45:28,835 --> 01:45:32,396
And I'll be dead, or back in prison
which is the same thing

1341
01:45:32,505 --> 01:45:36,874
You're not leaving
[Grunts, Groaning]

1342
01:45:39,312 --> 01:45:43,305
All right
I'll do it myself

1343
01:45:44,484 --> 01:45:46,645
I got three weeks'
weapons training

1344
01:45:46,753 --> 01:45:51,087
I'll kick the...
And a platoon full of marines

1345
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:53,954
No problem

1346
01:46:04,938 --> 01:46:08,237
- Major, patch me into roof battery
- Aye, sir

1347
01:46:08,341 --> 01:46:12,243
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir

1348
01:46:12,345 --> 01:46:14,745
Let's go!

1349
01:46:20,086 --> 01:46:23,881
- Laser powered up
- Oh, no

1350
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:26,823
I said, on your knees!

1351
01:46:26,926 --> 01:46:29,417
My name's Stanley Goodspeed

1352
01:46:29,529 --> 01:46:32,464
I'm a chemical weapons
specialist for the FBI

1353
01:46:32,565 --> 01:46:34,499
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1354
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:37,126
- Glass or plastic!
- Shut the fuck up!

1355
01:46:37,236 --> 01:46:40,728
Because if the winds change and if you
launch those rockets, we're gonna die

1356
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,068
Shut up!

1357
01:46:42,175 --> 01:46:46,009
And you're gonna end up
in a glass jar or a plastic bag

1358
01:46:46,112 --> 01:46:51,209
So do the math, hand over the gun
and let's go find some rockets!

1359
01:46:51,317 --> 01:46:54,616
I said shut the fuck...
[Neck Snaps]

1360
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:02,920
[Panting]
You made the right choice

1361
01:47:03,029 --> 01:47:07,193
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father

1362
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,599
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel, I was your age

1363
01:47:10,703 --> 01:47:13,695
So I'm fucked either way
So come on

1364
01:47:13,806 --> 01:47:16,639
The weapon is hot
I am standing by for the launch command

1365
01:47:16,743 --> 01:47:20,270
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing...
Is this for real?

1366
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:23,008
Hey, it's business

1367
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:28,246
Access code entered
Weapon available for release

1368
01:47:28,354 --> 01:47:30,254
Launch coordinates;

1369
01:47:30,356 --> 01:47:34,554
six, seven, five, four, five, niner

1370
01:47:36,262 --> 01:47:38,423
The weapon is hot

1371
01:47:38,531 --> 01:47:41,432
I'm standing by
for launch command

1372
01:47:41,534 --> 01:47:43,434
It's affirmative

1373
01:47:46,572 --> 01:47:49,803
[Bell Chiming]

1374
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:52,400
Standing by for command

1375
01:48:00,386 --> 01:48:02,946
I'm waiting for
a launch command, General

1376
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:13,021
- Fire
- Fire!

1377
01:48:18,938 --> 01:48:21,202
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1378
01:48:26,779 --> 01:48:31,341
Origin; Alcatraz, 67253725

1379
01:48:31,451 --> 01:48:35,478
- What's the heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast

1380
01:48:35,588 --> 01:48:39,115
- Speed?
- 300 knots Headed right at Oakland

1381
01:48:39,225 --> 01:48:40,817
The football game

1382
01:48:44,764 --> 01:48:46,527
Oh, my God

1383
01:49:09,489 --> 01:49:11,354
Missile radically
changing direction

1384
01:49:17,663 --> 01:49:22,100
New direction; 275 degrees west
It's headed out to sea, sir

1385
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:24,431
Oh, Christ!

1386
01:49:25,938 --> 01:49:29,840
Missile losing altitude
Falling

1387
01:49:29,942 --> 01:49:33,309
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100

1388
01:49:36,549 --> 01:49:39,450
Bogey detonated underwater

1389
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:43,880
What the fuck?

1390
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:47,323
- It missed
- Well, that's great

1391
01:49:47,426 --> 01:49:50,953
Extremely great,
but there's still one left

1392
01:49:51,063 --> 01:49:54,760
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened?

1393
01:49:54,867 --> 01:49:58,234
What the fuck is going on
to the coordinates? Sir! Major!

1394
01:49:58,337 --> 01:50:00,737
Captain, step outside

1395
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,536
- Talk to me, sir
- Captain, step outside!

1396
01:50:17,023 --> 01:50:19,218
Get me the Pentagon

1397
01:50:32,071 --> 01:50:34,437
What the hell was that, Frank?

1398
01:50:36,342 --> 01:50:39,675
- I said, what the hell...
- I heard what you said!

1399
01:50:39,779 --> 01:50:42,748
- I'd appreciate a little more respect
- Cut the crap, General

1400
01:50:42,849 --> 01:50:45,113
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people

1401
01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:47,243
- Call the Pentagon Ask for more time
- No

1402
01:50:47,353 --> 01:50:50,413
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose

1403
01:50:50,523 --> 01:50:53,617
You're coming loose
The rest of us are in complete control

1404
01:50:53,726 --> 01:50:56,661
- We're gonna ask for a new deadline
- Put the phone down

1405
01:50:56,762 --> 01:50:59,287
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are marines!

1406
01:50:59,398 --> 01:51:03,357
Are they?
I wanna talk to Gen Kramer

1407
01:51:03,469 --> 01:51:06,199
- You've been asked by an old friend
- Put him on the phone right now

1408
01:51:06,305 --> 01:51:08,432
- You've been ordered
- This is Major Baxter!

1409
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:11,840
Now you're being given your last chance
by a man with a gun

1410
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:14,105
Put the phone down

1411
01:51:16,682 --> 01:51:21,016
- I thought you weren't ready to kill
- I'm warming up

1412
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:23,247
At ease

1413
01:51:31,898 --> 01:51:34,992
They need a decision,
Mr. President

1414
01:51:40,973 --> 01:51:44,875
[Sighs]
These past few hours

1415
01:51:44,977 --> 01:51:49,243
have been the longest,
darkest of my life

1416
01:51:49,348 --> 01:51:52,943
How does one weigh human life?

1417
01:51:54,287 --> 01:51:57,745
One million civilians
against 81 hostages

1418
01:51:57,857 --> 01:52:01,190
And in the middle, Frank Hummel

1419
01:52:01,294 --> 01:52:05,526
[Sighs]
That we have ignored, abandoned

1420
01:52:05,631 --> 01:52:10,000
or marginalized a great
soldier like Frank Hummel,

1421
01:52:10,102 --> 01:52:13,265
and American boys have paid
for that neglect

1422
01:52:13,372 --> 01:52:16,773
with blood is equally real

1423
01:52:16,876 --> 01:52:19,276
and equally tragic

1424
01:52:21,781 --> 01:52:23,942
We are at war with terror,

1425
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:27,611
and fighting war means casualties

1426
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,178
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make

1427
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:38,764
Air strike approved

1428
01:52:41,067 --> 01:52:43,058
Red Thunder to Tower
Request clearance

1429
01:52:43,169 --> 01:52:46,502
The amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1430
01:52:46,605 --> 01:52:49,733
- This is strike leader Prepared to go
- It'll be over in a few seconds

1431
01:52:49,842 --> 01:52:52,640
[Pilot]
Flight time to drop point; 17 minutes

1432
01:52:59,218 --> 01:53:02,551
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you

1433
01:53:02,655 --> 01:53:05,453
- What the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?

1434
01:53:05,558 --> 01:53:08,789
- That's affirmative, Captain
- So now they think we're gutless?

1435
01:53:08,894 --> 01:53:11,556
The Feds?
They think we won't actually do it

1436
01:53:11,664 --> 01:53:14,462
They're gonna come at us with
everything they got Air and sea

1437
01:53:14,567 --> 01:53:16,899
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age

1438
01:53:17,003 --> 01:53:18,994
They don't know
we missed on purpose

1439
01:53:19,105 --> 01:53:24,407
Great We're not gutless
We're incompetent That right?

1440
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:27,911
I don't think I like your tone, Captain
We planned for this contingency

1441
01:53:28,014 --> 01:53:31,006
Load the VX into the choppers,
take four hostages and Evacuate

1442
01:53:31,117 --> 01:53:33,347
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone

1443
01:53:33,452 --> 01:53:36,649
Excuse me, General, but
what about the fucking money?

1444
01:53:36,756 --> 01:53:39,224
There is no fucking money
Mission's over

1445
01:53:39,325 --> 01:53:41,088
Bullshit it's over

1446
01:53:41,193 --> 01:53:44,720
You're talking to a General, soldier!
Maintain discipline!

1447
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:49,494
I'm not a soldier, Major The day
we took hostages, we became mercenaries

1448
01:53:49,602 --> 01:53:54,403
And mercenaries get paid
I want my fucking money!

1449
01:53:54,507 --> 01:53:57,067
This mission was based
on the threat of force

1450
01:53:57,176 --> 01:54:00,839
I'm not about to kill
80,000 innocent people

1451
01:54:00,946 --> 01:54:04,279
Do you think I'm
out of my fucking mind?

1452
01:54:04,383 --> 01:54:07,409
We bluffed They called it
The mission's over

1453
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:13,552
Who ever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1454
01:54:13,659 --> 01:54:16,457
Stand down, Captain

1455
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,228
Stand down, Captain!

1456
01:54:28,874 --> 01:54:33,641
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and Evacuate

1457
01:54:33,746 --> 01:54:37,147
That's a simple order, Major!

1458
01:54:37,249 --> 01:54:39,376
It's not so simple, Frank

1459
01:54:39,485 --> 01:54:44,184
Sgt Crisp, secure the general

1460
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:47,259
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir

1461

Sergeant!

1462
01:55:00,339 --> 01:55:03,433
- I'll have that sidearm, sir
- You mean this sidearm?

1463
01:55:12,384 --> 01:55:15,820
Maj Baxter, you're either with us
or against us

1464
01:55:21,393 --> 01:55:25,420
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General

1465
01:55:29,635 --> 01:55:34,800
But like he said it's over

1466
01:55:34,907 --> 01:55:36,932
[Grunts]

1467
01:55:52,324 --> 01:55:54,485
Let's get him

[Groaning]
My God, what have I done?

1470
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,072
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket!

1471
01:56:11,844 --> 01:56:14,813
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse

1472
01:56:14,914 --> 01:56:17,576
- Lower lighthouse!
- Go

1473
01:56:29,995 --> 01:56:33,726
[Shouting]
Darrow, go to the lighthouse!
I'll take care of this fucker!

1474
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:42,667
One, two, three!

1475
01:56:42,775 --> 01:56:44,242
Eat that!

1476
01:56:54,019 --> 01:56:55,987
[Groaning]

1477
01:56:58,657 --> 01:57:00,090
Did it

1478
01:57:25,384 --> 01:57:27,978
[Grunts]

1479
01:57:31,156 --> 01:57:34,922
Come here Come here,

1480

You shoot me, I drop this
We're both dead

1481
01:57:38,597 --> 01:57:41,327
Come on Come on
Don't be scared I won't hurt you

1482
01:57:41,433 --> 01:57:43,628
- Come on
- You know how this shit works?

1483
01:57:43,736 --> 01:57:45,863
You know how this shit works?

1484
01:57:48,374 --> 01:57:51,969
Come on

1485
01:57:52,077 --> 01:57:54,170
I don't need a gun
I'll put it down

1486
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,614
Come on Let's play
Come on Come on

1487

Listen, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot Stan Goodspeed, FBI

1488
01:58:03,455 --> 01:58:06,652
Uh, let's talk music Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1489
01:58:06,759 --> 01:58:11,093
- I don't like soft-ass shit
