1
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,058
Oh, my.

2
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,226
Hope you haven't
been waiting long.

3
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,860
I'm usually
the first one here.

4
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,100
Sorry about that.
All right.

5
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,631
I think you're gonna like this
three-bedroom property, Mr. Poole.

6
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,203
Right through here, this bathroom
has been completely redone...

7
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,077
new tiles, new sink.

8
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,208
There are walk-ins
in every room.

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,548
And right through here
is the kitchen.

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,077
Look at this skylight.
That is nice.

11
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,953
And the cabinets, I believe

12
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,322
are original, which some
people really enjoy.

13
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,554
And if you follow me
to the backyard...

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,927
And, uh...

15
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,900
What about the other house?
The one down the street.

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,596
Oh, right.

17
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,094
Well, I made the offer
like you asked,

18
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,732
but they didn't
want to sell.

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,675
Yeah, that house
is not on the market.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,077
I mean, did you tell them
that I'd pay whatever they wanted?

21
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,675
I did, Mr. Poole.
They live there.

22
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,151
They like it.
That's their home.

23
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,246
But anyway,
back to this place...

24
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,349
Let me just show you
this backyard.

25
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,589
Are you from California,
Mr. Poole?

26
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,153
The weather's so nice here.

27
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,858
A lot of Californians
spend time in their backyard.

28
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,367
And look at this...
there's plenty of room for a pool

29
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,029
- or a hot tub...
- How much?

30
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,801
Well, they're asking 325.

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,968
I'm sorry, could you
mind repeating that?

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,807
I just have trouble
with this ear.

33
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,246
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
saying they're asking 325.

34
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,110
Okay, I'll take it.

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,384
Well.

36
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,381
Mr. Poole, I'm pretty sure I could
get them to knock off 25 or 30.

37
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,055
I mean, look at this place.
It needs to be re-stuccoed and...

38
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,462
It's okay.

39
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,466
I'll pay what
they're asking.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,229
But look at the place.

41
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,794
I mean, it needs paint
at the minimum

42
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,797
and the landscaping really
leaves a lot to be desired.

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,005
I'd like to pay
what they want.

44
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,208
No negotiating,
no repairs, just...

45
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,738
But Mr. Poole...

46
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,808
Mrs. Wyat,

47
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,652
you need to just
let this go. Okay?

48
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,022
The higher the price,
the bigger your commission.

49
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,551
- So...
- Okay, then.

50
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,772
¶ Don't got a lot of time ¶

51
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,276
¶ Don't give a damn ¶

52
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,905

53
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,881

00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,090
¶ Love of the loveless ¶

59
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,331
¶ Love of the loveless ¶

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,938
¶ Don't have too many friends ¶

61
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,440
¶ Never felt at home ¶

62
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,738
¶ Always been my own man ¶

63
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,869
¶ Pretty much alone ¶

64
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,608
¶ I know how to get through ¶

65
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,446
¶ And when push comes to shove ¶

66
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,782
¶ I got something that you need ¶

67
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,651
¶ I got the love ¶

68
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,282

00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,658

00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,867
¶ The love of the loveless ¶

72
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,804

¶ Nothing ¶

¶ Don't got a lot of time ¶

77
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,872
¶ Don't really care ¶

78
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,706
¶ Not selling anything ¶

¶ Love of the loveless. ¶

86
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,810
Hi.

87
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,345
I'm your neighbor from...
from next door,

88
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,652
Esperanza Martinez.

89
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,922
I just want to come by
and say hello,

90
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,486
um, welcome you
to the neighborhood.

91
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,829
Hello.
Homemade tamales for you.

92
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,826
Thank you.

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,394
I used to be...

94
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,838
good friends with the man
who lived here.

95
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,275
I was actually
the one who found him.

96
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,176
Found him where?

97
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,443
There in your kitchen.

98
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,950
He died of a heart attack.

99
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,509
Fue terrible.

100
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,111
It was terrible.

101
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,955
He had been laying there
for 10 hours, they think.

102
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,552
- Here?
- Yes.

103
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,530
We were good friends.

104
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,032
So where are you from?

105
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,865
Not here.

106
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,936
Thank you for
the tamales.

107
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,668
You're welcome.

108
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,708
Looks like you're burning.

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,184
- I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

110
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,980
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

111
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,150
but you still don't
have a phone.

112
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,956
- No.
- Yeah, and I rang the...

113
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,123
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure
you're doing okay

114
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,998
and that the move
went well.

115
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,094
And did you notice that
we re-stuccoed and painted?

116
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,765
Yeah, I noticed that.

117
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,640
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

118
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,769
Yeah, well...

119
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,474
- I just thought...
- The thing is...

120
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,982
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat,

121
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,110
so it's really just
a waste of time.

122
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,211
What do you mean, you're not
gonna be living here that long?

123
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,119
And for the record,

124
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,528
whoever did it,

125
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,658
they did kind of
a lousy job.

126
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,168
It's all discolored
right there.

127
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,606
Oh, well...

128
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,505
we can have
that fixed.

129
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,772
No, don't bother.

130
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,904
It doesn't matter.

131
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,146
Well.

132
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,419
Anyhow.

133
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,823
Looks like you're burning.

134
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,393
- I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

135
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,197
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

136
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,074
but you still don't
have a phone.

137
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,873
And I rang the bell.

138
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,903
Well?
And did you notice

139
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,040
that we re-stuccoed
and painted?

140
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,643
Yeah, I noticed that.

141
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,381
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

142
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,252
Yeah, well...

143
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,417
- I just thought...
- The thing is,

144
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,689
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat.

145
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,255
So it's kind of
a waste of time.

146
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,061
What do you mean, you're not gonna be
living here that long?

147
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,091
And for the record,

148
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,660
whoever did it,

149
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,865
they did kind of
a lousy job.

150
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,602
It's all discolored
right there.

151
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,734
Oh, well...

152
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,676
we can have
that fixed.

153
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,611
No, don't bother.

154
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,013
It doesn't matter.

155
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,448
Anyhow.

156
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,592
What are you doing?

157
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,666
Oh my God.

158
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,349
Yes! Really. Really.

159
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,447
Yes! Yes!

160
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,090
I don't know anything
for sure, but...

161
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,690
It's... it's like...

162
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,568
Oh, please please
please please.

163
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,130
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

164
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,506
Thank you.
See you soon.

165
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:22,071
Mr. Poole, something very
wonderful has happened...

166
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,581
Were you just in
my backyard?

167
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,243
Did you not look?

168
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,752
Were you looking
in the windows?

169
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,311
Ay, no!

170
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,483
Of course not.
Did you not see?

171
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,425
See what?

172
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,553
- Oh my God.
- I...

173
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,085
I... I saw you.

174
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,155
You were running around.

175
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,764
Do you need
to borrow something?

176
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,370
Okay, I'll see you later.

177
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,285
You don't see it?

178
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,883
See what?

179
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,091
All I see is a water stain
from a lousy stucco job.

180
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,622
You are not looking.

181
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,369
I... I don't see anything.

182
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,243
You are not looking.

183
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,975
Es el rostro de Dios.

184
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,449
The face of God.

185
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,715
The face of Christ.

186
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,087
It's... it's like a sign
from God.

187
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,957
Look, the only sign
I see is that

188
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,984
you seem a little overexcited.

189
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,223
It's probably the heat.

190
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,164
I think the heat
has gotten to you.

191
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,598
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

192
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,467
I... I... I know it's
hard to believe it.

193
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,735
But the proof is right...
right there.

194
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,674
All right.

195
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,337
You just going
to ignore it?

196
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,074
No. No.

197
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,514
I am gonna
ignore you, though.

198
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,421
So who were you
talking to?

199
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,952
To you.

200
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,023
No, I mean in your yard.
You were on the phone.

201
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,500
- Who were you talking to?
- Mmm.

202
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,128
Excuse me?

203
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,240
Stay there.

204
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,343
Yeah?

205
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,473
Hi, I'm looking for
Esperanza Martinez.

206
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,847
Said she would be here.
I'm Father Vincent Salizar

207
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,511
from St. Ramos
Catholic Church.

208
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,145
She called and asked me
to meet her here...

209
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,156
Discúlpame.
Qué bueno que llegó.

210
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,283
It's in the backyard.
I'll show you.

211
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,122
Ven. Come in, come in,
come in.

212
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,993
Mire.
Pares aquí.

213
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,056
Aquí aquí.
Pares aquí. Aja.

214
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,727
Look, I don't know
what you're up to,

215
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,703
but I didn't say
you could come back here

216
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,069
and I'd like you
to both leave.

217
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,700
You see?

218
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,006
Well, I do see something.

219
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,173
- Very sorry about the intrusion, Mr...
- Poole.

220
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,477
Henry Poole.

221
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,381
Mr. Poole, I apologize.

222
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,249
So...

223
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,220
you do see it?

224
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,489
Well, I can see how it could
be interpreted as a face.

225
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,722
- Oh my God.
- That's quite clear.

226
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,563
But the face of Christ?

227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,397
I'm not so sure that

228
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,494
we can make that leap.

229
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,266
Thank you.
Thanks.

230
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,364
You see?
You understand?

231
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,102
And like I was saying,

232
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,269
I'd like you to both leave.
I'm kinda busy in there.

233
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,007
No no no no no.
Look. Look.

234
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,244
You can see...
the eyes here

235
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,343
and the beard here.

236
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,948
And the holy shoulder.

237
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:56,394
Everything. Everything, Padrecito.
Everything.

238
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,919
I can see how
it could be that.

239
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,092
These types of things should
not be easily discounted,

240
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,729
but we do have to take
these things at face value,

241
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,931
no pun intended.

242
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,406
Look, the face value of this

243
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,432
is that it's a water stain.

244
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,138
Right?

245
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,079
- Right?
- You're probably right, Mr. Poole.

246
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,106
Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,141
And by no means does
the church condone

248
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,154
any kind of frivolous
claims of this nature, but...

249
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,588
But nothing.
Look,

250
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,593
the game's over, okay?
That's not the face of Christ

251
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,323
and I want to be
left alone!

252
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,728
You're right.

253
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,995
You're right, Mr. Poole.

254
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,502
We've imposed enough.

255
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,833
Esperanza, let's go.

256
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,897
No no, espere un minuto, ¿sí?

257
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,340
Mr. Poole,

258
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,003
you can't ignore this, please.

259
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,071
- Es que espere, mejor... mejor, sí.
- Esperanza...

260
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,742
- vámonos.
- Por favor, espere un minuto.

261
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,274
Mr. Poole,

262
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,814
don't you believe in God?

263
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,916
Please! Please.

264
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,161
Es que... es el rostro
de Dios.

265
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,165
Sus ojos.

266
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,537
Excuse me.

267
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,568
No, wait...

268
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,446
These types of things

269
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,177
should not be
easily discounted,

270
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,015
but we do have to take
these things at face value,

271
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,486
no pun intended.

272
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,011
Yeah, well, I agree...

273
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,992
Please...

274
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,329
It's gonna be okay.

275
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,358
We're gonna be okay.

276
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,167
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,003
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,876
Hello?

279
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,644
Hi. I'm Henry.
I live next door.

280
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,344
Oh, yeah.

281
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,353
I saw you move in.
I'm Dawn.

282
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,719
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

283
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,281
Anyway, your daughter,
I guess,

284
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,725
she dropped this
in my backyard.

285
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,888
Oh, God, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

286
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,195
I keep telling her to stay
out of other people's yards.

287
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,566
No, it's not a problem.
She was just walking around back there.

288
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,367
Did she tape you?

289
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,206
I don't know.

290
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,835
'Cause she does that
sometimes.

291
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,210
She tapes people.

292
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,511
Why does she do that?

293
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,511
Uh...

294
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,182
I don't know.

295
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,857
Um, well, I've got to go.
But thank you so much

296
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,023
for bringing this
back to Millie and...

297
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,727
I'll make sure that she
stays out of your yard.

298
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,668
You having
another party?

299
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,907
Sorry?

300
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,917
Well, I've seen you in here a couple
of times buying the same stuff.

301
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,112
I thought maybe... Uh...

302
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,281
That'll be $155.82.

303
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,191
I thought maybe you might
be throwing some parties.

304
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,787
No parties.

305
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:35,630
Well, that doesn't look like
a very healthy diet.

306
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,467
Just kind of a phase.

307
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,119
Andales. Andales.
Hurry hurry.

308
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,982
Go go go with me.

309
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,460
Hurry, girl! Hurry.

310
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,757
Hurry, Margie.

311
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,403
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

312
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,064
- Hey!
- Oh my God, oh my God.

313
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,903
Run run run run!

314
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,144
I see you.

315
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,473
Hey! Hey!
Holy shoulder!

316
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,773
Hey.

317
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,212
Are these yours?

318
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,786
There you go.
You can have those back.

319
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,685
Let me ask you
a question.

320
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,283
Does that look like a church back there?
'Cause it's not.

321
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,624
It's my house.
It's private property.

322
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,027
And I don't want you four
wandering around back there

323
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,895
when I'm not home
with a bunch of candles

324
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,400
doing whatever it is
that those things do. Okay?

325
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,801
And you're gonna put
paint on my wall?

326
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,203
All right?
That's vandalism.

327
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,002
- Got it?
- Please. Please, Mr. Poole.

328
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,875
Calm. We didn't paint
anything on your wall.

329
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,209
- Really?
- Really.

330
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,543
- No, nothing?
- No no no...

331
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,071
Okay, so what's that?

332
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,414
Wanna tell me
what that is?

333
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,252
Oh my God.

334
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,691
That's not paint,
Mr. Poole.

335
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,525
And we did not
put it there.

336
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,996
So what is it?

337
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,727
It's blood.

338
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,735
It's the holy blood.

339
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,396
- Blood?
- Yes.

340
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,337
Okay.

341
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,035
- Oh my God.
- Let me tell you something.

342
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,010
All three of you are
old enough to know better

343
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,445
and I'm especially
disappointed in you.

344
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,886
Sick of it.

345
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,083
Please just leave me alone,
all right?

346
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,622
Blood.

347
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,234
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

348
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,440
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

349
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,010
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

350
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,418
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

351
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,112
¶ I got my head checked ¶

352
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,325
¶ By a jumbo jet ¶

353
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,328
¶ It wasn't easy ¶

354
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,166
¶ But nothing is ¶

355
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,260
¶ No ¶

356
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,134
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

357
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,402
¶ When I feel heavy metal ¶

358
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,068
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

359
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,134
¶ And I'm pins
and I'm needles ¶

360
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,645
¶ Whoo hoo ¶

361
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,909
¶ Well, I lie
and I'm easy ¶

362
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,917
¶ All of the time but
I'm never sure ¶

363
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,579
¶ When I need you ¶

364
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,487
¶ Pleased to meet you ¶

365
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,296
¶ Oh, yeah. ¶

366
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,662
Thank you.

367
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,503
Ooh! Oops.

368
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,129
- "Oops?"
- Sorry.

369
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,663
Oh, I missed.

370
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,141
You... you missed?

371
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,667
Eh, let me just
try again.

372
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:41,838
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,575
Okay.

374
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,778
Damn it. Jesus.
Sorry.

375
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,379
- Oh, damn.
- Eh!

376
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,186
You know, seriously,

377
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,216
do you want to go
practice and come back?

378
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,718
Maybe warm up on, like, an orange?
What's the story?

379
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,527
You know, at this point, I'm just like,
"A razor blade and a coffee cup,

380
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,500
I'll do it myself."
You know what I mean?

381
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,968
One more time.

382
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,800
It's just...
this is the one.

383
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,068
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,735
Okay, just relax.
Okay?

385
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,505
I feel it.

386
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,944
Okay.

387
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,144
- Ah, got it.
- Got it?

388
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,583
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

389
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,553
Ouch! How many times
did she hit you?

390
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,889
Uh, three or four.
I actually kinda lost track.

391
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,895
Three or four, huh?
She's getting better.

392
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,897
She got some practice.

393
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,092
Let me just run through
a couple of standard Q and A.

394
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,864
- You sleeping okay?
- I could use a little more, yeah.

395
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,394
Diet good?

396
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,030
I eat, yeah.

397
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,041
Exercise?

398
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,736
Uh, you know,
here and there.

399
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,335
So no?

400
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,903
- Well...
- Other than that, Mr. Poole,

401
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,414
you're doing fine.

402
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,245
I'd probably try
a little more exercise.

403
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,685
Maybe some yoga?
Or Pilates?

404
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,883
I'll call you in a few days when
your blood and urine come back.

405
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,101
I can help you
over here.

406
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,925
Hope you're not using
that as a mixer.

407
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,057
- Huh?
- 'Cause you're not getting vodka.

408
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,828
Oh, yeah.

409
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,828
Did you know that in 1985,

410
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,601
Gorbachev, right after he became
the party's general secretary,

411
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,632
tried to eradicate
vodka in Russia?

412
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,507
The people wouldn't
have it, though.

413
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,843
Isn't that weird?
I mean...

414
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,178
something like 30,000
Russians die a year

415
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,616
from alcohol poisoning,
but the people,

416
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,142
they want what
they want.

417
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,882
Yeah.

418
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,493
What's wrong with you?

419
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,999
Hmm?

420
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,974
Well, I don't mean
to be rude.

421
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,476
It's just that...

422
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,205
something is clearly
wrong with you.

423
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,304
I don't know if you're sad
or angry or both,

424
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,713
but you're not normal.

425
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,481
I thought maybe you might
want to talk about it.

426
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,014
You want me to tell you
why I'm sad and angry

427
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,049
while you're ringing up
my bottles of bleach?

428
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,857
So it is both...
sad and angry.

429
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,386
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

430
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,058
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

431
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,828
I was indulging you.

432
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,733
Okay? I was being polite.

433
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,501
Okay, indulge me
some more.

434
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,907
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Why don't you just ring my stuff up,

435
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,968
all right? Jesus.

436
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,536
I mean, I appreciate
your concern,

437
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,571
but I'd just like to
get out of here.

438
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,174
- All right?
- Okay.

439
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,153
I'm sorry I asked.

440
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,554
Don't be.

441
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,759
It's okay to be sad,
you know.

442
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,329
I mean, I've been
really sad before.

443
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,340
Sometimes...

444
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,605
you have to be sad to remind
yourself that you're alive.

445
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,540
Better than feeling
nothing, right?

446
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,691
It's not coming off, huh?

447
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,961
No.

448
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,230
No, it isn't.

449
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,365
I, uh, think I might have
even made it worse.

450
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,036
You, uh, you got
any suggestions?

451
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,046
Um, no.

452
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,571
But if it's what
Esperanza says it is,

453
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,108
then I guess it's gonna take a little
bit more than a bottle of bleach.

454
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,816
Yeah, well,
Esperanza's wrong.

455
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,315
So you aren't in
so much doubt.

456
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,660
You really think that's
the face of Christ?

457
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,666
Actually,

458
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,066
from this angle, it looks
a little bit like you.

459
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:35,232
I mean,
an abstract version.

460
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,400
I guess.

461
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,501
It's just a stain.

462
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,603
It's a bad stain.

463
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,136
Well, if you can't
get it off,

464
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,978
I guess it'll be something
to remember you by.

465
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,779
What?

466
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,786
Well, you're not gonna
live here that long, right?

467
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:55,253
Esperanza, she's like the local
newspaper around here.

468
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,023
I think she cornered
the real estate agent

469
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,361
and so we got
the lowdown on you.

470
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,833
Yeah.

471
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,804
So... so what are you doing? Buying it,
selling it and making a profit?

472
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,331
Yeah.

473
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,173
Yeah, something like that.

474
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,374
Well, don't sell it
to any weirdoes, okay?

475
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,644
No.

476
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,049
I won't.

477
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,282
Okay, well,
good luck with the face.

478
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,721
Thanks.

479
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,315
Or whatever it is.

480
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,000
Listen to me.
The man is clearly an atheist.

481
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,735
And he's not very nice.

482
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,539
The two go hand in hand.

483
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,411
Well, those without faith

484
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,348
sometimes need a little help.

485
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,543
That's it.

486
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,314
Psst, psst.

487
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,617
Now what are you doing?

488
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,027
- Your lawn is so sloopy.
- Sloopy?

489
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,429
- Yeah.
- Look, this is ridiculous.

490
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,731
Okay, people just don't go around
helping one another for no reason,

491
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,397
so just tell me
what it is you're doing.

492
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,429
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

493
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,305
Just tell him.
Just ask him.

494
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,469
Ask me what?

495
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,541
She wants to bring
the church in

496
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,481
to test the face
in your backyard,

497
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,915
to see if it's a miracle.

498
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,384
You've got to
be kidding me.

499
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,444
Nope. She's crafty like that.

500
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,388
- Aren't you?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,517
I didn't catch your name,
but anyways...

502
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,225
Listen to me, okay?

503
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,461
You can build me
a goddamn gazebo back there

504
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,299
and I still wouldn't let you
and your crazy church friends

505
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,498
into my house. All right?

506
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,669
So that face, whatever
you happen to think it is,

507
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,905
is a stain.

508
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,573
It's not a miracle.

509
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,081
Okay?

510
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,515
How can you say that?

511
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,179
Look, I really don't want
to talk about it,

512
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,949
so I just came out here
to give you that.

513
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,321
I just found it, so...

514
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,991
Oh my God.

515
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,258
Why did you have to
go and do that?

516
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,596
Um, why are you crying?
I just... I'm sorry.

517
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,465
I just found that.

518
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,333
That's Leo.

519
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,204
He was her boyfriend
before he died.

520
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,208
He lived in your house.

521
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,107
He was such a good man.

522
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,545
Well, look, there's
a cigar box full of them under the sink,

523
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,049
so you can come by
and get 'em when you want 'em.

524
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,884
He was so handsome.

525
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,729
I... I never thought
I'd find someone like him.

526
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,558
I... I was ready to...

527
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,538
to just be old alone.

528
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,542
I never married.

529
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,573
Never found anyone.

530
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,548
Then one day,

531
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,381
three years ago or so,

532
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,783
Leo came here.

533
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,991
And that was it.

534
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,054
Years of being alone

535
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,361
and one minute...

536
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,135
manages to take it all away.

537
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,271
A lifetime of sadness and...

538
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,006
suddenly

539
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,505
I couldn't even remember

540
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,247
what it was like to be sad.

541
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,756
And then he died.

542
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,435
And I remember.

543
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,940
And...

544
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,370
I pray to God

545
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,642
to help me stop

546
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,842
feeling that pain

547
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,878
and let me know

548
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,412
that he was okay.

549
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,927
And now...

550
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,828
the face appears...

551
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,997
the face of God.

552
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,841
Look,

553
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,680
Esperanza...

554
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,186
I want you to be
very honest with me.

555
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,713
Okay?

556
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:32,686
You really think that
that stain out there

557
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,324
is the answer
to all your prayers?

558
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,493
Do you?

559
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,738
So what exactly is it that
you want the church to do?

560
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,606
Just come and test
the wall.

561
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,947
Test the blood.

562
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,852
And to see what it is.

563
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,289
And if it's nothing,
then it's nothing

564
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,816
and I won't
bother you again.

565
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,022
I promise, really.

566
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,998
All right.

567
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,008
Just one day.
That's it.

568
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,533
I mean it.
One day.

569
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,246
Thank you, Mr. Poole.

570
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,873
Thank you.

571
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,406
You're welcome.

572
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,678
Thank you.

573
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,583
You'll see.
You'll see.

574
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,092
Everything happens
for a reason.

575
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:48,037
Esperanza,
llevélo al dentro.

576
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,836
- Gracias.
- Who's that guy?

577
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,276
He has to open up the wall and look
at what's behind the stain

578
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,507
to be sure it's not
man-made.

579
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,947
We'll repair it.
It'll look as good as new. Don't worry.

580
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,417
No, don't repair it.
It's okay.

581
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,512
Don't be silly, Mr. Poole. We're not
gonna leave a hole in the wall.

582
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,682
Doesn't matter.

583
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,954
I'm not gonna be here
that long.

584
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,601
You know, Father Salizar,
the house was re-stuccoed

585
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,201
before I moved in,
so that's it.

586
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,644
There's really not
a lot to talk about.

587
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,307
Maybe not about the house.

588
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,946
Why did you say you were
not gonna be here that long?

589
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,249
I don't really want
to talk about it.

590
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,452
Oh, yeah, you do.

591
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,757
Oh, I do?

592
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,626
Otherwise you wouldn't
have mentioned it.

593
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,656
Let me ask you
a question.

594
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,397
What makes you think
you know me that well?

595
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,340
I don't think that.

596
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,641
I just think anybody with two eyes
could see that something is wrong,

597
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,115
- like you're...
- Sad and angry?

598
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,310
Yeah.

599
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,012
Something like that.

600
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,520
Yeah.

601
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,614
I'm a good listener.

602
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,627
Yeah? Me too.

603
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,113
I just think anybody with two eyes

604
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,783
could see that something
is wrong.

605
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,590
- Like you're...
- Sad and angry?

606
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,657
Yeah.

607
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,996
Something like that.

608
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,901
I just think anybody
with two eyes

609
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,499
could see that something
is wrong,

610
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,570
- like you're...
- Sad and angry?

611
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,814
Yeah.

612
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,715
Something like that.

613
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,104
What are you doing
in there?

614
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,599
Wow.

615
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:10,334
You really like
this place.

616
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,290
You don't talk,
do you, Millie?

617
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,819
It's okay.

618
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:37,493
Sometimes I don't like
to talk either.

619
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,332
You know?

620
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,008
I ought to go.

621
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,581
Okay?

622
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,948
I'd love to sit here and visit
with you, but I just can't.

623
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:01,485
I got a pretty long journey
ahead of me.

624
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,159
I wish I could stay
and talk with you.

625
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,562
I just don't have
the time.

626
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,962
Mr. Poole? Uh...

627
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,832
I... I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, but...

628
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,329
Well, I have something
for you.

629
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,176
How'd you know
this was the one?

630
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,982
I know everything
about this neighborhood.

631
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,512
You should know that
by now.

632
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,105
This used to be my room.

633
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,171
Mr. Poole, are you okay?

634
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,874
This used to be my room.

635
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,281
This is the last place
I remember being happy.

636
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,455
Even then
I can barely remember.

637
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,643
This is the room where they
used to scream at each other.

638
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,272
Mmm.

639
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:20,222
It's a strange thing
about standing here again.

640
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:25,031
It's doing absolutely nothing
for me, you know?

641
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,066
Mr. Poole,

642
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,474
I'm sorry it wasn't
what you hoped.

643
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,000
Don't be.

644
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,842
It never is.

645
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,780
But thank you.

646
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,841
This was very generous.

647
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,442
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

648
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,922
What did you expect?

649
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,447
You can't go to the past
to fix the present.

650
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,255
You sound like
a fortune cookie.

651
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,360
Cookies don't talk.

652
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,767
Now...

653
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,271
at least now you know.

654
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,036
Know what?

655
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:09,444
To come back to
the place you grew up.

656
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,641
Yeah.

657
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,377
Now I know.

658
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,717
It's like nothing.

659
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,189
You find out
there's nowhere to hide.

660
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,059
¶ Shadows are falling ¶

661
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,190
¶ And I been here
all day ¶

662
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:35,663
¶ It's too hot to sleep ¶

663
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,675
¶ And time is
running away ¶

664
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,377
¶ I feel like my soul has ¶

665
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,680
¶ Turned into steel ¶

666
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,151
¶ I've still got the scars ¶

667
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,126
¶ That the sun
didn't heal ¶

668
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,259
¶ There's not even
room enough ¶

669
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,202
¶ To be anywhere ¶

670
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,672
¶ It's not dark yet ¶

671
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,202
¶ But it's gettin' there. ¶

672
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,663
Millie?

673
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,740
Hey.

674
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,477
Come out, honey.
It's too late to be playing games.

675
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,624
Where are you, Millie?

676
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,185
Where are you, Millie?

677
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,758
Millie?

678
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,204
Millie?

679
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,832
Millie?

680
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,863
What are you doing?

681
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,541
Honey?

682
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,221
Hey, Millie.

683
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,089
Millie.

684
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,228
Hey.

685
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,204
What is it?

686
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,909
Hey, what did you say?

687
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,176
What?

688
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,876
Hey.

689
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,948
What did you say?

690
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,185
Mama.

691
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,198
Mommy?
Can you hear me?

692
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,224
We're okay.

693
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,260
I love you so so much.

694
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,905
I'm sorry.

695
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,906
I'm so sorry, baby.

696
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,346
I'm sorry.

697
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,077
Mommy's here.

698
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,608
Mommy's right here.

699
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,852
Come on.
Let's go.

700
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,758
Hey, let's go home.

701
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,287
Thanks.

702
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,422
What happened out there?

703
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,858
You tell me.

704
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,570
She hasn't said a word
in over a year,

705
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,575
ever since her father left.

706
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,544
I mean, she loved him
so much.

707
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,175
And it's just been...

708
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,183
so unfair for her.

709
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,812
I mean, I... I couldn't
even get her out of bed

710
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,118
when this
whole thing started.

711
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:24,116
She just kind of
turned inside herself

712
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,824
and couldn't find
her way out.

713
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,924
I took to every kind
of doctor... therapists,

714
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,833
psychologists,

715
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,272
psychiatrists, and pretty much
everyone... nothing.

716
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,266
They'd just run down the list...
depression, post-traumatic

717
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,677
whatever...

718
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,148
abandonment.

719
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,516
And after a while,
she got a little better,

720
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,681
but she just
wouldn't talk.

721
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,521
Maybe she just didn't
have anything to say.

722
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,652
Maybe she wasn't ready
until now.

723
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,790
Maybe. But she touched
that wall and she...

724
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,357
You think she spoke because
she touched the wall?

725
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,494
No, I'm not saying that,
but that's what happened.

726
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:10,700
I mean, she touched it
and she talked.

727
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,403
And I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

728
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,844
Dawn, I think it's great
that Millie spoke.

729
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,906
But I think you
should realize

730
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,215
it was a completely
random event.

731
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,416
Things just... they don't
happen like that in real life.

732
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,017
I mean, if they did,
then I wouldn't...

733
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,925
You wouldn't what?

734
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,961
Ever feel like things
just happen for no reason?

735
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,364
That you're just kind of
going along for the ride

736
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:47,900
and there's just
nothing you can do?

737
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,011
I need to
tell you something.

738
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,352
What?

739
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,060
I want to tell you so that
I'm not the only one that knows.

740
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,218
Henry, this is so unheard of
here in the States.

741
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,096
I mean, it happens.

742
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,000
- But this disease...
- Disease?

743
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,774
It steamrolls
through the system.

744
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,770
Stopping it at this point...

745
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,650
You're saying
I'm gonna die.

746
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,256
Yes.

747
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,132
Mr. Poole.
Mr. Poole,

748
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,644
are you okay?
Mr. Poole?

749
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,409
Sorry.
The door was open.

750
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,747
That doesn't mean you can
just walk through it.

751
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,514
I need to talk to you.

752
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,045
No. No, you don't, actually,

753
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,320
'cause I know exactly
what you're gonna say.

754
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,886
No, you don't exactly.

755
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,923
So I guess you heard
what happened last night.

756
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,160
Now you think
that little girl spoke

757
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,570
because she touched
the wall?

758
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,939
And now we're all supposed to believe
that the Second Coming's happening

759
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,171
in my backyard.

760
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,942
And the next thing you know,
this whole goddamn street...

761
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,940
sorry... turns into a carnival
with every holy-roller freak

762
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,510
within a 100-mile radius
lined up around the block

763
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,012
to touch or catch a glimpse
of my stucco job.

764
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,619
Well, it's not gonna happen.

765
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:54,027
And in no way did Millie
finally speaking

766
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,259
have anything to do
with her touching the wall,

767
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,358
and you know that.

768
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:02,531
And God only knows... and I use
the phrase very loosely, believe me...

769
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,769
who knows what it was that caused her
to get up at 3:00 in the morning

770
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,300
and wander over here
and start palming the wall

771
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,142
like her life
depended on it?

772
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,239
- It was me.
- What was you?

773
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,410
I told her the wall would
take away her suffering

774
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,818
if... if she just had faith.

775
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,321
Why would you do that?

776
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,153
- It worked, no?
- No.

777
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,989
She worked. Maybe your
insane pep talk got to her,

778
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,790
but she got here
on her own.

779
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,957
Why it's so hard
for you to believe

780
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,229
that something like this
could happen?

781
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,293
Why is it so important
to you that I believe

782
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,997
that something like that
could happen?

783
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,972
- Because it...
- Because I'll tell you.

784
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,408
Because if you can convince me,
then suddenly your beliefs

785
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,741
become more real. Right?

786
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,271
The more people you can get to
jump on your God's-on-the-wall train,

787
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,443
the more your mission's made.
So until you get me

788
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,079
to swallow your world
and believe what you believe,

789
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,783
you'll never have the kind
of faith you want to have.

790
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,257
You'll always have
a little bit of doubt.

791
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,023
You'll... you'll never
know if you're quite right.

792
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,121
You'll always kind of
be wondering if it's real.

793
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,133
You'll always be sitting over
there waiting for that man

794
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,362
to come waltzing back
in from the dead.

795
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,169
And that's sad.

796
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,505
That's really sad.

797
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:17,946
I'm just trying
to help.

798
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,539
Just like that.

799
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:20,981
Yeah?

800
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,222
Esp...

801
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,990
Esperanza?

802
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,562
- Hey.
- Hey.

803
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,591
How you doin'?

804
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,427
I'm good.

805
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,167
Just getting some air.

806
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,107
I just wanted
to thank you

807
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,168
for helping me
with Millie last night.

808
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,112
So...

809
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,774
I made you some cookies.

810
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,283
Thank you.

811
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,946
It was Millie's idea.

812
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,954
- How is she doing?
- She's really good.

813
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:39,553
I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

814
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,267
You wanna go
for a walk?

815
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,667
Yeah.

816
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,278
Mmm, just came out of the oven,
like, 10 minutes ago.

817
00:56:56,312 --> 00:57:00,942
¶ Her fingers touch
upon my lips ¶

818
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:04,943
¶ It's a morning yearning ¶

819
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,822
¶ It's a morning
yearning ¶

820
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,224
¶ Pull the curtains shut ¶

821
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,059
¶ And try to keep it dark ¶

822
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,999
¶ But the sun is burning ¶

823
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,528
¶ The sun is burning ¶

824
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:39,278
¶ Baby crying kept us
up all night ¶

825
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:43,418
¶ With her morning yearning ¶

826
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,295
¶ With her
morning yearning ¶

827
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:56,096
¶ Morning yearning... ¶

828
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,438
I just wish I could tell you that
everything was gonna be all right.

829
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,239
That's okay.

830
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,088
Now what?

831
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,631
Now I go home.

832
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,861
And then...

833
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,063
I wish I didn't.

834
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,676
¶ Like a summer rose ¶

835
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,584
¶ I'm a victim of the fall ¶

836
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,319
¶ But am soon returning ¶

837
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,521
¶ Soon returning ¶

838
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:56,362
¶ Your love's the warmest
place the sun ever shines ¶

839
00:58:56,399 --> 00:59:00,495
¶ My morning yearning ¶

840
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:05,133
¶ My morning
yearning. ¶

841
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,121
My God.

842
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,489
Dear God.

843
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,007
Oh my God.

844
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,676
Patience.

845
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:54,987
What are you doing?
What's going on?

846
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,093
Are you... are you okay?

847
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,561
Yeah.

848
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,294
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

849
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,234
Everything is right.

850
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,066
What are you talking about?

851
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,969
I touched the face.

852
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:14,443
I just put
my hand on it.

853
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,906
And my whole body
got all warm.

854
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,645
And then I closed
my eyes.

855
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,949
I saw light everywhere.

856
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,154
I opened them...

857
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,663
and I could see.

858
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,710
I can see.

859
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,617
Look at that.

860
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,250
I can see perfectly.

861
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:08,095
The house numbers,
the license plate.

862
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,836
You know,
this is amazing.

863
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,503
- This is a miracle...
- Don't say that.

864
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,513
What? Miracle?

865
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,710
- Yeah.
- Come on, Mr. Poole,

866
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,911
what else could this be?

867
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,182
What?
A coincidence?

868
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,519
I mean, there are
no miracles, Patience.

869
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,548
I don't believe in them.

870
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,357
Imagine that there was
something wrong with you,

871
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,023
Mr. Poole.

872
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:45,557
And you did this seemingly
meaningless thing,

873
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,093
put your hand
on a wall,

874
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,538
and you were healed.

875
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,446
It's okay, Mr. Poole.
You don't have to say anything.

876
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,384
I gotta go.

877
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,387
I gotta go
tell my mom.

878
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,981
This is incredible!

879
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,626
Wow!

880
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,621
Hi.

881
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,963
Hey.

882
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,532
It's getting harder,
isn't it?

883
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,065
What's that?

884
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,908
To pretend this
isn't happening.

885
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,743
Hey!

886
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,077
- Hi.
- You're home.

887
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,672
Yeah.

888
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,310
Millie wants to know if you
want to come over and play.

889
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,320
Really?

890
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,915
Um, I just don't think
I'm up to it.

891
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,686
- Henry...
- I think I'll just stay here.

892
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,184
...are you actually considering
saying no to a six-year-old girl

893
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,357
with actual words coming
out of her little mouth?

894
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,033
Give me a minute.

895
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,004
We'll be in the yard.

896
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,742
Millie?

897
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,485
Dawn?

898
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,390
I got you, Mr. Poole.

899
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,053
Let's get him!

900
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,993
- Get him, Mommy, get him!
- I got him!

901
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,015
Oh, gosh.

902
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,358
I surrender.
You win.

903
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,386
I surrender.

904
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,662
¶ A million tears ¶

905
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,332
¶ A million codes ¶

906
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,001
¶ 1:15 ¶

907
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,101
¶ No way to go ¶

908
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,874
¶ You point your finger ¶

909
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,348
¶ To the moon ¶

910
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,011
¶ It looks like rain ¶

911
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,179
¶ Coming soon ¶

912
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,746
¶ I figured all ¶

913
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,520
¶ My worst fears ¶

914
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,361
¶ Believe in
childlike heroes ¶

915
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,889
¶ But I don't want to go ¶

916
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,061
¶ That way ¶

917
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,300
¶ Surrender hope ¶

918
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,933
¶ Again ¶

919
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:17,412
¶ I don't want to go
that way ¶

920
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,609
¶ Surrender hope ¶

921
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,585
¶ And faith ¶

922
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,610
¶ Again ¶

923
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,159
¶ Your blood, your fire ¶

924
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,792
¶ Your kiss good night ¶

925
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,268
¶ Your words, sometime ¶

926
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,137
¶ They might be mine ¶

927
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:48,837
¶ I feel this love
could cross the sand ¶

928
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:53,679
¶ I want to feel
that way ¶

929
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:03,984
¶ The fire might linger
and fade away ¶

930
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:08,520
¶ The shadows run
from yesterday ¶

931
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,431
¶ Like everyone ¶

932
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:16,268
¶ And everything
were memories ¶

933
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,830
¶ And then appears ¶

934
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,672
¶ Your blood, your fire ¶

935
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,111
¶ Your kiss good night ¶

936
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,614
¶ Your words, sometimes ¶

937
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,311
¶ They might be mine ¶

938
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:34,153
¶ I feel this love
could cross the sand ¶

939
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:38,388
¶ I want to feel that way ¶

940
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:43,490
¶ Oh, don't make me
feel that way ¶

941
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,864
¶ Oh, I want to feel ¶

942
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:49,997
¶ That way ¶

943
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,304
¶ Oh, I'm breaking through ¶

944
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,072
¶ These walls of steel ¶

945
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:00,913
¶ Pushing that wall
for something real ¶

946
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:05,410
¶ I'm falling far
and faster still ¶

947
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,014
¶ Wake up, wake up ¶

948
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:12,255
¶ Wake up,
wake up ¶

949
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,997
¶ Wake up, wake up ¶

950
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:20,025
¶ Everyone and everything ¶

951
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:24,699
¶ Everyone
and everything. ¶

952
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,382
- All right?
- Yeah.

953
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:42,118
You ready?

954
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,921
- Okay, good.
- Hey!

955
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,258
Hey.

956
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:47,694
Hi, Mr. Poole.

957
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,789
Hey, there, Millie.

958
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,800
That's a really nice dress.

959
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,359
You look really pretty.

960
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,871
You look nervous,
Mr. Poole.

961
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,773
Oh, no, I'm... I'm fine.

962
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,936
I, uh, no.

963
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,070
I'm just a little tired,
that's all.

964
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,707
You kind of wore me
out yesterday.

965
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,614
Um, honey,

966
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:11,085
do you want to
get in the car?

967
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,456
I wanted to, uh,
return your dish to you.

968
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,925
Oh, thanks.

969
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,723
They were really good.
Thanks a lot.

970
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,389
Glad you liked them.

971
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,796
Really shouldn't eat
so many at once, though.

972
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,960
- Not good for you.
- No, it doesn't matter.

973
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:28,595
I mean, I'm...
Uh... no, you're right.

974
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,935
I shouldn't.

975
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,441
Well, listen, I...

976
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,273
I was wondering and,
I don't know,

977
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,903
it might seem a little unfair

978
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,777
seeing as how you know
my situation,

979
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,305
but I thought that maybe,

980
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,341
if you were able to get
a sitter and you had the time...

981
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,818
- Yes.
- Really?

982
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,515
Oh, wait.

983
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,580
- What?
- Can I ask you?

984
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,320
Well, you did just
ask me, didn't you?

985
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,851
No, I mean, really ask you...

986
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,296
to finish asking you.

987
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,526
Okay.

988
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,329
Would you like to
get dinner with me?

989
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,131
I can't.
I'm busy.

990
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,001
- I didn't really want to any...
- No!

991
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:04,630
Henry, I'm kidding.

992
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,265
I would love to.

993
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,367
- Great.
- What about tomorrow?

994
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,605
It's perfect.

995
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,706
And it's not unfair
for you to ask.

996
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,115
Would it be worse
if you didn't?

997
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,052
Thank you.

998
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,715
Okay, so...

999
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,724
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1000
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,154
Have fun.

1001
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,519
Just this once, okay?

1002
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,888
Okay, I promise.

1003
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,517
Whatever you say, Mr. Poole.

1004
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,460
Thank you.

1005
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,588
What's wrong with her?

1006
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,599
Bursitis.

1007
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,567
And what about
the one next to her?

1008
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,263
There's nothing
wrong with her.

1009
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,704
So, preventative?

1010
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,401
Just in case.

1011
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,910
No, is it true that
the man in the red shirt

1012
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,936
just wants to be
a better dancer?

1013
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,908
Ay, Mr. Poole...

1014
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,448
Um, what about you,
Mr. Poole?

1015
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,255
Have you touched
the wall yet?

1016
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,395
No.

1017
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,805
But you will.

1018
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,950
Hey, Henry.

1019
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,114
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

1020
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,918
Funny.

1021
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,447
It's good to see you too.

1022
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,926
Oh, you...
you forgot these.

1023
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,826
I wanted to return
those to you.

1024
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,996
Thanks.

1025
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,967
Don't really need them, though.

1026
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:16,062
- Well.
- I guess they'll be a good souvenir

1027
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,471
- of my previous life.
- Yeah.

1028
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,309
So have you talked
to your doctor yet,

1029
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,608
- your eye doctor?
- Not yet.

1030
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,241
90 bucks for him to
tell me I'm 20/20.

1031
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,773
- Yeah.
- I already know that.

1032
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,012
But, I mean, you got to think
about all the write-ups

1033
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,283
in the medical journals. Right?

1034
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,790
You're still having
a pretty hard time buying into this,

1035
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,849
- aren't you?
- You gotta admit that it's...

1036
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,327
Do you know who
Noam Chomsky is?

1037
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,989
- The writer?
- Yeah.

1038
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,261
He's a linguist too, but...

1039
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,495
once in an interview, he said,

1040
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:50,801
"When questions of decision,
reason or choice of action arise,

1041
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:53,967
human science is at a loss."

1042
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,977
You actually believe that?

1043
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,708
He meant that not everything
needs an explanation.

1044
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,340
Sometimes things just happen

1045
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:04,511
because we choose
for them to.

1046
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:07,920
I chose to believe.

1047
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,087
Okay.

1048
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:15,855
Thanks.

1049
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,763
You're welcome.

1050
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,863
Well, this is about
the loveliest thing

1051
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,631
that I've ever seen.

1052
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:00,533
I can't wait to see
what's for dinner.

1053
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,237
Pizza!

1054
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,373
Perfect.

1055
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,411
This is... this is
very romantic, Henry.

1056
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,786
- Thanks.
- Really.

1057
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,723
Plastic utensils.

1058
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,920
Oh, yeah, family heirlooms.

1059
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,433
Can I ask you something?

1060
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:33,100
Sure.

1061
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:37,545
The other night,
you came home kinda late and...

1062
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,278
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

1063
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,806
It's fine.

1064
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:46,652
You want to know
where I was.

1065
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,950
Yes.

1066
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,457
I can't tell you.

1067
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,754
No, I...

1068
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,821
I'd just gone for a walk.

1069
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,731
And it's kind of funny

1070
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,669
'cause I'd just left the house
and started walking

1071
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:06,606
and I... I don't even think
I really knew where I was going

1072
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,974
till I got there.

1073
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,740
Where did you go?

1074
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,906
The river.

1075
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,143
I, uh...

1076
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,119
My parents,
they used to fight a lot.

1077
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,786
So I would go down there

1078
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,419
and even though it was
such a big place,

1079
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:30,160
I always... I always just
kind of felt very safe there.

1080
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,965
I'd kind of go there
and hide.

1081
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,936
And that's why...

1082
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,131
I came here.

1083
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,674
So just like that,
you disappeared.

1084
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,686
Since this thing
happened to me,

1085
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,053
every morning when I wake up,
the first thing I think about

1086
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:59,720
is... I mean, after I figure out
if I'm still actually here or not...

1087
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,397
The first thing I think about
is how much time

1088
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,060
that I have left.

1089
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,467
And all I can really do
is kind of...

1090
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,495
wait for the end.

1091
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,942
But this morning
when I woke up...

1092
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,575
the first thing
I thought about was you.

1093
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,242
And Millie.

1094
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,185
I'm just trying
to say that...

1095
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:33,354
that I'm enjoying this.

1096
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,194
I'm enjoying you
and being around you.

1097
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,005
And I just...

1098
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,701
it's a surprise
'cause I didn't ever think

1099
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,733
that I'd feel this way.

1100
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,119
Mommy?

1101
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,952
Millie, what are you
doing up?

1102
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,550
I can't sleep.

1103
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,561
Where is Esperanza?

1104
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,620
On the couch, snoring.

1105
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:13,363
Okay, let's go inside.
Um, do me a favor.

1106
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,962
Keep enjoying this.

1107
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,539
All right, honey.
Come on.

1108
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,544
Big sack of potatoes, huh?

1109
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,103
What are you doing
up so late, Millie?

1110
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,808
It's a school night.

1111
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,589
Okay, you want Jasper?

1112
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,785
Here he is.

1113
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:40,120
'Night.

1114
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,582
Sorry about that.

1115
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,488
It's like she doesn't want
to miss a thing now that...

1116
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,830
You know...

1117
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,927
I... I think maybe we should
just call it a night

1118
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,027
because this isn't...

1119
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,970
Henry.

1120
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,839
Sorry, this just isn't right.

1121
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,536
What are you talking about?

1122
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,512
Just you, me and everything

1123
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,104
all at once.
I just... I'm sorry.

1124
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,343
Hey, how can you say that?

1125
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,850
Henry.

1126
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,854
I know you're gonna die,

1127
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,367
but all that either of us have

1128
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,304
is right now,

1129
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:01,605
and we should pay
attention to that.

1130
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,218
I am paying attention.

1131
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,892
That's the problem.

1132
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,292
I'm sorry.

1133
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:38,479
¶ On an ocean white ¶

1134
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:45,542

01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:31,925
¶ Ooh ooh ¶

1142
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:38,963
¶ How come so ¶

1143
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:47,512
¶ So ¶

1144
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:56,957
¶ Sweetly, child,
you sing? ¶

1145
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,693
¶ And all the joy ¶

1146
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:07,168
¶ You bring to me ¶

1147
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:13,732
¶ Goes ¶

1148
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:22,316
¶ Goes our loved
ones home ¶

1149
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,180
¶ And I will... ¶

1150
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:33,683
¶ I will be waiting. ¶

1151
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,235
Henry!

1152
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,800
What's going on?

1153
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,370
- It's Millie.
- What is it?

1154
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,142
She's in here.

1155
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,345
I mean, she's been
like this all morning.

1156
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,514
She won't talk to me.
She won't look at me.

1157
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:02,784
Nothing.

1158
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,701
Millie?

1159
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,761
Can you hear me?

1160
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,072
Millie, you remember how
much fun we had the other day

1161
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,906
when we played?

1162
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,912
You remember that?

1163
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,315
Please.
Please say something.

1164
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:45,263
Henry's here.
He came over to play.

1165
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,736
Sweetie?

1166
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,398
Honey,
can you hear me?

1167
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:10,549
Henry, I know you're gonna die,

1168
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:14,995
but all that either of us
have is right now.

1169
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,631
And we should pay
attention to that.

1170
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,273
Was there any kind
of trauma?

1171
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,645
Anything which could have
set her back like this?

1172
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,535
You told me "one time."

1173
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,196
You promised me.

1174
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,035
Mr. Poole, God is
bigger than a promise.

1175
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,870
Just let me talk to you, yes?

1176
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,500
- Esperanza, please, let him go.
- No no no!

1177
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:36,840
- Mr. Poole, just let us...
- Listen to me, please.

1178
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,176
Listen to me!
Mr. Poole.

1179
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,875
- Holy shit.
- No no no no.

1180
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:47,410
No "holy shit." No "holy shit."
Holy... something else.

1181
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,855
Mr. Poole,
the test came back.

1182
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:52,325
Yeah, and what? And what?
There's no explanation for it, right?

1183
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,827
- No.
- It's a big surprise, huh?

1184
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,489
- No no, please...
- Yes, you're right.

1185
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,361
There is no explanation.
That's exactly right.

1186
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,923
You want to tell me
what's going on?

1187
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,197
Why all these people
are here? Huh?

1188
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,067
There here to see
something unexplainable.

1189
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:04,901
- Yeah?
- They're here to find some hope.

1190
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,270
Let me tell you something...

1191
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,366
I never should have let you
come here in the first place

1192
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,275
'cause this is insane.
You got people praying to the wall.

1193
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,404
- Excuse me, is this your house?
- Yeah!

1194
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,881
- This is my house.
- You know, you're a very lucky man

1195
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,713
- to have such a...
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm so lucky

1196
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,776
I ought to buy
a lottery ticket, shouldn't I?

1197
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,412
You're all just kind of
staring at the wall?

1198
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,013
Is that what you're doing?

1199
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,752
Hope can't save you.

1200
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,282
You understand that?

1201
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,954
It can't save you.
Or her

1202
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,725
or her or him!

1203
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:32,733
You understand that?
Hope isn't gonna save you!

1204
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:35,258
You know that.

1205
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,136
Please, Mr. Poole.

1206
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:44,410
No no no no no no, please.
Listen to me!

1207
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,937
Listen, it's a miracle.
It will do things...

1208
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,449
No no no no...
this is a gift from God!

1209
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,679
This is a gift from God!
No no... oh my God.

1210
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,914
I want this out of here!

1211
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:58,448
I don't want this stain
on my wall!

1212
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,656
I want...

1213
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,326
This doesn't save lives.

1214
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,097
Please.

1215
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:15,302
This doesn't save lives.

1216
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:20,508
¶ Oooh ¶

1217
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:29,182
¶ Sweetly, child,
you sing ¶

1218
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:36,428
¶ And all the joy ¶

1219
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,160
¶ You bring to me ¶

1220
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:46,003
¶ Goes ¶

1221
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:54,679
¶ Goes our
loved ones home ¶

1222
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,281
¶ And I will... ¶

1223
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:06,555
¶ I will be waiting ¶

1224
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:14,832
¶ On an ocean ¶

1225
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:23,708
¶ Sweetly, child,
you sing ¶

1226
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,642
¶ On an ocean... ¶

1227
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,381
Mr. Poole?

1228
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:39,825
¶ On an ocean... ¶

1229
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,419
Can you hear me?

1230
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:53,864
Mr. Poole,
the blood was real.

1231
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,677
Oh, God.

1232
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,109
Thank God you're okay.

1233
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,443
What are you
doing here?

1234
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,752
I've been waiting
for you to wake up

1235
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,623
to make sure you're okay.

1236
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,791
...Dios mio.

1237
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,161
What are you smiling at?

1238
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:57,069
At you.

1239
01:27:57,105 --> 01:28:00,074
Why did you not tell me,
Mr. Poole?

1240
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,666
Tell you what?

1241
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:03,609
About your secret
you had.

1242
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,613
Dawn explained it to me.

1243
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,847
What do you mean, "had"?

1244
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,114
I need to see a doctor!

1245
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:14,587
You need to get back in your room.

1246
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,283
- I need to see a doctor.
- Sir!

1247
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,315
Mr. Poole, no no no.
You should not be walking around.

1248
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:20,259
You need to get back to
your room... hey hey!

1249
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,128
Hey hey!
Mr. Poole.

1250
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:25,826
Please... okay.
Mr. Poole, just calm down.

1251
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,859
Mr. Poole...

1252
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,030
No no no no.
No no... don't do that.

1253
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:34,132
Mr. Poole, look at
your arm, Mr. Poole.

1254
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,167
- You're bleeding.
- Mr. Poole.

1255
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,674
Please.

1256
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,851
Please.

1257
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,872
Mr. Poole.

1258
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:12,004
Wake up.

1259
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,674
Mr. Poole?
Wake up.

1260
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:17,776
It's okay.
Wake up.

1261
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:27,054
Millie, did you just
say something to me?

1262
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,893
Mommy said
you're not sick anymore.

1263
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,872
I'm...

1264
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,999
I'm not gonna die?

1265
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,907
No, Henry.

1266
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:44,775
You're not.

1267
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,372
How can that be?

1268
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:50,851
Well, I told them what
was wrong with you

1269
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,615
and they checked.
And you're fine.

1270
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,919
You were never sick,
Henry.

1271
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:08,902
So... so I was
never gonna die?

1272
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,133
No no, we are all going to die,

1273
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,936
just not right now.

1274
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,775
And that is the miracle

1275
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,473
for you.

1276
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:26,416
after what I've done,

1277
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,319
the miracle's gone.

1278
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,620
No no no.

1279
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,888
Don't worry about that.

1280
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,919
It was here for as long

1281
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:37,988
as it needed to be here.

1282
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:39,556
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1283
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,593
Like everything
and everyone.

1284
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:49,474
I'm glad you're better,
Mr. Poole.

1285
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:55,578
Millie,

1286
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,481
I'm glad you're better too.

1287
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:08,186
You know, you should really
get some rest.

1288
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:10,197
Okay?

1289
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:12,324
We'll be outside
if you need us.

1290
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:14,231
Come on, honey.

1291
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:33,680
¶ I promise you will
get old ¶

1292
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:38,317
¶ I promised you
everything ¶

1293
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:43,319
¶ To protect you
wherever you go ¶

1294
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:48,461
¶ I'll give you
this diamond ring ¶

1295
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:53,873
¶ Just promise you
will remember ¶

1296
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:57,400
¶ The promise should
last forever ¶

1297
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:03,745
¶ Right up to
the dying embers ¶

1298
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:07,777
¶ Of the fire that
burns so slow... ¶

1299
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,471
- You're back.
- Yep.

1300
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:40,352
I'm home.

1301
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,379
What's left of it.

1302
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,284
What do you make
of all this?

1303
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:51,124
You're gonna live, Henry.

1304
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,792
Yeah.

1305
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,267
It's a gift.

1306
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:56,565
Yeah.

1307
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,629
Pretty miraculous, huh?

1308
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:04,411
I don't...
I don't know what it is.

1309
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:07,209
I don't know
if it was a mistake.

1310
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,806
I don't know.

1311
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,385
I don't think that
any of this

1312
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,983
was a mistake.

1313
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:25,860
What now?

1314
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:58,127
¶ It's a beautiful
thing to do ¶

1315
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:04,461
¶ Sometimes you just
have to walk away ¶

1316
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:07,736
¶ Remember I do love you ¶

1317
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:13,944
¶ Have courage in
what you say ¶

1318
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:18,941
¶ And promise you will
remember ¶

1319
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:23,616
¶ That promises
last forever ¶

1320
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:28,561
¶ Still after
the dying embers ¶

1321
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:33,401
¶ The fire that
burns so slowly ¶

1322
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,537
¶ Sometimes you just
have to walk away ¶

1323
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:56,284
¶ Sometimes you just
have to walk away ¶

1324
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:05,429
¶ Wishing today
was yesterday ¶

1325
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,205
¶ Yes, sometimes you just
have to walk away. ¶
