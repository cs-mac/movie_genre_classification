1
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,280
Who are you?

2
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:32,198
Hello, I'm Nancy Drew.
It's nice to meet you.

3
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:33,477
May I ask who you are?

4
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:36,800
- Guess.
- All right.

5
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,396
I'm guessing you two are working
with Lawrence McNabb...

6
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,598
...the locksmith,
he gives you the keys...

7
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,070
...and you're responsible
for the recent burglaries.

8
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:47,039
However, you should know
the DA is only interested in McNabb...

9
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,759
You two could make a deal with him.

10
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:53,272
- And that Charlie the security guard
is about to walk through that door.

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,519
Hi.

12
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,597
Listen to me. L'll get Pastor Murray
to drop the charges...

13
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,795
...if you agree to
some kind of counseling.

14
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,392
Anger issues don't just go away.

15
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:15,391
- I don't need a shrink.
- Yeah, you do.

16
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,196
He gets cranky when he hasn't eaten.

17
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,837
I told him, "Go have a snack."

18
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,155
I said, "Before we get here,
you better have a snack."

19
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,429
Oh, one summer,
we're on Fire lsland...

20
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:26,311
Not with that story again.

21
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,715
Hold on.

22
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,106
What's that?

23
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,115
My sleuth kit.

24
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:37,669
Flashlight, fountain pen, notebook,
magnifying glass, fingerprint powder...

25
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,554
...digital recorder...

26
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,185
...and one of Hannah's lemon bars.

27
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:54,464
Bess,
is Nancy okay?

28
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,068
Are you kidding?
She's loving it.

29
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,464
- Here he is.
- Nancy?

30
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,623
Hi, Ned.

31
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,591
I had this dream
during my nap today...

32
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:04,314
...you went to California,
met that guy on Smallville...

33
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,230
...and you got amnesia...

34
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:10,385
...and forgot you ever met me,
and then I turned into a squirrel.

35
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:14,030
Anyway, what do you
think that means?

36
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,469
Ned, can we talk about this later?
I'm just a little busy.

37
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,509
Yeah, sorry.
All right, okay.

38
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,025
Not appropriate, Ned.

39
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:22,864
You take naps?

40
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,026
What's going on?
Ls she okay?

41
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:28,025
Hey, now don't worry.
I just talked with her. She's doing fine.

42
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:29,467
Nancy's my best man.

43
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:33,428
I mean, she would be
if she were on the force.

44
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:39,585
Fine. Therapy.

45
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,105
Great.
L'll call the DA back.

46
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,622
I just wanna thank you, Nancy Drew.

47
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,900
I've always heard
the nicest things about you...

48
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,788
...the way you solve mysteries
and you help people.

49
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,338
Steve?
Please don't thank her for turning us in.

50
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,265
I think Crankenstein needs
another lemon bar.

51
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,860
I thought the Crankasaurus was extinct.

52
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,507
I don't know about this.

53
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:06,785
Well, I'm sorry, Cranky Doodle Dandy.

54
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:09,097
I can't do this.

55
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:10,701
Gary, we made a deal.

56
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,540
Deals go wrong.

57
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,902
Hey. Where is she?
We need her.

58
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,739
You take that side.

59
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,098
Hey, Gary, look.

60
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:39,618
Hey!

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,695
Let's get out of here.

62
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,777
It's Nancy!

63
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:50,659
Hi, everybody.

64
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,461
Hold it there.
Hold it right there.

65
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:17,054
Hold on, Nancy.
We got the fire department here.

66
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:19,576
That's all right, chief.
L'll be down in a jiffy.

67
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,891
Hang on, Nancy.

68
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,008
Are you okay?

69
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,618
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

70
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,691
In the sleuthing business,
this kind of thing happens all the time.

71
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,451
It really isn't a big deal.

72
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,176
It is a big deal.

73
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,815
I ran from the courthouse in the middle
of that eviction case, which the judge...

74
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,175
...he didn't appreciate.

75
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:00,607
Where is your car?

76
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,048
Around the corner.

77
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,487
Is now a better time?

78
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,125
Because I wanted to give you this.

79
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:14,368
Well, your hunch was right
on the nose, Nancy.

80
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,573
Just wish you could have
clued us in a little earlier.

81
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,772
- Safe as usual.
- All right, Nancy, right here.

82
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,927
Hi, Nancy.

83
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:24,974
- Thank you.
- Bye.

84
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,012
Nancy, what are we going to do
without you?

85
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,086
Lt's only for a few months.
L'll be back.

86
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,327
The image of your mother.
Do you remember her at all?

87
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:33,563
No.

88
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:37,443
She was such a lovely woman,
so kind and intelligent.

89
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,172
Just like you, Nancy.

90
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,125
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye-bye.

91
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,124
So long, Nancy.

92
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,286
Shall we all pray
for her safe journey to California?

93
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,010
Sure.

94
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,050
Dear Lord,
please watch over Nancy Drew...

95
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,170
...and protect her as she strives
to solve mysteries...

96
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:05,961
...that are beyond the abilities
of local law enforcement agencies.

97
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,360
Dad, I'm...

98
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:14,206
I want you to promise no more sleuthing,
at least while we're in California.

99
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:18,682
You'll go to school, shopping,
spend some time with teenagers.

100
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,047
It's what you're supposed to be doing.
Give it a try.

101
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,838
You know, I've always picked cases
that help people.

102
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,442
- Others first.
- That's right.

103
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,725
But this one is a little different.

104
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,358
If everything goes well,
I could start making some real money.

105
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:39,643
We have enough money, Dad.

106
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:41,480
L'll be the judge of that, thank you.

107
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:46,483
At any rate, I'm starting something new.
I can't be worried about...

108
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,325
How you doing, John?

109
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,604
Yeah, l'll meet you at the deposition
as soon as my train gets in.

110
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,122
Well, we don't have an airport out here.

111
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,605
I wish I was kidding.

112
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,964
This is a terrible development.

113
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,959
What are you gonna do?
You have a mystery to solve in la-la land.

114
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,321
L'll figure something out.

115
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,514
I hope.

116
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,564
Ned.

117
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:21,000
With all the commotion,
I didn't get to give you this.

118
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:27,794
I needed a new compass.
The old one's wobbly.

119
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:29,158
Thank you.

120
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,235
In case I'm not with you
on your birthday.

121
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:34,318
That's so sweet.

122
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,599
I just don't know if l'll get to use it.

123
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,192
Why?

124
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:42,640
My dad let me choose the house we're
gonna live in, so I chose one with...

125
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,360
With a mystery.

126
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:48,111
But not just any mystery. One of the
greatest unsolved cases of all time.

127
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:49,317
Dehlia Draycott.

128
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,314
The movie actress.

129
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:55,275
Before your time.
Twenty-five years ago...

130
00:08:56,801 --> 00:09:01,397
...at the height of her fame,
she disappeared for five months.

131
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,597
Nobody knew where.

132
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,469
And when she came back,
she threw a giant party.

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,678
She never went downstairs
to greet her guests.

134
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,551
She was found floating in the pool.

135
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,788
Dead.

136
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,673
Gee, that sounds like fun.

137
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,274
I know, right?

138
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:23,318
But I didn't tell my dad about the house
and he's not letting me do any sleuthing.

139
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,436
There was a hostage situation.
I can kind of see his point, but...

140
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,271
Hi, Ned. Bye, Ned.
Gotta scoot, Nancy.

141
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:33,033
Mr. Drew.
Some pfeffernüsse, just in case...

142
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,587
...and some ginger cupcakes,
your favorite.

143
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,588
You're gonna get hungry,
I know it.

144
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,315
- Nancy, hold on.
- Thank you so much.

145
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,355
- Bye, guys.
- See you soon.

146
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:45,872
- And have a safe train ride, okay?
- L'll miss you.

147
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,345
Don't get hurt.
Please, you have to keep in contact.

148
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:52,312
Ned? Don't worry
about that guy from Smallville.

149
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,194
- He's not my type.
- Nancy.

150
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:56,945
You have a type?

151
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:03,946
Chief McGinnis! I just wanna let you
know I'm not sleuthing anymore. Bye.

152
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:09,944
Nancy Drew not sleuthing anymore?
I don't think so.

153
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:27,137
Hi, this is Carson Drew.
I'm running a little late.

154
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:30,583
Dad? Don't you think people
who talk on cell phones miss things?

155
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,102
- Like what, hon?
- Like that woman in the street?

156
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,985
Mr. Drew? Nancy?

157
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,295
Yes.

158
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:43,145
Hi. Thank you so much
for not running me over.

159
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,865
I'm Barbara Barbara,

160
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,899
You're here.

161
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm gonna get right out of your way.

162
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,017
How do you love it?

163
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:12,418
Gorgeous.

164
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,775
Welcome.

165
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:26,501
It's not exactly what I had
in mind, especially given the price.

166
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,700
Well, as I told your daughter on the
phone, you do pay a premium for my...

167
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,291
Oh, I am such an oaf.

168
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,693
As you were saying, you pay a premium
for history, architectural significance.

169
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:40,579
I mean, Dad, look at this woodwork.

170
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,617
- Yeah, what she said.
- Who's this?

171
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,657
Dehlia Draycott, the great film legend.
This was her home.

172
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,458
Didn't your daughter tell you?

173
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,134
We've both been somewhat busy.

174
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,295
Oh, excuse me. Gotta... Yeah.

175
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,733
Hello?

176
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,531
Do you know what? With a little
tweaking, you could be adorable.

177
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,687
Thank you?

178
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,816
Yes, you're just a makeover
waiting to happen.

179
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,934
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist.

180
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:12,294
Oh, come on, let's go upstairs.
I can't wait to show you.

181
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,495
Did you hear something?

182
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,653
I suddenly got a chill.

183
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:33,614
Have a look around, if you want.

184
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,287
Don't be afraid.

185
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,245
Please don't be afraid of me.

186
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:47,933
I'm here to help you.

187
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:52,807
You don't understand, I want to...
I want to help you.

188
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:00,532
I love that.
They fall for it every time.

189
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:04,971
That's a projector.
It's from one of her old movies.

190
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,322
There are so many booby traps
all over this house.

191
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:10,211
People get so scared sometimes,
they wet their pants.

192
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,647
Where's the gift shop?

193
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,764
That's the spirit.

194
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:19,241
Miss Barbara Barbara, I know I called
asking for a house with a mystery...

195
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,171
...but things have changed, and...

196
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,641
It's complicated,
but we're gonna need a different house.

197
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,599
Honey cheeks.
Read the fine print.

198
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,086
No refunds, no exchanges.

199
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,721
And besides, you know, there's nothing
else available, in your price range.

200
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:43,037
I'm gonna use the gents',
then run to that deposition.

201
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,201
Watch this.

202
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:56,006
Something just happened in the
bathroom which I'm at a loss to explain.

203
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,441
The house has a haunted theme.

204
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,684
It's like a theme park.
It's so fun, right, Dad?

205
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:03,236
No.

206
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:08,636
Oh, did I mention?
There's a strange caretaker.

207
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,524
He lives in an apartment down the hill.

208
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,205
What's your name?

209
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:15,676
Leshing. Let me know
if there's anything I can do for you.

210
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,643
Nancy Drew.
Thank you very much.

211
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:22,319
Leshy?
We need to talk about the lawn.

212
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,717
Dad?

213
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,521
Mr. Leshing?

214
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,393
Someone stole my moccasins
and an important folder.

215
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,756
Mysteries just find you, don't they?

216
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:16,232
I'm letting the professionals handle
this one. I'm on hold with the L.A.P.D.

217
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,119
Calling the police to solve a crime.

218
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,599
I like it.

219
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,230
It's been 57 minutes.
They must be having a busy night.

220
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,434
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.
- I'm fine!

221
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,635
A favorite pair of moccasins
and a Pee Chee folder have been stolen.

222
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,358
Please send an officer over
immediately.

223
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,232
Someone must have told a joke
over at the precinct.

224
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,192
Yeah. That's it.

225
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:55,672
Because it would be irresponsible for
a police department to laugh at a crime.

226
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:58,784
You're right.

227
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,068
Dad?

228
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,225
- Hello?
- Leshing, this is Nancy.

229
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:27,591
I needed to prove your whereabouts.
Go back to sleep.

230
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,989
Someone's in the house.

231
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,585
How did you get here so quickly?

232
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,660
Lf you're accusing me...

233
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:51,424
The attic.

234
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,778
How is it possible for someone
to be in the attic...

235
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,622
...and escape
while we're coming up the stairs?

236
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:18,938
Ls there another staircase?

237
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,341
No.

238
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,547
Do you believe in ghosts, Mr. Leshing?

239
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,947
I am a ghost.

240
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:30,582
The Four Seasons isn't haunted.
What do you say?

241
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,024
Dad, you hate hotels.

242
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,938
Spa treatments.
Room service.

243
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,941
These books must have been Dehlia's.

244
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,776
May I borrow some?

245
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,657
Lf it were up to me, I wouldn't let
anybody in the house, period.

246
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,896
But you're paying the rent,
so do what you want.

247
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,294
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

248
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,945
Good night.

249
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,022
I like him.

250
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,059
So turns out there's a mystery
here after all.

251
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:08,740
Dad, that mystery stuff is so boring
to me now. I've completely moved on.

252
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:13,656
That was really just a phase, you know,
like papier-mâché or puppets.

253
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:16,497
It's over, done, finished,
gone forever.

254
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:17,982
Got it.

255
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:30,498
Z, I'm sorry to have vanished
like I did.

256
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:35,099
I know you have been looking for me.
Something important happened last week.

257
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:39,652
I can 't be the Dehlia I was anymore.
I'm writing a new will.

258
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:43,530
I need to make provisions
for someone else. D.

259
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:49,173
D is Dehlia, but who's Z?
Who's the "someone else"?

260
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,129
No.

261
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,619
You're not sleuthing.
No, sirree.

262
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,578
You're just reading a letter
that happens to be a major clue...

263
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,492
...in a fantastically famous mystery.

264
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,411
That means nothing to you.

265
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,649
You're gonna go to bed
and be reasonable, Nancy.

266
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:06,936
You're going to a new school.
You're gonna make wonderful friends.

267
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,375
You're a normal teenager.
You really are.

268
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,051
Yeah.

269
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,571
- Yes.
- The quadratic formula:

270
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:02,168
Negative-B plus or minus
the square root of B-squared...

271
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,053
...minus four A-C, all over two A.

272
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:27,081
I only had enough time
for 12 flying buttresses.

273
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,082
But in actuality, there are 26.

274
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,521
Then l'll be brief.
O happy dagger!

275
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:36,720
Thank you. Please.

276
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:40,007
This is thy sheath.
There rust, and let me die.

277
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,638
The show is Pippin.
And I just wanted your name.

278
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,957
Hey, baby. How you doing?

279
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,677
- Hi.
- Hello.

280
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:50,038
Hi, I noticed you were wearing
penny loafers.

281
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,354
Did your podiatrist suggest them
or are you being ironic?

282
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:54,882
I like old-fashioned things.

283
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,761
Oh, we've noticed.

284
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,720
Penny loafers are practical.

285
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:04,558
Well, we may be on the brink
of a penny loafer fashion moment...

286
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:06,995
...or not.

287
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,117
That was awesome.

288
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,274
- Give that cupcake back.
- Shut up.

289
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,833
Come on.

290
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,837
That's a good cupcake.

291
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,117
Principal Fineman, I feel strongly...

292
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,750
...students should be given a more
nutritious alternative in the cafeteria.

293
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,909
Perhaps a salad bar.

294
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,989
A salad bar. Terrific idea.

295
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,798
Hi. I think the principal
wants to yell at me or something?

296
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,029
Let's see. Oh, yes.

297
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,475
There may be lead paint in
the shed next to the volleyball courts...

298
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,676
...but I can't be certain until
the lab report comes back.

299
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:49,193
Lead paint.
That's bad, right?

300
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:50,907
Very bad.

301
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:53,148
But there's no need to panic.

302
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,677
Finally, I urge you
to offer a course in CPR.

303
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:00,708
I noticed it wasn't
part of your curriculum.

304
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:03,232
I'm certified and I have found
great peace of mind...

305
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,228
...knowing I may
save a life someday.

306
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:13,195
So hot, so hot, so hot, hot!

307
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:31,386
Yeah, we know we're hot
Sorry that you're not

308
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,543
We go:

309
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:38,749
Cha-ching, where's the money?
Cha-ching, where's the money?

310
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,142
- Oh, my God!
- Corky!

311
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,667
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
No, my brother's choking!

312
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:56,429
My brother's choking!
Does anyone know CPR?

313
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,031
Does anyone know CPR?

314
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,582
I do. I know CPR.

315
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:02,628
Excuse me.

316
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:10,908
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

317
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,542
Oh, my God.

318
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:34,017
Oh, you idiot!

319
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:39,182
You were supposed to kiss her.
Lip-lock. That was the plan.

320
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:52,614
I'm looking forward to the journey.

321
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,289
And I don 't care
if a woman unaccompanied...

322
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:57,764
...is considered to be shameful.

323
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:03,089
I've done nothing wrong.
My heart is...

324
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:06,132
Yes? Your heart is?

325
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:07,773
Cut.

326
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:12,008
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I don 't know how much more time.

327
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:16,283
And action.

328
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,606
I'm looking forward to the journey...

329
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:24,162
...and I don 't care that...

330
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,290
- I feel sick. I need to stop.
- Cut.

331
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:34,889
What are you doing?

332
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:37,124
I'm sorry.

333
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:39,959
The door was unlocked.

334
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:43,282
The shutters had rusted closed,
and the bulbs were all burnt-out.

335
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:45,089
Leave it on.

336
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,242
I haven't been here
since the night she...

337
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,806
You were here the night she died?

338
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:02,087
How long did you work for her?

339
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:05,688
Year I got out of the service,
I went to work at the studio.

340
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:10,560
They sent me over here
to project a film for her...

341
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:13,720
...and she asked me to stay
and take care of her, so I did.

342
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:16,204
That was 1971.

343
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,446
When she disappeared,
did you know where she was?

344
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,080
No.

345
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:30,038
She never married
and she seemed to be very private...

346
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:34,597
...but there must have been a...
There must have been a man...

347
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:36,395
Someone she loved?

348
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:42,883
Every man who met her
fell in love with her.

349
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:45,524
It just couldn't be helped.

350
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,797
I just don't know
if she ever felt love herself.

351
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,072
Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry
about the weirdness the other day.

352
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,794
I have to say,
my feelings were a little bruised.

353
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:53,793
But, thank you, Corky.
An apology is the sign of a gentleman.

354
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,677
Inga roped me into the shenanigans.

355
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,511
She's my sister,
but I also think she might be the devil.

356
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:01,317
Also, you know, I thought
if you gave me mouth-to-mouth...

357
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:04,629
...it would be a fantastic way for us
to get to know each other.

358
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,754
The truth is, you're awesome.

359
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,630
By the way, did you know
there's a mystery to this house?

360
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:12,116
I know.

361
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,228
I only recently discovered that movies
aren't shot from beginning to end.

362
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,227
So I took the last movie
she ever made...

363
00:31:19,396 --> 00:31:22,627
...and reassembled the shots
in the order they were photographed.

364
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:27,791
Okay.

365
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,307
I just noticed something strange.

366
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:34,673
The last month before she disappeared,
she's only shown from here up.

367
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:40,306
Maybe she was pregnant.

368
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:43,712
She didn't have any kids.
Never married and no kids.

369
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:45,546
It's just a hunch.

370
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:50,344
Also, the photograph in this magazine
is dated just after her reappearance.

371
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:51,946
There's an X on her robe.

372
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:54,673
I believe that insignia will tell us
where she was hiding.

373
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,745
I've called the hospitals and hotels
that include the letter X...

374
00:31:57,913 --> 00:31:59,824
...but so far, nothing.

375
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:03,261
I need to talk to someone
who's an expert in clothing.

376
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:05,301
Oh, and one more thing.

377
00:32:06,352 --> 00:32:09,662
She's often with this man,
but he's always obscured.

378
00:32:09,872 --> 00:32:13,420
A hand at the edge of a picture,
a silhouette...

379
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,388
...even a blur.

380
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:20,019
I think she called him Z.
I have to find out who this man is.

381
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:23,660
I just have to solve this case.

382
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,579
What do you think?

383
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,619
I think the ability to sleuth
is an attractive quality in a woman.

384
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,426
Hey, don't they have a Costume
Department on the set of every film?

385
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,546
Yeah, but you should know
that movie people are kind of crazy.

386
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,221
Oh, goodness.
How crazy can they be?

387
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:50,185
- Really crazy.
- Dude, are we on yet?

388
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,578
No, I gotta be on one more...

389
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:54,623
You're fine.

390
00:32:54,828 --> 00:32:57,341
- Oh, I just had a question.
- And I'm all out of answers.

391
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,702
You look '50s. Go to set.

392
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,937
- But I was just wondering if maybe...
- Now!

393
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:06,896
Here we go. Okay, we're moving. We're
moving, people. We're on our way.

394
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,977
We are moving!

395
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:11,501
Hey, guys, this is good.
They got the feed up.

396
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:16,143
All right, let's just shoot the rehearsal.
Has anybody seen Mr. Fancy-Pants?

397
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,421
Right here, you idiot.

398
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,416
Nickname, I love a nickname.

399
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,860
It's not a nickname, Andy.
It's not a nickname.

400
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,617
You really are an idiot.

401
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,298
- All right.
- Copy that. On our way.

402
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,136
Okay, we're shooting the rehearsal!

403
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:31,023
- Stop with the bowing.
- Excuse me, sir. No, sir. No, l...

404
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:34,494
By the way, it's "action,"
not "begin the acting."

405
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,461
- When you're right, you're right.
- Action.

406
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:39,535
Locking it up! Last looks, everybody.
Last looks.

407
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:41,614
- Walking away. Walking away.
- Quiet, please.

408
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:44,092
And we're rolling.

409
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:45,298
- Rolling!
- We're rolling!

410
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:48,182
- You're cute.
- Thank you.

411
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:51,977
Okay, you hate crime, and action!

412
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,053
Hold him right there, boys.

413
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:59,539
Spider Weintraub.
As I live and breathe.

414
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:02,978
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney...

415
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,540
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but...

416
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,738
- What?
- I'm sorry. This just feels inauthentic.

417
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:08,890
Feels what?

418
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:12,689
Well, the scene takes place in the '50s,
but you're reading Miranda to the suspect.

419
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,218
Excuse me. Why in the name of sweet
Christmas is this tiny person talking?

420
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,217
Well, reading of Miranda
upon arrest wasn't law until '63.

421
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,653
Is that right?

422
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,696
The scene is still delicious, either way.

423
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,736
- What's your name, hon?
- Nancy Drew.

424
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,056
I'm Bruce.

425
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:36,767
All right, l'll tell you what, why don't
you direct the movie, Nancy Drew?

426
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,656
Oh, my God!

427
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:40,046
Should we cut?

428
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:45,448
Listen, Nancy, would you consider,
you know, directing this film?

429
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:48,847
Because we can
get rid of this guy in a second.

430
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,896
Is there a law against common courtesy
in Los Angeles?

431
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,616
Courtesy is so awesome.
I'm really into it.

432
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,289
In my book, courtesy counts.

433
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:58,686
I'd like to read that book, Nancy.

434
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,289
It's not an X.
They're palm trees.

435
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:13,130
Okay. What does that mean?

436
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,526
The insignia on her robe.

437
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,813
It's...

438
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:22,693
Something Palms.

439
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,766
Oh, now I get it.
Just kidding, I don't.

440
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:30,404
Southern Pines.
California Hot Springs. No.

441
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:33,288
Twin Palms Bungalows and Spa.

442
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:52,810
There was a fire some 20 years ago
and all the records were burned.

443
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:56,249
And on top of that,
I'm afraid our guest list is confidential.

444
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,603
Where's the closest hospital?

445
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,038
All the children born in one week
24 years ago?

446
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,002
Yes. Well, all the ones given up
for adoption.

447
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,888
The birth mother,
she may have left money for the child...

448
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,880
I'm sorry, but those records are sealed.

449
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,960
Only a court order
can open those records.

450
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:20,847
And only by a child seeking a parent.
Are you the child?

451
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:21,997
No.

452
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,880
But thank you, anyway.

453
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:31,317
Here's a blondie for your trouble.

454
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:53,117
Did...? Did you make these?

455
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:58,715
No. Hannah, our housekeeper
back in River Heights, did.

456
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,604
She sent over a tin.
She's a wonderful baker.

457
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:04,513
It's so weird. My mother made these
when I was a kid.

458
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,278
I haven't had one in years.

459
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:13,033
It's so perfectly moist.

460
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:15,352
Come here.

461
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:28,401
The county recommends a pediatrician
to new adoptive parents.

462
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:31,719
The doctor's files aren't sealed.
This might help.

463
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,953
- Thank you.
- And you didn't get that from me.

464
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:45,432
Twenty-four years ago.
Wow, that is so long ago.

465
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:50,238
Yes. It would have been
a first appointment, a newborn.

466
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,234
I know it seems a little "disorganisized"
but I know where everything is.

467
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:07,637
Right there. Here it is.
There were two newborns that week.

468
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,914
No, make that three.

469
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:13,548
Oh, but I don't think
I can release any information.

470
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:15,868
Let me call headquarters.

471
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:17,391
Maybe that's them.

472
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:18,990
- Hello?
- Hey, girl. It's Jimmy.

473
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:22,752
Oh, Jimmy. Yeah, no, I was
looking for it, then I found it. I found it.

474
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,589
I did find it and it's...

475
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:27,430
That's not it, but it's pink.
And it wasn't...

476
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,269
No, it wasn't where
I thought it was...

477
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:32,075
- I think it's yellow.
- Because I put it somewhere else.

478
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:35,626
Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I'm gonna have to call you ba...

479
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:38,356
I'm gonna have to call you back.

480
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,064
Nice try, squirt. Nice try.

481
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:12,465
Hello, I'm looking for Jane Brighton.

482
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,267
Are you Jane Brighton?

483
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,031
Are you Martine Dahlberg?

484
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:17,705
Yeah. Why?

485
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:19,909
I was just wondering, were you adopted?

486
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,266
Are you Susan Thabit?

487
00:39:22,512 --> 00:39:23,660
Were you adopted?

488
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,026
- Are you Martine Dahlberg?
- Yes.

489
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:27,260
Were you adopted?

490
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,900
Hello...

491
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,106
Can I help you?

492
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,943
Sorry, no.

493
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,099
No.

494
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,389
No.

495
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,459
- No.
- No.

496
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,345
No.

497
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,784
No.

498
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,302
No.

499
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:49,944
- No.
- No.

500
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:51,224
Nope.

501
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,186
- No...
- No...

502
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:05,544
Hello?
Ls there a Jane Brighton here?

503
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,221
That depends on who's asking.

504
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,343
Were you adopted?

505
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:13,545
Yeah.

506
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:19,458
Who are you?

507
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,298
You're who I'm looking for.

508
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,014
I am?

509
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:32,414
Hi.

510
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:40,052
You're kidding.

511
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:42,419
Did your parents tell you
that you were adopted?

512
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:45,935
Lt wasn't hard to figure out.
I mean, I didn't look anything like them.

513
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:50,020
My mother passed away,
and then my father...

514
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,097
I had to get away from him.

515
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,739
I left home early.

516
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,255
Dehlia Draycott.

517
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:02,814
Dehlia may have made a
provision for you.

518
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:05,496
If we prove you're her daughter,
there may be some money.

519
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,774
Is this some kind of a practical joke?

520
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:12,580
Oh, no. I don't joke.

521
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:16,452
I get that a lot.
I'm 12, but I skipped a few grades.

522
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,213
Because you were ahead academically?

523
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:21,020
Heck, no. There just wasn't any action
in junior high...

524
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,375
...so my dad made a few calls.

525
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,612
Anyway, I was wondering
if we could do, like, a dinner thing?

526
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,930
Like, Saturday-ish?
Not a date.

527
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,056
Corky, you've been really nice to me...

528
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,369
l'll show you the sights.
We'll have a few laughs.

529
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:35,416
- But there's this guy
in River Heights.

530
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,013
Oh, ouch. Okay.

531
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,091
Well, you still need to eat,
and it's not a date.

532
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,249
Okay. Seeing as how it's not a date...

533
00:41:52,738 --> 00:41:54,807
- What was th...?
- Go. Go, go, go.

534
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,171
That car, it almost hit us.

535
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,613
- Hurry! Go, go, go!
- Hey!

536
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,370
I wonder who tried to kill us.

537
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:08,131
Yeah, I'm wondering that too.
In fact, I'm kind of freaking out about it.

538
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:13,928
Well, usually when someone tries to
kill me it's because I'm onto something.

539
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,131
Oh, you have a cut.

540
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:21,813
There were dealer plates on the SUV.
I made note of the make, year and model.

541
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:26,485
Plus, the damage sustained from hitting
the barrier could help us identify it too.

542
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,765
You're just not like the other girls,
Nancy.

543
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,162
Hello?

544
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:47,042
Do not look into this
Dehlia Draycott business.

545
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:52,081
If you proceed, you will be harmed.
Do you understand?

546
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:54,243
We're not interested
in mudslide insurance...

547
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:57,529
...but thank you for calling.
Have a nice day.

548
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:10,039
Whoa, what's this?

549
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,247
I apologize, sir.
Allow me to introduce myself.

550
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,482
My name is Nancy Drew.
It's very nice to make your acquaintance.

551
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,840
I've been trying to set up
an appointment, but...

552
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,968
Posture, eye contact.
Pay attention, people, that's breeding.

553
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:26,644
I was just wondering if I could have five
minutes to discuss something with you.

554
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:29,323
Any time at all.
Here's my card.

555
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,086
Thank you.

556
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:41,239
It's about one of your clients,
a movie star.

557
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:44,604
All my clients are movie stars, muffin.

558
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,235
Well, I may have found
some evidence suggesting that...

559
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,046
- Astonishing.
- It may imply that...

560
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,686
Absolutely astonishing.

561
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,401
As I was saying...

562
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,557
I'm very disappointed, senator.

563
00:43:56,726 --> 00:44:00,162
Well, as you know,
you do owe me a favor or two.

564
00:44:01,846 --> 00:44:05,360
Well, talk to somebody else on your staff.
Maybe they can help you out on this.

565
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:12,433
Jane? Are you there?

566
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:16,361
Hi. I saw the lawyers who represent
the estate today and they...

567
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:18,401
It's all right.
I don't need any help.

568
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,478
What? Don't you wanna know
if you're Dehlia's daughter?

569
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:23,834
Just leave us alone, okay?

570
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:26,995
You seem like a really nice person.
I'm sorry.

571
00:44:45,962 --> 00:44:48,429
The will is in the Chinese box.

572
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:51,638
So there is a will.

573
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,396
See for yourself.

574
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,629
Miss Draycott collected chinoiserie.

575
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,632
Last year, the owner sold off the most
valuable pieces, against my wishes.

576
00:45:21,798 --> 00:45:24,028
Do you remember
the name of the dealer?

577
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:26,072
You ask a lot of questions.

578
00:45:26,238 --> 00:45:30,992
Is it this place? I noticed the ad
was circled. Do they have the box?

579
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,915
Let me tell you something, young lady.

580
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:37,150
Everyone who has tried to piece
this thing together has run into trouble.

581
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:40,825
Hello?

582
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:45,792
So you should be getting an early
birthday present/reward thing...

583
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:49,426
...for going along with my
"no sleuthing while in California" thing.

584
00:45:49,836 --> 00:45:52,429
Dad, you shouldn't have.
I don't really deserve it.

585
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,068
Yes, you do.

586
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:56,032
I know it hasn 't been easy for you...

587
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:58,311
...and this'll make me feel less guilty.

588
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,663
But what is it?

589
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:03,711
Just walk outside.

590
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,944
Hi. My sister dropped me off
and now she won't go away.

591
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:10,863
Leave!

592
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,991
My roadster.
Dad, how did you get it here?

593
00:46:14,193 --> 00:46:15,626
Happy almost-your-birthday.

594
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,348
Ned.
You drove this all the way here?

595
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:21,151
Yeah, it wouldn't fit in my suitcase.

596
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,180
I've missed this car so much...

597
00:46:24,352 --> 00:46:26,502
...and you.
I've missed the car and you.

598
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:32,186
Ned, Corky. Corky, Ned.

599
00:46:32,592 --> 00:46:34,627
Ned is my...

600
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,100
...really good friend from River Heights.

601
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:40,468
River Heights, right.
That's in one of those fly-over states.

602
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:42,782
Wait. Did I interrupt something?

603
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,300
Yes, actually. You did.

604
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,464
Hello?

605
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,860
- Hello? Nancy?
- Oh, Dad. Thank you so much.

606
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,543
We have to go.

607
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,465
Corky's going on a date with her?

608
00:46:57,629 --> 00:47:01,508
Whoa, Nancy Weirdo has,
like, two dates.

609
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:04,298
That other one is cute.

610
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:07,540
I don't usually go for the
just-back-from-slopping-the-hogs type...

611
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,780
...but he's cute.

612
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:32,020
Hello.
Would you like to order some drinks?

613
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,381
L'll have a glass of milk, please.

614
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:38,823
Milk. How refreshingly wholesome.
L'll have the exact same thing.

615
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,300
Who is this person?

616
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:43,621
Nancy and I met,
and things just clicked.

617
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:46,419
We laugh, we talk.
We keep it real.

618
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:48,860
- Keep it real?
- We're basically best friends.

619
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:50,855
It's funny that she
never mentioned you.

620
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:55,338
Hey, buddy,
she wants your drink order.

621
00:47:57,064 --> 00:47:58,782
Can I get an iced latte?

622
00:47:59,184 --> 00:48:01,572
No latte in Chinese restaurant, silly.

623
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:06,142
Yeah, silly.
No latte in the Chinese restaurant.

624
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:07,332
Don't talk to me.

625
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:10,461
All right.
Wow, this is fun, huh?

626
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:13,090
Ned and I have known
each other since second grade.

627
00:48:13,302 --> 00:48:16,214
He helped me solve the mystery
of the missing chalkboard erasers.

628
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:18,137
It was a janitor.

629
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:20,896
Fantastic.

630
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:25,580
Oh, my gosh.
How funny.

631
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:29,051
Here we are and here you are.
Hi, what's your name?

632
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:30,210
Ned?

633
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:32,020
You're not sure?

634
00:48:32,181 --> 00:48:35,092
No. I mean, yes, I'm sure.

635
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,249
Why are you here?

636
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,094
Why are you here?

637
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,249
Why are you here?

638
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,617
Hey, hey, guys, don't gang up on me.
I'm sensitive.

639
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:59,888
Hello. I'm looking for a box.
That is, one in particular.

640
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:01,127
What kind of box?

641
00:49:02,418 --> 00:49:03,407
Chinese?

642
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:09,051
Well, you've come to the right place.

643
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:12,450
So this is why
you wanted Chinese food.

644
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:16,052
What are you guys doing in here?
This is so nonlinear.

645
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:18,650
Everybody pick a row.
Check inside each box.

646
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:20,415
We're looking for a will.

647
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:25,335
- Wait, what's over there?
- Hey.

648
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:26,769
Ned, did you see this box yet?

649
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,244
Nothing there.

650
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:30,605
- No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch.
- Corky.

651
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:35,051
Hey, watch the top.
That is very expensive.

652
00:49:39,654 --> 00:49:41,849
- Hey there. Come here.
- You see this? Lt's big.

653
00:49:42,014 --> 00:49:43,732
Put that down.

654
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:49,809
What? You think you're funny?
Do you think you're funny?

655
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:51,725
So not cute.

656
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,728
There is one more.

657
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:15,144
So, Nance, what's the deal
with you and Ned?

658
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,380
Do you hear something?

659
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:18,826
No, I mean, are you two like a thing?

660
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,028
Excuse me, I have to defuse this bomb.

661
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,943
No kidding.
Love is a battlefield.

662
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:03,704
Nancy.

663
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:46,376
That's the SUV that tried to run
us down. The side's damaged. Come on.

664
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,453
What was that?
Are you okay? What was that?

665
00:51:48,622 --> 00:51:51,819
- Hurry, we're losing them.
- Oh, so you meant literally a bomb.

666
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:54,371
What was that? What was that?
Are you okay?

667
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:55,531
Hello?

668
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:02,575
They turned up that street!

669
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:04,936
Hold on. I thought we were
driving away from them.

670
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:06,454
That's why I got in the car.

671
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:08,173
- Buckled up?
- I'm fine.

672
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,411
Buckling up.

673
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:22,288
Say we do catch up with them,
what happens then?

674
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:24,168
Seriously.

675
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:27,092
It gets my goat when
someone tries to kill me. It's so rude.

676
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:29,017
But it only makes me
wanna try harder.

677
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,293
Then let the horses run.

678
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,847
We will go the posted speed limit
and no faster.

679
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:41,490
Everybody in the universe
drives over the speed limit, Nancy.

680
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,251
Nancy is trying to say
the ends do not justify the means.

681
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:45,896
Your means will lose them.

682
00:52:46,057 --> 00:52:48,810
It's important to judge the ends
and the means independently...

683
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:49,966
...to do what's right.

684
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,809
Didn't you promise your father
that you wouldn't sleuth?

685
00:52:56,016 --> 00:52:58,530
Aren't you breaking that promise?

686
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:05,451
What are you gonna do?

687
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:08,325
I have to stop working on this case.

688
00:53:08,495 --> 00:53:10,213
I have to stop and be normal.

689
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:27,528
What's this?

690
00:53:28,493 --> 00:53:32,566
Oh, just normal stuff.
Normal teenage stuff.

691
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:36,282
Okay. Carry on.

692
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:41,403
- He just pinched me!
- Deal with it.

693
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:44,405
If we're gonna baby-sit him,
we should get paid.

694
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,849
Ned, why is your shirt all wrinkled?

695
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:49,283
Because my closet's 6 inches deep.

696
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,285
That's not possible.
How could...?

697
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,320
Show me.

698
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,120
What are you guys doing?

699
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,282
"Hey, Corky. We're super glad
you asked. Would you like to tag along?"

700
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:14,882
Seriously. Oh, God.
What is going on?

701
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,682
I just fell down.

702
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:24,682
But I'm fine.

703
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:30,167
I still don't know what's going on.

704
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:37,602
Whenever you feel like letting me know.

705
00:54:57,285 --> 00:54:59,355
A secret passageway.

706
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:02,317
So this is how the intruder
has been getting upstairs.

707
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:04,076
This is nuts.

708
00:55:04,244 --> 00:55:07,316
Ned, will you get my flashlight?
Lt's in my kit.

709
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:10,676
Wouldn't this be considered sleuthing?

710
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:14,041
Who are we kidding?
I can't stop.

711
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:16,757
Once I find the will
and determine the identity of Z...

712
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:20,040
...l'll tell my father everything.
He'll understand.

713
00:55:20,203 --> 00:55:23,035
I mean, how else am I
gonna help Jane?

714
00:55:23,562 --> 00:55:24,597
Lt's important.

715
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:27,791
Don't you think?

716
00:55:29,442 --> 00:55:30,477
Yeah.

717
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:03,274
What was that?

718
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:07,875
I think we just had an earthquake.

719
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,193
Hello?

720
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,149
Nancy.

721
00:56:25,317 --> 00:56:27,307
Are you all right?

722
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:28,465
Where are you?

723
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,952
I'm in the basement.

724
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:37,546
Do you see anything?

725
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:41,553
I found a tunnel and I'm going in.

726
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:44,229
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,
something bad's happened.

727
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,705
I don't think that was a joke.

728
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:18,348
I lay there on the ground
Who will wind the clock when I'm away

729
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,300
Hi.

730
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:26,547
A tunnel in the laundry room.

731
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:28,906
What the hell is that all about?

732
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,300
John Leshing.
He's a tenant in this building.

733
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,586
He's the caretaker
of the Dehlia Draycott estate.

734
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,900
If anyone knows about the tunnel,
he does.

735
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,028
That man has always
given me the willies.

736
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,499
The drowning-kittens type.
You know what I mean?

737
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,977
Hi. These are for you two.

738
00:57:55,468 --> 00:57:57,902
- Here you go.
- Okay.

739
00:57:59,868 --> 00:58:01,859
These are for you two.

740
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:08,059
I hope you attend.

741
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:18,462
I know that she's weird,
but we have to go.

742
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:19,900
Why?

743
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:23,058
Ned, my future husband,
is gonna be there.

744
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,301
Jane? Lt's me, Nancy.

745
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,855
I was wondering if you and Allie
wanted to come to a party.

746
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:46,737
Oh, my goodness.

747
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,417
Wow, guys, your streamers look great.

748
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,140
Let's see yours.

749
00:59:03,462 --> 00:59:05,612
Yeah, yours are all right.

750
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,097
Downloading's cool...

751
00:59:08,781 --> 00:59:10,499
...but nothing sounds like vinyl.

752
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:13,698
You couldn't be more right if you tried,
Nancy.

753
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,809
Yeah.

754
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,769
- Hi.
- Hi.

755
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,499
I brought a few friends.
I hope you don't mind, all right?

756
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:31,978
No.

757
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:39,451
Oh, I didn't get the memo
about it being a retarded theme.

758
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:40,733
Hey, Ned.

759
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:41,933
Hi.

760
00:59:42,098 --> 00:59:44,566
Oh, can I take your coat or...?

761
00:59:44,738 --> 00:59:46,012
Okay.

762
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:49,368
Refreshments are in the dining room.

763
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:52,097
We'll be having a taffy pull
later, guys.

764
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,575
- Come on in.
- Hi.

765
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,648
Hi.
Refreshments in the dining room.

766
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:03,287
Oh, hello.
Hi. Oh, you look lovely.

767
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:14,726
Leshing, come quick!

768
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:27,048
So did you grow up in River Depths?
Tell me about it. Is there a river?

769
01:00:27,214 --> 01:00:29,728
River Heights.
Yeah, there's a river.

770
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:34,091
Oh, I knew that. I totally knew that.
How did I know that?

771
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:36,891
Hey. Hey.

772
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:38,281
Oh, you wanna dance, right?

773
01:00:44,093 --> 01:00:45,127
Hi.

774
01:00:45,692 --> 01:00:48,809
I just wanted to ask you if you knew
about the secret passageway.

775
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,770
I think you got your answer.

776
01:00:53,372 --> 01:00:54,566
Are you Z?

777
01:00:55,491 --> 01:01:01,327
Miss Drew, I suggest you rejoin
your guests and enjoy the party.

778
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,168
Hold on.

779
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,129
Hello?
- I warned you...

780
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,166
...drop this Draycott business.

781
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:20,126
Who is this?

782
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:27,122
- Please, stop calling here.
- Nancy?

783
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:30,360
Oh, hi, Dad.
Where are you?

784
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:33,725
I'm going to be even later to your party
than I said. I'm sorry, honey.

785
01:01:33,888 --> 01:01:36,243
Is everything all right?
Sounds a little crazy there.

786
01:01:36,408 --> 01:01:38,398
Yeah, everything's totally mellow.

787
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:42,640
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. Hurry home.

788
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:55,677
Happy birthday, Nancy.

789
01:01:57,326 --> 01:01:59,635
Back off, man.

790
01:02:11,444 --> 01:02:13,196
Somebody call 911.

791
01:02:13,364 --> 01:02:16,276
You! You know CPR, come on,
do something. Trish is choking!

792
01:02:17,564 --> 01:02:19,555
This is not a joke.

793
01:02:21,244 --> 01:02:23,438
Out of the way, out of the way.
Coming through.

794
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:26,163
Oh, my God. Do something,
do something. Somebody call 911!

795
01:02:26,323 --> 01:02:27,722
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

796
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:31,722
Does she have any allergies?

797
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:34,715
She's insanely allergic to peanuts,
but she didn't eat anything.

798
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:37,840
I had a peanut butter cookie,
and we were making out.

799
01:02:38,002 --> 01:02:39,321
Oh, my God.

800
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:41,473
I need a knife and a ballpoint pen.

801
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:43,673
- Here.
- Here you go.

802
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:47,356
Everybody, unless you've had
advanced emergency medical training...

803
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:49,637
...you must never attempt this
on your own.

804
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,833
Holy crap.

805
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,427
You know, I have to admit...

806
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,593
...I thought you were some insane, freak,
idiot person before, but you're not.

807
01:03:12,759 --> 01:03:13,908
You're pretty terrific.

808
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:16,674
Anyone can learn
emergency medical procedures.

809
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:19,189
I'm talking about
how great the party was.

810
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:21,189
Saving Trish's life was fantastic also.

811
01:03:22,118 --> 01:03:25,952
Anyways, I'd like to take you
and your little friend Ned out shopping.

812
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:27,789
You really do need a decent outfit.

813
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:34,074
What happened?

814
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:37,194
Lt was a lively party.
Almost everyone had a good time.

815
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,426
- I take it you're Nancy's father.
- That's right.

816
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:41,507
We responded to a complaint
from a neighbor.

817
01:03:41,676 --> 01:03:43,507
Dad, this is Sergeant Billings.

818
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:46,554
No, no, no.
Let me say something.

819
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,504
You had a wild party.

820
01:03:49,995 --> 01:03:52,031
You blew it out when Dad was MIA.

821
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,789
Damage was done.
Things went amuck. I get it.

822
01:03:58,674 --> 01:03:59,663
Congratulations.

823
01:04:00,194 --> 01:04:04,028
Getting rowdy is part of being
a normal, non-sleuthing teenager.

824
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:08,904
All right. That's a first.

825
01:04:14,753 --> 01:04:17,108
Come on. Come on.

826
01:04:24,192 --> 01:04:27,343
Hi. Obviously someone here
needs a little help with their look.

827
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:29,582
Oh, it's not that bad.

828
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:31,662
Oh, please, it's a fashion teardown.

829
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:35,426
You have some nice pieces.
They're just not really working together.

830
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:38,824
Me? I was talking about her.

831
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:41,345
Oh, sorry.

832
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:45,225
Wow, where did you get that dress?

833
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,863
I made it from one
of my mother's patterns.

834
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,506
It is just darling.
I love the sincerity.

835
01:04:53,669 --> 01:04:54,943
I have to take your picture.

836
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:59,661
You know what? I just remembered
how much I really hate this store.

837
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:01,618
Excuse me?

838
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:06,141
I wish you could stay longer.

839
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:09,778
My mom said if I stayed past the
weekend she'd turn my room into a den.

840
01:05:10,268 --> 01:05:11,303
Really?

841
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:15,422
Anyway, Nancy, I just want you to know
I'm not interested in that Inga person.

842
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:18,823
In fact, she scares me.

843
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:22,622
And that if you like this Porky guy...

844
01:05:22,827 --> 01:05:24,226
Corky.

845
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,024
- It's all right with me.

846
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:28,299
Ned, he's 12.

847
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:30,981
You just seem to really like
having him around.

848
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:33,665
Ned, can I ask you a question?

849
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,498
Can you tell when a girl
is thinking how much she likes you...

850
01:05:37,665 --> 01:05:40,975
...wondering if you like her, thinking
how important it is how you feel...

851
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,978
...before she says anything more
about how she feels about you...

852
01:05:44,145 --> 01:05:47,102
...because she's already saying
how she feels in her own way?

853
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:48,492
Can you repeat the question?

854
01:05:51,744 --> 01:05:55,373
Your cab's here.
Sorry to see you go, Ned.

855
01:05:56,544 --> 01:05:58,215
L'll see you soon.

856
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,896
Bye, Ned.

857
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,735
Jane, are you all right?

858
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,529
No. Child Protective Services, they...
They took her. They took Allie.

859
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:44,689
They said I was an unfit parent,
but it isn't true.

860
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:46,850
I didn't do any
of the things that they said.

861
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:49,691
Come in, come in.

862
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:55,289
You're always able to help people.

863
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:56,493
I can certainly try.

864
01:06:56,658 --> 01:06:58,296
Why don't you come
downtown tomorrow?

865
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,256
I will. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

866
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,727
Sure. What's the connection?
How did you two meet?

867
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,735
I'm Dehlia Draycott's daughter.

868
01:07:12,656 --> 01:07:13,975
You're what? Wait.

869
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:17,572
Dad, it's so late.
Jane's tired and so am I.

870
01:07:17,736 --> 01:07:21,046
Let's go over all this in the morning,
in the promising light of a new day.

871
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:22,569
Right.
Have you been sleuthing?

872
01:07:22,975 --> 01:07:24,966
Dad, do you really think
I've been sleuthing?

873
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:27,609
- That's not answering my question.
- You're not answering mine.

874
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:28,884
- Your what?
- What?

875
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:30,044
- What?
- What?

876
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:31,694
I'm going to bed.

877
01:07:33,654 --> 01:07:35,485
Good night.

878
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:40,369
Listen, I have to tell you something.

879
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:44,412
Right after you first found me,
someone came to my apartment. A man.

880
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:48,532
He said if I ever tried to prove that I was
Dehlia's daughter, that I would regret it.

881
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:51,253
That's why I was afraid
to talk to you that time.

882
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:55,405
- What did he look like?
- He was big.

883
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,803
Dark hair. Scary.

884
01:08:02,132 --> 01:08:06,966
And he had one pale blue eye
and one very, very dark.

885
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:28,641
Someone is filing grievances against you,
but I don't know who yet.

886
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:31,562
But it isn't true.
None of it happened.

887
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:33,959
How can they just take a kid
away from its mother?

888
01:08:34,129 --> 01:08:37,644
I believe you. And I think
a judge will too. It just takes time.

889
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,276
We'll get her back. I promise you.

890
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:44,805
Now, is there anyone
who might have something against you?

891
01:08:45,808 --> 01:08:48,322
Dad, look,
there's something I need to tell you.

892
01:08:48,488 --> 01:08:49,806
It has to do with this whole...

893
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:51,559
Carson!

894
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:52,716
Nancy.

895
01:08:52,887 --> 01:08:56,402
After Jane's little revelation, I found out
who the lawyer for the estate was...

896
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,795
...and I gave him a call.

897
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,199
He and I are going to talk privately.
Do you have your car?

898
01:09:01,726 --> 01:09:03,717
Down the block.
What are you two...?

899
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:06,162
Dinner, tonight.
I've got a lot of questions...

900
01:09:06,326 --> 01:09:08,840
...and I think you
just might have the answers.

901
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:15,921
Feel like some hot cocoa?

902
01:09:22,484 --> 01:09:25,282
- Channel presents
The Life and Death of Dehlia Draycott.

903
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:27,878
It's so weird.
I never used to think about her at all...

904
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,523
...and now I see her everywhere.

905
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:36,879
What if I am an unfit mother?

906
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:39,511
I don't know what I'm doing.
No one taught me what to do.

907
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:40,672
Jane...

908
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,278
Nancy, I don't think you understand
what it's like growing up without a mom.

909
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:47,630
Actually, my mother died
when I was very young.

910
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:50,361
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

911
01:09:51,122 --> 01:09:52,680
I didn't know.

912
01:09:53,561 --> 01:09:55,233
You've been so nice to me.

913
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:59,799
Sometimes, I think I can remember her.

914
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:04,670
But I never know if what I remember
is something I saw in a picture...

915
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,478
...or just made up.

916
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,357
She's...

917
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,672
She's a mystery.

918
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:22,233
Someone in the village told me
that the will is in the Chinese box.

919
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:27,671
Wait a minute.

920
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:37,631
What are we looking for?

921
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,636
A clue.

922
01:10:39,797 --> 01:10:41,276
It's empty.

923
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,395
You must make the dragon bow.

924
01:10:55,396 --> 01:10:57,990
- The will.
- I must've fallen asleep when I heard this.

925
01:10:58,156 --> 01:10:59,349
I've finally found it.

926
01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:03,954
Dehlia used a clue from one of her movies
to show someone where to find the will.

927
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:06,106
Now all I have to do
is make the dragon bow.

928
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:07,628
Okay, you lost me at "dragon."

929
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,788
L'll be back later.

930
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:16,862
Hello? Hello, Mr. Louie?
Are you in there?

931
01:11:18,314 --> 01:11:19,588
Hello?

932
01:11:21,353 --> 01:11:24,902
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner, but
this means so much to my two friends.

933
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,506
It's fine.

934
01:11:37,912 --> 01:11:39,584
It's the will.

935
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:44,031
If you want it, you can have it.

936
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:47,179
Thank you so much.

937
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:54,629
"I give all my property and assets
to my daughter born July 28th, 1981."

938
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,428
I knew it.

939
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:05,626
- Dad. I have to talk to you.
- Hi, honey.

940
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:07,268
What number are you calling from?

941
01:12:07,429 --> 01:12:09,147
My cell phone.
The one you gave me.

942
01:12:09,309 --> 01:12:10,662
I didn 't give you a cell phone.

943
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:19,457
Honey?

944
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:22,461
I have to get off this phone.
Everything's fine. See you tonight.

945
01:12:22,628 --> 01:12:24,141
Nancy...

946
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:36,816
So they're the ones
who've been breaking in.

947
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:57,249
Oh, Mary, you're exaggerating.

948
01:13:57,419 --> 01:13:59,808
No one blames you for Henry's death.

949
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:02,057
Least of all Jezebel.

950
01:14:06,418 --> 01:14:11,617
You've got to stop.
It's not your fault, Mary.

951
01:14:12,537 --> 01:14:15,847
You do believe that, don 't you, baby?

952
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:26,132
You don 't think
I was born bad, do you?

953
01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:32,091
I could never care if you were.
Mary, I love you.

954
01:14:57,653 --> 01:14:58,972
Go check on her.

955
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:01,328
Wait. I want to see this part.

956
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:05,611
Kids will love it just for making chocolate
pasta for those delicious desserts.

957
01:15:05,773 --> 01:15:09,162
Besides pasta, you can also make
pie crust, cinnamon rolls...

958
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:22,434
She's not there.

959
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:26,354
- Look again.
- She's not there.

960
01:16:34,644 --> 01:16:36,043
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

961
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:39,275
Go get her!

962
01:16:50,323 --> 01:16:51,836
Hey!

963
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:56,511
Hey.

964
01:16:58,242 --> 01:17:00,039
She's getting away! Jump!

965
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:02,555
Go, go, get the car!

966
01:17:03,002 --> 01:17:05,117
You idiots.

967
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,790
Right there.

968
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,793
- Hi, Dad.
- Are you okay? What happened?

969
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,467
Just your run-of-the-mill car accident.

970
01:18:04,116 --> 01:18:07,188
I swerved out of control because...

971
01:18:08,156 --> 01:18:11,386
Because men were chasing me.
I've been working on a case.

972
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:13,108
I'm gonna give you two some time.

973
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:15,027
Thank you.

974
01:18:15,955 --> 01:18:18,515
- I started to tell you today.
- You could have been killed.

975
01:18:18,675 --> 01:18:20,585
Do you realize that?

976
01:18:20,754 --> 01:18:24,383
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- This is a very dangerous city.

977
01:18:24,554 --> 01:18:28,149
- The world is not like River Heights.
- I know.

978
01:18:28,314 --> 01:18:31,510
I mean, I tried to be normal.
I really tried.

979
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,949
I just start working on something
and I can't stop.

980
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:37,151
I wonder where you got that from.

981
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:42,509
I mean, the idea of a girl out there
without her mom...

982
01:18:44,192 --> 01:18:47,389
Dehlia wanted to leave Jane the estate,
and I found the will.

983
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:50,625
Like you always say, "Others first."

984
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,782
I just wish that
you'd talked to me about this.

985
01:18:53,591 --> 01:18:56,822
L'll be okay, Dad.
We'll work it out. You're my guy.

986
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:00,266
Hey, kiddo.

987
01:19:00,431 --> 01:19:02,149
Mr. Biedermeyer.

988
01:19:02,311 --> 01:19:05,188
Your father and I were going over
some business when we heard.

989
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,069
I hope you're all right.

990
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,305
I'm fine.

991
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,779
Good.

992
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:12,703
He's offered me some consulting work.
I can do it from home...

993
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,747
...so we can go back
to River Heights.

994
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:16,898
And he pays a lot.

995
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,866
You know, I couldn't help but
overhear before about the mystery.

996
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,145
- Did you ever find the will?
- I did.

997
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:32,617
Dehlia used one of her movies
as a clue.

998
01:19:32,788 --> 01:19:35,984
It was hidden in the secret compartment
of a Chinese box.

999
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,741
Nancy always gets
to the bottom of things.

1000
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:42,138
Well, my firm would certainly
be interested in seeing that will.

1001
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:45,663
You know, Mr. Biedermeyer
wasn't always just Dehlia's lawyer.

1002
01:19:45,826 --> 01:19:48,294
He was her manager as well,
from the start.

1003
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:50,821
He made her who she was.

1004
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:54,697
Then he brought her account
to his law firm, and...

1005
01:19:54,866 --> 01:19:58,062
Well, it's time to sign on the dotted line.

1006
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:06,582
That's quite a signature.

1007
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:09,617
It's my middle initial.
For Zachary.

1008
01:20:09,784 --> 01:20:11,342
Z.

1009
01:20:22,063 --> 01:20:23,735
Where is the will?

1010
01:20:31,862 --> 01:20:33,261
Where is it, honey?
Do you know?

1011
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:37,580
You know, this is a little awkward.

1012
01:20:38,342 --> 01:20:41,094
His firm stands to lose
more than a little income...

1013
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:43,650
...if the money from the will
really does go to Jane.

1014
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:47,577
Dad, we have to get out
of this car now.

1015
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:49,010
Why?

1016
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,413
Excuse me, sir,
can you please stop the car?

1017
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,129
Nancy!

1018
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:03,172
Nancy!

1019
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:08,094
Dad, get away from them!

1020
01:21:17,178 --> 01:21:18,896
Excuse me, miss?

1021
01:21:19,058 --> 01:21:21,618
Oh, hello, honey.

1022
01:21:23,697 --> 01:21:25,972
The phone's over there, honey.

1023
01:21:30,937 --> 01:21:32,575
Sergeant Billings.

1024
01:21:32,777 --> 01:21:35,529
Do you know if a Dashiel Biedermeyer
rented in this building?

1025
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:37,734
No. No, he owns it.

1026
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:39,449
He owns the house you're in too.

1027
01:21:39,616 --> 01:21:41,368
He's a very rich man.

1028
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:47,007
There she is.

1029
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,048
Is there a back door anywhere?

1030
01:21:49,215 --> 01:21:51,490
Yes, honey, right over there.

1031
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:54,215
Tell Sergeant Billings
to send a car to the house.

1032
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:02,653
Get her!

1033
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,051
Open up!

1034
01:22:07,373 --> 01:22:09,648
Open this door!

1035
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:12,450
- Break it down.
- Come here.

1036
01:22:24,932 --> 01:22:27,207
Where's the will?

1037
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:31,444
I don't think I should say. It's
my insurance that you won't hurt me.

1038
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:34,207
L'll squeeze it out of you.

1039
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:37,804
Tell me something first.

1040
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,964
I'm just really curious.

1041
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,802
Why did you kill Dehlia?

1042
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:51,403
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

1043
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:55,278
She was gonna quit the business
and run off with that caretaker.

1044
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:57,519
He was the father.

1045
01:22:57,689 --> 01:23:01,840
Whatever. She was my only client.
She was gonna fire me.

1046
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:05,361
I spent 20 years of my life
building up her career.

1047
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:07,439
I got mad.
I reacted violently.

1048
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:10,883
I felt kind of bad about it for a while,
but I'm okay with it now.

1049
01:23:12,407 --> 01:23:14,477
Leshing is Jane's father.

1050
01:23:14,647 --> 01:23:17,923
- Does he know about the baby?
- It doesn't matter! Now where's the will?

1051
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:20,356
Lt's right here.

1052
01:23:29,246 --> 01:23:30,804
Come here.

1053
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:34,878
Give it to me!
Give me the will!

1054
01:23:59,523 --> 01:24:01,479
Just do it.

1055
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:06,436
If you shoot me, it'll leave all
sorts of evidence. Very messy.

1056
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:15,193
Strangulation leaves
a traceable handprint.

1057
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,200
What do you suggest?

1058
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:19,396
The best way to kill me?

1059
01:24:20,841 --> 01:24:22,194
Let me think about that.

1060
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,556
Enough of this crap.

1061
01:24:25,441 --> 01:24:27,237
Put the gun down.

1062
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,118
Hey!

1063
01:24:40,119 --> 01:24:42,838
I'm just really curious.
Why did you kill Dehlia?

1064
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:47,792
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

1065
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,869
She was gonna quit the business and...

1066
01:24:51,638 --> 01:24:52,707
Nancy?

1067
01:24:53,758 --> 01:24:55,794
Oh, my gosh,
you won't believe what's happened.

1068
01:24:55,958 --> 01:25:00,428
Hey, Mr. Biedermeyer. Inga Veinshtein.
I'm in water polo with Courtney.

1069
01:25:00,837 --> 01:25:02,236
Your granddaughter.

1070
01:25:03,037 --> 01:25:05,312
Yeah. I remember you.

1071
01:25:05,597 --> 01:25:07,747
Hey, Lurch, digging a hole or something?

1072
01:25:08,836 --> 01:25:11,430
- Okay. We had to show you this.
- Oh, my goodness!

1073
01:25:11,596 --> 01:25:13,075
Lt's called "The New Sincerity."

1074
01:25:13,556 --> 01:25:17,947
Yeah, I'm on the forefront. I see
something cute, I start wearing it...

1075
01:25:18,116 --> 01:25:22,711
...and in like five seconds, it's a total
trend. Penny-loafer fashion moment.

1076
01:25:23,395 --> 01:25:24,589
I need to borrow that coat.

1077
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:28,107
Leshing, thank you so much.

1078
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:32,073
You're welcome. Nancy.

1079
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:35,064
There's something you should know.
It's about Jane.

1080
01:25:37,074 --> 01:25:38,063
She's your daughter.

1081
01:25:42,993 --> 01:25:46,190
- Hey, you with the shovel.
- No. It's him.

1082
01:25:46,353 --> 01:25:47,502
Have you seen my father?

1083
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:48,901
Lt's a party!

1084
01:25:49,073 --> 01:25:51,303
Nancy, darling, are you okay?

1085
01:25:51,473 --> 01:25:52,621
Oh, good, good.

1086
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:54,703
- Oh, hi, honey. How are you?
- Hi, Mr. Drew.

1087
01:25:54,912 --> 01:25:57,710
I was locked in a trunk. What happened?
Are you okay?

1088
01:25:57,872 --> 01:25:58,861
Yeah, I'm fine.

1089
01:26:00,232 --> 01:26:03,064
Okay, let's get him up.
All right, easy, easy, easy.

1090
01:26:03,231 --> 01:26:05,791
Looks like my new job
might not work out now.

1091
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,907
Yeah. Maybe not.

1092
01:26:08,231 --> 01:26:10,267
So, what exactly happened?

1093
01:26:11,351 --> 01:26:14,069
Dad, do you really wanna know?

1094
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:15,299
Yeah.

1095
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,459
Do I?

1096
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:36,220
I don't know what to say.

1097
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:26,661
Nancy, I want you to know
I appreciate how hard it was...

1098
01:27:26,984 --> 01:27:28,463
...for you to do the right thing.

1099
01:27:31,423 --> 01:27:32,902
I'm very proud of you.

1100
01:27:41,342 --> 01:27:43,981
You know, Barbara Barbara Realty
would be delighted...

1101
01:27:44,142 --> 01:27:46,451
...to continue to rent
this property for you.

1102
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:47,816
Thanks, but no, thanks.

1103
01:27:47,982 --> 01:27:50,052
Well, what are you gonna do
with this place?

1104
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:54,180
I'm gonna live here, with my kid
and anyone else who needs a place.

1105
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:57,139
I think maybe you and I
should talk this over before you make...

1106
01:27:57,301 --> 01:27:59,656
Feel free to leave at any time.

1107
01:28:21,619 --> 01:28:24,086
Allie. Allie. Come here.

1108
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:55,168
There it is.
Just like clockwork.

1109
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:56,324
What?

1110
01:28:56,935 --> 01:28:58,163
Postpartum depression.

1111
01:28:59,495 --> 01:29:01,167
You're sad the case is over.

1112
01:29:02,175 --> 01:29:04,291
That's ridiculous.
I'm glad it all worked out.

1113
01:29:04,815 --> 01:29:07,203
You're only happy when there's trouble.

1114
01:29:07,934 --> 01:29:10,050
This I know for sure.

1115
01:29:10,214 --> 01:29:14,492
But that's who you are
and it's all right with me.

1116
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:16,093
Ned, that's so sweet.

1117
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:31,529
- Nancy?
- Yes?

1118
01:29:31,692 --> 01:29:34,252
Phone call.
Long distance from Scotland.

1119
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:38,609
Something about the Loch Ness monster
and some missing diamonds.

1120
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:41,128
Another case.

1121
01:29:44,260 --> 01:30:00,147
THE END
