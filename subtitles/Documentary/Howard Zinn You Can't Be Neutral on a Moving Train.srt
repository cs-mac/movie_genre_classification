1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When I look back on it,

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
I still can't make sense
of how a normal kid like me

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,100
Ever wound up meeting
Buck Howard.

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,900
When I was five years old,

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
My dad asked me what
I wanted to be

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,500
When I grew up.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,900
I said I wanted to drive
a steamroller and he said, "No,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
You want to be a lawyer."

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,200
I said astronaut.
He said lawyer.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,500
I said policeman.
He said lawyer.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,600
So we compromised... on lawyer,

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Which is how, 20 years later,

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,300
I ended up in law school.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
And even though
this was my father's dream,

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
For the first couple of years

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,400
I bought into the whole thing,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
Until one day.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,100
I finished an exam early
and I just sat there thinking,

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,900
Thinking that somewhere
there must be somebody

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,600
Whose dream it is to be a lawyer,

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
But after more than
two years in law school,

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,100
I hadn't met a single one.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,400
And suddenly it occurred to me...

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not happy.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
I gotta get out of here.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,500
So this moment right here

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Became my last chance
to stop everything,

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,300
Hit pause,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,300
And find a dream
before it was too late.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,300
Late or not, it felt fantastic.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Of course, I hadn't told
my father any of this,

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,100
But I was pretty sure
that he'd understand.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
I just had to present my case.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, Dad. Well, school's tough.

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,200
You know,
Contracts is really hard.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,700
See? I would have been
a terrible lawyer.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,300
The thrilling thing, though,

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Is that now all I had were options.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,700
I could do anything I wanted.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,300
You name it,
I thought of being it.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I could be a private investigator,

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
A test driver for NASCAR,

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Or a talk show host.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,300
How do you get
that job, anyway?

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,000
The truth, though,
is that I did have an idea

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,300
In the back of my head.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,700
I had always had this secret dream
of becoming a writer.

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,300
And while I didn't know
how to get that job either,

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
I did have a pen and paper.

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
So I just did what came naturally.

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
And that's when I was hit
by something else...

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Reality... the reality of having to
find something to do

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
To pay for little things
like food and rent,

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
And getting my car fixed.
I had to find a job,

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,300
But who said it couldn't be
something with a little adventure,

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,700
Something with words like "celebrity"
and "performer" attached to it?

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
And that's how it happened.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,800
That's how I found myself

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,100
Meeting the one and only
Great Buck Howard.

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,700
You must be Troy.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,400
- I'm Gil.
- Oh, hi. I'm Troy.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
- Sorry I'm late.
- Relax. It's not a problem.

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Let's grab a seat.

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
He should be here any minute.

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
We were impressed
you'd been to law school.

66
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,100
I should probably explain that. Uh...

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
I didn't finish, actually.

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,500
Good evening, Mr. Howard.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,900
Oh, here he is.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Buck!

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,100
Big Buck!

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,300
I'm Buck Howard.

73
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Troy Gable.

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,300
Young man, I am delighted
that you are interested in this job.

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
I am very busy. I did over...

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
One thought kept racing
through my mind as Buck talked...

77
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I had no idea who this guy was...

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
And I guess it must have shown.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
You do know who I am, don't you?

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Uh...

81
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
You have seen "The Tonight Show"?

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
You have to say "with Johnny Carson,"

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Not the nitwit who's on there now.

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Buck did "The Tonight Show"...
with Johnny...

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
61 times.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,700
I think...
you're a magician, right?

87
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
Buck's a mentalist.

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
Magician is kind of
a dirty word around here.

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,700
I was a magician...
when I was three years old,

90
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,400
But I evolved out of that. Not that
I have anything against magicians,

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,400
As long as they're dead.

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Buck's been
on all the big shows...

93
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,800
Jim Nabors, Jon Davidson,
Sally Jesse Raphael.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Dinah... he was the co-Host
on "Dinah!" Many times.

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
He's performed all over the world...
Las Vegas...

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
But not lately.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,900
Yourjob would be
to take care of all of Buck's travel,

98
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,500
And then to go
on the road with him

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
To ensure the engagements
were handled smoothly.

100
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,800
It is a very demanding
but ultimately rewarding job.

101
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,700
For instance,
in a few months' time

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,200
We'd be very hard at work
on a benefit that I started

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,800
For sick children
with my friend George Takei,

104
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,200
Who is perhaps best known
for his portrayal of Sulu

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
On "Star Trek."
He is a dear friend.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
This certainly wasn't the kind ofjob

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
My father would
have envisioned for me,

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,800
But there was something
kind of exciting about Buck.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,400
He told these long stories about
a world full of his famous friends...

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,700
Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon...

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
The Captain & Tennille.

112
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,200
It was wonderful
to meet you, young man.

113
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,200
I think this can all work out.

114
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,000
Gil, call me later.

115
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
So the job's yours if you want it...

116
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,400
Pays $650 a week to start.

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Uh...

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Yeah, it sounds great.

119
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,700
Good. You'll be going to
Bakersfield this weekend,

120
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,300
Somebody will meet you
and show you the ropes.

121
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Good luck, Troy.

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Thank you, Gil.

123
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
Edward, your younger readers
may not be aware

124
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,300
That it was actually Johnny Carson
who dubbed me the Great Buck Howard.

125
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,800
Do you recall what trick
you did that night?

126
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It's not a trick. It's an effect.

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
there was a difference.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,100
Troy.

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
Edward, I'm going
to give you a coin.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,300
I would like you to grasp it
between your thumb and your forefinger.

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm going to count, and whenever
you feel compelled to do so,

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
You simply drop the coin.
Do you understand?

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Ready? One, two,

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,500
Three.

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Troy, could you show Edward
what's written on that piece of paper?

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,300
Welcome to Bakersfield!
I'm Sheila Heller.

137
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm Buck Howard.

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
This is Alan, Troy...
and this is Edward.

139
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,000
He is a magazine writer
who is doing a profile on me.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
- Oh, yeah.
- It's going to be a cover story, right?

141
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,300
- Right.
- Buck needs to head back to the hotel

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
To prepare for the performance,

143
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,100
But if you could show
Troy and I around...

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Oh, that would be no problem at all.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,500
I love to come to the venue first

146
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
And meet the people like you

147
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,900
Who keep these places up
and running. Cha-Cha-Cha.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Dude, check it out.
I like that... nice and big, bro.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Right through here is where we have
the main celebrity dressing room,

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Which of course is for Buck.

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,500
- And we have snacks.
- Where's the brandy?

152
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh! God, I knew
we forgot something.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,200
- I'll send out for a bottle right away.
- Okay.

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,900
Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

156
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,700
Okay. All right.

158
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh my God.

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
Ah, but it's part of my job.

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,900
You know what I'm saying?

161
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
There aren't many cues,
but don't let that lull you to sleep.

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Do you have that intro?

163
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Please tell Buck I am
so sorry about the crowd.

164
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,800
I thought it would
at least be half full.

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
Go tell Buck he's on,

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,300
And if he asks,
tell him it's a huge crowd.

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,100
So...

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,900
Come in.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,800
- How's the crowd?
- Uh, it's pretty full.

170
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,700
Pretty full?
What does that mean?

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,500
Nothing. It's a big crowd.

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,100
- It's a packed house.
- Great! Let's do it.

173
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Uh, Buck, this way.

174
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,800
Let's do it!

175
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
Are you ready?

176
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,900
Yes, of course
I'm ready. Let's go.

177
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,200
He's ready. House lights down,
stage lights down, cue tape.

178
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,300
...search in sullen silence
on a dull dark dock...

179
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,600
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to introduce to you a man

180
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Who has performed in over 27 countries

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
On radio, television,
and other media,

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,300
Including "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson."

183
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
- Presenting the Great Buck Howard!
- Spotlight.

184
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
Whoa! There we go!

185
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Stupid amateurs.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I love this town.

187
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,500
All right. Next cue's in 15 minutes
when he goes over to the piano.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll be outside.

189
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I will need a volunteer.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
In fact, these two handsome,

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Strapping young lads
down in front will do perfectly...

192
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,000
Here's the thing
that struck me about Buck

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
As I watched
the progression of his show:

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He was cheesy...
there was no denying that...

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But he also had
a sort of timeless charm

196
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
That the audience
really seemed to love.

197
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Uh-Oh.

198
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,100
Uh-Oh.

199
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Now, I asked you to choose
a number between one and 100.

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,800
But you didn't, did you?

201
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,000
I guess I didn't.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,700
Did you choose the number zero?

203
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,700
Whoa.

204
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,000
- Whoa, zero.
- God...

205
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Zero.

206
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
...deep and profound sleep.

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,800
Nighty-Night.

209
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,700
What the world needs now

210
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,700
Is love, sweet love...

211
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Now I'll need to impose
on you one last time

212
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
Before I vanish.

213
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,300
I will need four volunteers,
two of whom

214
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Will go with me
to the green room.

215
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
The other two will stay
here in the auditorium...

216
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,000
Hey.

217
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,300
...and they will take
my entire fee in cash

218
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,900
And they will hide
that fee in here.

219
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,100
If I am unable to find
that cash when I return,

220
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,400
That money will stay here
in Bakersfield, California.

221
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
I love this town!

222
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,800
I saw him do this
last week in Stockton.

223
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,800
Apparently he's never
failed to find his money

224
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,500
In over 5,000 tries.

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
Hmm.

226
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I'll let you choose
your four volunteers.

227
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,000
Guys, come on.
We have to go to the green room.

228
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Gentlemen, this is
my entire entourage,

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,900
Just so you can see there's
absolutely nothing fishy going on

230
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
While they hide my money.

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,300
You'll be my witnesses.

232
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Would either of you like
a signed photograph?

233
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,900
- Oh...
- Yeah.

234
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,000
Alan, some signed photos,
colored ones, please.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
I don't see
any of the colored ones.

236
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Seek and ye shall find, Alan.
They're in there.

237
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,400
My ink pen, please. Ink pen.

238
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
- Thank you, Troy.
- Black and white's fine.

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
No, it's not. It's not fine.

240
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,500
- Alan?
- Buck, these are the only ones we have.

241
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,000
Mr. Howard,
they're ready for you.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, well that's fantastic news.

243
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,000
Sorry, folks,
there won't be any photograph

244
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Due to Alan's incompetence.

245
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,500
I'd still like a black and white.

246
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
What's the point in having
a black and white?

247
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
What's the point?

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,700
Let's go.

249
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,700
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry.

250
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Sir, may I look
in your right shoe, please?

251
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, well.
I thought it would be more.

252
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,100
How did he do that?

253
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,300
I love this town!

254
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
- ...In front of these people.
- The only humiliation is

255
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,900
- That you're incompetent.
- That's not true!

256
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,700
- It is true.
- Come out and say that to my face!

257
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Go on, get the hell out of here.

258
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Leave the petty cash with Troy.

259
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,500
- That's my money.
- Oh yeah, Buck?

260
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Well, you suck!

261
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,300
I can't train you anymore. You're gonna
have to figure it out for yourself.

262
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,500
I don't even know where to begin.

263
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,100
It's not that complicated. Listen,

264
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
If you take this job,
you're an idiot.

265
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,700
Do you underst...

266
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,400
Troy, I'm sorry
you had to see this.

267
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Edward, this wouldn't be
a pleasant story.

268
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to write that down.

269
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,300
Alan, I think it's time
for you to leave.

270
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,900
- No, okay...
- Otherwise, I'm gonna call security.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Oh, call security, you fossil!

272
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, I guess this
is adios, fellas.

273
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,800
Excuse me for interrupting.
Could I have your autograph?

274
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Anything for a beautiful young lady.

275
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Oh!

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Did you enjoy the show?

277
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Oh, I didn't see the show. In fact,
I didn't even know you were here.

278
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,900
There was nothing about it
in the paper or anything.

279
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,200
I used to watch you all the time
on the Carson show, though.

280
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,900
That's super.

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
There you go.

282
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you.

283
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Something's bothering you, it seems.

284
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
That whole thing with Alan...

285
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,500
Alan and I have been
having problems for years.

286
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,200
That's why I had to let him go.

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Troy, I know you have
aspirations beyond this job.

288
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Well, no matter what you decide
to do in the future,

289
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
You'll need life experience.
I can give you that.

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Some very big things
are about to happen for me.

291
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
What kind of things?

292
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,400
Well, Troy, why don't you
stick around a while,

293
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,700
Work with me?
Maybe you'll find out.

294
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Deal?

295
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,000
I dove in.

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,800
My life became
all Buck Howard all the time.

297
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,000
The auditoriums
we played in were old

298
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
And usually half full
but Buck didn't seem to notice.

299
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
The minute he came out on stage,
he was in his element.

300
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,600
Buck walked the edge.
Everything he did,

301
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
He made the impossible
seem possible.

302
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,100
Isn't that wild?

303
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
It's wild!

304
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Buck did have his following,

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
- And we went to them.
- I love this town!

306
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
For some reason, the people
of Akron, Ohio went nuts for him.

307
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,400
I saw parts of the country
I'd never seen before...

308
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,600
- Welcome to Willamette, Oregon!
- I love this town!

309
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,200
That I'd never heard of before...

310
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Welcome to Wausau, Wisconsin!

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,700
I love this town!

312
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
Buck did have his quirks.

313
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
How much did you
tip the bellman?

314
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,700
$2.00.

315
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
That's it?

316
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,600
You represent me, Troy.

317
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,900
You're making me look cheap.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,200
Here you go. Thanks.

319
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,400
Troy, can you come in here?

320
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Did you just give
the bellman $10.00?

321
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,700
- Yes, why?
- It's far too much.

322
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,300
$1.00 cash, American, per bag.

323
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
I am not made of money.

324
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,300
And sometimes
he went beyond quirky.

325
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,800
They pick me up in a minivan.

326
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,700
This show is already ruined!

327
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,900
You are incompetent!

328
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, Buck could
be difficult, frustrating,

329
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
And at times I had to wonder
why I put up with it all.

330
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,500
Mr. Howard.

331
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,800
I want to thank you
so much for having me.

332
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I just wanted to say,
though, I won't be doing

333
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,500
The "You can call me RayJay" bit.

334
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,900
I don't want to do that.

335
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,700
And by the way,
is Mr. Takei here?

336
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,800
Um, no, he's uh...
he won't be with us this year.

337
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
My college roommate was managing

338
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
A multimillion dollar hedge fund

339
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,100
And here I was helping Buck Howard

340
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
With his benefit
starring Gary Coleman

341
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,600
And the guy from
the "Police Academy" movies.

342
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,700
The strange thing
was that I didn't mind.

343
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,800
- Hello, Buck Howard.
- It was kind of cool.

344
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,200
Or sad, depending on how
you looked at it.

345
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
You gotta tell me
how you do it.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,100
I keep getting older
and you look the same.

347
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,300
- Clean living.
- Yeah, clean living,

348
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
And keeping all your money
under a mattress, right?

349
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Anyhow, Buck, I want
to really thank you for calling me.

350
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,200
You know,
nobody calls me anymore.

351
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Buck, we're ready to start.

352
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Have a great show, everyone.

353
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,900
I would like to dedicate
this next song

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,400
To a once very very
dear friend of mine,

355
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Sulu, from "the Star Trek,"

356
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Mr. George Takei.

357
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,700
George,

358
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
May the force be in you.

359
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
What the world needs now...

360
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
No matter
how corny Buck's show could be,

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
And no matter how much
he yelled at me before it,

362
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,400
I never missed
the money effect.

363
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,300
It was the one part of the show
that always amazed me.

364
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

365
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

366
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,200
And without fail,
it always amazed the audience.

367
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,500
True, it would be a pleasure
to retrieve it personally.

368
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,100
As a gentlemen,
I fear I must refrain,

369
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,200
For my money
is in your brassiere.

370
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's the money!

371
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,400
I hadn't found my place in the world.

372
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,300
But this finale was Buck's place,

373
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
And just getting to be a part of it

374
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,900
Made me feel like
I was on the right track.

375
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,700
Troy, we have the last
of the Great Buck autograph seekers.

376
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,700
A colored photograph.
To whom shall I address it?

377
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
Dad, what are you doing here?

378
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,800
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

379
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,600
- Uh...
- Troy, this is your father?

380
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,400
I didn't know
you had family in Leesburg.

381
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
He doesn't.

382
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,700
Sir, what a pleasure.

383
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm Buck Howard.

384
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
But before
you congratulate me on the show

385
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,500
I have to congratulate
you on something.

386
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,400
I want you to know you have raised
a very fine young man

387
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Who is doing
a wonderful job for me.

388
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,700
Hmm. I thought
he was in law school,

389
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,900
Because that's what he told me.

390
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,500
But I am thrilled to hear that
he's doing a wonderful job for you.

391
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Uh-Oh.

392
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,800
You know, Mr. Gable,
I can imagine how you feel.

393
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
My father didn't want me
to go into show business.

394
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,300
He wanted me to be
an accountant.

395
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,500
Obviously that wasn't my calling.

396
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,200
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna touch that.

397
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,600
But if carrying your bags
is Troy's calling, well then I just

398
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,300
Wasted a lot of money
on his education.

399
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,200
- Dad.
- Troy, may I?

400
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,500
You know, sir,
I have a theory about that.

401
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,800
I call it my onwards
and upwards theory.

402
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Perhaps you noticed
in the musical portion of my...

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,700
Listen, I'd like to
talk to my son alone.

404
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Very well.
I was merely trying to add

405
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,400
A little perspectivo,
as the Latins say.

406
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,100
I think you've done that.

407
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,300
Very well. Good evening.

408
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,100
Troy, you can bring that and toss
my salad when you get back to the hotel.

409
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,800
That's a hell of a guy.

410
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,000
Dad, I'm sorry.

411
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,300
I haven't heard from you
in over a month.

412
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,800
I had to call your friends
like I was some kind of freaking cop.

413
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,700
I know.

414
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,700
I would have killed
to go to law school, Troy.

415
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,500
I would have killed.

416
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,900
I hated it.

417
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,100
- I wasn't happy. I...
- You think I danced out the front door

418
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
Every morning
in my adult life happy

419
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,400
About where I was
gonna be spending my day?

420
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,900
I don't know what
you're doing here.

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,700
I don't think you do either.

422
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,000
But come on.
You're smarter than this.

423
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,900
You are.

424
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,500
You are smarter than this.

425
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,300
I hope he enjoys his Cobb salad.

426
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,900
I just don't think, uh...

427
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,300
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

428
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,300
I'm sorry.
I have to resign.

429
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,700
I have to resign.

430
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,800
Gil's not here yet?

431
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,700
Uh, no, he's not.

432
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Buck, there's something
I need to discuss with you.

433
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,800
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

434
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
Can we talk later?
We'll get back to this,

435
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,700
But there is some business
I need to discuss.

436
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
I've tried.

437
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm on the horn to the guys
at Leno, Letterman, every week.

438
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,200
They want to have you on the show.
They're just booked tightly right now.

439
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,100
Letterman I understand
because I don't have a history there.

440
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,300
But this Jay Leno... I think
he's doing his show a great disservice

441
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,500
By not having me. I practically built
"The Tonight Show."

442
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,900
I know we need to get you
some attention right now.

443
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I speak to the bookers in Vegas.

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
I tell them you're better now
than you've ever been.

445
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,800
They tell me
they just need to see it.

446
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
If they need to see something,

447
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,700
I've got something
I can show them.

448
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,700
For the past three years
I have been rehearsing in secret

449
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,500
A new effect. I can't even tell
either of you what it is.

450
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,800
It's not that I don't trust you,
but I cannot afford

451
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
That the tabloids
get a hold of this now.

452
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Let me just say it is enormous.

453
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,300
And I think Cincinnati is
the perfect place to unveil it.

454
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,500
They have always
loved me in Ohio.

455
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Not so much Ohio,
but Akron.

456
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,900
It's close to Cincinnat...
it's the same state.

457
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,400
I need you to call Steve Keating
in New York at the top P.R. Firm.

458
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I want local press
and national press.

459
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
I can feel this.
It's gonna be huge.

460
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Cincinnati.

461
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,800
Welcome to Cincinnati!

462
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I love this town!

463
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
- I'm Doreen.
- How do you do?

464
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm Buck Howard.

465
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,400
This is my brother Kenny.

466
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,800
- Hello, Kenny. How are you?
- Good.

467
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,100
On behalf of both of us,

468
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,400
And the Cincinnati chapter
of the Red Hat Society,

469
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,500
I'd like to present you
with this pin.

470
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,200
Well, my goodness.

471
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,400
Isn't that beautiful?
Ow!

472
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,000
- Oh!
- Agh! Mmm!

473
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,100
You may have
drawn blood there.

474
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,800
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

475
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
It's a beautiful pin
from a beautiful woman

476
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,700
And I will wear it
while I'm here.

477
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,100
The entire time I'm here,
I'll wear it for good luck.

478
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Boy, I love to come
to these venues before the show,

479
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,100
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get back to the hotel

480
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,800
Because my press relations attache

481
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,600
Has flown in for a rendezvous
from the borough of Manhattan.

482
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,800
That's no problem at all.
We're your hosts.

483
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,800
We'll be taking you anywhere you need
to go the whole time you're here.

484
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
That's how we do it
in Cincinnati.

485
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,100
I'm gonna drive you.
We got a limo and everything.

486
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,600
I saw you, 1989,
Bowling Green University.

487
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,100
You were awesome!
Do you remember that?

488
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,300
Honestly, I do
vaguely remember that.

489
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
But of course that's
nearly 20 years ago,

490
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,500
And I do 400 or so shows a year.

491
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,000
You do 400 shows a year?

492
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,900
Yeah, uh, I'm doing
the calculations in my head...

493
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
You might want
to face that way.

494
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,300
And I don't even see how 300 dates
is physically possible. I mean...

495
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,700
That's pretty much
a show every night, you know?

496
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
I mean, where do you perform
on Monday and Tuesday nights

497
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
And how does that
allow for travel time?

498
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,900
Troy, he has to be checked in
by now. It's Steve Keating. K-E-A.

499
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,500
Buck, I know how to spell.
I told him his name a thousand times.

500
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
They're saying
he hasn't checked in.

501
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
Well, this is absurd.
I have to do the TV show this afternoon.

502
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,800
I don't have
my press attaché,

503
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm forced to be driven around
by these two hayseeds all day long.

504
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,000
Maybe that's him, Troy.
Get the door.

505
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Hello.

506
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Do I have the right room?
I'm looking for Buck Howard.

507
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,400
Troy, can you hang up
my pants, please?

508
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
How can I help you, miss?

509
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,900
Mr. Howard, I'm Valerie Brennan
from K.P.T. Steve couldn't make it.

510
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,600
There was this emergency
in London with Gary Oldman

511
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,400
So I will be working with you.

512
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,300
With you?
You're practically an embryo.

513
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,700
I really don't take this very well.

514
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,300
I'm sorry. I don't like
these kind of changes.

515
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,600
I have a very big weekend.

516
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,100
I have my show Saturday.

517
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
I have an enormous event
planned for Sunday.

518
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,500
And I know all about it.
I have been briefed.

519
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,400
It's gonna be perfect.

520
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I know you hired Steve,

521
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,700
But I think I can fill in
for him quite capably.

522
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,000
All right, young lady,
we'll give it a shot, see how it goes.

523
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,600
Good. My name's Valerie.

524
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,700
Very well, Valerie.

525
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,900
This is Troy,
my road manager.

526
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,700
Hi.

527
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,100
So why don't you get some rest?

528
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
The news is
in a couple of hours

529
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,800
And I need to work
on your schedule.

530
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,900
If you could spare Troy,
that would be great.

531
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,100
He could help me roll some calls.

532
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,000
- Troy, do you mind?
- No.

533
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,100
Well, it was nice meeting you.

534
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Thank you.

535
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,600
From the shining se-Ee-Ea...

536
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,300
So, you wanted to
go over something?

537
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh, no. I just want
to go over a drink about now.

538
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
Can I have a scotch
on the rocks?

539
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,400
- And you, sir?
- Uh, same.

540
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Very good.

541
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,700
I can't believe I'm in Cincinnati
with Buck Howard.

542
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Can I ask you
something about Buck?

543
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
- Yeah.
- Is he gay?

544
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,600
'Cause we got a bet
going in the office.

545
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,900
I don't know.

546
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,800
So you're not his, um,

547
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,200
Traveling companion, or...

548
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,700
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

549
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
It just looked
kind of domestic up in the room

550
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,500
With you handling his pants.

551
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,600
No, Buck's just my boss.

552
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm just doing this to pay the bills,

553
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,400
You know, until I figure out...

554
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
What you really want to do.

555
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,900
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hmm.

556
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,900
Okay, so, let me guess.

557
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,000
You... you're a good looking guy,
so you're an actor.

558
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,400
No.

559
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Stand up?

560
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,900
Oh, God no.

561
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,700
Okay, hold on, hold on.

562
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,500
Um, you're a writer.

563
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,000
- Did I get it?
- No.

564
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

565
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,700
I do a little writing.

566
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,800
What little writing
have you done?

567
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,000
Just little stuff, silly stuff,

568
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Stuff that's happened to me, or stuff
that didn't happen that I wish happened,

569
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Things like that.

570
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Well, you sound like
a writer to me.

571
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
Hmm.

572
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,300
Thank you.

573
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,100
Hey, I didn't say
you were a good writer.

574
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,100
Okay, I'm gonna go.

575
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,900
This was fun. It was nice.

576
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,100
So I'm gonna go freshen up
for our big night out.

577
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,200
I'll see you at dinner.

578
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,400
I can't believe that you know
Sulu from "Star Trek."

579
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,100
Hey, what about Spock?
You know him too?

580
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,500
I've met Leonard Nimoy
but I wouldn't say we're friends.

581
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,700
And for that matter, George and I

582
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,100
Aren't on the best of terms
at the moment, I'm afraid.

583
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,700
Mr. Howard, have you
ever been married?

584
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,200
No, I've never met
the right little lady.

585
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,100
Yeah, right.

586
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,900
As Shirley MacLaine said,
"True love is supposed to be rare.

587
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,100
That's how we know
it's valuable."

588
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,700
That's beautiful.

589
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Shirley's actually a client of ours.

590
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,900
She is a very nice woman.

591
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,100
You know Shirley MacLaine?

592
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
That's what I do. I arrange and
coordinate publicity for celebrities.

593
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,900
- Well, give us some dirt!
- No!

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,100
We want to know
who's sleeping with who!

595
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,600
- I take the fifth because...
- I know Shirley. She...

596
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,900
- I cannot say anything complimentary.
- She came to a show I did.

597
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
All right, tell us who's nice, then.

598
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,500
Okay. Um, so,

599
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,600
People like to make fun
of Keanu Reeves,

600
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Right, 'cause he's...

601
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
But he is one of the sweetest
guys you will ever meet.

602
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Oh, you can tell that.

603
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
Tell him he kicked butt
in "The Matrix"!

604
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,800
- Tell him.
- Okay.

605
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
Um, and, um, Jay Leno...

606
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,900
He's just a regular guy
from Boston.

607
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,100
Just really down to earth,
really sweet.

608
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,900
You think Jay Leno is

609
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Just a regular sweet guy
from Boston?

610
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,800
You don't have the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

611
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,900
Well, I met Jay Leno
a number of times

612
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
And he's always
been really warm.

613
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
Then he was faking.

614
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,200
I know Jay Leno, missy.
I know him.

615
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,000
I've dealt with Jay Leno.

616
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,000
- You'll have to trust me on this one.
- I...

617
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Buck Howard?
To makeup.

618
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
No, Buck. This way.

619
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,400
Let's do it!

620
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,400
I'll be right back. I have to go
call and check in on the boys.

621
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,100
She's great, my sister.

622
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
She's a genius,

623
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,200
Very artistic, been married
a whole bunch of times.

624
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,800
She's lived a glamorous life.

625
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,000
Sounds like it.

626
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Hey.

627
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
How does Buck do his tricks?

628
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm not gonna tell anyone, I swear.

629
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,000
I don't know. I don't...

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,100
You're his assistant.
He's got to tell you something.

631
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Kenny, as far as I know, it's real.

632
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,300
Damn.

633
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,700
They're gonna go to commercial
in a couple of minutes.

634
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
Then we're on.

635
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
The producer says
we can watch from the booth.

636
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Okay.

637
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,600
You smell really nice.

638
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,500
Thanks.

639
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Cindy Crown here,
back with magician Buck Howard,

640
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,600
Or the Great Buck Howard
as he's more commonly known.

641
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,800
It is wonderful to have you
in Cincinnati, Buck.

642
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,200
Thanks, Cindy.
I'm very glad to be here.

643
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,600
Yes, and I understand
you're here for a very special show.

644
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,200
That's correct, Cindy.

645
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,900
On Saturday evening,

646
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,400
I will be performing

647
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,300
At the Cincinnati Arts Complex.

648
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,400
I was afraid Ohio
may have an arts complex,

649
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,700
But I never expected
it would be in Cincinnati.

650
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,600
And on Sunday afternoon,

651
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,400
I'll be staging
a very important event.

652
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Why don't you tell us about that?

653
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,700
This has been top secret
to this very moment.

654
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,700
At roughly 2:00 P.M.,

655
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,900
I will put to sleep

656
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
900 souls,

657
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,400
Whom I will wake up
immediately afterwards,

658
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,300
As if from the dead.

659
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,100
Well, that sounds just super.

660
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,900
Be sure to come out
for both events, folks.

661
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,500
Now, I've heard you're going
to do a warmup

662
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,700
By performing
a magic trick on me.

663
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,400
Take this piece of paper
in your left hand.

664
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I'll need a coin. Ah!

665
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,900
Yes, there's one.

666
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,700
Oh!

667
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,200
I want you to hold
that silver dollar in your hand

668
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Between your thumb
and your forefinger.

669
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
I will begin counting.

670
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,600
Whenever you feel compelled, all you
need to do is simply drop the coin.

671
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Ready?

672
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,900
One, two,

673
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,900
Three,

674
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,300
Four.

675
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,400
Five.

676
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,200
- 20 seconds, Cindy.
- Six.

677
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,100
Cindy, you do understand
that at some point in time

678
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,200
- You have to let the coin drop.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

679
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,700
- Maybe I didn't understand.
- 10 seconds, Cindy.

680
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
We're almost out of time.

681
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,300
But we can do this
very quickly. Go ahead.

682
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Hold out your hand.
We'll try it one more time very quickly.

683
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,300
Ready...

684
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,600
- I'm sorry, we are out of time, Buck.
- Oh my God.

685
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,500
- And thank you...
- Cut 'em off.

686
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,600
- Let's don't drop the coin...
- We're out.

687
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,300
Maybe you could come back
at some other point in the future.

688
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Listen, I'm sorry.
Mr. Howard...

689
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?

690
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,400
He won't pick up his phone
and I'm trying to apologize.

691
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,700
I don't know what for,
but I am trying to apologize.

692
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,300
It's okay. Just relax.

693
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Trust me.
This is what Buck is like.

694
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,800
Tomorrow he'll act like
nothing happened.

695
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,700
What are we doing here?

696
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
I mean, seriously,

697
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,800
How on earth does a guy like you

698
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,300
Wind up working with Buck Howard?

699
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,800
- I want to know.
- I had just quit law school

700
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,300
And moved to L.A.

701
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,700
I bet you wish you'd just stayed in
school right about now.

702
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,300
No way.

703
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,100
Look, Buck is no picnic,

704
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,800
But law school was...
oh my God.

705
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,800
I would wake up every day there

706
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,800
Just dreading life.

707
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Look, I'll admit I have
no idea what I'm doing,

708
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,700
And obviously I've got to
quit this job and figure it out,

709
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,000
But I'm trying,

710
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,000
And it feels good.

711
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,200
It feels like what I'm supposed
to do, you know?

712
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Oh, come on.
You're not supposed to do anything.

713
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,700
Life is not magical like that, okay?

714
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,300
No one is supposed to do anything.

715
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
How do you know that?

716
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,000
'Cause it boils down
to the same thing for everyone,

717
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,700
From Buck Howard
to Meryl Streep to you.

718
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Most creative people, they just want
the world to love and adore them,

719
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
Which is infantile.

720
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,100
Okay, all right.

721
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,900
Maybe I'm naive, but

722
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Life is short,

723
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,700
You know?
I mean, someday

724
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
We're not gonna be here.

725
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,700
And if that's the case,

726
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I want to spend the time
that I have doing something

727
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,600
That makes my heart race.

728
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I don't care what
that says about me.

729
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
It's how I feel.

730
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,600
That really turns me on.

731
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,800
Are you serious?

732
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah. That whole existential thing...

733
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,300
I have a boyfriend.

734
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Oh, forget I said it.

735
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,000
- Hello?
- Troy, are you asleep?

736
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,800
Buck, no, I'm awake.

737
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,500
I just think I'm coming down
with something. What's up?

738
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Where the hell is Valerie?

739
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,300
She's supposed to be
organizing interviews for me today.

740
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,000
I have no idea where she is.

741
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,800
I don't know where she is exactly,

742
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
But I'm sure she's on top of it.

743
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,500
I'll try and track her down.

744
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,400
I was just on my way
to the theater right now.

745
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
Well, I'll be in my room preparing
for the show tonight.

746
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,100
I don't want to be disturbed
unless it's for press.

747
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,600
Okay.

748
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,300
Spotlight on me.
Buck will enter stage right,

749
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,500
Come up to the microphone...
"I love this town"...

750
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,100
Do a few effects.

751
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Eventually he will come
over to the piano.

752
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Basically just stay on Buck
the whole time. That's all you...

753
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,000
- Hi.
- Mmm.

754
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,900
- Uh...
- Oh, uh...

755
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,600
I have to show you something.

756
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,100
Edward's article.

757
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,400
Now, I heard it was coming,

758
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,200
And I heard it was bad...

759
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,800
It's, I mean, yeah...

760
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,300
He pretty much makes fun
of Buck the entire time.

761
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,500
Okay.

762
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,100
Uh, we can't let him see this.

763
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,800
No, it's this one
right here, Mr. Howard.

764
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,500
Oh.

765
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,300
Mr. Howard, I just wanted to
ask you if it would be okay

766
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,600
For me to introduce you
before the show tonight.

767
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,400
No, it wouldn't be okay.
I'm always introduced on tape...

768
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,100
Always have been, always will be.

769
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,100
That's a nice outfit, though.
Very becoming.

770
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,100
Just there, Kenny.
Thank you.

771
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
- Kenny, that will be all, thank you.
- Yep, okay.

772
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,300
I'm all over there.

773
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
Troy, this is urgent.

774
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,400
I don't want this Kenny fellow
anywhere near me.

775
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,200
Our policy is "Out of the way, freak,
I have to catch a train."

776
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Do you understand?

777
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
Give him a photo,
a colored one.

778
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Actually, no, get him
a black and white.

779
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,000
Second thing... why didn't we do
any more interviews today?

780
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,100
What is the mental midget
Valerie doing?

781
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,700
She got you an interview today.

782
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
In fact, they're on
their way here right now.

783
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
- With who?
- An internet columnist.

784
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,100
I don't even know that paper.

785
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
And it's here and now,
in a few minutes.

786
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,000
I knew nothing about it.

787
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,400
This is the time I have
to prepare for the show, Troy,

788
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,300
And what good would it do
to do an interview now?

789
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,100
I think Valerie is concentrating
more on tomorrow's big event.

790
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,700
She was told that the locals here
would pack the place tonight.

791
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,500
Buck, I have Mark Simpson
here to interview you.

792
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,900
Hello, young man.
I have heard a lot about you.

793
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,800
- I'm a really big fan.
- Whoa.

794
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,100
Come on over, sit with me.
Pull you up a chair.

795
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,300
I won't have long to give you.

796
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,200
I've had a lot of press today.

797
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Buck, are you ready?

798
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,500
Yeah.

799
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Okay, Jeff, Buck is ready.

800
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
House lights down.

801
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,700
Cue tape.

802
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,900
Stage lights, please.

803
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,200
- What is she doing?
- Thank you.

804
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,800
It's okay.
She's got a big surprise for you.

805
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
I wanted to welcome
the Great Buck Howard...

806
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,700
- Oh my God.
- To Cincinnati in my own special way,

807
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,900
So I composed a little song.
I hope he likes it.

808
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,500
Troy, stop her.

809
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,000
How?

810
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,000
Do you believe in magic?

811
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,700
Well, Buck Howard is here

812
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,700
He's gonna give a great show

813
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
So you don't have to fear

814
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,400
There'll be some magic

815
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,700
And some mentalism too

816
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
And if we're really lucky

817
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,000
He might even play the pian-Oo

818
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Do you believe in magic?

819
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,100
Do you believe
in ma-A-Gic?

820
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,100
Do you believe in ma-A-A-Gic?

821
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard!

822
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,900
Come on, Buck!

823
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,600
The Great Buck Howard,
everybody!

824
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,300
That was the most amateurish thing

825
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,700
I've had to live
through in 40 years.

826
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,900
She nearly ruined the show.

827
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,600
There is a reason, Troy,
I am called the Great Buck Howard.

828
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,300
Not the Okay Buck Howard,
not the not Bad Buck Howard,

829
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,700
- The Great Buck Howard!
- I know. I'm sorry.

830
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,000
I do not want to see
either of those people

831
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,600
For the remainder of our stay here.

832
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,100
We rent our own car, a cheap one,

833
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,300
And we drive ourselves around.

834
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,100
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

835
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,700
I barely got this show
back tonight, Troy.

836
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,900
The audience thought
we were clowns.

837
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,700
And by the way,
you are partially to blame.

838
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,600
Buck, there is no way
I could have known

839
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,300
That she was gonna pull that.

840
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,100
Yes, that's true.
You only could have known

841
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
If you were someone
who is observant.

842
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,300
But you're clearly not
someone who is observant.

843
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,900
Could you leave
my dressing room, please?

844
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,100
- He seemed really pissed.
- He was.

845
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,700
She just wanted to sing,
man, you know?

846
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,900
Kenny, I don't know
what to tell you,

847
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,400
But this is the way it's gotta be.

848
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Yeah.

849
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
He wanted you to have
one of these, though.

850
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
Now that's class.

851
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,100
We mess up his whole show,

852
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,700
But he's still got enough goodness

853
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,100
To give me a really cool picture.

854
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,200
I will treasure this, Troy.

855
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,700
I know you will.

856
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,400
Who's this guy?

857
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,600
That's Alan.
He was Buck's road manager before me.

858
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,600
There's like
a whole section about him.

859
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,300
Buck is gonna die
when he sees this.

860
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,300
It's hard to feel bad for him.

861
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,600
He has this face
you just want to punch.

862
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
How does he do
the things in his act?

863
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
I mean, how does
he find the money?

864
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,300
- And I know you know.
- I don't know.

865
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,200
I heard he has a guy
who travels around with him

866
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,600
And he slips into the audience
and he tells him where the money is.

867
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
How? When?
He's being watched the whole time.

868
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,200
- He has a hearing aid.
- He does not have a hearing aid.

869
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,600
Besides, that is impractical.

870
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,500
Buck would have to have
someone on payroll year round,

871
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,200
And he's too much
of a cheapskate for that.

872
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,700
You're cute,

873
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,400
'Cause you like believing
he's real, don't you?

874
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,700
I cannot wait for
this weekend to be over.

875
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,800
Not that it...
I didn't mean about...

876
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,500
I just hate working with...

877
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,100
You're great. This has been...

878
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,600
It's okay. It's okay.

879
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,100
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't even be here.

880
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,100
I should just...

881
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,800
Go back to my...

882
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Room.

883
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,300
Right?

884
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah, you should
just go to your room.

885
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,600
Go ahead. Go.
I'll see you in the morning.

886
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,000
What?

887
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
- Go to your room.
- Troy, I...

888
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I was just... are you...?

889
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,600
No, stay.

890
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,600
A night on my own
in Cincinnati...

891
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,100
By this point,

892
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,300
All I could really think
was one thing...

893
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,100
Thank God I did not quit
this job before Cincinnati.

894
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,000
The town hadn't been
as kind to Buck, though.

895
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But that didn't matter, because the
whole weekend was about his big effect.

896
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,900
Buck was counting on it
to change everything for him.

897
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,700
And on the day,
it looked like it just might.

898
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,200
You're very good at what you do,

899
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,800
'Cause this is a lot of people.

900
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,700
There's like 300 so far,

901
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,400
And the press turnout's great.

902
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,000
So yeah, if you just tell him

903
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,500
To go get ready, we're good.

904
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Okay.

905
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Thank you ma'am. Hi, just sign here
and make your way...

906
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,200
Thank you. Silence, please.
I need complete silence.

907
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,600
I have already begun
to take a mental picture

908
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,500
Of each and every one of you here.

909
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,500
If I feel you are not suited

910
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,900
To this task,

911
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,200
I will tap you on the shoulder

912
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,000
And for your own safety

913
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,500
You will go off to one side,

914
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,900
Where you will become
an observer

915
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,400
And no longer a participant.

916
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,700
Please focus on me.

917
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,600
Let no outside stimuli

918
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Break this little bubble
we've formed between us.

919
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,100
This is getting to be
the ideal group.

920
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,100
We're almost ready to begin.

921
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,300
Stop.

922
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,100
Members of the press,
we're delighted that you're here,

923
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,500
But in order to ensure
your ability to cover this event,

924
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,600
I urge you not to listen
too carefully to what I am going to say.

925
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,900
Please. Now, let us begin.

926
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen to the sound of my voice

927
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,100
And only my voice.

928
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,100
I will now count from one to 20.

929
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,400
While I am counting, you will slowly
feel yourselves becoming tired.

930
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,400
In fact, more than tired.
You will feel exhausted.

931
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,100
But this is good.

932
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,600
You have come
to the right place.

933
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,200
This is the ideal locale
to lie down and take a rest.

934
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,000
If you decide to lower yourselves

935
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,900
Down to the ground,

936
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,900
Be my guest. One, two,

937
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,900
Three, four...

938
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,900
Hey hey.

939
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,300
Six, seven...

940
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,300
Eight, nine...

941
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,900
- Where are you going?
- 10...

942
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,200
Where are you all going?
Somebody has to stay here.

943
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,100
11, 12...

944
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,300
Jerry Springer has had
some frickin' accident

945
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,200
And everyone's leaving to cover it.

946
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
- Did you say Jerry Springer?
- 15...

947
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,700
Jerry Springer used
to be like the mayor of Cincinnati...

948
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,500
- 17...
- Are they gonna come back?

949
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,400
- Where was the accident? Was it close?
- Columbia Parkway.

950
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,800
It was close.

951
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,400
20.

952
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,200
Jeez, he did it.

953
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,900
Jerry Springer got into
a car accident on the Columbia Parkway

954
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,000
And they all got
called away to cover it.

955
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,900
- Who?
- Jerry Springer.

956
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,900
He was on a TV show a while back.
It was kind of a big thing.

957
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,400
Prior to his TV show
he was the mayor of Cincinnati,

958
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
So he's kind of popular here.

959
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,000
It's this pin. It is cursed!

960
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,800
Let's go.

961
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,500
I give up.

962
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,600
Buck...

963
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,200
What?

964
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,400
These people are still asleep.

965
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Wake up.

966
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,100
Wake up.

967
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,100
Wake up!

968
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,600
Wake up.

969
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
Make your way,
thank you very much for coming.

970
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,200
Buck, I'm really sorry
about your thing, it's...

971
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,500
Let me get this straight...

972
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,200
The entire local press corps had
to leave to cover a traffic accident?

973
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,600
Yeah, uh... yeah.

974
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,000
Why didn't you get
the national press here

975
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,500
As I asked?
They wouldn't have had to leave.

976
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,100
I tried and I couldn't
get any to come.

977
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,600
No, I'm sure you couldn't,
because you were so busy

978
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,400
Servicing Troy's needs
that you couldn't service mine.

979
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,600
- Buck!
- Don't say a word.

980
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,200
I've just performed
one of the most stunning feats

981
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,100
In the history of mentalism,

982
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,800
And there was no one to see it.

983
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,500
This was going to change
everything for me.

984
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,800
The two of you have delayed
my resurgence by months.

985
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,300
And I will have you fired
tomorrow morning, I promise you.

986
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
Let's go, Troy.

987
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,300
I wasn't gonna give you this,

988
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,900
Didn't want to be the one.

989
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But now I just don't care.

990
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
Goodbye, Buck.

991
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,300
Buck, you can't just...

992
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,700
Forget it. Valerie!

993
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,900
- Valerie, wait.
- I just want to get out of here, okay?

994
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,900
- My blood is boiling.
- I don't blame you.

995
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,900
I'm done, Troy. Never in my life
have I been spoken to...

996
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
- I'm done.
- I know. Me too.

997
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,300
Excuse me.

998
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,500
One, two, three, four, five,

999
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
One, two,
three, four, five,

1000
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,200
One, two, three,
four, five...

1001
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,500
He's fine. We're gonna keep him
overnight and run some tests,

1002
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,500
But I think it was
just exhaustion.

1003
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,900
Really?
So he's gonna be okay?

1004
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,800
Well, he did pinch a nerve.

1005
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,600
Whoever gave him C.P.R.
Didn't know what they were doing.

1006
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,700
Thank you.

1007
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,100
- This is it.
- Yeah.

1008
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,400
Yeah.

1009
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,200
It's been really nice
being with you, Troy,

1010
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,100
You know, and...

1011
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,300
Just... you know,
I'm in L.A. All the time

1012
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,300
And maybe I'll call you sometime,
you know, when I'm...

1013
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,200
In L.A.

1014
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,800
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

1015
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,500
One thing... you...

1016
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
You've gotta quit this job.

1017
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,300
You know you can do better,

1018
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,500
And I know people.
I could probably help.

1019
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,100
- Okay?
- Okay.

1020
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,200
It is over for Buck
and everyone knows it but him.

1021
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,200
No, it's not life-Threatening.

1022
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,100
He just fainted.

1023
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
Look, my wife said
she's leaving me

1024
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,100
If I let a client ruin
another vacation.

1025
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,300
I can't go unless his life
is in imminent danger.

1026
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,300
Gil, what am
I supposed to do here?

1027
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,100
What do you mean?

1028
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,100
Isn't there someone
I should call or notify?

1029
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,700
No. Troy, there's no one.

1030
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,200
It's just you.

1031
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,800
Okay.

1032
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,700
I am going to sue
that human rectum Edward

1033
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,800
And his disgusting magazine

1034
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,500
Right out of business.

1035
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,200
They were deceptive, malicious,

1036
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,700
Not to mention I was supposed
to be on the cover.

1037
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,500
I'm sorry about some
of the things I said.

1038
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,900
I was very upset.
It wasn't you.

1039
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,500
I never told anyone this,

1040
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,900
But I did do
"The Tonight Show" 61 times,

1041
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,300
But I didn't appear once
in Johnny's last 10 years.

1042
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,100
I have no idea why.

1043
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,000
They just stopped calling.
No one ever explained.

1044
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,700
Even at the end
when Johnny was retiring,

1045
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,200
I kept hoping that he'd call
for one last show,

1046
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,400
But he never did.

1047
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,300
That's actually when I realized
that it was probably over for me.

1048
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,500
I've been denying it ever since.

1049
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,300
It's exhausting.

1050
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,800
You still entertain
a lot of people, Buck.

1051
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,800
You still put on a good show.

1052
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,700
A good show. A good show.

1053
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,800
How are we today, Mister...

1054
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,900
Howard?

1055
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,500
Horrible!

1056
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,500
How's Gary Singer?

1057
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,100
You mean Jerry Springer.
Very well.

1058
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,200
It was a minor accident.

1059
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,900
He checked out last night.

1060
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,900
I'm sorry to hear that.

1061
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,700
Seeing Buck like this was hard.

1062
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,700
Despite everything,
I'd come to feel

1063
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,300
Not exactly affection for him,

1064
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,300
But something like it.

1065
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,800
This was the end, though,

1066
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,800
And just like Valerie had said,

1067
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,000
It was over for Buck.

1068
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,100
Legendary performer
and mentalist Buck Howard

1069
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,600
Collapsed and was rushed
to University Hospital yesterday.

1070
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,600
Conflicting reports suggest
that Mr. Howard suffered

1071
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,000
Somewhat of
a mental breakdown

1072
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,900
After setting a new world record
in a stunning performance...

1073
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,900
...is best known
for his many appearances

1074
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
On "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson"...

1075
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,300
Our reporter Judd McKinley
was on hand yesterday

1076
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,100
And got this eyewitness footage.

1077
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,900
And Mr. Howard,
he seemed totally out of it...

1078
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,900
Delivery for Mr. Howard.

1079
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,600
Call Gil and tell him
I'm in imminent danger.

1080
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,300
He'll know what it means.

1081
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,400
This train is leaving the station

1082
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,000
And we've got to be on it.

1083
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,800
And bring these bouquets.
They're worth a lot of money.

1084
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,100
The legendary mentalist
Buck Howard,

1085
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,500
Best known for his many appearances on
"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"

1086
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Checked himself out of a hospital
in Cincinnati on Monday,

1087
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
After the completion
of a highly taxing stunt

1088
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,300
Where he put some
800 people to sleep.

1089
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,100
Mary Hart was just the beginning.

1090
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,700
No one could have predicted it,

1091
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,300
But suddenly Buck was hip.

1092
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,300
David, it's great
to have you on T.R.L.

1093
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,600
Everyone's enjoying you here.

1094
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,700
We do have a big
surprise for you here.

1095
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,600
We're gonna bring him out.

1096
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard! Come on out!

1097
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,800
I love this town!

1098
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,000
And I love this man,
David Blainefield!

1099
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,400
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1100
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,100
Why don't we just
mentally shake hands?

1101
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,900
Do you have insight
into the mindset of the kids today?

1102
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,200
What's your take on kids today?

1103
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,000
I suppose I have
some degree of insight,

1104
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
And I have one major worry,

1105
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,700
And that worry can be
summed up in one word:

1106
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,900
Drugs.

1107
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,600
Today we'll be preparing
one of Buck Howard's original recipes

1108
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,300
From his new book,
"Mentally Cooked."

1109
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,000
Since this picture was taken, it looks
like you've had a little work done,

1110
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,200
- Around the eyes, I think.
- No, nothing's changed.

1111
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,000
You don't have to be
defensive about it.

1112
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,400
- No, I don't.
- A lot of people have work done.

1113
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,300
But not me.

1114
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,900
Now, Buck, this is quite incredible.
You're hip now.

1115
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,200
Are you aware that you're hip?

1116
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,600
I'm aware that I'm hip,

1117
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,100
And I have to say, Colin,

1118
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,400
- I've always been hip.
- It's Conan.

1119
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh, right.

1120
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,900
I love this town!

1121
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,700
Buck, how are you? Whoa!

1122
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,400
Wow!

1123
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,200
Buck, it's good to have you here.

1124
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,700
- It's great to be back.
- Oh my gosh, yes indeed.

1125
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,400
I don't think I'll be the same.

1126
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,400
Buck, I've got a friend
of yours backstage

1127
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,600
Who you haven't seen
in quite a while now.

1128
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,300
So I'm gonna bring him out
right now. You ready?

1129
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
George Takei!

1130
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,900
What the world
needs now

1131
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,600
Is love, sweet love

1132
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,400
It's the only thing...

1133
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,400
- I love this man!
- That there's

1134
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,300
Just too little of.

1135
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,000
In the wake
of this whole crazy circus,

1136
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,800
The call came in that Buck
had been waiting for.

1137
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,500
It was Vegas. There was talk
of a headline spot,

1138
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,300
Even a long-Term deal.

1139
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,400
But now, Buck
wouldn't hear of it.

1140
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,700
And why would he?
He was beyond Vegas.

1141
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,000
He was bigger
than he had ever been,

1142
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,600
And he was about to make
a triumphant return to the place

1143
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,500
Where it had all started for him.

1144
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,400
It's "The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno,"

1145
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,500
Featuring Kevin Eubanks
and the Tonight Show band.

1146
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,200
Tonight, Jay welcomes
Tom Arnold,

1147
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,600
Mentalist Buck Howard...

1148
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,700
Okay.

1149
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:38,200
And now, Jay Leno!

1150
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,500
...you're right. I can't tell you.

1151
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,200
- We're about out of time.
- Okay okay.

1152
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,800
Do you even have
anything to promote?

1153
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,500
No, I just came to hang out.

1154
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,700
You're not
at the Chuckle Hut next week?

1155
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,500
No, I just got nowhere to go.

1156
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,700
Tom, we gotta go.
My apologies to magician Buck Howard.

1157
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,100
We were not able to
bring him on tonight,

1158
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,300
We were having so much
fun with Tom,

1159
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,700
Time got away with us.
We'll have him back at another time.

1160
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,100
Good night. Stay tuned for Conan,
coming up next. Good night, everybody!

1161
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,400
So, I'm bumped for Tom Arnold.

1162
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,900
I don't even know who that is.

1163
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,300
Hey, Buck,
I am so sorry, man.

1164
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,000
My wife left me for a rich guy

1165
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,600
And my mom got busted
for crystal meth,

1166
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,600
So I had a lot of funny material.

1167
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,000
It just kept going on.

1168
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,500
You inspired me
to come to Hollywood.

1169
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
Do you remember this?
1978, Ottumwa, Iowa,

1170
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,800
The coliseum?
You signed this for me. You rocked.

1171
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,600
Excuse me.
Buck, Jay wanted me to tell you

1172
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,700
He's very sorry.
It couldn't be helped.

1173
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,500
- Buck. Buck.
- Thank you, Buck. You rocked!

1174
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,800
Come on, you're not the first person
in the world to get bumped.

1175
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,800
We want to have
you on next week.

1176
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,000
Do you know how many times
I did "The Tonight Show"?

1177
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,900
61. Do you know how many times
Johnny Carson bumped me?

1178
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,700
Zero. None. Nada.

1179
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,900
You can tell Jay to take
his apology and shove it!

1180
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,300
Do you want to be on
the show next week or not?

1181
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,900
That man is Satan.

1182
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,300
And Buck Howard
does not work with Satan.

1183
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,500
Gil, call Vegas.
Let's hear what they have to say.

1184
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,100
Hello hello.

1185
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,900
Hi.

1186
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,600
Hello.

1187
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,200
Hey.

1188
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,400
Welcome back to Vegas, Buck!

1189
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,400
- Thank you.
- Hey. Dan Green.

1190
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,800
Nice to meet you, Dan.

1191
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,300
Michael Perry... oh, wow.
Quite a handshake.

1192
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,700
The old Buck Howard handshake.
That's fantastic.

1193
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,400
By the way, a great job
on the Stewarts... Jon and Martha.

1194
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,800
Unbelievable, really.

1195
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,000
- Good exposure for you.
- Buck, you look great.

1196
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,200
- I mean the whole... the...
- Very fresh.

1197
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,800
- It's got a...
- Yeah, it's terrific.

1198
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,100
Listen, I'm gonna jump in.

1199
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,600
Buck, as Gil already knows,
we've been courting you.

1200
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,600
After the comeback you've had
we think Vegas is

1201
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,700
- The perfect place for you.
- Perfect.

1202
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,100
We don't mean
to offend at all, but we did

1203
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,400
- Conduct some initial research...
- Yeah, and so Gilly sent us

1204
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,100
A few tapes, and we screened them
for a focus group, and...

1205
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,700
Yeah. The magic-Slash-Mentalist
part of the show

1206
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,700
Where you're doing the hypnosis

1207
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,300
And you're looking for your money

1208
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,000
- Scored really high.
- Yeah, through the roof.

1209
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,700
However, the piano and the standup
portion of your show...

1210
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,700
- Mmm, not so much.
- A little more on the lower end.

1211
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,400
- Yeah. Not bad...
- No, not awful.

1212
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,300
Just... a... little...

1213
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,300
Any thoughts?

1214
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,900
Well, I, um...

1215
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,600
I want to get back to Vegas,

1216
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,100
And it's not that
I don't find it sickening

1217
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,400
That people don't like
the standup and the piano,

1218
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,000
But I'm open for suggestion.

1219
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,600
- Ah.
- Great. Okay.

1220
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,400
- That's what we wanted to hear.
- That's where we were headed.

1221
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,700
That's Teddy.

1222
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,600
I'll be right back.

1223
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,900
We're not gonna change anything big.
It is the Buck Howard show.

1224
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,900
Oh, Buck, I gotta tell you, my mom...

1225
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,900
This was Buck's shot.

1226
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,400
The hype had died down
and now this is what was left.

1227
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,100
Maybe this is where Buck belonged...
back in Vegas,

1228
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,200
With his name in bright lights.

1229
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

1230
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,800
Get ready for a night
that will overwhelm your senses,

1231
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,700
Expand your mind,
and thrill your soul.

1232
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,500
Presenting the Great Buck Howard!

1233
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,700
And your number is...

1234
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,900
- 17.
- Oh my God!

1235
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,200
Show the crowd.

1236
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,100
How 'bout that, folks?

1237
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,800
Isn't that wild, folks?

1238
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,300
Isn't that wild? It's wild!

1239
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments time

1240
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:28,900
These fine citizens will wake up
with a snap of my finger.

1241
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,000
They will believe someone has
removed all of their clothes...

1242
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,700
And that they are standing
in front of you,

1243
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,600
Shall we say, buck naked.

1244
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,600
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

1245
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,100
Gil, do you have a second?

1246
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,900
Look, this could not be going better.

1247
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,300
- Love it.
- We're really happy...

1248
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,900
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1249
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,500
These two people
will come backstage with me

1250
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,500
To keep an eye on me to make sure
there's no funny business,

1251
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,700
And these two people
will hide my fee in cash

1252
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,700
Somewhere in this auditorium.

1253
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,400
You have my fee.

1254
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,400
All right, shall we?

1255
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,400
Here we go. Man of the hour.

1256
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,300
Great job, Buck.
It's going great.

1257
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,100
Hey, Buck,
let me ask you something.

1258
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,000
How do they work
this thing with your money?

1259
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,400
What do you mean?

1260
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,700
I assume the casino pays you
by the month, right?

1261
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,700
So is that a week's
worth of cash out there?

1262
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,100
- Honey, shh.
- What? I'm curious.

1263
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,000
- Um...
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hi.

1264
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,700
I work for the casinos, sir,
and it's a good question.

1265
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,000
The agreement we have with Buck

1266
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,800
Is that if he's unable
to find the money,

1267
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,100
A pro-Rated sum
for tonight's show only,

1268
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,000
It is deducted from his salary
and donated to charity.

1269
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,500
Boring!

1270
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,900
- They're ready for you.
- Mr. Howard...

1271
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,300
- We're here to party.
- ...they're ready for you.

1272
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,200
- Gotta get out there!
- Go get 'em, Buck!

1273
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,600
As I went back
to watch him finish the show,

1274
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,000
I had this feeling that
it was time for me to move on.

1275
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,900
I was Buck's road manager,
and his days on the road were over.

1276
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,500
Now for this next effect

1277
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,000
I will need complete silence,

1278
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,700
Absolute concentration.
Thank you.

1279
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,500
Two-Year deal. Buck did it.

1280
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,400
Yes, his show had changed...

1281
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
The doves, the scarves...

1282
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,300
But it seemed like Buck was okay
with these compromises.

1283
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,400
And despite it all,
his show still came down to this,

1284
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
His signature effect,

1285
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,500
The thing he had
always been known for.

1286
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,600
Gil, is he all right?

1287
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,500
Oh, just fine.

1288
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,800
But then, suddenly,

1289
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,000
For the first time
in a nearly 40-Year career,

1290
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,100
Buck couldn't find his money.

1291
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:47,000
And just like that, it was over.

1292
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,800
So here you are.

1293
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,100
What are you gonna do now, kid?

1294
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,900
Well, um,

1295
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,900
I've been doing some writing.

1296
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,300
Really?
Like for a newspaper?

1297
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,000
No, different kind of writing.

1298
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,200
Oh. You mean the kind
where they don't pay you.

1299
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,100
Well, I'm hoping eventually,
but so far, yeah.

1300
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,200
You don't remember because
you were a little kid.

1301
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,700
But your mom and I,
we barely made it in the beginning.

1302
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,400
- We struggled...
- So that I wouldn't have to.

1303
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,600
Yes, I know.

1304
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,300
That's right.
But I didn't have a choice.

1305
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,500
You do.

1306
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,200
So, how about this...

1307
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,200
You come back home,
you save up your money,

1308
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,700
You go back to school...
hear me out, now,

1309
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,100
Just hear me out.

1310
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,200
Entertainment law.

1311
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,600
- Entertainment law.
- Dad, stop.

1312
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,100
I wish I could
go back to school.

1313
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,600
I know that if I do,
I'd be set, but I can't.

1314
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,400
I have to try this.

1315
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
It might be a crazy dream.

1316
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,500
I might fail miserably,

1317
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,900
But I have to at least try.

1318
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,900
Otherwise, I'm not going
to be happy at anything.

1319
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Okay.

1320
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,500
Good luck.

1321
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,800
You are aware that the word
"writer" rarely appears

1322
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,900
Without the word
"starving" in front of it.

1323
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,800
So you better finish
your breakfast.

1324
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,800
And then take me
to the airport.

1325
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
I gotta get out of Los Angeles.

1326
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,400
My dad was right.
I did need to make money.

1327
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,200
But I had learned from Buck

1328
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,300
That when you do
the thing you love,

1329
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,300
Somehow, magically,
you find the money.

1330
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,100
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1331
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,100
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1332
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,500
Wow, so yeah,
that's Jonathan Finerman.

1333
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,400
Yes, you remember him?
His show just got picked up

1334
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,100
And we've just been doing press
round the clock.

1335
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,000
I grew up watching him.
He was huge.

1336
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,200
But I still don't understand

1337
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,000
Why he would want
to meet with me.

1338
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,600
The writer's assistant got fired,
and I just mentioned you.

1339
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,600
Troy, this could be
so great for you.

1340
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
Most of the assistants,
they make staff in like a year or two.

1341
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,500
It would be really good.

1342
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't usually do this sort of thing,
but I had to meet you.

1343
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,100
You used to work
for Buck Howard.

1344
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,000
Yeah, I did.

1345
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,400
I've been a fan of his
ever since I was a kid.

1346
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,300
I also do a little
amateur magic myself.

1347
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,200
There's always been something
I've been curious about,

1348
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,000
Not that it matters...

1349
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,600
I don't know how
he finds the money.

1350
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,800
That's not what
I was gonna ask.

1351
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,400
Is he gay?

1352
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,400
I'm just wondering.

1353
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,100
I don't know.

1354
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,700
I never saw him with anyone, so...

1355
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,900
Yeah, well...

1356
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,800
The thing about the money,
I found that out. That's a total scam.

1357
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,200
Really? How?

1358
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,000
He wears an earpiece.

1359
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,400
I've heard about this.

1360
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,900
And there's a guy that travels with him
that tells him where the money is.

1361
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I think I would have noticed.

1362
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
He travels separate.

1363
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,100
No one is even sure what
the guy looks like.

1364
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,600
He sees where the money is,

1365
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,200
Goes to the restroom
or out to his car...

1366
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,300
Only takes a second...

1367
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,500
Whispers into a microphone,
it goes right into Buck's ear.

1368
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,600
"Third row,
lady in the green sweater."

1369
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,900
And his job is done.

1370
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
No, I don't believe it.

1371
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,900
You're loyal. I like that.

1372
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,800
Who would have thought
that Buck Howard on your resume

1373
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,900
- Would land you a job?
- Not me.

1374
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,300
And seriously,
thank you very much

1375
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,100
- For arranging this. It went very well.
- Come on.

1376
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,200
So, thank you. I mean it.

1377
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,100
Okay, well, I'm over here.

1378
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,200
So, that boyfriend of yours,
how's that working out?

1379
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,900
And you ask just because
you're concerned about my well-Being?

1380
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,600
Yes, of course.

1381
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,800
Of course
I'm very very concerned.

1382
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,300
I'll call you.

1383
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,300
Okay.

1384
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,200
Preferably late at night, drunk.

1385
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,500
Always!

1386
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,000
Okay. Bye.

1387
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,700
And just like that,
I began a whole new life.

1388
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,400
Still, I thought
about Buck all the time.

1389
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,900
He had just disappeared
after that night in Vegas.

1390
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,600
I wondered what
exactly had gone wrong.

1391
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,500
Buck had never failed
to find his money before.

1392
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
It didn't make sense.

1393
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,300
But then again,
maybe it proved he was real.

1394
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,200
'Cause when you think about it,

1395
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:36,000
Only something fake could
work 100% of the time.

1396
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,700
Regardless, I just wished there was
some way I could know that he was okay,

1397
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,400
Maybe talk to him one more time.

1398
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,200
Come in.

1399
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,900
- Hey, Buck.
- Troy! My goodness!

1400
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,300
- How are you?
- I brought you something.

1401
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,800
Look at that. Brandy.
That's very kind of you.

1402
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,800
What are you doing here?

1403
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,300
Just thought I'd take a trip up,
check out the show.

1404
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,900
Come in.

1405
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,200
Buck, it's 30 minutes to showtime.

1406
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,800
Troy, this is Russell,
my new road manager.

1407
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,300
Russell, Troy used to have yourjob,
but Troy understood

1408
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,000
The importance of not looking
like a bum on the job.

1409
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,000
Your tie.

1410
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,200
You're not in a bar.

1411
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,000
Come back when it's five minutes
and I need some water.

1412
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,000
Actually, there is
some water right there.

1413
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,000
That's distilled water.
I'm not an iron.

1414
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,200
I drink spring water, remember?

1415
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,400
Thank you.

1416
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,500
So, you've come out of retirement.

1417
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,400
Oh, I'll never give up, Troy.

1418
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,900
So, why are you here?

1419
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
What happened in Vegas?

1420
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,100
Did you blow it on purpose?

1421
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,100
Because that is the only explanation
that I can think of.

1422
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
I know you wear an earpiece

1423
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:31,100
And you have someone
in the audience

1424
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,100
Who tells you
where the money is.

1425
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:37,100
Troy, that thing about the earpiece
has been going around for years.

1426
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,500
It's a rumor.
Do you want to check?

1427
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,700
No, it doesn't matter.

1428
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,900
It's not important.

1429
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
Look, I get it. It is a show.

1430
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,500
You are there to entertain.

1431
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
I understand.

1432
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,000
I just want to know,
for myself.

1433
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,600
What happened in Vegas?

1434
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,100
You know, I don't really belong

1435
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,100
In Vegas anymore.

1436
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,800
I belong in places like these.

1437
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,200
I love what I do.
I love these towns.

1438
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,400
I love these people.

1439
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,100
And I would never
cheat them, ever.

1440
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,100
Watch the show tonight.

1441
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,000
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1442
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,200
I can't tell you how delighted
I am to be back in Bakersfield.

1443
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
I love this town!

1444
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,600
As I settled in
to watch Buck's show,

1445
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,900
It struck me

1446
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,300
This was the first time
I was seeing it as an audience member.

1447
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,300
I want you to take
this piece of paper...

1448
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,100
And it was his old show.

1449
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,100
The changes he had made
in Vegas were gone

1450
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,500
As if they had never happened.

1451
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,100
And somehow it felt right.

1452
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,100
It was actually kind of
beautiful in a way.

1453
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,000
...because I know
what the number is.

1454
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,800
The number you have
written down is the number 77.

1455
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,500
Is that correct?

1456
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,200
Show the audience.

1457
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,500
Isn't that wild?

1458
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,500
What the world needs now

1459
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,000
Is love, sweet love...

1460
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,800
When I tap them
on their left shoulder,

1461
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:14,500
They will be sound asleep
in their chairs.

1462
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,500
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...

1463
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:22,700
Humpty Dumpty had
a great fall...

1464
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,400
As the show neared its finale,

1465
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,700
I saw that Buck had actually
made one small change.

1466
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,700
And this one was just for me.

1467
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,600
For many years
there have been rumors

1468
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:38,300
That I employ some sort
of listening device

1469
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,500
To aid me with this effect.

1470
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,100
I would like to address
those rumors tonight.

1471
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:46,500
Is there a doctor in the house?

1472
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,300
Oh, there are two.

1473
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,600
May I ask you both to come
onstage, please?

1474
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,400
Take these instruments.
Please look in my ears

1475
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,600
And tell the public
if I have any kind

1476
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,500
Of listening device whatsoever.

1477
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,400
It's all clear.

1478
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,200
Thank you.

1479
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,300
Now, to convince

1480
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Even the most hardened skeptics,

1481
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,800
I will also put
this hood over my head.

1482
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,800
I will ask you all to clap in unison

1483
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,300
While my fee is being rehidden

1484
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,100
Here in the auditorium.

1485
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,400
And I am ready.

1486
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,300
They're done.

1487
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,000
Thank you.

1488
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the public,

1489
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:59,600
I may have to inconvenience you
one more time.

1490
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,500
I must have, please,
for this effect, complete silence.

1491
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,300
I couldn't watch because I knew

1492
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,400
Buck wasn't going
to find the money.

1493
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,500
I could only guess

1494
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,100
That whatever Buck
had used in the past,

1495
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,700
Whether it was an earpiece
or his own powers,

1496
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
It was gone now.

1497
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,100
And for the first time, I realized

1498
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,400
I wanted to believe
that Buck would always be out there,

1499
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,100
In some small town somewhere,

1500
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,300
Showing people that
the impossible was possible,

1501
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,300
That there was magic in this world.

1502
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,900
But that wasn't meant to be.

1503
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,400
This time it was
really over for Buck.

1504
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,300
- Sir, you have the money.
- I'm sorry. I don't have it.

1505
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,600
Sir, you have the money
in your left pocket.

1506
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,100
I love this town!
