1
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:23,356
As we sit here today,
we are all complicit in the genocide.

2
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,256
Indifference is complicity.

3
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,439
They were saying, you know,
"We need help. We need support.

4
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:47,049
We need you to do something.
Do something."

5
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:53,356
It's part of my responsibility
as a human being.

6
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:34,161
I think you need to ask yourself,
"What's the threshold?"

7
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:39,098
I mean, at what point
are you going to not make excuses?

8
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:43,996
And I think, for me, it's genocide.
That's the bar.

9
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,008
This is the first time in history that
our government has declared genocide...

10
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,840
...while it's still actually happening.

11
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:55,345
That's another level.
I mean, that's a level of inhumanity...

12
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,382
...that affects us all. And I think...

13
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,590
...requires us to do something.

14
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:10,294
- Where do you have the pens? Good.
- I have them in the bag, with the postcards.

15
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:12,435
All right, you wanna grab the dog?

16
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,729
Two hundred enough,
or do you wanna bring more?

17
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:18,602
- Come here, Lucky. Let's see if we match.
- Here, Dad, hand him to me.

18
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:22,609
- How do we look?
- Good. He looks better than you.

19
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,747
Well, it doesn't take much.

20
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,440
Okay.

21
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:31,417
I grew up learning about the family
members that escaped the Holocaust...

22
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:34,022
...but it always wasn't real for me.

23
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,956
In college, there were certain students
that were the activist type...

24
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:46,034
...and I definitely didn't consider myself
one of them.

25
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:49,604
Do you have a moment?
Stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan.

26
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,968
- You have a moment, sir? Okay.
- Sorry, no.

27
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,610
Back then I felt I had perfected...

28
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,838
...the art of walking through
without taking a single flyer.

29
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,643
It involved avoiding eye contact.

30
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,313
I would pretend to make a cell phone call.

31
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,250
Could you sign a postcard for us...?

32
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,912
- Online.
- Do you have a second?

33
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,285
You know what's happening in Sudan?
In Darfur?

34
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:15,123
And then I took a class in what happened
in Rwanda, and it opened my eyes.

35
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:16,925
This will be given to the governor.

36
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,567
- Just sign...
- Just sign there.

37
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,465
Help stop the genocide in Sudan?
It'll take a second.

38
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:25,033
And then, you know,
for my last two years at school...

39
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,473
...I was the person
passing out flyers every day.

40
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,509
You know what's going on over there?
It's not funny, man. It's a genocide.

41
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,051
It's mind-blowing that...

42
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:40,454
...you learn about what's happened in the
past, what happened in Nazi Germany...

43
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:43,991
...what happened in Rwanda, and
we've got a chance to make it right...

44
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,493
...and we've just fallen flat on our faces.

45
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,098
It makes me angry.

46
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:01,942
Yes. This is a picture of Labado village...

47
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,809
...immediately after an attack...

48
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,981
...by the Arab militia
and government forces.

49
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:11,491
- This is catastrophic for them, no?
- It is catastrophic.

50
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:15,358
This is the sort of description
of the burning of villages...

51
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:18,626
...that some of the witnesses gave.
- Amazing.

52
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:07,579
This was taken
soon after the attack in Labado.

53
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,742
- The village had been destroyed.
- Okay.

54
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,219
- Is this the garrison, this...?
- Yes, this is a military garrison.

55
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:18,018
You see, here are the Janjaweed
and the government forces...

56
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,661
...sharing the looted property.

57
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:23,230
This was happening in such
close proximity to the military...

58
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,663
...that they can't possibly deny
not knowing.

59
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,929
In fact, they were actually
providing protection to them.

60
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,838
Yeah.

61
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:06,367
Let me show you one move,
then I'll stop meddling.

62
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:10,973
If you were able to do this, and she didn't
respond, then you can take these two out.

63
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:15,035
I guess every experience changes you.

64
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:16,811
Offense or defense?

65
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,848
But as an actor and the son of a
psychologist and the son of an educator...

66
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:24,482
...I think I am predisposed
to want to know...

67
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,589
...and to want to investigate
and to understand.

68
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:32,660
And sometimes you come up against
something that you just can't understand.

69
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,307
The first time I went to Africa was for
the filming of the movie <i>Hotel Rwanda.</i>

70
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:49,477
Maybe because I'd been sensitized
by that experience...

71
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:55,016
...I was struck by the similarities
to what's happening in Darfur.

72
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:07,529
I was invited along with
a Congressional delegation to the area.

73
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:13,728
We flew in and then went to see the camps.

74
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:21,542
I was just kind of getting hit
by this wave of hopelessness.

75
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,282
Then I just tried to engage personally
with these kids.

76
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,645
Yeah, they can come with us.

77
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,846
All of the kids had drawings
depicting bombers...

78
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:38,187
...soldiers and Janjaweed,
people being shot, and fires.

79
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,158
And then you start feeling like:

80
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:46,734
"Well, I wouldn't want horsemen riding
down on me and killing my children.

81
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:52,368
And maybe their plight is in some way
tied into my plight...

82
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:56,535
...or their journey is in some way
tied into my journey on this planet."

83
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:04,878
You can see that the potential...

84
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:08,251
...for what's there,
that kids really are just kids.

85
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,259
"I'll play with a rock.

86
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:15,158
I'll play with a stick. I'll roll around
in the dust. Let's make up a game."

87
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:18,960
And that that spirit
is that same spirit everywhere.

88
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:33,441
It's so sad when you just see that light
get dimmed down, and it's just gone...

89
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:38,019
...and you don't know if it'll ever come back
or what that's gonna turn into.

90
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,781
But that light is what...

91
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:44,586
You know, you fight for that light
because it's right there.

92
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,821
In everything they've dealt with,
and everything they've seen...

93
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:52,559
...and everything they've come
through. Bang, you know?

94
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:57,763
Open. I'm here, I'm alive.
I'm here. My spirit is here, you know?

95
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,670
That's you, man, that's me.

96
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:29,332
Power.

97
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,370
Despair.

98
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:39,147
I think if you put the two of them together,
you have what the Darfur crisis is about.

99
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:46,182
- Godfather to base, Godfather One.
- <i>Godfather One, good morning.</i>

100
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:51,224
Moving from
Alpha-Oscar to India-Gulf, over.

101
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:57,590
My job as a humanitarian
is to provide food to save lives.

102
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,792
And this we're doing.

103
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:06,071
We're feeding almost three million people
around Darfur.

104
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:10,873
But the harsh reality about it,
is at the moment...

105
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:15,575
...the food resource is not available
in the way in which it should.

106
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,281
People that don't eat
will try to find it some way.

107
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,851
We get riots, we'll get violence.

108
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:29,125
Eventually, if the food is not available
anywhere else...

109
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,129
...these people will start dying.

110
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:42,034
I come from a family
of development workers.

111
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:47,945
We've always talked about the fact that
we need to all try to improve the planet.

112
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,342
For me, it's pretty much of a motivation.

113
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,580
It wasn't so much when I was very young.
I used to like racing motorcycles.

114
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:04,825
We have a lot of assessments to plan
where the priorities are going to be.

115
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,662
We need to think about it.

116
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:09,771
For me, the first one
would be this area here.

117
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,407
And basically we never went there.

118
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:18,138
All of this area has not received food.
And there's a drought going on here.

119
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:23,149
And if we do not help them,
they will migrate down with their cattle.

120
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:26,651
We don't want those people to come down.
Just no way.

121
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:30,155
We need to actually put the food there,
get them to stay in the area...

122
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:34,194
...and do whatever, in order to improve
the condition of those that are poor.

123
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,354
This is wheat and cereal.

124
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,765
- Mixed together.
- Very nice.

125
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:45,271
It certainly provides you with a very
strong sense of doing something...

126
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:49,104
...in a situation which the world
has to solve.

127
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:51,508
Because one cannot
just think that you can...

128
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:57,017
That we can just continue to see
burned villages and dead people.

129
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,826
It's the JJs.

130
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:41,138
Try not to let you see
too much pointing at them.

131
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,938
Keep your camera aimed forward.

132
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,146
Governments around the world
have always used proxy fighters...

133
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:58,783
...to fight wars that have
political implications for them.

134
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:03,589
The Janjaweeds
are basically an Arab militia.

135
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,992
Some people say that
they are a proxy force...

136
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:15,108
...but it's not just Janjaweeds. There's
an enormous amount of tribal violence...

137
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:18,906
...which is getting the situation
increasingly worse.

138
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:26,949
It's the responsibility of the government,
of having opened this Pandora box...

139
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:30,216
...that I don't think now
they have the capacity to close...

140
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,122
...in order to bring peace to this area.

141
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:42,327
In the international media,
we are told that the conflict in Darfur...

142
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:44,404
...it is between Arabs and Africans.

143
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,400
But this is absolutely not true.

144
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:54,109
It is not about religion,
it is not about ethnicity...

145
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,312
...but it happens that certain communities
have a nomadic lifestyle...

146
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:03,219
...and others are agriculturalists.

147
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:08,495
It is a classic case of a conflict...

148
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:12,498
...whose root cause is over resources.

149
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:18,903
Again, it's a backdrop of prolonged years
of drought in that part of the Sudan.

150
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,843
We are proud to be an Afro-Arab country...

151
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:28,746
...based on tolerance,
based on understanding.

152
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:16,522
We are African.

153
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,691
We are African.
As you've seen it from our skin.

154
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:23,201
And we are Muslim,
but doesn't mean we are Arab.

155
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:25,897
We have our culture. Just...

156
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:30,171
We just use Arab
when we are doing our worship, yes.

157
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:35,750
But in our whole life, in our normal life,
we use our full language.

158
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,919
We hate Arab, and we don't like Arab...

159
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:43,616
...because you don't know what Arabs
happened to did to us.

160
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,625
You had asked that we give you a chart...

161
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:54,299
- Yeah.
...of those who are most responsible.

162
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:09,150
- Yes. And arming and funding of Janjaweed.
- Okay.

163
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:13,220
You have the armed forces
and the police units.

164
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:17,018
Together with the Janjaweeds,
they committed these crimes.

165
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,719
But all these units in some way
report to Harun.

166
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:25,196
Harun's position is central
to everything that happened in Darfur.

167
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:30,429
- He was a judge.
- He was a judge.

168
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,621
This photograph
that a witness provided us...

169
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:57,197
...shows a meeting that was held...

170
00:30:57,366 --> 00:31:01,097
...with the government officials
and members of the Janjaweed.

171
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:09,173
There is one interesting piece of evidence
in Geneina...

172
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:14,748
...where he told the people that he had the
power to kill whoever he wished in Darfur...

173
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,350
...for the sake of peace...

174
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:19,419
...and that he can kill three-quarters
of the population...

175
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:23,115
...for just one-quarter
of the population to live.

176
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:27,661
So that just shows
the amount of power that he had.

177
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,152
- Hey. Hello.
- Hello. Hello, man.

178
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:13,429
The question is, where does Sudan get
all this money to fund the genocide?

179
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:17,035
And it's through foreign oil companies...

180
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:21,505
...who provide the Sudanese government
with billions of dollars in revenue.

181
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:28,615
And it turns out that these companies
themselves then rely on investors...

182
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:33,448
...like a state pension fund,
to continue their operations in Sudan.

183
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:45,323
The airport, Terminal 5.

184
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,203
And now we're asking the State of
California to say to those companies:

185
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:53,705
"You need to get out.

186
00:33:54,376 --> 00:34:00,178
And if you don't do that, California's going
to sell its investments in your company."

187
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:06,384
So we're gonna use the weight...

188
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:09,786
...of billions and billions of dollars
of state pension fund money...

189
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,654
...as financial leverage
on the Sudanese government.

190
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,131
To make it happen, we have to get
the legislation we wrote...

191
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:25,933
...through the state legislature
and then signed by the governor.

192
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:28,406
You hear anything about the vote?

193
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:34,674
I'm not as worried as I was a little while
ago, but there's still a concern.

194
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:39,916
I'm from the Sudan
Divestment Task Force.

195
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,586
Since oil extraction began in Sudan...

196
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:46,760
...the money that's coming in from these
companies is going straight to the military.

197
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:50,329
You guys have been tireless on this issue,
that's for sure.

198
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,294
Prior to this, the only thing I'd organized
was bus trips down to Tijuana.

199
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:01,966
I was barely voting in elections. I mean,
what did I know about making laws?

200
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,348
Ten dollars for the T-shirt.

201
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:20,452
Assembly Bill 2941
is gonna set us on the path...

202
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:22,426
...to finally ending this genocide.

203
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:26,023
But this bill is under
an enormously important vote...

204
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:30,729
...and if it does not pass out of the
Senate, Assembly Bill 2941 is dead.

205
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:32,572
I can give you two things...

206
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,971
Daddy.

207
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,973
Ayana, can you get the door for John?

208
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,040
My friend, John Prendergast...

209
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:47,211
...for 22 years has been dealing
with conflicts in Africa.

210
00:35:47,422 --> 00:35:51,085
When that trip to Darfur came up, he was
the first person to pop into my head.

211
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:52,556
Would you do me the favor?

212
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:54,423
If it's bad, I don't know.
It's good?

213
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:55,620
- Great.
- Yes!

214
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:59,198
Your fortune cookie says,
"Your sensitivity is an asset."

215
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,665
- Asset.
- What's an asset?

216
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:06,968
It's a boon. It's something good.
It's one of my good sides, it helps me out.

217
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:09,867
- Chapter one is now the preface.
- The preface.

218
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,069
Chapter two...

219
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:14,477
When we came back from Darfur,
I think we both thought:

220
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:16,378
"Well, that could be a book."

221
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:21,488
This section, it's your construction,
this idea of the path out of apathy.

222
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,453
Which I think is what
is the whole point of the book.

223
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:28,994
Is you can go about your life, but
you can... But you can get it done.

224
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:31,995
You can do... You don't just have
to be sitting there going...

225
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,964
...with your hands in the air,
"I don't know what to do."

226
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,697
And that was me. And that was you.

227
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:41,671
You know?
And then we started figuring it out.

228
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,710
I looked at myself and said,
"Well, what can you do?"

229
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:50,682
I thought, " Well, the best asset
really that I have right now is that...

230
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:54,788
...for the moment, I am a celebrity."

231
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,989
People stick a mike in front of me and say,
"What's going on?" You know?

232
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:05,224
And while I'm talking about, you know,
George Clooney and Brad Pitt...

233
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,459
...I can also talk about Darfur.

234
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:13,539
Going to Capitol Hill, we know
that the wheels of bureaucracy...

235
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,199
...and politics move very slowly.

236
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:21,144
But one of these people may be the
new leader of the so-called free world...

237
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:25,650
...and this is an opportunity
to make them state their position.

238
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,347
- Mr. Cheadle, how are you?
- Good to meet you.

239
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:32,587
- I've seen your film. The <i>Hotel Rwanda.</i>
- Oh, great.

240
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,922
I get a lot of questions too,
personally to me:

241
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:38,896
"What can I do?" And, you know,
I have all this passion now...

242
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:41,331
...but I don't know where to direct it,
you know?

243
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:43,437
We just gotta get people there.

244
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:48,201
And what I think is, when they see
particularly a humanitarian situation...

245
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:52,039
...and they think, "I wanna do something."
- Yeah.

246
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:55,547
And that's been...
That's one of my objectives now...

247
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:59,915
...is to try to get more people of means
to go to these difficult places.

248
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:02,921
Because I think they will then
take it upon themselves.

249
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:07,425
I'm gonna do what I can, and actually
what I can do is something substantial.

250
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:09,496
Because your soul's gonna be touched.

251
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,859
Once you see this,
you're not gonna be the same.

252
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,796
That's right.

253
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,491
We do have problems in terms of security.

254
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:21,919
There's been a lot of attacks
on humanitarian convoys.

255
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:35,335
We're running out of time, trying to finalize
the deliveries for the north, aren't we?

256
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:41,338
You will be able to open,
and we just... We just move.

257
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:54,892
This is the tracking sheet
that the convoy will be using.

258
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:58,658
Every seventh WFP truck, there's a one
piece of A.U., and that's how it goes.

259
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,494
It's for protection.

260
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:03,629
All drivers get in.

261
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:14,446
These jobs take an enormous amount
of risks, being shot at...

262
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:15,708
...being burned.

263
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:19,618
They've been attacked with bazookas.

264
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:31,559
The African Union protection force
has its limitations.

265
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:34,896
They cannot support deliveries with WFP...

266
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,335
...and at the same time,
provide protection to their camps.

267
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,991
I'd put a couple prominent
Republicans up front.

268
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:42,261
Okay.

269
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,564
Like, you can put this on a second line.
"Senators."

270
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,900
Go up, up.

271
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,839
I always felt that if I
passed out a few more flyers...

272
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:55,710
...convinced a few more people
that divestment's a good idea...

273
00:42:55,884 --> 00:42:59,285
...that we'd get it to a level where
the experts... I didn't know who.

274
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:03,083
I just assumed there was divestment
experts, Sudan experts. You know...

275
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:06,885
...big NGOs that would, you know,
basically come in, shake my hand and say:

276
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:08,824
"Good job, we'll take it from here."

277
00:43:10,398 --> 00:43:13,060
And I quickly learned that
that's not the case...

278
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:15,429
...and that you have to
become your own expert.

279
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:19,266
- Mr. Sweeney, hi.
- Good to see you, man. How's it going?

280
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,340
- This is Jason Miller.
- Hey, Jason.

281
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:25,673
He's my... The codirector, partner in crime.
He's my other half.

282
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:28,873
Well, we always have to
have a coconspirator.

283
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,450
We made thousands of these postcards.

284
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:34,110
People are signing them
and sending them back to us...

285
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,417
...and then wanted to bring 2941 of them
for Assembly Bill 2941...

286
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:42,957
...to the governor's office,
and wanted to get your thoughts on that.

287
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,792
- Did you print them in-state?
- Yeah.

288
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:50,000
You're in a state that is union-oriented.

289
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:55,370
And this piece has no union bug.

290
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:58,239
We care about an issue,
but we don't understand the whole...

291
00:43:58,413 --> 00:43:59,880
- Game.
- The political context.

292
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:02,107
That's why
we're obviously seeking advice.

293
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:07,084
You don't want folks to say, " This is
a bunch of inexperienced white boys...

294
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:12,090
...who don't know how to deal
with the unions and people of color"...

295
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,785
...when this is a people-of-color issue.
- Right.

296
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:16,453
- Okay.
- So...

297
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:18,155
So who published this?

298
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:21,001
- Us.
- Okay, but...

299
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:22,898
- Pocket money.
- Pocket money?

300
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:25,631
Yeah, we're... I wait tables.

301
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:28,071
No. No, come on, man. Be serious.

302
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:29,904
- I'm serious. Yeah.
- You serious?

303
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:31,978
- Okay, well...
- We got a good deal.

304
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:34,046
Is this a union or nonunion printer?

305
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:36,683
It's a union printer.
I'll have them put the sticker...

306
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:40,412
Well, man, tell them to put
the damn sticker on here, man.

307
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:36,743
Are you satisfied with
what you have your hand on so far?

308
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,577
Must have names of people
you think...

309
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:49,656
Not the list of the...
But just your own list that you're...

310
00:45:57,965 --> 00:46:02,095
Mr. Prosecutor, you know
to look straight at the camera.

311
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:06,401
I speak worse in Spanish.

312
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:11,074
Because I speak very fast,
no one can understand me.

313
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:14,808
Vanessa?

314
00:46:16,384 --> 00:46:19,319
Can you help me to correct my English?

315
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:24,185
- How?
- I will read and then you will say no.

316
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:26,759
"I welcome the opportunity
to update the Council...

317
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:31,126
...on the activities undertaken by my office
since my last report in December."

318
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:34,234
- It's okay? Yeah?
- Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

319
00:46:34,402 --> 00:46:38,668
"My office is collecting all available
information from outside Darfur."

320
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,331
- Available.
- Available. Available.

321
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,305
Like "Vanessa."

322
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:45,469
- Av... Available?
- Available.

323
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:48,638
Available. It's okay? Available?

324
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:51,751
It's boring, my goodness.
It's long and boring.

325
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:54,878
At this meeting
the Security Council will hear...

326
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:58,219
...a briefing by Mr. Luis Moreno-Ocampo...

327
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:01,556
...prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court.

328
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:04,994
There being no objection, so decided.

329
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:08,226
- You have the floor, sir.
- Thank you, Madam President.

330
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:12,066
I welcome the opportunity
to update the Council...

331
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,675
...on the activities undertaken by my office
since my last report in December.

332
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:21,946
I have stressed the need for cooperation...

333
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:25,142
...in order to ensure accountability.

334
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:28,811
Our justice effort should contribute...

335
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,552
...to the protection
and to the prevention of further crimes.

336
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:38,028
We need more information on groups
that continue to attack them...

337
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:39,689
...or impede them.

338
00:50:48,202 --> 00:50:53,333
As my office moves toward
the presentation of evidence...

339
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:56,670
...it sends a signal
to those who are considering...

340
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:58,835
...committing further crimes...

341
00:50:59,013 --> 00:51:03,006
...that they cannot do so with impunity.

342
00:51:03,317 --> 00:51:05,751
Thank you very much, Madam President.

343
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:11,685
Of course it is needless
for me to reemphasize again...

344
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:15,522
...that the referral by the Security Council
of this issue to the ICC...

345
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:21,099
...has been very much politically motivated.

346
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:26,470
The judiciary in Sudan is very well-known
for its integrity and competence...

347
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,441
...and we think that it is within
the competence of our system...

348
00:51:31,612 --> 00:51:37,141
...that we will prosecute
whoever is committing crimes in Darfur.

349
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:40,776
How many names are you gonna
present in your submission?

350
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,966
The Sudanese government won't turn over
these individuals for prosecution.

351
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:56,068
Will you offer Khartoum the list
of the people that you suspect?

352
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:58,500
Perhaps it's time to ignore
Sudanese sovereignty.

353
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:00,139
No, no, no.

354
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:31,767
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

355
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:44,440
For people who are covering this story,
I think there's an emotional impatience.

356
00:52:44,618 --> 00:52:48,645
People who would like the people
in Darfur to have an end to their suffering.

357
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:53,486
And they've been waiting and watching,
and it's like genocide in slow motion.

358
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:56,256
Yeah.

359
00:53:16,884 --> 00:53:19,978
Hey, Vanessa, can you check
your BlackBerry and see...?

360
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:21,917
Yeah.

361
00:53:22,089 --> 00:53:24,614
I didn't...
My BlackBerry is...

362
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:47,803
There's been reports that if
humanitarian aid was completely cut off...

363
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:50,500
...which it's gotten close to
or is getting close to...

364
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:52,577
...that the death toll would skyrocket.

365
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:56,807
So, what do you gauge success against?
People say, "You're doing a great job."

366
00:54:56,984 --> 00:55:00,476
But it's still... The ultimate goal
isn't divesting from Sudan...

367
00:55:00,654 --> 00:55:03,680
...it's ending the genocide in Darfur.
Part of it is guilt.

368
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:07,554
I don't wanna look back in 10 years
and say I didn't do everything I could.

369
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:09,320
It's frustrating you don't see...

370
00:55:09,496 --> 00:55:12,124
...the goal in sight or the light
at the end of the tunnel...

371
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:15,132
...but putting things into perspective,
give yourself credit.

372
00:55:15,302 --> 00:55:19,898
I'm not just saying that
because I'm your dad, but...

373
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:22,268
Give yourself credit.
You've come a long way.

374
00:55:29,216 --> 00:55:33,152
It's hard. I'm scared because I don't see
the light at the end of the tunnel.

375
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,756
And it's easy... You know,
I have other things that I'm doing...

376
00:55:36,924 --> 00:55:42,385
...and I can kind of, you know, I guess
even... Just if that's... I don't know.

377
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:49,361
All right. Hey, you know, it helps.

378
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:52,795
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you, man.

379
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:54,497
I'm proud of you. I love you.

380
00:56:31,845 --> 00:56:35,110
Yes, good morning, base.
Any update on the convoy?

381
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:38,376
Did they start moving?
Coming to comp location? Over.

382
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:43,485
<i>Zero-eight-five-seven.</i>

383
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:48,959
<i>About 17 kilometers away from location.</i>
<i>Oscar-Kilo, over.</i>

384
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:54,863
Okay, so let's wait for your call
once the convoy is about to arrive. Over.

385
00:56:57,804 --> 00:57:00,238
Daddy, come here. Daddy, come here.
Daddy, come here.

386
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:02,398
- Hey.
- Wait a second.

387
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,976
Why are you taping us?

388
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,409
I got an e-mail from George Clooney...

389
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:14,418
...explaining that he was going
to be going on a trip to China...

390
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:17,318
...and then on to Egypt...

391
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:22,622
...to meet with some heads of state
to discuss the situation in Darfur.

392
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:26,430
But given the lack of time,
we couldn't get a crew together...

393
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,163
...so I took it upon myself
to be the interim sound guy...

394
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:33,966
...DP, all of that.

395
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:36,439
It's never gonna work.

396
00:57:37,044 --> 00:57:39,672
That was...
I don't know who that was.

397
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:45,542
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have just landed</i>
<i>at Beijing Capital International Airport.</i>

398
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:47,243
Hi, how are you doing?

399
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:56,360
They have huge economic ties to Sudan...

400
00:57:56,596 --> 00:58:00,532
...and don't wanna do anything
to threaten that relationship.

401
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:04,034
There's been a real reticence
to even acknowledge...

402
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:07,833
...that there is a humanitarian crisis
in Sudan.

403
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,072
We're here to simply say:

404
00:58:11,244 --> 00:58:15,578
How can we move forward from here
so that these people don't die?

405
00:58:15,749 --> 00:58:20,686
And you guys have the relations.
And you...

406
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:23,379
We can't do this without you.
We need you.

407
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:26,958
- The bottom line is protection for civilians...
- Right.

408
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:30,426
...who are not soldiers,
who are not combatants...

409
00:58:30,597 --> 00:58:33,896
...but who are innocents
literally in the way, in between.

410
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:41,702
- Have you ever been to Shanghai?
- Yeah.

411
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:50,316
We met with a foreign minister, A.F.A.

412
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:53,078
And it was a good meeting.

413
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:56,654
I guess as good as can be expected.
We weren't really imagining...

414
00:58:56,823 --> 00:58:59,951
...we were gonna walk out of there
with anything very substantive...

415
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:03,756
...as far as him agreeing to do anything.

416
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:25,141
We are in Cairo.

417
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:30,546
We just had a meeting
with Gamal Mubarak...

418
00:59:30,724 --> 00:59:34,592
...the president's son and the heir apparent.

419
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:40,089
He spoke about how to work
with the government of Sudan...

420
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:43,759
...and not force solutions down their throat.

421
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:50,434
There's not a lot of time left.

422
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:57,214
We wonder what these diplomatic
discussions are going to do.

423
00:59:59,386 --> 01:00:05,052
We're the highest level delegation to
go to Egypt to discuss the crisis in Darfur.

424
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:07,390
That shouldn't be.

425
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:10,990
That's embarrassing.

426
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:37,084
<i>They got six shots with their club play,</i>
<i>but they got five shots with the club players.</i>

427
01:00:37,257 --> 01:00:41,023
<i>Then in the second half, they took them all</i>
<i>out and they only made one shot.</i>

428
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:44,655
China does the largest amount of trade
with Sudan, mostly in oil...

429
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:47,026
...and has a great amount
of economic influence.

430
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,327
Egypt has a long history
with the Sudan.

431
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:51,835
Both countries believe
they have a role to play...

432
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:55,065
...and must do more to get
all the parties on the table in time.

433
01:00:55,242 --> 01:00:56,504
It's just not enough.

434
01:01:12,492 --> 01:01:15,552
We think there has been
a deafening silence.

435
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:20,462
Very recently, there were aid workers that
were attacked. A convoy was overcome...

436
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:25,196
...and supplies burned
that were strictly for humanitarian aid.

437
01:01:25,372 --> 01:01:29,331
We need to press that these stories
not be small paragraphs on page 17.

438
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:30,976
We need these stories out.

439
01:01:32,112 --> 01:01:37,641
Our call today is that priorities be linked
to human survival, not political processes.

440
01:01:37,817 --> 01:01:41,378
Because someday this will end.
And the question then will be asked:

441
01:01:42,055 --> 01:01:46,424
Where did the nations
of these United Nations stand?

442
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:53,427
The situation in Darfur
is very much overdramatized.

443
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,593
The United States is the only country
in the world that has labeled...

444
01:01:57,771 --> 01:02:01,366
...what's going on in Darfur as a genocide.

445
01:02:01,908 --> 01:02:05,708
Our view is that the United States uses...

446
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:09,406
...for its own public use, domestic use...

447
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:12,780
...especially during
previous election campaigns...

448
01:02:12,953 --> 01:02:15,854
...to win the black voters...

449
01:02:16,022 --> 01:02:19,423
...or other lobbies in the United States.

450
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:22,791
Any war is catastrophic.

451
01:02:22,963 --> 01:02:25,591
There is no merciful war.

452
01:02:25,765 --> 01:02:28,325
But it is not a genocide.

453
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,337
Channel Six, this is Gulf Service.

454
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:45,478
Police vehicles are at Juliet-five-five...

455
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:49,012
...has announced that kilo-one-com
situation is won.

456
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:52,684
- Sir?
- Yes.

457
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:55,343
I got some...
You might want to check this.

458
01:03:56,823 --> 01:03:58,051
This point.

459
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,319
That's all we needed.

460
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,326
God almighty, man.

461
01:04:03,863 --> 01:04:06,593
Listen, I just got the message
about the hijacking.

462
01:04:06,766 --> 01:04:08,324
No one got hurt, I hope.

463
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:13,032
Yeah, that's the most important thing.
Yes.

464
01:04:13,206 --> 01:04:16,039
We must diminish the number of convoys
that we're sending.

465
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:20,043
It is getting to be such a nightmare anyway.

466
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:25,311
Just recently there was a shootout,
one vehicle from the NGOs.

467
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:29,478
The passenger side of the car
received 12 bullets.

468
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,558
And only one of the people there
got hit on the leg.

469
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:38,527
Just luck! They could've been all killed.

470
01:05:19,038 --> 01:05:22,701
How is your brother? How is he feeling?

471
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,609
Just give him lots of support tomorrow,
yeah?

472
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:32,374
Yeah, he needs to actually do well
on that exam. Yeah?

473
01:05:35,221 --> 01:05:40,249
I'll call tomorrow. You know, just to
see how he did on the exam, yeah?

474
01:05:42,962 --> 01:05:46,955
Okay. Ciao, my love.
Love you. Bye-bye. Ciao.

475
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:53,365
I miss... I miss my wife.

476
01:05:55,675 --> 01:05:58,303
My little girl, she's...

477
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,343
We miss each other quite a lot.

478
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:07,152
With Manuel, I like his...
Now he's very protective of me.

479
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,016
Amazing. He's taller, big guy.

480
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:14,820
Puts his arms around me and he says,
"Don't worry, Dad, I'll take care of you."

481
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:16,985
I feel great.

482
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:21,191
Yeah, I miss all that.

483
01:09:01,494 --> 01:09:05,590
This is the area. The rebels have
their camps in the higher ground.

484
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:08,992
And in the lower ground,
you have the villages.

485
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:12,604
So typically, the rebels would use
the villages to get supplies, food.

486
01:09:12,772 --> 01:09:15,332
And the reaction of the government
and the Janjaweed...

487
01:09:15,508 --> 01:09:19,103
...is to destroy the environment
around the hills...

488
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:22,378
...to make the life impossible
for the rebels.

489
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,086
This was their counterinsurgency policy.

490
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:30,381
Go to the village...

491
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:34,617
...remove all possible support
for the rebels.

492
01:09:34,794 --> 01:09:37,058
And therefore,
the rebels would be exposed.

493
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:27,141
The suspect Kushayb was
the main militia commander, and Harun...

494
01:10:27,313 --> 01:10:34,048
...he was the coordinator of the government
of Sudan's activities in Darfur.

495
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,212
And you can see a direct relationship...

496
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,258
...between the two of them acting together
to produce the crimes.

497
01:10:46,332 --> 01:10:50,928
Ali Kushayb's name comes up consistently
amongst witnesses...

498
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:54,369
...in Bindisi, in Mukjar, in Kurumand,
in Arwalla.

499
01:10:56,175 --> 01:11:02,705
Before the victims were raped, they were
paraded naked in front of Kushayb.

500
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:11,817
We're after criminals...

501
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:17,657
...and we have identified those two guys
as being responsible for atrocities.

502
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:21,288
So I consider that, yes,
the government of Sudan...

503
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,697
...which is a member
of the United Nations...

504
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:27,169
...which knows very well its obligations
in an international role...

505
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,138
...has to surrender those two individuals
to The Hague.

506
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:39,174
In two months, in six months,
in two years, they have to do it.

507
01:11:40,453 --> 01:11:45,914
The irony of the situation is that
the ICC has never visited Darfur.

508
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:51,992
The evidence was gathered
from people outside Sudan.

509
01:11:52,165 --> 01:11:55,931
So we question the credibility of ICC.

510
01:12:04,377 --> 01:12:07,540
As far as Harun and Kushayb
are concerned...

511
01:12:07,713 --> 01:12:11,706
...we are in no way going to hand over
any of our citizens to the ICC.

512
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:17,013
In this situation when you are fighting
rebels, you have to be very tough on that.

513
01:12:17,857 --> 01:12:20,883
The government has a monopoly
of the use of force.

514
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:27,597
And the government exercises its authority
to protect its own citizens.

515
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:37,936
Today's the Senate vote.

516
01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:40,806
Are you sure it's this way?

517
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:42,978
This way, I think.

518
01:12:44,617 --> 01:12:48,519
Our goal until this afternoon is
to kind of rally up additional support.

519
01:12:48,688 --> 01:12:49,882
Hello.

520
01:12:50,923 --> 01:12:53,892
It doesn't matter how far
you've gotten in the legislature...

521
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:56,761
...once you lose, it's game over.

522
01:12:56,929 --> 01:13:00,990
Assembly Bill 2941, by Assembly member
Koretz, act relating to investments.

523
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,293
Secretary, call the roll.

524
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:07,804
Aanestad? No. Ackerman?
Alarcón? Aye. Alquist?

525
01:13:07,974 --> 01:13:09,339
- Ashburn? No.
- No.

526
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:12,773
Battin? No. Bowen? Aye.

527
01:13:12,945 --> 01:13:16,108
Harman? Aye. Hollingsworth? No.

528
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:18,842
Kehoe? Aye. Lowenthal?

529
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:20,781
Aye. Machado?

530
01:13:20,953 --> 01:13:22,420
Aye. Maldonado?

531
01:13:22,588 --> 01:13:24,453
Aye. Margett?

532
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:30,185
McClintock? Migden? Aye. Morrow? Murray?

533
01:13:30,363 --> 01:13:32,058
Aye. Soto?

534
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,593
Aye. Vincent?

535
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:41,502
Oh, my God.

536
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:44,575
Oh, man.

537
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:48,874
I almost... I needed a diaper.
I was gonna pee my pants.

538
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:52,542
So it's done with the state legislature...

539
01:13:52,718 --> 01:13:55,448
...now it's on to the governor.

540
01:13:56,355 --> 01:13:58,323
I bet you they strike out here.

541
01:13:59,759 --> 01:14:01,522
Think they had trouble spelling it?

542
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:03,592
Adam, it's Don.

543
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,961
- How you doing?
- <i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

544
01:14:06,132 --> 01:14:11,331
I'm all right. So I'm just going over
this little speech I'm gonna make.

545
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,364
I've been asked to say a few words today...

546
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:43,896
...but only a very few,
because quite frankly...

547
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,436
...the time for words
has drawn to a close...

548
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:50,268
...and action desperately needs
to take its place.

549
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:55,310
We ask today that Governor
Schwarzenegger sign AB 2941...

550
01:14:55,648 --> 01:14:59,778
...and send a message loud and clear
that it is our responsibility...

551
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:04,286
...to prevent such tragedies, such
travesties, from ever happening again.

552
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,983
All right, ready? Let's go.

553
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,454
We'll take the thousands
of postcards we've collected...

554
01:15:10,629 --> 01:15:13,826
...and walk down to the governor's office
to deliver the postcards.

555
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:16,866
- So how's the book coming?
- Tomorrow's the deadline.

556
01:15:17,503 --> 01:15:19,767
But when you find something that...

557
01:15:20,473 --> 01:15:24,170
...has such a purpose as this, it's kind of,
how do you drop it?

558
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:28,669
They'll take us into a conference room,
where we're gonna give them these.

559
01:15:28,848 --> 01:15:31,908
So if this thing's vetoed,
it's gonna kill the movement.

560
01:15:32,084 --> 01:15:34,746
And if he signs it, it will be law,
or it will be...

561
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,717
It'll be law, absolutely.

562
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:39,357
- How are your arms? You all right?
- Yeah, we're good.

563
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:40,753
Right here's our building.

564
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:43,359
- We follow you.
- Yeah.

565
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:51,128
We met with the deputy director.

566
01:15:51,303 --> 01:15:53,828
They couldn't give the position
of the governor yet...

567
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:57,066
...but we told them that whether
he signs it or not, we'll know...

568
01:15:57,243 --> 01:16:00,701
...and we'll be loud either way.
- We're trying to speak in a loud voice...

569
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,973
...so that people cannot say,
"I was unaware."

570
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:06,049
They can only say,
"I either acted or I stood by."

571
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:18,845
What is the most valuable action...

572
01:18:19,018 --> 01:18:22,818
...to enroll people, other people
in our generation, to take action?

573
01:18:22,988 --> 01:18:24,546
You'll figure out ways...

574
01:18:24,723 --> 01:18:27,851
Because you're with like-minded
individuals... . to build and say:

575
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:31,656
"What are you doing, Carlos,
what's going on in your community?"

576
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:35,766
"What's going on? Where are you
connected? Can we get our groups together?"

577
01:18:35,935 --> 01:18:40,372
You just have to start making those inroads,
and I think the answers will come to you.

578
01:18:42,007 --> 01:18:45,773
You guys, we really do see you
as the instruments of change...

579
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:49,108
...what is going to take this grassroots,
collective movement...

580
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:52,182
...and create enough noise
and create enough pressure...

581
01:18:52,351 --> 01:18:56,549
...that we finally push our leaders
to do what we want them to do.

582
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:59,418
That's what they're there to do.
Let them know that.

583
01:18:59,592 --> 01:19:00,957
What do you want us to do?

584
01:19:01,126 --> 01:19:05,654
The most important thing is to go directly
to the president. There is no question.

585
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:09,025
If we can bottle the same enthusiasm...

586
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:14,264
...and interest that people have to call into
<i>American Idol,</i> we can, you know, this...

587
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,707
We can knock this out pretty fast.

588
01:19:19,178 --> 01:19:21,203
John and I authored a book together...

589
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:25,942
...to try and talk about our experiences
and how people could get involved.

590
01:19:26,118 --> 01:19:28,586
I'm told that I should hold it up.

591
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:34,087
- Okay, I did it.
- And I'm going even further.

592
01:19:36,195 --> 01:19:39,562
- I know my representatives.
- There you go. There you go. Get them.

593
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:42,565
- I'm gonna do whatever I can.
- Oh, man. I love hearing that.

594
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:48,539
A lot of people want to know how to
inject themselves into this process.

595
01:19:48,707 --> 01:19:52,234
And even if it's tilting at windmills,
I think it's better to fight it...

596
01:19:52,411 --> 01:19:55,710
...than to go, "What can I do?"

597
01:19:55,881 --> 01:20:00,147
I don't know. But more than nothing.
A lot more than nothing.

598
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,088
- Thank you.
- Let me see your shirt.

599
01:20:06,091 --> 01:20:10,755
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11.

600
01:20:13,132 --> 01:20:15,532
I will nunchuck you very good.

601
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:17,396
Oh, you speak good English.

602
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:19,764
Chuck you very good.

603
01:20:21,273 --> 01:20:23,207
- Ciao, guys.
- Okay.

604
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,270
Bye-bye!

605
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:28,310
Bye-bye.

606
01:20:28,614 --> 01:20:32,106
The Sudanese people are such
sweet people, I'm telling you.

607
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:37,347
That's why it's so incredible
to hear about such violence around.

608
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:39,923
It's completely shocking,
and on the other side...

609
01:20:40,092 --> 01:20:44,028
...you just basically realize that that
has actually been the story of the world...

610
01:20:44,196 --> 01:20:46,061
...forever. Sixty years ago in Europe...

611
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:48,859
...we did the same thing
to millions of people in ovens.

612
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:53,130
So, you know, sometimes you
actually just try to put it also...

613
01:20:53,305 --> 01:20:56,570
...in the balance of power, greed, and...

614
01:20:57,743 --> 01:21:02,510
Just, for me, makes my engagement...

615
01:21:02,681 --> 01:21:06,378
...to try and help...

616
01:21:06,585 --> 01:21:09,986
...to change that whilst I am here.

617
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:14,285
And I just don't mean here in Sudan,
but in the world.

618
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:17,819
It's part of my responsibility
as a human being.

619
01:23:36,802 --> 01:23:38,360
Okay.

620
01:23:40,873 --> 01:23:42,272
Do you have the new questions?

621
01:23:42,441 --> 01:23:44,341
Yes, you have them in the back.

622
01:23:47,913 --> 01:23:51,542
They will have the responsibility
to implement the judge's decision.

623
01:23:53,986 --> 01:23:58,047
Immediately following this briefing,
for the television reporters...

624
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:03,657
...the prosecutor will take a couple of
questions from you in the lounge area...

625
01:24:03,829 --> 01:24:05,990
...where the red chairs are.

626
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,492
Good afternoon.
Thank you for your presence here.

627
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:24,579
I still think you could even say this slower,
this line here. This is really the whole point.

628
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,015
You start it off with a strong...
"To the people of Darfur." Pause.

629
01:24:28,186 --> 01:24:29,949
"To the people of California."

630
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,025
What's up, man? How you doing?

631
01:24:37,195 --> 01:24:38,890
Hi, guys. I'm Adam.

632
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:43,698
- Congratulations. Big day.
- Thank you.

633
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:46,565
We got legislation lined up
in 15 other states in January.

634
01:24:46,838 --> 01:24:49,568
- Is it similar? It's the same pattern.
- Almost exactly.

635
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:52,835
Hello, how are you? Hello, everybody.

636
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:54,205
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

637
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:56,279
Good to see you again.
How have you been?

638
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,437
Very good.

639
01:24:57,616 --> 01:24:59,709
All decked out.
I've never seen you like this.

640
01:24:59,885 --> 01:25:03,150
- I knew you were coming, so I had to come.
- Of course, you had to come.

641
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:28,340
You can hear the noise of the trucks
already, somewhere around.

642
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:30,003
It goes in that way.

643
01:27:04,109 --> 01:27:07,203
All right, gentlemen, get ready.
Follow the governor.

644
01:27:09,014 --> 01:27:11,539
Hello, everybody. How are you?

645
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:17,381
Thank you very much, everyone,
for being here today.

646
01:27:17,556 --> 01:27:21,686
Today, I'm signing two bills
that will send a very clear message...

647
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:25,887
...that California does not stand for
murder and genocide.

648
01:27:26,064 --> 01:27:31,024
It is an action that says we will not
cooperate with the horrors of Darfur.

649
01:27:31,203 --> 01:27:36,573
We will not pay for it. We will not
support it, and we will not enable it.

650
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,378
See? It crossed quite easily, huh?

651
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:47,508
Welcome back!

652
01:27:53,058 --> 01:27:55,856
It's such a great feeling
to see these guys back.

653
01:27:56,027 --> 01:27:59,724
Yeah! Well done! Nice!

654
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:15,344
What are you going to do to prevent
these two men from going on the run?

655
01:28:15,647 --> 01:28:19,583
Is it just to send a signal
or is it just the beginning?

656
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:22,584
Do you see the possibility of further names?

657
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:27,190
Can you make well-founded
judicial investigation...

658
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:29,919
...into a country that you can't visit?

659
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:42,865
Our greatest asset will be our ability
as a race, the human race...

660
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:47,869
...to reach within ourselves to find the
courage to move toward peace and balance.

661
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:51,547
To the Sudanese government:
We are coming after you.

662
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:55,481
Your genocide will not occur
on our watch...

663
01:28:55,654 --> 01:28:58,851
...and it will not occur on our dime.

664
01:29:03,228 --> 01:29:04,957
Yeah, we've done it once more!

665
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:08,031
Nobody got shot.
We delivered. We delivered.

666
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,226
That's the issue, you know.
We managed to give people...

667
01:29:11,403 --> 01:29:14,395
...the food they need in a place like this.

668
01:29:14,706 --> 01:29:18,540
Now I know why I'm here.
Now it makes me proud.

669
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,974
I'll talk to my family
and say to my kids:

670
01:29:21,146 --> 01:29:23,842
"Guys, look.
This is what Daddy is doing."

671
01:29:37,429 --> 01:29:39,007
I'm
honored.
