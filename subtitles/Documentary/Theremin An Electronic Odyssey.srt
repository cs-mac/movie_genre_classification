00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,647
Can you see me?

3
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,682
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:12,451
How?

5
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:15,020
I could be
thousands of miles away,

6
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:17,489
and yet, when you turn on
whatever device

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:19,658
is bringing my image
and voice to you,

8
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm there.

9
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,228
Instantaneously.

10
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,464
How is that possible?

11
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:27,533
To our ancestors,

12
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,468
it would've seemed like sorcery.

13
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,703
For them, speed of communication

14
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:33,806
was only as fast
as the swiftest horse

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,908
or sailing ships.

16
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:39,745
Our messages travel invisibly
at the speed of light.

17
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,581
How did we attain
such mythic powers?

18
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,584
It all began in the mind
of one person.

19
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,920
A child of poverty

20
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,923
of whom nothing was expected.

21
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:57,563
<i>In fact,
if this man had not lived...</i>

22
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:04,770
<i>the world we know
might not exist today.</i>

<i>we might still be living</i>

29
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,853
as our ancestors did
in the 17th century.

30
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:02,554
Unaware

31
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,958
of armies of invisible servants
awaiting our commands.

32
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:08,894
This is the story
of how we learned

33
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,697
to make electrons
do our bidding.

34
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,766
In a way, it begins

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,702
with the greatest genius
who ever lived--

36
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,737
Isaac Newton.

37
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:27,579
This is Woolsthorpe,
Newton's ancestral home.

38
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,983
He walked these fields,
tormented by mystery.

39
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:33,252
Newton, the man
who figured out the formula

40
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,354
for the motions of the planets
around the Sun,

41
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,022
wanted to know

42
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,658
how does the Sun make
the planets act that way

43
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,327
without touching them?

44
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,862
How do all the apples
know how to fall?

45
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,865
Another genius was puzzled
by another aspect

46
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,435
of the same mystery.

47
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,111
You see, son?

48
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,613
No matter how I turn
the compass,

49
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:05,451
the needle always
points the same way.

50
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:06,819
Except...

51
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:14,426
But how?

52
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:16,328
They do not touch.

53
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,666
I didn't hear a
"Thank you," Albert.

54
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:28,140
<i>I can still remember this.</i>

55
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,142
<i>The experience made a deep</i>

56
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,611
<i>and lasting impression on me.</i>

57
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:35,180
<i>Something deeply hidden</i>

58
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:38,317
<i>had to be behind things.</i>

59
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,487
Between the lifetimes
of Einstein and Newton,

60
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,555
there lived another genius,

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,824
one of equal stature.

62
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:49,161
The man who solved the mystery
that stumped Newton,

63
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,297
also laid the foundation

64
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:53,899
for Einstein's
revolutionary insights.

65
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,335
And for the way we live now.

66
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:18,557
<i>In 1791, in a squalid slum</i>

67
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,659
<i>in the suburbs of London,</i>

68
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:23,095
<i>Michael Faraday was born.</i>

69
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,770
<i>He showed
little promise at school.</i>

70
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:38,744
Pray tell us a word that begins

71
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,746
with the letter R.

72
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,748
Well?

73
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,919
Wabbit?

74
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,388
The word is "Rabbit."

75
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:52,925
Once again,
and correctly this time.

76
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,960
Wabbit?

77
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:57,129
Do you mock me?

78
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,031
Have I not told you how

79
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,699
to pronounce the letter R?

80
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,969
Surely you can at least
tell us your name?

81
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:07,640
Michael "Fawaday," ma'am.

82
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,775
Take this ha'penny,

83
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,910
and buy me a cane,

84
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,079
so that I may give
your insolent brother

85
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,280
a proper flogging.

86
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:34,099
<i>History does not
record that Michael Faraday</i>

87
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,602
<i>ever attended school again.</i>

88
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,941
<i>Faraday took his family's
fundamentalist Christian faith</i>

89
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,510
<i>to heart.</i>

90
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,612
<i>It would always remain
a source of strength,</i>

91
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,081
<i>comfort and humility for him.</i>

92
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:52,685
<i>He was sent to work at
a bookbindery at the age of 13.</i>

93
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,788
<i>By day, he bound the books,</i>

94
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:56,956
<i>and by night,</i>

95
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,124
<i>he read them.</i>

96
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,527
<i>It was the beginning
of a lifelong fascination</i>

97
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,697
<i>with electricity.</i>

98
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,312
After years of working
in the bookbindery,

99
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,614
Faraday, now 21,

100
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,050
yearned to escape
to a larger world.

101
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,452
His big break came

102
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:27,953
when a customer
gave him a ticket

103
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,856
to a sensational
new kind of entertainment--

104
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,993
science for the public.

105
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,899
And it started right here

106
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,202
<i>at London's Royal Institution.</i>

107
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,170
<i>Humphry Davy was not only</i>

108
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:47,640
<i>one of the leading scientists
of his day,</i>

109
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,042
<i>he discovered
several the chemical elements,</i>

110
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:52,144
<i>including calcium and sodium.</i>

111
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,480
<i>He was also
a consummate showman.</i>

112
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,850
<i>And primitive demonstrations
of electricity</i>

113
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:00,019
<i>never failed
as a crowd pleaser.</i>

114
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,920
May we have

115
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,590
the lights lowered, please?

116
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,327
I am about to unleash the might

117
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,929
of the 2,000 massive
chemical batteries

118
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:15,367
stored in the cellar
beneath our feet.

119
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:22,174
And now, behold the power
of the mysterious force

120
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,945
of electrical fluid
to illuminate our future.

121
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:49,234
<i>Faraday was too
busy taking notes to applaud.</i>

122
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,975
Faraday created a transcript
of Davy's lecture.

123
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,310
Using the skills he had learned
as an apprentice,

124
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,714
he bound them into this book.

125
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:05,384
Perhaps such a gift would
bring him to the attention

126
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,419
of the great man.

127
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,297
<i>Maybe this gesture
could be his means of escape</i>

128
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,666
<i>to a much larger universe.</i>

129
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,775
Good day, sir.

130
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,778
I wish you to deliver this
parcel to Sir Humphry.

131
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,287
<i>It was a long shot, anyway.</i>

132
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:45,290
<i>But Faraday hoped
something would come of it.</i>

133
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,826
<i>And it did.</i>

134
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,565
Uh, the experiment
is ready for you now, sir.

135
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:02,474
Ampere tells me that
poor Dulong lost an eye

136
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,044
and three fingers
working with this.

137
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,151
My eyes!

138
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:13,419
My eyes!

139
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,409
When a chemical experiment
blew up in the face

140
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:29,211
of the world-renowned scientist
Humphry Davy,

141
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,380
he remembered Michael Faraday,

142
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,582
the lad who had gone through
such lengths

143
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:37,887
to copy down and bind
the transcript of his lecture.

144
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,222
You have a first-rate
memory, young man.

145
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,892
And I shall have temporary need
of a secretary.

146
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:46,762
Sir, I dream of a life
in service to science.

147
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,532
I would advise you to stick
to the bookbinding.

148
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,068
Science is a harsh mistress.

149
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,904
Surely, a person of your
station and modest means

150
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,238
must have a trade.

151
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:58,574
Trade is vicious and selfish.

152
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,244
Men of science are amiable
and morally superior.

153
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,114
I take it
I'm the first man of science

154
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:06,482
you've ever met.

155
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:12,989
<i>Faraday made
himself indispensable to Davy.</i>

156
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,424
<i>The temporary job became
a permanent one,</i>

157
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,227
<i>and the Royal Institution
became his lifelong home.</i>

158
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,797
<i>By day, he assisted Davy
in the lab,</i>

159
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:25,067
<i>at day's end,
he climbed the stairs</i>

160
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,669
<i>to the little apartment</i>

161
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:29,705
<i>where his beloved bride Sarah
was waiting.</i>

162
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>Humphry Davy and the chemist
William Wollaston</i>

163
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,852
<i>were experimenting with
a mysterious phenomenon,</i>

164
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:47,490
<i>one with potentially
far-reaching implications.</i>

165
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,059
This is the identical setup
to Orsted's.

166
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:54,163
Now close the circuit, Davy,
and watch closely.

167
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,669
What could be driving
the needle away from the wire?

168
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,072
Damned if I know.

169
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,807
But it's as if
the electric current

170
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,343
makes the wire behave
like some kind of magnet.

171
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,713
Electricity must have something
to do with magnetism.

172
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:15,818
Now if we could only get it
to turn continuously,

173
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:17,920
imagine what might be
accomplished

174
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,790
if we could put
these forces to work.

175
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:25,761
After you've
tidied up, Faraday,

176
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,096
you might see what
you can make of it.

177
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:31,033
<i>Davy may have
been having a bit of fun</i>

178
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>at the expense
of his young assistant,</i>

179
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,371
but Faraday was on fire.

180
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,374
Up to now, electricity had been
nothing more

181
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,576
than an entertaining
novelty toy.

182
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,279
It could make a light flash
for an instant

183
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,548
or turn a compass needle
briefly,

184
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:48,517
but it had
no practical application.

185
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:52,688
Faraday immediately set about
designing the experiment,

186
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:56,592
devoting every moment of
his spare time to the problem.

187
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:58,794
If Faraday succeeded,

188
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:02,198
he would be putting
an infinitely large, invisible,

189
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:05,701
and as-yet-undiscovered army
of electrons

190
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:09,305
at the command of human whim.

191
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,875
How does a revolution begin?

192
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,078
Sometimes it doesn't take much.

193
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:19,381
<i>A piece of metal,
a bowl of mercury,</i>

194
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,617
<i>a bit of cork.</i>

195
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:26,288
Sarah dear,
send your little brother down.

196
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:28,290
I'm about to try
something knew,

197
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,726
and I want him to see it.

198
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,863
Why don't you do
the honors, Georgie.

199
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,568
There she goes.

200
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:41,570
There she goes!

201
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:52,148
<i>This was the first motor</i>

202
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:56,685
converting electric current into
continuous mechanical motion.

203
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,021
Looks pretty feeble, right?

204
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,290
<i>But that turning spindle</i>

205
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:04,126
<i>is the beginning
of a revolution,</i>

206
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,595
<i>one that dwarfs
all the shots fired</i>

207
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,664
<i>and bombs ever detonated</i>

208
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:13,769
<i>in the sheer magnitude of its
effect on our civilization.</i>

209
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:17,139
<i>Try to imagine
all the businesses,</i>

210
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,141
<i>industries, technologies,</i>

211
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,510
<i>transformations
of the way we live</i>

212
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:24,547
<i>that have their beginnings
in that ecstatic moment</i>

213
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,683
<i>in Michael Faraday's
laboratory.</i>

214
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:30,286
News of Faraday's invention
spread quickly,

215
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,224
and suddenly, Davy's assistant
was the toast of London.

216
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,560
Davy didn't take it well.

217
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:41,063
<i>He had, after all,
discovered all those elements.</i>

218
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,569
Now people were saying
that his greatest discovery

219
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:49,338
was Michael Faraday.

220
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,574
Davy made sure that Faraday

221
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:56,011
wouldn't be making
any more headlines anytime soon.

222
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:00,015
You sent for me, sir?

223
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,251
I have a new challenge for you.

224
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,754
I want you to take
over our efforts

225
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,624
to improve the quality
of British optical glass.

226
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,260
Those damned Bavarians

227
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:12,995
are running circles around us.

228
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,063
Glass?

229
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,731
With all due respect, sir,

230
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,334
I know nothing at all
of glass-making.

231
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,536
Then you will learn, Faraday.

232
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,272
We all know what
a quick study you are.

233
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,609
Just analyze the chemical
composition of their glass

234
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,612
and work backwards to
see how they made it.

235
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,547
It shouldn't take you long.

236
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,890
<i>But Faraday
struggled for four years</i>

237
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,424
<i>without any success.</i>

238
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:01,443
This is even worse
than the last batch.

239
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,780
No matter how hard he tried,

240
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:08,117
Faraday could not figure out
what Joseph Fraunhofer

241
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,419
had discovered years before.

242
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:14,423
<i>What Faraday failed to grasp
was that casting</i>

243
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,226
<i>perfect optical glass
for telescopes was a craft</i>

244
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,395
<i>as well as a science,
and the masters</i>

245
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:22,298
<i>in Bavaria kept their secrets
under lock and key.</i>

246
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:32,775
<i>Faraday never did learn
their secret.</i>

247
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:35,244
<i>He kept a single glass brick</i>

248
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,781
<i>as a souvenir of this failure.</i>

249
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:43,519
Years later, it would change
the course of his life...

250
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,721
and ours.

251
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:09,818
Davy's death finally brought an
end to this fruitless project,

252
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,788
and Faraday,
the boy from the slums,

253
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,357
succeeded him
as Director of the Laboratory.

254
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:19,028
Faraday used his new authority
to do something unprecedented--

255
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:21,797
a series of annual
Christmas lectures on science

256
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:25,067
for the young...
beginning in 1825

257
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,703
and continuing to this day.

258
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,737
<i>At one of the first
Christmas lectures,</i>

259
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,906
<i>Faraday enchanted his audience</i>

260
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,843
<i>with displays of the new powers
that were at his disposal.</i>

261
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:11,547
Suppose I want to fire
a portion of gunpowder.

262
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,349
I can readily do it
with the power

263
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,850
of electricity.

264
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,624
If I receive electricity
through this conducting wire,

265
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,960
I can then give it
to anything I touch.

266
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:29,198
But I must stand on these
insulating glass legs

267
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:32,468
to prevent the electricity
from going away into the floor.

268
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,073
<i>Now I am electrified!</i>

269
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,775
Whoa!

270
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,149
Do you think I could light
this gas jet

271
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,418
just by touching it
with my finger?

272
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,586
No, don't do it! No!

273
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,122
No! Don't!

274
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,260
Now, mind you,
don't try this at home.

275
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,834
And now, my children,
you have seen for yourselves

276
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:08,404
how this invisible force
of electricity

277
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,839
can be made to serve
new purposes

278
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:14,443
utterly unattainable
by the powers we have now.

279
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:27,423
The invention of a motor
that could work continuously,

280
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,625
eliminating countless
human hours of drudgery,

281
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,594
would be more than enough
to make you a fortune

282
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,596
and land you
in the history books.

283
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,199
But that's not how
Michael Faraday saw it.

284
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:40,369
He had absolutely no interest
in patenting his ideas

285
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,371
or personally profiting
from them.

286
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:44,373
And as for the history books,

287
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,608
he had only written
the first sentence

288
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,378
of an entry that
would be many pages long.

289
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:54,516
Mr. Anderson, may I ask you
to dim the lights, please?

290
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:57,653
Gentlemen, I am about to induce
a current of electricity

291
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,722
merely by moving a magnet.

292
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,290
Please observe what happens

293
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,859
in the gap between the wires
when I do so.

294
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,370
Do you see how the current only
flows when the magnet is moving?

295
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,306
This is the conversion

296
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,441
of motion into electricity.

297
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,920
This was the first generator.

298
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:35,257
From here, electricity would
become available on demand.

299
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,760
Faraday was continuing
to change the world

300
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,862
and the way people lived,

301
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,930
and then, suddenly,

302
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,300
an illness attacked
his incomparable mind.

303
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,841
<i>My dear Schoenbein,</i>

304
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,278
<i>I would be very grateful to
have your opinion regarding...</i>

305
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,252
<i>Regarding...</i>

306
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,890
<i>Dear Schoenbein...
Regarding...</i>

307
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:21,136
My dear husband,
whatever is the matter?

308
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:23,872
I began a letter to Schoenbein

309
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,809
and could not remember
what I meant to say.

310
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:29,044
This is no cause for alarm.

311
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,913
You work too hard.

312
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:33,082
- You're exhausted.
- No.

313
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,383
Sarah, this is different.

314
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,385
Horribly different.

315
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,922
It's the third time my memory
has failed me in as many days.

316
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:42,057
I fear I'm losing my mind.

317
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,360
And what would I be
without that?

318
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,632
Why, my darling husband,
of course.

319
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,403
When Faraday was 49,

320
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:57,406
he began to battle severe
memory loss and depression.

321
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,942
His work came to a standstill.

322
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,311
And although
he never fully recovered,

323
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:05,681
his greatest achievements
still lay ahead.

324
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,235
<i>Faraday</i>

325
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,870
had immersed himself so deeply

326
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:25,339
in electrical
and magnetic experiments

327
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:28,075
that he came to visualize
the space around a magnet

328
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,779
as filled with
invisible lines of force.

329
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:35,216
<i>A magnet was not simply
the magnetized bar of iron</i>

330
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,617
<i>that you could see.</i>

331
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:39,453
<i>It was also
the unseen something</i>

332
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:42,023
<i>in the space around the bar.</i>

333
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,525
<i>And that something
he called a field.</i>

334
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,929
<i>A magnetic field.</i>

335
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:50,631
<i>Faraday believed
in the unity of nature.</i>

336
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,034
<i>Having demonstrated
the connections</i>

337
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:56,804
<i>between electricity
and magnetism, he wondered,</i>

338
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:01,542
<i>were these two forces also
connected to a third-- light?</i>

339
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,811
If he could only show
a connection

340
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,614
among these three
invisible phenomena,

341
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:09,150
one of nature's
most intimate secrets

342
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:11,085
would at last be revealed.

343
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,120
<i>So, what did he do?</i>

344
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,956
<i>He designed an experiment.</i>

345
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,992
<i>Faraday knew that light
can travel as a wave.</i>

346
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:21,062
<i>Waves of light vibrate
randomly in all directions.</i>

347
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,665
<i>But there's a way to isolate
a single wave of light.</i>

348
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,668
<i>It's called polarization.</i>

349
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,403
<i>When light bounces
off a reflective surface,</i>

350
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:30,838
<i>like a mirror,</i>

351
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:33,407
it becomes polarized.

352
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:35,276
Faraday wanted to see

353
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,412
if that single ray of light
could be manipulated

354
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,448
by the invisible magnetic field.

355
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:42,984
<i>The eyepiece contained
a crystal</i>

356
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:45,953
<i>that acted as a kind
of picket fence for light.</i>

357
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:47,955
<i>Light could only pass
through it</i>

358
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,424
<i>if it was somehow moved
by the magnet.</i>

359
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,627
<i>He placed a lantern
before a mirror,</i>

360
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:55,830
<i>one that he would only see
through the eyepiece</i>

361
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:59,467
if its reflection could pass
through the picket fence.

362
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:02,703
If this is hard to understand,
don't feel bad.

363
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,639
Scientists could not explain
this phenomenon

364
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:06,340
for another 100 years.

365
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,377
<i>Faraday knew that magnetism
had no effect</i>

366
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:12,346
<i>on light
that was moving through air.</i>

367
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,615
<i>But what about when it was
moving through other materials?</i>

368
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,984
<i>So what kind of material
could he use</i>

369
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,620
<i>to help the magnet
move the light?</i>

370
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,722
<i>He tried hundreds of different</i>

371
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,758
<i>transparent chemicals
and objects...</i>

372
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:28,496
<i>but saw nothing
through the eyepiece.</i>

373
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,132
<i>The light was not twisted
by the magnet.</i>

374
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:34,001
<i>He tried crystals of calcite,</i>

375
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:36,037
<i>sodium carbonate,</i>

376
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:37,905
<i>calcium sulfate,</i>

377
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,541
<i>and still, he saw nothing.</i>

378
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,310
<i>He tried acids.</i>

379
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:43,377
<i>Sulfuric acid,</i>

380
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:45,212
<i>muriatic acid,</i>

381
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,248
<i>carbonic acid.</i>

382
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,716
<i>He tried gasses...</i>

383
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,652
<i>oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen...</i>

384
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:53,321
<i>with no success.</i>

385
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,923
<i>The magnetic field induced</i>

386
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,259
<i>in these substances
could not twist the light</i>

387
00:24:58,293 --> 00:24:59,760
<i>from his lamp back into view.</i>

388
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:03,030
Damn!

389
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:12,940
<i>In desperation,
he decided to try...</i>

390
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:14,942
<i>the glass brick,</i>

391
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:18,212
<i>the souvenir</i>

392
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:21,115
<i>of his years
of bondage to Davy.</i>

393
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,763
<i>It did the trick.</i>

394
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:37,565
<i>The force of the magnet</i>

395
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,300
<i>twisted the light</i>

396
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:41,903
<i>so that it could pass
through the crystal.</i>

397
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:44,272
<i>So, what's the big deal?</i>

398
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:46,540
<i>Faraday had demonstrated
the existence</i>

399
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:49,176
<i>of the physical reality
that surrounds us,</i>

400
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,946
<i>but which no one had ever
been able to detect.</i>

401
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,981
<i>It was as dramatic
a breakthrough</i>

402
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,751
<i>as seeing the cosmos
for the very first time</i>

403
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:58,152
<i>through a telescope.</i>

404
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:01,822
By showing
that an electromagnetic force

405
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:03,658
could manipulate light,

406
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:07,094
Faraday had discovered
a deeper unity of nature.

407
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,664
He had opened a door
for Einstein

408
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,266
and all the physicists
who came after him

409
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:14,068
to glimpse the interplay

410
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:17,305
of hidden, primal forces
in the universe.

411
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,408
Even as he approached
the summit of his genius,

412
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:22,576
he was plagued by depression

413
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:24,278
and doubts about his ability

414
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,614
to retain even
the simplest thoughts.

415
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:30,651
<i>My dear friend, I find
a difficulty in answering</i>

416
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:33,621
<i>or even acknowledging properly
a scientific letter,</i>

417
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:36,791
<i>for I cannot now hold it
at once in my mind.</i>

418
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:40,061
<i>The memory
of the parts fail me.</i>

419
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,266
<i>P.S. You will be sorry to see</i>

420
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,168
<i>the tone of this short note,</i>

421
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:51,038
<i>but my dearest husband is not
quite so well as usual,</i>

422
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:53,608
<i>but I hope he will improve.</i>

423
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:56,644
<i>Yours very truly, S. Faraday.</i>

424
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:02,149
As a young man,
Faraday had risen from poverty,

425
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:04,619
in one of the most
class-conscious societies

426
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:06,988
the world has ever known,

427
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:10,891
to become the most celebrated
scientist of his time.

428
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:14,495
By age 40, he had invented
the electric motor,

429
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:17,198
the transformer, the generator,

430
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:20,234
machines that would change
everything about the home,

431
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,670
the farm, the factory.

432
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:26,340
Now, at 60, decades after
the fertile periods

433
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,576
of the greatest physicists,

434
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,379
plagued by memory loss
and melancholy,

435
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:34,482
he fearlessly probed deeper

436
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:37,919
into the mysterious
invisible forces.

437
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:59,193
The world thought that
Michael Faraday was a has-been.

438
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,129
Despite his depression,

439
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:04,465
he remained
as passionately curious as ever.

440
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,034
Having discovered the unity

441
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,536
of electricity,
magnetism and light,

442
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,371
Faraday needed to know

443
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:14,175
how this trinity
of natural forces work together.

<i>This was nothing new.</i>

446
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:25,053
<i>Children had been playing
with magnets</i>

447
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,021
<i>and iron filings for centuries.</i>

448
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>Everyone had always assumed
that this lovely pattern</i>

449
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,644
<i>was just something
that iron did.</i>

450
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,231
<i>Faraday knew that electric current
turns a wire into a magnet,</i>

451
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,700
<i>so he expected
to find related patterns</i>

452
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:43,137
<i>in iron filings around a wire
carrying electricity.</i>

<i>But where others saw merely
lovely shapes,</i>

454
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:51,045
<i>Faraday saw something profound.</i>

455
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,516
<i>The patterns were not simply
a quirk of iron filings;</i>

456
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,519
<i>they existed in the space
around a magnet</i>

457

<i>or an electric current,</i>

458
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,656
<i>even in the absence
of iron filings.</i>

459
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:05,392
<i>The patterns were the traces,
the footprints</i>

460
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,528
<i>of invisible fields of force,</i>

461
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:12,199
<i>that reached out into the space
around anything magnetic.</i>

462

<i>The compass needle

464
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,011
<i>to some far away
magnetic North Pole.</i>

465
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,547
<i>It was detecting
a continuous force field</i>

466
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:29,250
<i>that stretched
all the way there.</i>

467
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,956
Earth itself is a giant magnet.

468
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,491
And like any other magnet,

469
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,993
its lines of force
extend far out

<i>Pigeons and other birds

00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:11,660
<i>How? Partly by recognizing
familiar landmarks--</i>

480
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:14,062
<i>rivers, mountains, stars.</i>

481
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,764
<i>Even certain smells can serve</i>

482
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,934
<i>as signposts
for migrating birds.</i>

483
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:21,503
<i>But birds also have
an inner compass.</i>

484
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:24,739
<i>They can actually sense
the Earth's magnetic field.</i>

485
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:28,510
<i>Their brains process magnetic
data in much the same way</i>

486
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:31,112
<i>ours process visual data.</i>

487
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:33,481
<i>By sensing the direction
of the field,</i>

488
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,584
<i>birds can tell north
from south.</i>

489
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:38,620
<i>That's one way North American
birds know which way to go</i>

490
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:40,355
<i>when they head south
for the winter.</i>

491
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:42,691
<i>The field is stronger
near the poles</i>

492
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:44,526
<i>than it is at the equator,</i>

493
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,129
<i>a fact that birds use
to figure out their latitude.</i>

494
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,799
<i>There are also small
irregularities in the field,</i>

495
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,267
<i>locations where the field</i>

496
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,703
<i>is a little weaker or stronger.</i>

497
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:57,138
<i>Just like a distinctive
mountain or river,</i>

498
00:30:57,173 --> 00:31:01,176
<i>these magnetic anomalies
can serve as landmarks.</i>

499
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:14,055
<i>For thousands of years, humans
have used carrier pigeons</i>

500
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,958
<i>to send messages
to distant locations.</i>

501
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:19,127
<i>It was a crucial method
of communication</i>

502
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:20,996
<i>as recently as World War II.</i>

503
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,697
<i>When you think about it,
we've been using</i>

504
00:31:22,732 --> 00:31:25,734
<i>magnetic fields to communicate
for a long time.</i>

505
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:28,603
<i>We just didn't know it.</i>

506
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,414
So why does our planet
have a magnetic field at all?

507
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:41,182
What causes it?

508
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:44,419
The answer lies
deep inside the Earth.

509
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:47,589
Liquid iron, circulating around
the solid part of the core

510
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:49,090
as Earth rotates,

511
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,861
acts like a wire
carrying an electric current.

512
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:54,696
And as Faraday showed us,

513
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,265
electric currents
produce magnetic fields.

514
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,867
And that's a good thing.

515
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,269
Our magnetic field protects us
from the onslaught

516
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:05,373
of cosmic rays, which would be
very damaging to our biosphere.

517
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:08,710
Cosmic rays can rip through DNA.

518
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,112
Without our magnetic field,
the rate of mutation

519
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,281
in living organisms
would be much higher.

520
00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:17,452
Fortunately, most of this
cosmic shrapnel gets trapped

521
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,222
in the Van Allen belts,
donut-shaped zones

522
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:25,093
of charged particles corralled
by our magnetic shield.

523
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:36,204
<i>Knowing that the Earth itself
is like a giant bar magnet</i>

524
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:39,274
<i>explains one of the most
beautiful sights in the sky,</i>

525
00:32:39,308 --> 00:32:41,309
<i>the aurora.</i>

526
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:46,081
<i>Charged particles from the Sun,
the solar wind,</i>

527
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:48,917
<i>are constantly bombarding
the Earth.</i>

528
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,454
<i>You can think of the solar wind
as a kind of electric current.</i>

529
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:54,556
<i>Our planet's magnetic field</i>

530
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,225
<i>channels that current towards
the North and South Poles.</i>

531
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,060
<i>When it hits our atmosphere,</i>

532
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:00,896
<i>the oxygen
and nitrogen molecules</i>

533
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,634
<i>in the air glow like
giant fluorescent lightbulbs.</i>

534
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,456
<i>When Faraday pursued</i>

535
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:30,859
his last
and most profound discovery,

536
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,861
the poverty
of his childhood stymied him

537
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,629
as it never had before.

538
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,364
He needed help

539
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,567
and found it in one who had come
from another world.

540
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:57,070
Michael Faraday
had solved the mystery

541
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:59,239
that baffled Isaac Newton.

542
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:20,427
<i>This was how the Sun
told the planets how to move</i>

543
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:22,729
<i>without touching them.</i>

544
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:24,931
<i>The Sun does touch the planets</i>

545
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,766
<i>with its gravitational field,</i>

546
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,402
<i>and Earth's gravitational field</i>

547
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:32,806
<i>tells the apples how to fall.</i>

548
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:45,084
All this is a dream.

549
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:49,156
Unfortunately,
that was the prevailing view

550
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,757
among his fellow scientists.

551
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,026
Faraday was dreaming.

552
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:54,661
<i>They admired his inventiveness</i>

553
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,730
<i>and his genius
for experimentation,</i>

554
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:59,566
<i>but they regarded
his invisible "lines of force"</i>

555
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,036
<i>and his ideas about light
and gravity as hand-waving,</i>

556
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:06,373
<i>meaning there was nothing solid
to back it up.</i>

557
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:09,576
<i>Some openly ridiculed
his theories.</i>

558
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,912
<i>They needed
to see his ideas expressed</i>

559
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,381
<i>in the language
of modern physics,</i>

560
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:16,083
<i>precise equations.</i>

561
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:17,551
<i>This was the one area</i>

562
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:19,219
<i>where Faraday's
childhood poverty</i>

563
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,587
<i>and lack of formal education</i>

564
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:24,191
<i>actually held him back.</i>

565
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:26,893
<i>He couldn't do the math.</i>

566
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:31,465
<i>Faraday had finally hit a wall
that he could not overcome.</i>

567
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:34,067
<i>And then, the greatest
theoretical physicist</i>

568
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,903
<i>of the 19th century came along.</i>

569
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:41,074
<i>James Clerk Maxwell was born
into a world of wealth</i>

570
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:42,709
<i>and privilege,</i>

571
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:47,080
<i>an only child
of doting middle-aged parents.</i>

572
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:54,921
<i>By his early 20s,
he had made a name for himself</i>

573
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,656
<i>as a mathematician.</i>

574
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:59,059
<i>While other scientists had come
to think of Faraday</i>

575
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,495
<i>as old-fashioned;
a great figure of the past</i>

576
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,331
<i>but no part of the future
of physics,</i>

577
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:07,801
<i>James Clerk Maxwell
knew better.</i>

578
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,803
<i>He began by reading everything</i>

579
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,406
<i>Faraday had written
on electricity.</i>

580
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,409
<i>He became convinced
that Faraday's fields of force</i>

581
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:17,911
<i>were real,
and he set out to give them</i>

582
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:20,881
<i>a precise
mathematical formulation.</i>

583
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,249
_

584
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,796
An equation in physics
is just a shorthand description

585
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:13,300
of something that can be
represented in space and time.

586
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:16,737
For instance, the equation that
describes the arc of a pendulum

587
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:21,575
shows that it can never swing
higher than its initial height.

588
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:40,060
When Maxwell translated
Faraday's experimental

589
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:44,164
observation on electromagnetic
fields into equations,

590
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,100
he discovered an asymmetry.

591
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,337
See that bottom one?

592
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,906
It cries out for something else.

593
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,908
Great mathematician that he was,

594
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:58,378
Maxwell added a single term
to balance it.

595
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:02,048
This tweaking of the equation
changed Faraday's static field

596
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,919
into waves that spread outward
at the speed of light.

597
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:09,256
It wasn't long before we found
a way to turn those waves...

598
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,427
<i>into couriers</i>

599
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,829
<i>for our messages.</i>

600
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:19,232
Can you see me?

601
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,635
Can you hear me?

602
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:24,571
This is how.

603
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:32,979
<i>This technology has transformed
human civilization</i>

604
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:35,115
<i>from a patchwork of cities,</i>

605
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:37,117
<i>towns and villages</i>

606
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:41,154
<i>into an intercommunicating
organism...</i>

607
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:53,500
<i>linking us at light speed...</i>

608
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,441
<i>to each other...</i>

609
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,786
and to the cosmos.

610

<i>Nothing is
too wonderful to be true,</i>

611

<i>if it be consistent
with the laws of nature.</i>
