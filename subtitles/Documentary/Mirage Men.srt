1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,770
Attention projectionist,
adjust the lens,

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,072
so that your picture
will be focused properly

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,674
before the show starts.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,884
Flying Saucers have
invaded our planet,

5
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,587
Washington, London,
Paris, Moscow are

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,024
key targets, the whole
world is under attack!

7
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>People of Earth, attention!</i>

8
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:42,408
(Narrator) In 1952 the
Central Intelligence Agency,

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,780
faced with a huge public
interest in flying saucers,

10
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,382
brought in a
panel of scientists,

11
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,017
very senior scientists,

12
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,721
we know it now as
the Robertson Panel.

13
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,524
They concluded that
there was nothing

14
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,094
to these flying saucer reports

15
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,764
as objective devices
of some kind

16
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,334
but that, nevertheless,
the government had to

17
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:14,740
exercise great care
to debunk the stories

18
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,709
and individual civilians

19
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:21,413
who expressed an interest in
flying saucers ought to be

20
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,550
carefully watched,
said the Robertson panel.

21
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,853
And I believe that to be
the founding document,

22
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,023
the document giving the
long range strategy

23
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:36,095
that has been followed
by the US government.

24
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:39,665
The general feeling
amongst people

25
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,569
who have devoted a big
chunk of their life

26
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:50,709
to studying UFOs, I think,
is fear that they have

27
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:55,547
been taken for a ride,
that these cases are hoaxes,

28
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,718
but sophisticated hoaxes carried
out by their own government.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,588
What do you want with me?

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,052
(Narrator) Let's take
one step at a time,

31
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,388
you're looking at Richard Doty,

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,894
the professional
disinformer, trained to lie.

33
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,896
I'm Richard Doty.

34
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:48,133
There's probably about
80% of false information

35
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,969
being presented and about
20% of factual information.

36
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,672
Unfortunately the
UFO community

37
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,440
doesn't know which is which.

38
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,643
(Interviewer)
And that's your job,
to keep it that way?

39
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,711
(Richard Doty)
That was my job before,

40
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,113
I'm a private citizen now.

41
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,482
But back in the early
eighties it was my job

42
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:08,353
to confuse the UFO community.

43
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,924
Doty was representing
himself, as I recall,

44
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,826
as basically this
sort of Deep Throat.

45
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:18,330
Doty had this wonderful
way to sell it,

46
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,933
I'm with the government
you cooperate with us,

47
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,635
and I'm going to
tell you what the

48
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,072
government really
knows about UFOs.

49
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,941
Doty found a lot
of gullible people

50
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,842
in the UFO community,

51
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,378
that would easily believe

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,719
what he said without
any type of scrutiny.

53
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,788
My commander told me,

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,457
"Well there's this guy
Special Agent Doty,

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,828
and you've got to be careful
because he kinda made the..."

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,396
The impression I got was that

57
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,433
he had made the Air
Force a little nervous.

58
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:57,703
Maybe... they didn't say egg
on their face or anything,

59
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,805
but they were just
very cautious.

60
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,076
The main reason that
we in the UFO field

61
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,479
recognize the name Richard Doty

62
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,316
is that a man named
Paul Bennewitz

63
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,384
a self-made man,

64
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,419
a very successful businessman

65
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,756
was systematically driven insane

66
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,326
wound up in an insane
asylum under treatment

67
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,862
for a long time,
lost his business

68
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,365
had to turn it over
to his family,

69
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:31,436
and was destroyed
by the efforts of

70
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,540
Richard Doty.

71
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,442
You hear about the ones that

72
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,944
something goes wrong.

73
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,445
You hear about the ones
where there was an

74
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,714
unfortunate incident
or in some cases

75
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,916
there are failures.

76
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,018
It was unfortunate

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,687
what happened to Mr. Bennewitz

78
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,623
but they were
supposed to protect

79
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,593
something and they
did their job.

80
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,894
That's the part
of the base that

81
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,162
Paul Bennewitz could see.

82
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,365
You can see the
Manzano mountain here

83
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,901
where all the nuclear
weapons were stored.

84
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:07,172
Kirtland Air Force Base,
the perimeter fence,

85
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,442
Paul Bennewitz's house
is right over here,

86
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,078
and his excellent view was
afforded from this

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,049
exclusive area of Albuquerque.

88
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,219
You basically have
a front row seat.

89
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,322
August, September of 1979,

90
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,223
Paul was standing
up on his deck

91
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,392
and looking up over the
roofs towards the base

92
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,262
and these lights he
saw would probably be

93
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,398
about half a mile away,

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,966
there was always two of them,

95
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,969
they'd lift up from the
ground rather quickly

96
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,172
and then very
quickly go around,

97
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,007
shoot that way around
the side of the mountain

98
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,408
and then drop down behind it.

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,578
And they did the same
thing every time.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,547
For anybody that would
peak your interest,

101
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,148
"What the hell is that?"

102
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,122
He had an interest
in the UFO subject.

103
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,824
It was about the only
thing he was interested in

104
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,393
besides his business.

105
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,229
He had a company called
Thunder Scientific

106
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,532
they designed instruments for
high profile people like NASA

107
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,068
and even the Air Force.

108
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,436
A lot of people said
he was a genius

109
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,072
with electronics and
he decided that he was

110
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,007
going to listen in
on what was going on

111
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,076
at the base, maybe he
could pick up some

112
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,611
radio signals about
what this thing was

113
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,114
and he knew about
where to start looking

114
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,415
and he started picking up

115
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,485
these bursts of information,
when he started

116
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,153
to decode the signals
he thought that it

117
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,554
had a connection to whatever

118
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,456
these lights were.

119
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,625
He decided it was
something to do with

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,395
technology that wasn't ours.

121
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,130
He was a good American,
so he called up

122
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,365
the Air Force base,

123
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,534
they connected him with
Richard Doty eventually.

124
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:59,835
Paul didn't know
initially what he got,

125
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:03,405
he didn't analyze it.

126
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,907
And when he had got
the first series

127
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,446
of transmissions,
he recorded them,

128
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:15,017
and then he contacted the
security officer for Kirtland.

129
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,020
I began
a dialogue with Paul,

130
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:20,422
trying to find out
everything he had

131
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,593
and as I did then I
learned that a lot

132
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,863
of the information he had
wasn't anything to do

133
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,632
with a Soviet threat or
some kind of hostile

134
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,868
threat against Kirtland
it was information

135
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,469
that he had gathered -

136
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:36,371
because of the fact
that he was a scientist,

137
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:39,875
and because he had sensitive
and sophisticated equipment

138
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,512
he was collecting emissions
coming from the base.

139
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:45,814
And we had to decide what we
were going to do then,

140
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,283
were we going to
allow this to happen?

141
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,553
Or were we going to try
and convince him otherwise?

142
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,228
The more he had contact
with me and others

143
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,864
within the intelligence
community,

144
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,700
the more he started analyzing
the information.

145
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:09,871
So, we kinda planted
the seed in Paul that

146
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,040
what he was seeing and
what he was hearing

147
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,842
and what he was
collecting was in fact

148
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,244
probably, maybe, UFOs!

149
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,147
It was very easy
to convince Paul.

150
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,183
Paul was a
World War II veteran,

151
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:24,786
he was very patriotic,
he always flew his flag.

152
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:26,188
Those type of people
you can convince that,

153
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,889
"Listen", just tell him

154
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,225
"Paul, you can't tell
anyone else about this,

155
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,861
because it could get
into the wrong hands"

156
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:37,466
so immediately Paul became
a cooperating source

157
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:39,835
he held everything
that he had gotten

158
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,770
in secrecy.

159
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,906
(Bob Durant)
Doty was feeding this man
all kinds of lies

160
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:50,212
about UFOs and aliens
being kept underneath

161
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,915
a mountain nearby, and
so on and so forth,

162
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:57,853
and Bennewitz, of course,
was believing all of this.

163
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,222
He had two films,
of an object flying,

164
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:02,457
one picture depicted an object
that looked like it was

165
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,092
flying out of the mountain

166
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:07,963
and it looked like some kind
of saucer-shaped object.

167
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,198
He immediately then
though that there

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,135
were UFOs coming
out of Manzano.

169
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:15,937
The second film
was of an object

170
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,105
that was something
that was experimental

171
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,208
that the
government was doing.

172
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,845
When he filmed that, then
again the flag went up that

173
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,114
he just filmed a
classified project.

174
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,522
Paul made a presentation to
the Air Force officials,

175
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:36,124
on what he had been doing

176
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,260
and about what he had
been collecting.

177
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:42,130
He showed some of his film, he
showed some of his pictures,

178
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:43,965
he had a audio recorder
that was playing

179
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,268
the sounds that he had
collected from the base.

180
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,869
The highest ranking
person in the room

181
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,138
who was a Brigadier
General said

182
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,943
"You have some very
convincing information Paul."

183
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,845
And that kind of set
everything in motion with

184
00:09:56,947 --> 00:10:01,216
Paul to let him think
that, yup, he does.

185
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,251
From the point he came
in and gave that meeting

186
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,254
they decided all his perceptions
were going to be directed

187
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,091
exactly the way the intelligence
organizations wanted.

188
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,093
(Richard Doty)
We briefed everybody
in the room.

189
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,963
So they knew what we
were doing, basically.

190
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,065
And so after the meeting there

191
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,167
was a number of
questions asked to him,

192
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,303
"What do you want the
Air Force to do?"

193
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:27,075
And Paul says "I'd like
a grant to investigate

194
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:32,547
UFOs on the base" and a
grant to continue

195
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,485
this contact that he claimed he
had with some of these aliens,

196
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:40,622
which... now that's
a different story!

197
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:44,159
At one point another
agency was conducting

198
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,228
an investigation and they
set up a surveillance

199
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,929
across the street from him

200
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,633
and Paul's son contacted
me and said

201
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,703
"Leave my father alone,
you guys are across

202
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:57,539
the street and you're
bothering my father,

203
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,041
he's getting to the point
that he's being paranoid."

204
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,877
Well, I knew it wasn't us.

205
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,512
(Greg Bishop)
He said he saw people coming
in and out of the house

206
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:05,780
and looking out
from the curtains

207
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,116
and things like
that and as it turns out

208
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,885
the NSA had some
people in this house,

209
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,821
they were watching
him and actually

210
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,657
beaming messages straight
across the street

211
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,093
into his antenna set up.

212
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,801
He'd started picking up
these signals

213
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,771
and the NSA was scared
that anybody could

214
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:32,540
figure that out.

215
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,142
They decided to just
take complete control

216
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:36,678
of what he was seeing
and give him exactly

217
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,747
what he thought he
should be getting.

218
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,649
They replaced his
computer with

219
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:42,217
their own computer.

220
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,486
The computer had software
that would decode

221
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,087
the messages that he
was getting in the way

222
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,523
that they wanted
him to see them.

223
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,091
And if you look at
the transcript of it,

224
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,494
it seems like almost
gibberish but because

225
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,963
people want to pull out
content from a random

226
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,599
order it starts to make
some kind of sense.

227
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,201
They said that they
were from a planet with

228
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,003
no water and they were
trying to find a new

229
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,838
place to live and they
wanted to take over

230
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,107
the Earth and that they
can only trust Paul.

231
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,109
They were going to have some
kind of agreement with him

232
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,944
but he said you can't
trust anything they say,

233
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,646
these aliens are evil

234
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,682
and it served to make him
look silly which was

235
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,116
exactly what they
were trying to do.

236
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,722
Paul actually thought

237
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,023
that these UFOs had
to be coming

238
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,992
from some other place.

239
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,928
So Paul on his own went
up to Archuleta Peak,

240
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,264
which is in northern New
Mexico, around Dulce, New Mexico

241
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:35,203
and he did his own
investigation basically.

242
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,138
Dulce and the
Archuleta Peak area

243
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,507
had a superstition
for many years,

244
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,543
way, way before we
were ever involved.

245
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,813
There were strange lights
and strange stories

246
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:47,148
about that area coming from

247
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,217
the Indian tribe that
lives up there.

248
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:02,664
(Greg Bishop)
If somebody wanted to hide
something here

249
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:06,501
it would be pretty
easy, it's very remote.

250
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:10,271
It's supposedly the site of
an underground alien base.

251
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,974
That rumor got started
in the early 1980s

252
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,143
because of what was
told to Paul Bennewitz

253
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:19,781
by the Air Force Office
of Special Investigation.

254
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,516
Paul was a pilot,
and he had a plane,

255
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,119
and he flew around those
areas and he saw things

256
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,988
and he filmed things
up there that, again,

257
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,790
presented a
problem for us because

258
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,559
what he was filming up
there was actually

259
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,829
a secretive military
installation

260
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:38,733
that was training commandos.

261
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,636
So then we had to convince Paul
that what he was seeing up there

262
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,638
was again, UFOs.

263
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,173
(Greg Bishop)
The Air Force actually put him
in a helicopter

264
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,642
with Rick Doty the first time

265
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,744
and flew him up to a
place above Dulce,

266
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,212
called the Archuleta Mesa

267
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:54,215
and before they
took him up there,

268
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:56,885
they dumped a bunch
of props up there.

269
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,687
They flew him up there, flew
him over the mesa and said,

270
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,222
"You're right
Paul, look there's stuff here,

271
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,024
there's some evidence
of what's going on,

272
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:05,193
why don't you check
this out for us?"

273
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,229
(Richard Doty) So I would
go with Paul up there

274
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:10,498
and we actually
camped out there a couple times

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,735
and we actually saw some
things that startled me,

276
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,703
which were fully
explained later,

277
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,540
but one of the things that
was kind of interesting

278
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,108
were these lights coming
out of the ground,

279
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,676
but the way the
lights, these beams,

280
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,214
were coming out of the ground
in a pulse kind of manner,

281
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,750
that it looked like they were
saucers flying out

282
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,652
of these mountains, and I
actually saw this

283
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:34,155
and I was somewhat
concerned that maybe

284
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,873
Paul had stumbled
onto something.

285
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,798
Paul was flying what
he called his missions

286
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,867
around Archuleta Mesa

287
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:51,205
and would send back
fascinating letters,

288
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,908
five, six, seven,
eight pages long,

289
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,712
hand written with pencil
sketches of what he'd seen.

290
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:02,116
And finally he started
sending large format

291
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:04,085
eight by ten photographs taken

292
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,954
with his Hasselblad
in which he'd say,

293
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:10,524
"Well, here's the black
atomic powered ship that

294
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:15,529
crashed last week" and
he'd circle it, and, oh,

295
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,699
I'd look at that
and, bless his heart,

296
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:22,570
I couldn't see anything that
resembled a crashed anything.

297
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,909
(Greg Bishop) Something
actually did crash near Dulce

298
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,113
on the mesa
in the late 1980s.

299
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:34,048
Bennewitz just happened
to be flying over it

300
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,651
and took pictures of it and so
the disinformation campaign

301
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,488
had to be ratcheted
up even more.

302
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,156
The Air Force, they knew
it was something

303
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,558
they were testing up in
this area and that it

304
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,160
had gone off course
and crashed.

305
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,162
Of course they told Paul
Bennewitz that it was

306
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,864
some sort of alien
craft that had been

307
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,933
given to the humans
to use and that they

308
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,069
had shot it out of the sky
as some sort of a lesson.

309
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,476
What probably crashed there was
some sort of unmanned

310
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,545
aerial vehicle and now they're
over in the Middle East,

311
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,747
remote controlled,
killing people in cars

312
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,215
as they drive
across the desert.

313
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,552
But in 1985 they didn't
really want anybody to

314
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,588
have any knowledge of
this kind of thing.

315
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,791
They took great pains to
explain to him that it

316
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,827
was this atomic powered aircraft

317
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,930
that the aliens had helped us
with and bring down

318
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,698
that laughter curtain
again so people

319
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,133
just wouldn't pay attention.

320
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,102
They'd just think it
was another UFO nut.

321
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,671
Somebody gave him a
satellite picture

322
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,474
of the landing area.

323
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:38,179
In '83 he went up
there with me

324
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,148
and the chief of police for
the Jicarilla Apache tribe.

325
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
They had made a landing pad

326
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:44,585
and he took us
right to the spot.

327
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:49,723
They were giving
him disinformation,

328
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,059
some of it was true,
some of it wasn't, see.

329
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,228
I think that was the
biggest problem he had,

330
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,232
coping with, why this,
why not the other thing?

331
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,468
He thought that
this was the place

332
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,770
where the aliens were
getting together

333
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:07,208
to take over the world
and he wanted to trap

334
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,510
them all there, kill them
all in one fell swoop

335
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,978
and save the Earth.

336
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,518
By the mid eighties he
was getting to the point

337
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,487
where he had written
all of these

338
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,457
letters to congressmen,
senators, TV stations,

339
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,726
even President Reagan
saying this is what's

340
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,795
going on, the Air Force
is cooperating with me,

341
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,530
these are the people
who are cooperating

342
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,699
with me and giving
me this information,

343
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,667
Earnest Edwards,
Richard Doty, all this,

344
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,536
he would put their
names in these letters.

345
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,505
He'd get answers back saying

346
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,140
"We're not interested
in the UFO subject,"

347
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,509
and there was this kind of
cognitive dissonance,

348
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,877
here are people in the
government telling him

349
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,045
"Yes, you're right,
this is going on,

350
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,213
let's keep an eye on it."

351
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,616
And then elected
officials and other people

352
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:49,950
in the media saying,

353
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,118
"We don't know what
you're talking about,

354
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,087
this isn't very important."

355
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,089
And nobody seemed to
care what he was talking about

356
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,557
except the Air Force.

357
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,531
So many people knew
ultimately about

358
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,800
Paul Bennewitz and that
sad, strange,

359
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:12,907
horrible story that it got
way out of the realm

360
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,177
of just a cute
flying saucer story.

361
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,012
Paul was convinced
that everything

362
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,947
he was doing was UFO related.

363
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,950
I actually sat down
with Paul and told Paul,

364
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,987
"Listen Paul, I think you
ought to stop doing this.

365
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,056
I think you've gone
as far as you can go,

366
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,626
and this is a friend, this
is Richard Doty a friend."

367
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,528
It wasn't Richard
Doty a Special Agent

368
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,130
with OSI talking to him, I said

369
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,765
"This is a friend
talking to you, Paul."

370
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,099
Because I became a
friend with him,

371
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,035
he was a very wonderful person

372
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,571
and I didn't want to see
him harmed and I said

373
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:46,440
"Paul, stop it!
Listen to your son,

374
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,142
listen to your wife, end it.

375
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:49,677
Get rid of the equipment,

376
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,513
lock this stuff
away, go on with your life,

377
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:56,217
go back to your
work at your business

378
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,719
and stop this".

379
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,755
Paul listened to me and
I thought maybe he was

380
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,758
going to take my
advice, but he didn't.

381
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,961
He continued and continued
and continued

382
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,730
and at that point we ended
the investigation,

383
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,967
we ended every
involvement with Paul Bennewitz.

384
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,937
(Greg Bishop) By 1988
things were so bad that

385
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,641
his family decided to
take him to a psychiatric

386
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,646
facility and see if they
could try and save his life.

387
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,616
He said that aliens would
come at night through

388
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,484
his wall and inject
him with something

389
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,086
that would make him get
in his car and drive out

390
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:33,954
into the desert and
he didn't remember

391
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,756
what he was doing
or why he went.

392
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:36,991
The scary thing was
there actually were

393
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:42,763
injection marks on his arm.

394
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,766
(distorted voice) This is a
friend talking to you...

395
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,539
Years later, I sat
down with Paul,

396
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:56,810
at dinner and told Paul,
exactly, that everything we did

397
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:59,613
was a sanctioned counter
intelligence operation

398
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,815
to convince him that
what he was seeing

399
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,552
was UFOs and that what
we didn't want him

400
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,588
to know was that he had
tapped into something

401
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,291
on the base, and
we didn't want him

402
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,559
to ever disclose that.

403
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,861
Paul looked at me and said,

404
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,262
"You don't have to
lie to me, Rick,

405
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,897
I know it UFOs related".

406
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,279
If it hadn't been for Paul
Bennewitz I would have

407
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:31,253
never known 70% of the
stuff that was going on.

408
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,488
(Greg Bishop) What kind of
stuff did you find that

409
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,555
would make you think
that there was

410
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:35,991
something underground there?

411
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,926
(Gabe Valdez )
Well, the entrance to...

412
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,530
(Greg Bishop)
A big enough entrance to get

413
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,899
a truck or a plane or
something through?

414
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,134
(Gabe Valdez) Yes.
(Greg Bishop) You saw this?

415
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:46,935
(Gabe Valdez) Uh-hum.

416
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,638
(Greg Bishop) But it wasn't
where Paul said it was?

417
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,507
(Gabe Valdez) No.

418
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,514
Well, the first case of
the cattle mutilation in Dulce,

419
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,617
it was June 14th 1974.

420
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,992
People do kill animals
and steal the meat,

421
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,127
and it's different,
it was different.

422
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,530
Why did they just
take the udder,

423
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:17,032
the lymph nodes and the tongue

424
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:20,402
at the base of the
throat with the tonsils?

425
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:24,006
And we're finding the
evidence at the mutilations,

426
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,408
gas masks that were
made by the military,

427
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,644
radar chaff,
and the tranquillizers

428
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,512
they were using -- atropine,

429
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:33,182
they were injecting
them with atropine.

430
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:36,151
I was up front
with the ranchers,

431
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:42,024
they were losing cattle and
nobody was compensating them.

432
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,093
I wasn't hiding
anything, I never did.

433
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,934
I'm established as
somebody who is doing

434
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,236
all of this news
and documentary.

435
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:58,073
So I start getting
newspapers, people are saying,

436
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,975
"Linda, what is the answer?"

437
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:02,277
Ok, this is what I'm
going to do next.

438
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:04,012
I'm going to get to the bottom

439
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,549
of this animal
mutilation mystery.

440
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:11,487
And finally in October
of '79 Lou Girodo,

441
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,956
who was the head of
the district attorneys office

442
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,925
in Trinidad says,
with our cameras running,

443
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:20,229
finally, "Well,
investigators and I

444
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,231
have come to the conclusion
we're dealing with creatures

445
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,433
not from this planet,"
is the way he put it,

446
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:29,004
which is in my film,
A Strange Harvest.

447
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:32,207
And said all the reasons why,

448
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,344
the orange light that
he and a deputy had seen

449
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:41,550
go into the ground,
come out, split in two,

450
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:46,121
in pastures where they had
mutilated animals.

451
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:48,023
(Gabe Valdez)
We did follow one
and it stayed there,

452
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,491
it was hovering on
top of the cattle,

453
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:51,326
Manuel Gomez's cattle,

454
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,428
and when I was going to try and
intercept it myself

455
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:55,664
it flew over me.

456
00:22:55,766 --> 00:23:00,035
But this looked like a
saucer type, yeah, aircraft.

457
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,436
(Greg Bishop) Ah ha.

458
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,338
(Gabe Valdez) You could
see lights in it blinking.

459
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,274
Why do they put lights if
they're from outer space?

460
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,075
They don't need any
guidance with lights!

461
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,548
I was an analyst in the
agency responsible

462
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,050
for chemical weapons
analysis

463
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,985
so the embassy would
always give me

464
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,221
a security escort and bodyguard.

465
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:21,156
Special Forces guy
came, and I said,

466
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:23,625
"Hey, what do you know about
these crazy stories

467
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:29,331
about the helicopters that
are taking mutilated cattle?"

468
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,134
"Oh," he says, "my real job,

469
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:37,072
I'm in a special
group in New Mexico.

470
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:41,543
We've been doing something that
is really, really interesting."

471
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:43,545
He said, "It just blows my mind,

472
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:47,883
I just...we got these
helicopters that I'm flying."

473
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,519
He says, "These helicopters
are all fixed up.

474
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,920
First of all they got
no markings on 'em.

475
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,022
Second of all
they're really fast.

476
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:57,492
Third, they're really quiet,
and they got a lot of lights.

477
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,261
We got red lights,
we got white lights,

478
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:00,929
we got strobe lights."

479
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:02,631
I said, "What are
you talking about?"

480
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,970
He says, "We pretend
we're UFO's."

481
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,006
What the hell is that?

482
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,144
(Greg Bishop) Do you know
anything about this?

483
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,480
Where did all that
information come from?

484
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,948
Why do you listen to
those people, they lie?

485
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,351
It's like, yes but they talk.

486
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:25,220
And if they talk, once in
a while you're gonna get

487
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,522
a piece of something
in that huge pile of crap

488
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,625
that will actually
connect to what you want,

489
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,994
and if you don't
let them take you somewhere

490
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,528
like they did with Paul,

491
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:36,265
kind of keep an even keel,
I think you're ok.

492
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,867
You just have to listen,
that's the thing.

493
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:41,203
(Man at conference)
So are you saying
the Dulce base,

494
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,139
or the Dulce architecture,

495
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:47,476
let's call it, ah,
exists or doesn't exist?

496
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,878
Have you investigated
the RAND Corporation's

497
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,514
involvement in
tunneling in that area

498
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,016
in the 50's and 60's?
(Greg Bishop) Oh yeah, yeah,

499
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,051
I actually put some
of that in the book...

500
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:58,153
(Man at conference)
...nuclear waste facility
there...

501
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:00,489
(Greg Bishop)
Not waste, but they
exploded an atomic bomb

502
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,424
underneath
about ten miles from Dulce

503
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,326
to try and get
gas out of the ground.

504
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:06,161
Stupidest idea! They
couldn't use the gas

505
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:08,897
'cause it was radioactive.

506
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,999
(ARCHIVE) New programs
of the Atomic Energy Commission

507
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:13,201
and other
agencies are designed

508
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,238
to expand the usefulness
of nuclear energy.

509
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,874
Before work is begun on
any of these programs.

510
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,943
The government thoroughly
evaluates the health

511
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:24,513
and safety factors,
often for several years.

512
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:30,185
Project Gasbuggy was
an underground nuclear

513
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:33,255
detonation that
took place in 1967

514
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:36,224
in Dulce, New Mexico.

515
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,627
It was an attempt to release
natural gas reserves

516
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,496
from the subterranean
environment

517
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:43,965
in a sort of early version
of what we would

518
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:49,871
now recognize as fracking.

519
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:52,174
Some people have
suggested that the cattle

520
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,976
mutilation program
was actually a covert

521
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,914
monitoring program for
assessing the radiation

522
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,316
leakage levels into
the environment,

523
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:04,019
into the ecosystem and
into the food chain.

524
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,028
(Gabe Valdez)
Senator Harrison Schmitt

525
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,131
had a conference here in
1980, 'cause the ranchers

526
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:18,433
were asking for help,

527
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,236
and I met Paul Bennewitz there.

528
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:25,407
He was taking a bunch of
pictures of the aircraft

529
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,309
coming out of the
Kirkland area,

530
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,177
but we were watching
the same aircraft

531
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,213
flying in the Dulce area, see.

532
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:33,014
Everybody's looking at these
sophisticated aircraft

533
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,850
and kind of saying,

534
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:36,151
"Well, they're the
one's that are

535
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,586
mutilating the cattle."

536
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,026
One agency was doing
the cattle mutilations,

537
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,095
but the people that
were doing the research

538
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:50,866
on the aircraft used the
cattle mutilations to test

539
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:53,468
their aircraft so that
people think it was UFO's...

540
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,338
and it helped the cattle
mutilation thing, see!

541
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,473
It's a wonder they didn't crash
into each other, you know!

542
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,287
(Linda Howe) Doty and
others would probably

543
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,856
defend their
counter-intelligence efforts

544
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,426
as being patriotic.

545
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:13,930
They are carrying out
work assigned by people

546
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,099
who have decided
that there must be

547
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,935
a policy of denial in the
interests of national security.

548
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,175
They're working
for my government.

549
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,846
They're working in
agencies of the government

550
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,515
that is supposed
to be protecting

551
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,852
of the people by the
people for the people.

552
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:41,024
How did it all
turn upside down?

553
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,240
(Tracy Tormé) At the core
there is something

554
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,309
that they want to keep
people away from.

555
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,577
A real truth.

556
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,916
I'm Richard Doty.

557
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,953
I'm here at the UFO
Congress at Laughlin, Nevada,

558
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,022
as a private citizen,

559
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,523
just enjoying the
sights and sounds.

560
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,264
Disinformation is
designed to appeal

561
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,933
to the person that
it's operating on.

562
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,370
The more dramatic you
can be appealing to that

563
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,606
prejudice, the better
you're gonna get

564
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,108
your hooks into the person
you're trying to get.

565
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,977
In Paul Bennewitz's case,
he was taking about

566
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,313
UFOs and so if the Air Force
wanted his full

567
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,183
and undivided attention, they
would talk UFOs with him

568
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,852
which is exactly
what they did.

569
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,055
It became seen as
necessary to create

570
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,858
an active disinformation
program in the late

571
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,061
1970's and early 1980's

572
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,197
and the reason for this
is twofold.

573
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,834
One was the American
Freedom of Information Act.

574
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,669
(Archive Voice)
"It's curtain time.

575
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,105
An ingenious printing
element that works faster

576
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,275
than the eye can see.
Watch it in action."

577
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,743
(Richard Dolan)
Thousands of pages of documents

578
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,312
were released from places
like the CIA, the FBI,

579
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,047
all the
military agencies.

580
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,918
Documents proving the
lie that agencies

581
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,420
across the board were
interested and were tracking

582
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,022
the UFO phenomenon.

583
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,827
During the late 1970's

584
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,162
a variety of leaks
started to occur.

585
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,764
Now they're just
stories right?

586
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,800
But the problem is
there were many of them

587
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,104
and they seemed to have
a coherence about them.

588
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,078
Researchers at the time were
in a very optimistic mode.

589
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,781
I wouldn't say there
were giddy so much

590
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,385
as just hopeful, that if
they got the right leak,

591
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:53,356
or the right document,
that they just might be able

592
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,759
to smash the
wall of secrecy.

593
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,628
Then what happens?

594
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,865
Then we get entrants into
the field by individuals

595
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:06,169
who start leaking
documents of dubious origin

596
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,738
whose provenance
was basically unknown,

597
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,741
that caused now twenty
five year's

598
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,310
worth of dissension
in the research field.

599
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,413
And it's the same within
the mainstream media.

600
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:21,184
Serious media never in
their news coverage

601
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,388
truly, seriously promoted the
extraterrestrial hypothesis,

602
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,158
what they
did do was move that

603
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,426
to the realm of entertainment.

604
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,665
Any time someone
brings such ideas up seriously,

605
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,600
what you find is the serious
media says well,

606
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,903
you've been watching
too many movies.

607
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,971
So in a sense you could
argue that the movies

608
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:48,978
are used to inoculate the
public against these truths.

609
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,183
So these demonstrably
false UFO stories

610
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:57,620
become inoculations.

611
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,223
When the doctor inoculates
you from a disease,

612
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,292
he gives you a little
bit of it,

613
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,228
and then your body's immune
system recovers,

614
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,998
deals with it and now you're
kind of immune to it.

615
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,905
(George Hansen off camera)
Look at the UFO conferences,

616
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,273
where are they held?

617
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,844
Usually in small dingy
hotels with rather limited

618
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,247
numbers of people participating.

619
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,215
(James Carrion off camera)
I mean there has to be

620
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,749
a reason why
it's perpetuating.

621
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,184
You don't see conferences
on leprechauns,

622
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:36,159
so why do we still have
conferences on UFOs?

623
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,094
James Carrion (off camera)
One of the keys to a
disinformation campaign

624
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,929
is to have a feedback loop,

625
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,098
and you need people
on the inside to feed back

626
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,067
to you the results
of the operation.

627
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:55,111
Probably Doty's first
success in rounding up

628
00:31:55,213 --> 00:32:01,050
a useful asset as they say in
the intelligence field,

629
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,922
or a useful idiot as they also
say in the intelligence field,

630
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,660
was his recruitment of a
man named William Moore.

631
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,130
Now William Moore I think
very significantly was

632
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,201
the co-author of the
first book about Roswell.

633
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,937
(Rick Doty) I was given
the task of making contact

634
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,306
with Bill Moore
and basically finding out

635
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,775
what he knew and who he knew.

636
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,720
Bill was a little reluctant
to disclose everything to me,

637
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,255
for obvious reasons.

638
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,957
Here I am a government
agent coming in

639
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,793
and introducing myself and
wanting to know what he knew.

640
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,696
But there's techniques
that we use,

641
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,065
that we're trained
to use in gaining

642
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,767
that person's confidence,

643
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,935
and I used those techniques
against Bill Moore

644
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,172
and they worked and Bill Moore
took me into his confidence

645
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,709
and we had a professional
relationship as far as him

646
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:06,182
providing us information about
the UFO community and agreeing

647
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,820
to say things we wanted said
regarding the UFO community

648
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,388
or within the UFO community.

649
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,391
The process of studying
this phenomena

650
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,226
and the people involved with it,

651
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:21,631
of assessing the claims
and the counter-claims,

652
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,867
and of dealing with the question

653
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,769
of how we as
Earthlings will react to

654
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,205
the discovery of a race of
extraterrestrial visitors

655
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,942
and how they will react to
us, all of this and more

656
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,279
when finally looked at
in perspective leads

657
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,715
us to the inescapable
recognition that in studying

658
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,884
the UFO phenomenon we
are at the same time

659
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,720
becoming more
aware of ourselves

660
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,588
as individuals.

661
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,824
(Robert Durant)
Moore was singled out

662
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:52,595
because he had
achieved considerable

663
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:57,734
celebrity within the
UFO field and a certain

664
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,903
authenticity that
would recommend him to

665
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,907
politicians and journalists,
and remember

666
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,009
it's the politicians and the
journalists who are

667
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,046
the ultimate target of all
of this disinformation.

668
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,051
I went to visit Bill, he
had a bad back,

669
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,186
he was lying flat on his back,
he couldn't move,

670
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,956
he was in traction and I
remember him very dramatically

671
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,693
saying to me, "Aliens do
exist, UFO's are real,

672
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,729
I know that now for a fact."

673
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,131
Just seems kind of
almost like a bad

674
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,800
science fiction movie,
but that's kind of

675
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,235
what was going on at the time.

676
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,005
He was invested in
maintaining these contacts

677
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,876
that he had supposedly
inside the government.

678
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,779
At one point Bill
Moore had played me

679
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,815
an early tape recording
of a conversation he had

680
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,650
with Doty, and Moore was
telling me, you know,

681
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,720
this is a huge breakthrough,
and this guy is like

682
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,256
on the inside and he's gonna
give a lot of stuff away.

683
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,159
I just remember even
back then that I was

684
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,895
kind of suspicious that
it sounded a little too

685
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,998
good to be true, but I
was kind of curious as to

686
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,800
why somebody who
supposedly was in

687
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:07,804
Air Force intelligence
was speaking so openly

688
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,823
about some of these
incredible things.

689
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:13,668
(Robert Durant)
William Moore was
using his position

690
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,804
as an executive
of an outfit that was called

691
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,774
the Aerial Phenomena
Research Organization.

692
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:23,878
And in fact Moore admitted
that he paid off the secretary

693
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,015
of that organization
to send him reports

694
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:29,284
at once when they came in

695
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,619
and they went directly to Doty.

696
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:33,021
Bill didn't believe
everything I was telling him

697
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:36,024
and obviously he's
a very smart person

698
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:38,726
and a lot of the information
I was telling him

699
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:40,595
wasn't factual.

700
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:42,530
If you were a UFO
researcher and you were offered

701
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:45,099
documents that
nobody had ever seen,

702
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,635
that pointed the way
to what the government

703
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:50,772
might know about UFO's
and in exchange you

704
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:53,708
basically had to report
on what people were thinking,

705
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,177
what rumors
were making the rounds,

706
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,112
that's what he was
offered and in exchange

707
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:00,048
he was offered something
that nobody else had

708
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,716
gotten up to that point,

709
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:03,785
pure unadulterated
information

710
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:07,889
that would lead him to
the center of the answer,

711
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,824
the answer to the
question, you know,

712
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,526
what does the government know

713
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,797
and are there actually some
sort of non-human intelligences

714
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:18,800
interacting with the human race?

715
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:23,671
(Robert Durant)
Moore later was
part of the series

716
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,708
of break-ins into
the Bennewitz house,

717
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,111
and the psychological
warfare program.

718
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:32,246
Again, self-admitted by Moore.

719
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,551
Moore was not working alone.

720
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:42,223
Others, I'm convinced
went for the same deal,

721
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,926
and the deal was very simple.

722
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:49,097
You cooperate with us,
and, we will give you

723
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,799
the information that
the U.S. government has

724
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:55,136
deep down in those vaults.

725
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:58,773
Now, this is the
Faustian bargain

726
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:03,277
that William Moore went for
and he came up short on it.

727
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:12,186
It became apparent to
me that my supplying

728
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:15,690
information to the
government through Doty

729
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:21,596
on the activities of
Paul Bennewitz, APRO,

730
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,532
and to a lesser extent,
several other individuals

731
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:27,735
was to be a
part of this equation.

732
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:31,072
I also discovered that
whatever it was that

733
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,941
Bennewitz was involved
with, he was the

734
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,177
subject of considerable
interest on the part of

735
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:39,814
not one but several
government agencies,

736
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:43,017
and that they were actively
trying to defuse him

737
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,186
by pumping as much
mis, dis-information

738
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:48,990
through him as he
could possibly absorb.

739
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:52,693
Being a very small part
of that process gave me

740
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:56,230
I thought something
of an advantage.

741
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:58,166
It became my intention
to play that advantage

742
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:01,069
for all the information
I could get out of it.

743
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:03,771
Bennewitz for his part...

744
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,612
Frankly I'm a
little ashamed of some

745
00:38:11,714 --> 00:38:13,714
people in this audience,
regardless of what you

746
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:16,918
believe what you hear or not.

747
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,052
(Greg Bishop) They had
to stop the talk about

748
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:19,954
4 or 5 times just because
of all the yelling.

749
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:22,190
People got mad ran out
of there, I saw a woman

750
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:24,358
start crying and leave,
people kept saying,

751
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:26,160
"Where'd you get all
that crap from, Bill?"

752
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,962
And one guy said, "I'm
gonna get a firehose!"

753
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,131
And ran out the back.
Very dramatic.

754
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:37,038
Bill's admission to
working with government agents

755
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,974
was the first
acknowledgement to the degree

756
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:43,644
which our government would
go in an attempt to keep

757
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:46,547
the cover-up going, and I
think people were angry,

758
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:49,217
maybe not so much at Bill,

759
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:52,286
but at themselves
for their own

760
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:55,022
naiveté as allowing
that to happen,

761
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,325
and refusing to
acknowledge that they

762
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:59,727
could have been just
as easily duped,

763
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:02,230
it's scary to think,
gee somebody I trusted

764
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:05,099
might be playing
me for the fool.

765
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,835
Bill Moore I think
probably believed

766
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,271
what he was preaching.

767
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:13,908
I think he was one of
these people that wanted

768
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,311
to believe that he was
one of the chosen few

769
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:20,081
to spread this information,

770
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:24,252
to be the Moses of
mythology, UFO mythology.

771
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,020
(Robert Durant)
Moore's book was well received

772
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,322
and in my opinion,
well done research,

773
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,592
but very troubling because
the thesis was

774
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:34,996
that Roswell was a real
spaceship that crashed

775
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:37,732
and that the U.S.
government has the parts.

776
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:43,704
I believe that he was
singled out precisely to

777
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:47,241
ultimately discredit him
and Roswell,

778
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:51,279
to keep the press and the
politicians off of Roswell.

779
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:54,615
(ARCHIVE) July 8th 1947.

780
00:39:54,717 --> 00:39:58,019
The Army air forces has
announced that a flying
disk has been found

781
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,555
and is now in the
possession of the Army.

782
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:02,623
Army officers say the
missile found sometime

783
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,126
last week has been
inspected at Roswell,

784
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,662
New Mexico and sent
to Wright Field, Ohio

785
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:10,231
for further inspection.

786
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,600
(Mark Pilkington)
The key thing to remember

787
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,304
about the alleged crash
of a UFO at Roswell

788
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:20,107
in 1947 is that by the
time of Paul Bennewitz's

789
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,679
involvement in the UFO
field it had been entirely

790
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:28,015
forgotten by the UFO
community, and it was only

791
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:29,850
with the publication in 1980

792
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:32,086
of the Roswell Incident
by William Moore

793
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:34,689
and Charles Berlitz
that the elements

794
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,858
of the Roswell story,
the crashed spacecraft,

795
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:41,095
the recovered alien
bodies, the pact between

796
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:43,231
the American government
and the extraterrestrials

797
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,800
to back engineer
their technology.

798
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,704
All of these things have
eventually become the core story

799
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:52,006
of the American UFO mythology.

800
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:58,980
Their craft crashed
somewhere after coming all

801
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,115
these 50 light
years, they crashed

802
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:03,251
and then they sent
another one that crashed again,

803
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:04,785
and sent another
one that crashed.

804
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,854
About nine crashes
in the Southwest

805
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:10,958
in the late 40's and
that would indicate

806
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,228
to me or at least suggest
to me that we were

807
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,963
testing something
that was crashing.

808
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,170
Roswell happened.

809
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,806
Two crashes, one in
Roswell and one west.

810
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,209
They didn't find the craft
for a couple of years,

811
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,711
it was all one crash
but it took them

812
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:32,780
a couple of years to find
the second crash site.

813
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:35,216
(Conference voice)
Things are getting weird, man.

814
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,553
Now Doty played a
massive role

815
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:43,557
in the perpetuation
of the Roswell myth,

816
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,595
many of the ideas prominent
in the UFO subculture

817
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:52,867
for two decades and it was
completely avoided.

818
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:58,706
Rick Doty is certainly
a fascinating character

819
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,208
and clearly a trickster.

820
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,145
(Robert Durant) A man
who probably has trouble

821
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:08,049
figuring out whether he's
lying or not these days.

822
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,283
(George Hansen)
It would not surprise me

823
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:13,087
if people were selected
to sow disinformation.

824
00:42:13,189 --> 00:42:15,990
It would also not surprise
me if some of the people

825
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,893
were selected because
they were not very bright,

826
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,228
they lacked
certain critical judgement

827
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,331
but were very
energetic in putting

828
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:27,668
out certain messages,
and I do often think

829
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,638
that some of the people
in the government agencies

830
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,240
who have been involved
in the UFO field

831
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,677
were kind of pushed or
nudged in that direction.

832
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:37,978
They'd just go
into the field

833
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:40,848
and muck it up automatically
by themselves

834
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,718
without any external controls.

835
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:50,124
Rick is not the
man you're after,

836
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:53,294
it's the person in the control
position that's important here.

837
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:55,763
In my opinion he was
just simply a pawn

838
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,065
in a much larger game.

839
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,768
Just as I was.

840
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,305
What we are hearing
today about malevolent aliens,

841
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:08,209
underground bases, secret
treaties with the US government,

842
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:11,412
has its roots firmly planted
in the Bennewitz affair.

843
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,919
The entire story of a
secret treaty between

844
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:20,855
the US government
and the aliens,

845
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:25,259
of exchanges of technology
between us and the aliens,

846
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:29,263
of battles between the aliens
and American armed forces,

847
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:32,800
and of aliens allegedly having
implanted hundreds of thousands,

848
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,668
if not millions, of human beings

849
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:37,238
for the purpose of
taking over the world,

850
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,775
and using us as
cattle, or slaves,

851
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:46,147
came about as a result of
the disinformation process.

852
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:50,785
I know, because I was in
a position to observe

853
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:53,220
much of this process
as it unfolded,

854
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:57,992
and I was providing regular
reports on its effectiveness

855
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,796
to some of the very people
who were doing it to Paul.

856
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:03,864
It wasn't a whole
lot that we did.

857
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:06,534
It was just a simple,
really, really, simple,

858
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:09,603
nod and statement to
Paul that what

859
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:11,806
he was seeing was probably UFOs.

860
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:21,097
It's generally assumed that the
counter intelligence operation

861
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,200
conducted against
Paul Bennewitz was designed

862
00:44:24,302 --> 00:44:26,402
to throw him off the
scent of some kind of

863
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,504
classified experimental
technology

864
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:32,976
that he was accidentally
filming over Kirtland AFB,

865
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:35,211
but when you stop
to think about it

866
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:38,248
this doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

867
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,384
If the Kirtland base
personnel really had wanted

868
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:43,820
him to stop his
investigations

869
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:45,521
they could have ordered
him to do so,

870
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:48,791
instead they encouraged
him to continue his

871
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,928
research and indeed
facilitated his

872
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,332
growing delusions about an
extraterrestrial invasion.

873
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:59,769
What this suggests is
that rather than a

874
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:03,339
campaign directed against
Paul Bennewitz,

875
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:08,945
this was an information war on
the American UFO community.

876
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:10,980
And there are a
number of reasons why

877
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:14,083
Air Force Intelligence
might have wanted to use

878
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:17,120
Bennewitz as a conduit
for disinformation.

879
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:20,490
The UFOlogists were
constantly seeking evidence

880
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:25,495
for the extraterrestrial
conspiracy and the UFO cover-up.

881
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,830
They were digging
through documents,

882
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,565
they were hanging
around secret air bases

883
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:34,137
and quite likely stumbling
upon genuine military secrets.

884
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,508
And a more serious possibility
is that Soviet intelligence

885
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,278
agents may have been
infiltrating the UFO field

886
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,215
in order to extract
this kind of information

887
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:48,084
about new technologies.

888
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,919
I think it's no coincidence
that the timing

889
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:52,088
of the operation
against Paul Bennewitz

890
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,224
dovetails with the development
of the Stealth program,

891
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,195
and at the time this was the
absolute pinnacle of

892
00:45:59,297 --> 00:46:03,833
global aviation technology and
that's exactly the sort of thing

893
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:07,270
that Soviet agents would
be looking for.

894
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:12,208
If you guys are
doing a film... I...

895
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,513
I do not want to do an
interview in a film

896
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:20,883
in which you're going
to try to communicate

897
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,153
that there's nothing to UFOs,

898
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,423
that advance technologies
are being used to cover...

899
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:29,892
I mean... (Mark Pilkington
off camera) No. No.

900
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,362
That's not what it is.

901
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:34,897
(Linda Howe) It's just playing
into the government's...

902
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,933
absolutely what
they want people to do...

903
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:39,335
(John L. and Mark P. off camera)
That's absolutely not
what we're doing.

904
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:41,871
(Greg Bishop )
People trying to put out

905
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,339
documentaries about
UFOs seemed to be

906
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:46,109
teased over and over
and have the rug pulled

907
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:47,844
out from under them
at the last minute.

908
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:53,182
In the late '70s a rumor
started circulating

909
00:46:53,284 --> 00:46:57,053
that there was a film of
a UFO landing at

910
00:46:57,155 --> 00:47:00,056
Holloman Air Force
Base, in New Mexico.

911
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:03,092
And apparently a UFO came and
landed at the Air Force base,

912
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:06,329
on the tarmac, a group of
people went up to meet him,

913
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,398
there was a sort of
exchange of information

914
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,301
then the alien got back in
his ship and took off.

915
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:14,771
(Richard Dolan)
I have wondered,

916
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:19,108
that that film - I think as
many people have wondered -

917
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,411
was an abortive attempt at
some kind of disclosure.

918
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,052
We began with an
invitation and met with

919
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:33,056
Paul Shardle, who was head of
security for the Depository,

920
00:47:33,158 --> 00:47:36,225
where all the films by the
military are sent,

921
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:38,861
all out at Norton.

922
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:41,330
We talked about possible
programs such as

923
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,100
three-dimensional
moving holography,

924
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:46,803
atomic fission, a dog
program where they

925
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,806
trained Shepherds to
do reconnaissance,

926
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,944
and a lot of laser work
at Wright Patterson.

927
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,213
Then he said, "I want
you to come with me

928
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:58,514
into this studio."

929
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:01,417
We went into a studio,
which was a clean room.

930
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,253
He said, "What would you
think if we told you

931
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:07,824
that in the early '70s
there was a landing

932
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,359
of an alien craft at
Holloman Air Force Base,

933
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:14,464
and our TDY, temporary
duty guys, had filmed it?"

934
00:48:14,566 --> 00:48:17,300
And I was just
sort of scratching my head

935
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:19,469
thinking, UFOS?!

936
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:22,038
What are we talking about?

937
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,340
So he said, "Look, if
you're interested,

938
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:26,576
you should bury that under
the other projects,

939
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:29,512
because UFO sends
up a red flag."

940
00:48:29,614 --> 00:48:33,316
He said,"If you're interested,
go talk to Captain somebody,

941
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:36,319
and he'll start a liaison
with the Pentagon."

942
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:38,054
Which we did.

943
00:48:38,156 --> 00:48:41,791
I was told that
there was footage

944
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:43,826
and that was sort
of like a carrot.

945
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:45,862
Where you'll be
provided with a film

946
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,899
that we have, 900
feet of Ektachrome,

947
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:55,138
and off we began our project.

948
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:03,312
We had a legal contract
with the Pentagon

949
00:49:03,414 --> 00:49:05,915
and an agreement on
everything that we were

950
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:08,518
going to be doing and their
total cooperation.

951
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,455
They fulfilled every
one of our requests,

952
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:17,026
they vetted our information,
gave sanction to it,

953
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:20,830
they really did not influence
the content at all.

954
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:23,232
I was quite surprised.

955
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:26,302
Even the people at
Holloman did not say,

956
00:49:26,404 --> 00:49:28,171
"What are you doing? What
are you talking about?"

957
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:30,773
They seemed to confirm that
something had happened.

958
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:35,478
And the film was
not forthcoming,

959
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,780
but I knew where it was
and what it was

960
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,383
and was told by one of the
people we worked with

961
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:43,786
that it was confiscated
at the last minute

962
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,922
because it didn't
seem appropriate.

963
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,225
So we ended up having
to go to animation.

964
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,994
But everything else
was documented

965
00:49:52,096 --> 00:49:54,263
as I recall it happening.

966
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:59,368
It was a daylight shot
of a light ascending

967
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,471
on Holloman Air Force Base.

968
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:06,976
And with that little clip,
that's all I can tell you,

969
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:09,111
that it's genuine.

970
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,846
A landing of a craft
at Holloman...

971
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:15,184
it was... film... very
brief... that's all...

972
00:50:15,286 --> 00:50:18,955
you know... I can tell
you it's genuine...

973
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,257
(Mark P) Just that
snippet that you saw?

974
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,461
Just a light coming
down from above...

975
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:28,931
it was really not
that distinguishable

976
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:32,435
it was just among
other footage,

977
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:35,371
that's all I can tell you...

978
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:37,173
(Mark P) And just to
say on camera that you

979
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:39,809
never saw the Holloman
landing footage?

980
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,811
Not really...

981
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,880
(Mark P) Oh... OK!
Can you elaborate?

982
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,450
(sound recordist off-camera)
Can we just wait for that car?

983
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:51,287
Saved by the car.

984
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:53,823
I'm trying to think
how to answer that.

985
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,226
I knew what the film was
about, all the details of it.

986
00:50:57,328 --> 00:51:02,265
But I never saw a real
projected version.

987
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:03,966
(Mark P off-camera)
You saw a still of it?

988
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:05,167
Yes.

989
00:51:18,016 --> 00:51:19,148
(Linda Howe)
What is your bottom line?

990
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,416
Beginning, middle and end?

991
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,417
(Mark P off-camera)
Our bottom line is that

992
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,953
there is a UFO
phenomenon that's

993
00:51:24,055 --> 00:51:27,390
genuine and needs to be
studied, and seriously,

994
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:29,825
and one of the things
that makes that

995
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:32,895
difficult is the muddying
of the waters by

996
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:35,931
people like Rick Doty,
Walter Bosely

997
00:51:36,034 --> 00:51:40,503
and others who are
working for OSI, FBI,

998
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:42,271
who ever else
they're working for,

999
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:47,043
CIA, NSA, and they are
making the work of

1000
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,312
people like yourself,
and us, and others

1001
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:51,914
who want to understand
what's really going on

1002
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:54,733
very, very difficult.

1003
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:57,987
OK, and thank you
for your attention.

1004
00:51:58,089 --> 00:51:59,589
We're ready to roll
here just momentarily.

1005
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:00,990
(Chris Green off-camera)
If you believe that it's true

1006
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,226
then you have to buy in

1007
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:08,331
to this phantasmagorical,
conspiratorial, bizarre,

1008
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:13,069
nonsensical,
ridiculous story,

1009
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:17,507
and when I've sat down with
Rick, his response to me is,

1010
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:20,677
you know, it's
really all true.

1011
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:23,079
(Bill Ryan off-camera)
Rick's great strength is

1012
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,614
that he's a wonderful
storyteller.

1013
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,316
He's a very friendly guy,

1014
00:52:26,418 --> 00:52:28,284
he builds relationships easily.

1015
00:52:28,386 --> 00:52:30,420
My immediate instinct
is to trust him.

1016
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:39,495
(Tracy Tormé off camera)
I think it's very easy

1017
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:42,198
to mislead people in
the UFO community.

1018
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,634
You get them going
down a certain trail..

1019
00:52:44,736 --> 00:52:47,971
you give them certain
leads and you just

1020
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,973
watch people chase
their tails over

1021
00:52:50,075 --> 00:52:54,244
and over again,
looking for the truth.

1022
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:56,312
I was living and working
in New York when

1023
00:52:56,414 --> 00:52:58,882
Linda Howe actually came
to stay with me for a few days

1024
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:04,254
and it was right in the midst of
her working on this HBO project.

1025
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:06,222
Linda was sort of, I
believe, on the track

1026
00:53:06,324 --> 00:53:09,359
at the time, of thinking
that this was the film

1027
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:12,462
that was gonna
again, expose everything,

1028
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,265
and I believe she was
in touch with Doty at the time,

1029
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,635
in fact I think she had even
gone to see him face to face.

1030
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,137
And that was very
curious to me because

1031
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,640
I'd known about this guy
through Bill, you know,

1032
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,643
Bill Moore, and
I thought, hmm,

1033
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,379
now he's sort of hooking
Linda in the same way.

1034
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:35,251
Doty said that he has names
of people who are witnesses.

1035
00:53:35,353 --> 00:53:37,987
A security guard has a gun

1036
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,891
melted in his hand,
there's a disc, beings.

1037
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:45,161
I want to investigate
that story.

1038
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,964
The original plan
with Linda Howe

1039
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,465
was to obtain
everything she knew,

1040
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,234
as much
information as she knew,

1041
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:54,337
and to find out what
she was going to air

1042
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,940
in this documentary for HBO,

1043
00:53:57,042 --> 00:54:00,076
and whether we wanted
it aired or not.

1044
00:54:00,178 --> 00:54:03,913
So I drove her out to
Kirtland, to the OSI office.

1045
00:54:04,015 --> 00:54:06,449
I took her into
a special room,

1046
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:08,284
I told her it was the
Commander's office,

1047
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:10,586
which wasn't really,
necessarily true...

1048
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:14,157
The first thing that
shifted this from what I

1049
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:16,159
thought was going to be
a five minute meeting -

1050
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,996
get these names,and addresses
and phone numbers and go on -

1051
00:54:20,098 --> 00:54:23,199
I had already set up
other things to do...

1052
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:29,939
"That documentary that you did
broadsided the government."

1053
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:34,877
"How do you mean?"

1054
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,482
"Nobody ever expected that
a credible journalist

1055
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:43,152
would ever take on the
animal mutilation story."

1056
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:47,256
It was like something was
shifting in the air...

1057
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,624
Where is this going?

1058
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:50,626
What is happening here?

1059
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:54,063
He never gave me a list
of names or phone numbers.

1060
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:58,234
Instead, he said,
"My superiors have asked me

1061
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,536
to show you something."

1062
00:55:00,638 --> 00:55:02,905
Pulled out this
manila envelope,

1063
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,574
pulled out these pages,

1064
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,243
and as he's handing
them to me, he says,

1065
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:12,582
"You can read these but
you cannot take notes.

1066
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,551
You can ask me questions,

1067
00:55:15,653 --> 00:55:17,053
but I want you to
move from that chair

1068
00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:19,922
you are sitting in
to that chair."

1069
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,491
Everything that was done
there was being filmed

1070
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:23,493
by other agents
in another room,

1071
00:55:23,595 --> 00:55:25,128
and there was a
two way mirror.

1072
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,132
And I'm looking at the top
page,and it's all caps.

1073
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:30,900
Briefing Paper
for the President

1074
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:32,468
of the United States of America

1075
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,505
on Unidentified
Aerial Vehicles.

1076
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:40,410
And I'm trying to
read what is the most

1077
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:45,214
remarkable series of
letters and words that

1078
00:55:45,316 --> 00:55:47,083
probably has ever been
handed to me,

1079
00:55:47,185 --> 00:55:50,420
because this was
new, I was innocent.

1080
00:55:50,522 --> 00:55:53,289
And it started out about
all of these places

1081
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,525
in the United States
that the government had

1082
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:58,394
retrieved discs that
were identified

1083
00:55:58,496 --> 00:56:00,296
as extraterrestrial.

1084
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:04,634
I knew some names,
like Roswell.

1085
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:09,338
There was Aztec, Magdalena,
south of Laredo,

1086
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:12,275
down in Arizona.

1087
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:18,081
There were... my mind
was kind of reeling

1088
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:20,616
at how many places
this is saying,

1089
00:56:20,718 --> 00:56:23,953
because all of us had only
heard of Roswell, really.

1090
00:56:24,055 --> 00:56:27,090
And eventually it came
to paragraphs that are

1091
00:56:27,192 --> 00:56:30,059
as indelibly emblazed
on my mind sitting

1092
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,229
here today as they were then.

1093
00:56:33,331 --> 00:56:41,904
And the one that is probably
worth sharing from all of this:

1094
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:45,475
"These extraterrestrials
manipulated DNA

1095
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:49,946
in already evolving primates
to create homo sapiens."

1096
00:56:50,048 --> 00:56:52,115
And I remember
reading that sentence

1097
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:54,951
over several times,
trying to absorb

1098
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:58,020
the implication of its meaning.

1099
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:04,460
Because if homo sapiens
is a genetically

1100
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:08,931
constructed species by
extraterrestrials,

1101
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:11,501
we are then, by definition,

1102
00:57:11,603 --> 00:57:15,338
a planet of six and a
half billion androids.

1103
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,544
If we are androids,
what purpose are we serving?

1104
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:26,382
All of that hit me,
reading that sentence.

1105
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:31,154
Then, on the last page:

1106
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:35,658
Paragraph, paragraph,
paragraph, paragraph.

1107
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,961
PROJECT GARNET, all caps.

1108
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:42,231
All questions and
mysteries about

1109
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,134
the evolution of homo
sapiens on this planet

1110
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:48,971
have been answered and
this project is closed.

1111
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:50,239
The documents
that I showed her

1112
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,676
came from our special
office in Washington,

1113
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:57,313
with the operational plan and
what I was supposed to do.

1114
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:00,183
And the plans to
show her these.

1115
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:03,386
And I'd read them, and
I knew what was in them,

1116
00:58:03,488 --> 00:58:06,122
and I realized that
some of the information

1117
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:08,157
contained in them was real.

1118
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:09,625
But then I realized
that you have to give

1119
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:11,093
real information in order

1120
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,929
for a person to think
you're credible.

1121
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,097
So I knew what was in there,

1122
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,266
and I gave them to her
and it was sanctioned.

1123
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,136
I did what I was told to do.

1124
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:21,971
When you look back at it,

1125
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:23,706
they must have had
meetings about,

1126
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:31,247
"How do we stop a persistent
and dogged reporter

1127
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:35,384
who has already demonstrated
that she's going to go after

1128
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:37,486
a really, really
difficult subject.

1129
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:41,090
How do we stop her?"

1130
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:47,063
When you look back,
it all makes sense.

1131
00:58:47,165 --> 00:58:50,199
She wanted me to
tell her things

1132
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:52,201
that I couldn't tell her,

1133
00:58:52,303 --> 00:58:55,371
and at one point she
went public with my name,

1134
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:59,942
and she did what Paul Bennewitz
and Bill Moore didn't do

1135
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:03,512
and she publicized the
fact that she was deceived

1136
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:08,184
by a government agency,
namely OSI

1137
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:10,286
and although there
were many other people

1138
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:11,520
involved with that operation,

1139
00:59:11,623 --> 00:59:13,089
she named my name,

1140
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:16,626
and so then I became
a public figure.

1141
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:19,128
We actually played
a trick on Linda that,

1142
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,598
er, kind of paid
her back so to speak.

1143
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,234
Not anything that
harmed her in any way,

1144
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:26,235
or anything like that.

1145
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:29,572
We kind of planted something

1146
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:32,642
that she ran with
which wasn't factual,

1147
00:59:32,744 --> 00:59:34,644
and I think she realized that

1148
00:59:34,746 --> 00:59:36,646
maybe she should keep her
mouth shut after that.

1149
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,612
(Mark P off-camera)
The forged documents

1150
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:45,947
shown to Linda Moulton Howe

1151
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,483
by Richard Doty would
form the basis

1152
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,418
for the Majestic 12 papers

1153
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,888
which expanded upon the story
of the Roswell UFO crash

1154
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,557
and provided the foundations
for the future

1155
00:59:56,659 --> 01:00:01,729
UFO mythology in America.

1156
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,564
And over three decades later,

1157
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,299
these documents
are still dividing

1158
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,034
the international
UFO community.

1159
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,276
Before it had always
been inferred

1160
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,412
that a cover-up was underway.

1161
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,549
There was talk about
who was involved and so forth,

1162
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,518
but there was never
any paperwork.

1163
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,886
Here's the paperwork.

1164
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:32,293
A package showed up at the
home of Jamie Shandera,

1165
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,563
who was Bill's sort of
writing and research partner.

1166
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,633
What it contained was a
canister of 35mm film.

1167
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,369
They developed it,
and what was on it was

1168
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,505
photographs of this
document, saying that there

1169
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,708
was a group that had been
controlling UFO information,

1170
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,544
how it was released in public

1171
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,945
and how the government
should deal with it.

1172
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,619
Regarding the MJ-12
documents that were released

1173
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,555
to Jamie Shandera
and Bill Moore,

1174
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,523
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

1175
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,492
The document could be real,

1176
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,395
and because of the nature of it,

1177
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,599
it made a perfect perception
management device.

1178
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,635
People have to realize
that these things

1179
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,805
may not be to cover up the
truth about flying saucers

1180
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:22,443
it may be more to
gather information

1181
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,514
about how the public
responds to manipulation.

1182
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:35,890
When I print off the sum total
of all those documents -

1183
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,392
you get a stack
about this thick.

1184
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:42,263
When you read them through,
as one day I decided

1185
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,965
this is what I am going to do,

1186
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,700
it's very impressive.

1187
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,470
To have faked it would
have required a team,

1188
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:53,541
a high level team, of very,
very expert individuals

1189
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,010
who know everything
about document creation,

1190
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,913
science and technology
in the 1940s and '50s

1191
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,548
and a whole bunch
of other things.

1192
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,751
I looked at them, and
initially I thought

1193
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,487
they were good
forgeries, but over time

1194
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:10,424
my opinion of their quality
has gone down hill.

1195
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:14,362
The use of a zero
in front of a date,

1196
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,964
the use of an extraneous comma,

1197
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,835
the obviously
photocopied signature...

1198
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,937
they just keep getting
worse and worse.

1199
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,374
If they were faked, the only
thing that one can say is,

1200
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:29,844
the UFO topic was
considered important enough

1201
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,581
by these people to create
the most elaborate,

1202
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:37,685
incredible, detailed
series of papers,

1203
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:41,322
and one would have to
ask, if they're faked,

1204
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,356
"Why?"

1205
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,397
There were some
investigations conducted by FBI,

1206
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:55,269
OSI, regarding
the MJ-12 documents,

1207
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:57,672
extensive investigations,
just to determine

1208
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,440
whether these things
were legitimate,

1209
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,610
whether they contained
classified information

1210
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:07,348
and then who released them.

1211
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:12,720
I was interviewed as a
suspect, did I do these?

1212
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,357
It was proven that
I didn't do 'em.

1213
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,393
But somebody outside the
government created it.

1214
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,995
And in that particular instance

1215
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,764
I don't know if the government
would prosecute them.

1216
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:27,635
Doing that would lend
credence to the document itself

1217
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,904
and then they would have to
disclose the information

1218
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,706
and so the best thing
to do is just say...

1219
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,808
we did an investigation

1220
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,443
and not tell anybody
what the outcome was.

1221
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,650
(Mark P Off-Camera)
I like to think of UFOs

1222
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,286
as weapons of mass deception,

1223
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,489
and the role of the
intelligence organizations

1224
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,926
and the military,
in propagating UFO mythology,

1225
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,928
as somewhat analogous

1226
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,731
to what evolutionary
biologists call

1227
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,899
a punctuated equilibrium.

1228
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:06,574
The UFO mythology develops
of its own accord

1229
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,443
and the Mirage Men
will just drop a new

1230
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:13,447
piece of data, a new meme,
some new faked documents

1231
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,885
into the mix as and when it is
expedient for them to do so.

1232
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:21,389
And so there's no real
need for a sustained

1233
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:25,559
UFO deception campaign
because the folklore

1234
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,629
is just perfectly capable
of sustaining itself.

1235
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,876
The US government
had a once-secret program

1236
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:48,349
in which 12 astronauts were
sent to an alien home world,

1237
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,453
Serpo, thirty eight point
four light years away

1238
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,424
from the years
1965 through 1978.

1239
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,593
When the returning
astronauts came back

1240
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,395
I believe there were seven,

1241
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:05,299
that report was finalized
into a report called

1242
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,535
Project Serpo in 1980.

1243
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,370
Rumors about this
kind of thing had been

1244
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,806
flying around since
the 1960s or '70s,

1245
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:15,676
so it's got some kind of
historical provenance.

1246
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,012
(Victor Martinez)
In November of 2005

1247
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:20,881
Project Serpo was sent
to my UFO thread list.

1248
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,650
I received an
email from someone,

1249
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,587
he requested to be anonymous.

1250
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,360
When I first read
that bombshell email

1251
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,729
it was far different
from anything

1252
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,598
I'd ever received

1253
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:42,436
and even though it was
a version that was

1254
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,339
different than what
I was familiar with

1255
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,241
it had the ring of truth.

1256
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,376
Somebody within the
government would have

1257
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,579
to be cooperating
because I can tell you

1258
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,615
that a lot of information,

1259
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,418
not all of the
particular details,

1260
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,420
but a lot of the
information is factual.

1261
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,559
I believe it is a
disinformation campaign

1262
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:07,962
to lead people astray.

1263
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:11,432
That said, a good
disinformation campaign

1264
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,367
a good perception
management campaign

1265
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,604
will always includes nuggets
of fact and truth

1266
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,639
and some of those
nuggets of facts and truth

1267
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,842
should be, if you're
going to do it effectively,

1268
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:26,747
should be some of the more
extreme facts or truths.

1269
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,818
They brought back
thousands of soil samples.

1270
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,754
Samples from the Eben
civilization,

1271
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,423
and I believe all
these artifacts

1272
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,826
are now at Bolling
Air Force Base.

1273
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:42,663
And photographs, too.

1274
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,765
There's always a possibility
that the Serpo story

1275
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:49,770
was created for
disinformation to

1276
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,373
present to the Soviets
back during the Cold War

1277
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,775
and somebody stumbled on to it.

1278
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,310
There's always
that possibility,

1279
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:57,578
but I don't think so.

1280
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,812
It's not a professional job.

1281
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:08,389
Myself and three
others were working

1282
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:14,495
as a research team looking
into the Serpo story.

1283
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,397
We really wanted to
get to the bottom

1284
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,933
of Rick's involvement in it.

1285
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,402
People within the UFO
community immediately said

1286
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,704
"Hey, is Richard Doty
involved in this?

1287
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,673
Did Richard Doty do this?"

1288
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,877
I never had anything to
do with the Serpo story.

1289
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,946
We were adamant at this
time that Rick Doty

1290
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,815
was the person sending
the information.

1291
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:38,586
But we didn't have any
proof and the only way

1292
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,421
we could get that proof
was if we could see

1293
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,991
an actual copy of
the original emails

1294
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,360
that the anonymous source
had been sending Victor.

1295
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,697
Unless Rick Doty is one
the greatest novelists

1296
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,732
and writers of
the 21st century,

1297
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,634
it's not him.

1298
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,569
We came up with a plan.

1299
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,038
We'll use the same name
and just contact Victor

1300
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,574
and let him think
his anonymous source

1301
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,476
was back in
touch with him.

1302
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,979
We asked Victor to send
us copies of the emails

1303
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,582
that we, allegedly, had
sent him which meant

1304
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,751
we could look at the
headers of these emails

1305
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:12,853
to determine where they
actually came from.

1306
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,822
And it was from looking
at those headers

1307
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,958
and having emails from
Rick Doty to compare against,

1308
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,594
that it was indeed
Rick Doty's IP address

1309
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,696
on the Request
Anonymous emails,

1310
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,665
and, as it turned out
later, he was also

1311
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,934
several other people
in the story.

1312
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,770
All contacting Victor
and Victor thinking

1313
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,773
he's been contacted by a
multitude of different people

1314
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,708
when in fact
it was all one person,

1315
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,377
it was all Rick Doty.

1316
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,513
I didn't create
it, I didn't, err,

1317
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,983
conspire with anybody
else to create it.

1318
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,419
It was created by
somebody else and,

1319
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:46,387
those people, I don't know.

1320
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:02,803
(Bill Ryan) How do we
ever know what we know?

1321
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,605
Apart from Victor
Martinez who really

1322
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,006
started this thing off,

1323
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,342
I'm the only name who's known.

1324
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,412
We've got this
anonymous storyteller

1325
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,348
'round this giant camp fire
who's entertaining us

1326
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,450
with this incredible tale,
and we're sitting here

1327
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,585
with bright eyes with
the flickering flames

1328
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:20,654
thinking "Wow, tell
us some more."

1329
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:24,625
The idea of
disinformation is that

1330
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:27,027
it's meant to be believed.

1331
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,330
With Serpo, the
first response is,

1332
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:31,899
"Well, this is fascinating,
but it's ridiculous."

1333
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,368
Of course there's
an aspect of me

1334
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,337
that wants to believe this
wonderful story.

1335
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,405
I had no idea where this
would be leading...

1336
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,740
(Greg Bishop) Well, when
I first met Bill Ryan

1337
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,776
at the Laughlin
conference in 2006

1338
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,446
he presented himself
as somebody being

1339
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,948
given information to
reveal to the public.

1340
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,251
He didn't quite know why but
thought it was very important.

1341
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,786
What's strange about
the Serpo thing

1342
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:56,857
and Richard Doty was that
he denied, you know,

1343
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,293
continually and
vociferously that he had

1344
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,595
anything to do with
it, yet he came to

1345
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,898
the Laughlin UFO convention
to see what was going on there,

1346
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,468
to hear Bill Ryan talk and
announce this to the world

1347
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,903
in person rather than
just on the radio

1348
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,840
and basically had his hands in a
lot of things that were going on

1349
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,676
or at least looked like
an interested bystander.

1350
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,911
Why should he be interested
in this silly story?

1351
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,856
Wonderful question.

1352
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,325
We don't know whether Anonymous
got this from the movie

1353
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,961
or whether Spielberg
had the tip-off

1354
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,296
that this was one of the ways,

1355
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,267
as many people in
this community suspect,

1356
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,904
over the years, the public
have been gradually

1357
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,608
acclimatized to the
possibility of this contact

1358
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,876
with an extraterrestrial race.

1359
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,711
By seeding little
parts of the truth

1360
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,780
here and there in
movies, it's the best way

1361
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:55,649
to get ideas through to
the general population.

1362
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,984
This might have been one
of the ways of doing it.

1363
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,622
I think the
information should be

1364
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,259
brought out to the public.

1365
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,495
Let the public decide
whether this is real or not.

1366
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,531
(Bill Ryan) Whether you think
the information is real or not,

1367
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,366
or whatever the proportion
of that might be the case

1368
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,801
this is a government operation.

1369
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,469
If it's a government operation

1370
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,737
these guys wouldn't
be doing their job

1371
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,939
if they weren't following
me every step of the way.

1372
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,741
Ever since the
middle of November,

1373
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:25,913
I've been assuming that
I'm being monitored.

1374
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,282
If they're not doing that,
they're not doing their job.

1375
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,850
And it's like I'm
one part of a team

1376
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,718
but I don't even know who
the other team members are.

1377
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:36,490
And I have to assume
that I'm being bugged.

1378
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,258
I mean, this may be paranoid,

1379
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,395
but whatever's going
on, it's happening

1380
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:45,632
at a government level,
and therefore everything I do

1381
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,434
is being watched.

1382
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,536
I have to assume
I'm being tested.

1383
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,904
-- You know the whole
Bill Moore stuff?
(Mark P) Yeah, yeah.

1384
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,473
(Bill Ryan)
I wasn't around then,

1385
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,641
but they were running
around ragged just to see

1386
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,009
whether he would
make a good spook...

1387
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,312
just to see whether he was
willing to obey orders...

1388
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:02,950
I have to assume that's there's
something more at stake.

1389
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:06,520
(John Lundberg)
You also need a really good

1390
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:07,588
bull [bleep] detector.

1391
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,789
(Bill Ryan) Yes, I know.

1392
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:16,530
Since 1985 I've
talked to 18 people

1393
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,298
at the cabinet
level or above

1394
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,633
including four presidents.

1395
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,341
About a third of them
have said, "It's true,"

1396
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:32,579
about a third have said "I heard
it, and I think it's true,"

1397
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,983
and about a third of them have
said "I don't have a clue.

1398
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,952
I do think though,
Doctor Green,

1399
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,823
that this is important for
you to investigate."

1400
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,424
Turn it off for a minute.

1401
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,643
The trouble with
the whole UFO thing

1402
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,313
is there are so many
people who make up

1403
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,683
BS stories that
no one can check.

1404
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:03,918
Somebody can step
forward and say,

1405
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,687
"I'll tell you what's
going on in UFOs,"

1406
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:09,924
and they can say, "I've
briefed the President."

1407
01:13:10,026 --> 01:13:12,227
"I've done this, I
know what's going on."

1408
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:14,362
I don't know ...
I think there's

1409
01:13:14,464 --> 01:13:16,331
too much BS in that field.

1410
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:21,903
Part of the problem
that UFOs created

1411
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:25,073
was that there were
people within government

1412
01:13:25,175 --> 01:13:27,842
within the Air Force,
within the CIA,

1413
01:13:27,944 --> 01:13:30,845
who really believed that
flying saucers existed.

1414
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:34,749
And because they had stature,
because they had rank,

1415
01:13:34,851 --> 01:13:39,220
their opinion was
considered proof.

1416
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:40,789
(ARCHIVE) Unless we understand

1417
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,191
and work effectively
for the principles

1418
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,959
on which our
American way of life

1419
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:48,263
is founded the
structure will crumble.

1420
01:13:48,365 --> 01:13:52,066
Well, before going to
Norton Air Force Base,

1421
01:13:52,169 --> 01:13:55,069
going into a clean
room and being told

1422
01:13:55,172 --> 01:13:58,673
we had a landing by somebody
who seemed to be respectable,

1423
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:00,308
his name
was all over the wall

1424
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:05,780
as head of security, and his
boss and everything agreeing...

1425
01:14:05,882 --> 01:14:08,783
I didn't believe it then,

1426
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:11,686
but then when confronted
with the information

1427
01:14:11,788 --> 01:14:13,822
I now realize
after working with

1428
01:14:13,924 --> 01:14:16,324
intelligence people
that it's a reality.

1429
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:19,694
And they stand
behind the idea that

1430
01:14:19,796 --> 01:14:22,831
they don't disbelieve it,
it's just so far it's not

1431
01:14:22,933 --> 01:14:25,066
proven to be a threat to
our national security

1432
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:28,036
and that's the way they
got out from under it.

1433
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:34,742
In the intelligence
community there are

1434
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,245
definitely people that
are interested in

1435
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:40,181
extraordinary phenomena,
particularly UFOs.

1436
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:41,983
Definitely believers in that,

1437
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:45,286
because you don't work
in that profession

1438
01:14:45,388 --> 01:14:48,022
and it's not just a profession,
it's a world unto itself,

1439
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:50,258
without learning some things.

1440
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,694
How many pictures do you
need, how many eye witnesses,

1441
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:56,731
how do you study
something that controls,

1442
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,333
possibly, even this program?

1443
01:15:06,076 --> 01:15:09,110
What is known of
the truth of 'them' -

1444
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:10,712
these other beings?

1445
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:14,782
What if the truth
is bad? Could be.

1446
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,885
What if we're their
farm animals?

1447
01:15:16,987 --> 01:15:19,220
What if they eat
us psychically?

1448
01:15:19,322 --> 01:15:20,855
Yeah, I don't know. There's
a lot of possibilities

1449
01:15:20,957 --> 01:15:22,457
there that are not good.

1450
01:15:27,964 --> 01:15:32,367
I think we are surfing
on the wave of a huge

1451
01:15:32,469 --> 01:15:36,070
adventure of the
opportunity of humankind

1452
01:15:36,172 --> 01:15:39,908
rolling into a totally new era

1453
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:43,244
and that wave might
break one of these days.

1454
01:15:43,346 --> 01:15:46,915
Even the Vatican
recently has come out

1455
01:15:47,017 --> 01:15:49,217
in preparation saying
"Hey, listen, you know,

1456
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:50,652
if there is anybody out
there, they're all

1457
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,287
God's creations and
they're our brothers

1458
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:54,689
and sisters really."
I mean, what a set-up

1459
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,025
that is for what
might be coming next.

1460
01:15:57,127 --> 01:16:01,362
We're really a by-product of
extraterrestrial intervention.

1461
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:06,401
We're really - I
mean, this is my view -

1462
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:11,105
that we're... we've been
genetically altered by,

1463
01:16:11,207 --> 01:16:15,143
maybe not one, maybe
perhaps several

1464
01:16:15,245 --> 01:16:16,411
extraterrestrial races.

1465
01:16:16,513 --> 01:16:19,180
The government obviously
doesn't want to tell us,

1466
01:16:19,282 --> 01:16:22,350
otherwise they'd disclose
everything they knew.

1467
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:24,118
And the most
important players,

1468
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,820
the aliens, don't
want disclosure

1469
01:16:25,922 --> 01:16:28,256
because they could
disclose any time.

1470
01:16:28,358 --> 01:16:31,092
I mean, they control
most of the cards.

1471
01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:32,994
I don't have any files,
any photographs,

1472
01:16:33,096 --> 01:16:35,596
anything to show you,
I just have a lot of

1473
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:38,199
personal research, I
have my professional

1474
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:41,035
experiences and I have
the bona fides,

1475
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:43,604
the tested bona fides
of the sources

1476
01:16:43,707 --> 01:16:46,708
and I have my intuition.

1477
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,943
And those things
all fit together

1478
01:16:49,045 --> 01:16:52,347
and you kind of get a picture.

1479
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:58,152
There is a planet,
that orbits Sirius

1480
01:16:58,254 --> 01:17:00,855
the Dog Star system,
they are human

1481
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:04,659
they are very much
interested in us

1482
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:07,929
and they have been
key to our survival

1483
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:15,970
and they are capable
of coming here

1484
01:17:16,072 --> 01:17:18,172
certainly others
have come here.

1485
01:17:18,274 --> 01:17:26,681
Um, now... could that be
part of disinformation?

1486
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:29,350
Absolutely.

1487
01:17:29,452 --> 01:17:33,354
I read things even
today that we fed to

1488
01:17:33,456 --> 01:17:35,723
Paul Bennewitz or
to Linda Howe

1489
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:39,293
or to Bill Moore
that I fed to them.

1490
01:17:39,396 --> 01:17:42,263
And I see that today and
it's surprising that

1491
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,365
that stuff's still
there but it just shows

1492
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:46,434
we were a professional
organization

1493
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,002
and we did our job

1494
01:17:48,104 --> 01:17:49,370
and that information
is still out there.

1495
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:57,245
People whose job it was
to make the subject

1496
01:17:57,347 --> 01:17:59,981
look ridiculous over
the last 50 or 60 years

1497
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,249
have done a very good job.

1498
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:06,087
I don't know where they're
from, I don't know.

1499
01:18:06,189 --> 01:18:07,455
I don't know where
they're from.

1500
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:10,158
I know that they're not,
like, from Detroit, you know.

1501
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,360
That's as far as
I can take it.

1502
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:14,796
So again, when
somebody starts saying,

1503
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:16,164
"Well, here's who they are."

1504
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:17,999
"Here's why they're here,"

1505
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:22,370
they lose me almost
immediately.

1506
01:18:22,472 --> 01:18:28,176
I was selected to participate
in a special access program

1507
01:18:28,278 --> 01:18:30,011
within the counter
intelligence community.

1508
01:18:30,113 --> 01:18:32,313
My supervisor
selected me and said,

1509
01:18:32,415 --> 01:18:33,981
"You're going to be
briefed into a program

1510
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:37,051
and you're going to be
responsible for investigating

1511
01:18:37,153 --> 01:18:39,420
everything associated
with this program."

1512
01:18:46,863 --> 01:18:48,229
The first part of the
briefing dealt with

1513
01:18:48,331 --> 01:18:51,666
how the United States Air
Force were countering

1514
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,801
unauthorized disclosure
of technology

1515
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:58,039
to the public by using the
UFO phenomena as a cover.

1516
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:04,779
And then the second part
of the briefing

1517
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:10,718
was where we were actually
shown and briefed about

1518
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:16,157
the United States
government involvement

1519
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:20,394
with extraterrestrials
since the late 1940s,

1520
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,797
which was obviously the most
interesting part

1521
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:25,066
of the briefing.

1522
01:19:25,168 --> 01:19:27,301
Well, they showed us
a lot of things.

1523
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:30,138
They showed us a film
which was a late '40s

1524
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,274
or early '50s film of a
recovery operation

1525
01:19:33,376 --> 01:19:36,777
which they talked about
as being in Roswell.

1526
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,814
They showed crash debris, they
showed extraterrestrial bodies

1527
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:43,050
and then there was also
a briefing showing

1528
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,754
a live alien sitting in a
room talking to people.

1529
01:19:46,856 --> 01:19:49,357
And then the narrator of
this film talked about

1530
01:19:49,459 --> 01:19:52,360
the continuation of a
connection between

1531
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:58,332
the United States government and
extraterrestrial civilizations.

1532
01:19:58,434 --> 01:20:04,338
After viewing this I was
not sure if it was real,

1533
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,242
if it was... they
presented it to us for

1534
01:20:08,344 --> 01:20:11,212
some reason, maybe
some kind of

1535
01:20:11,314 --> 01:20:15,249
psychological conditioning,
I don't think

1536
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:18,119
I initially
believed any of it.

1537
01:20:18,221 --> 01:20:21,189
But after the film
was over with

1538
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,292
an Air Force Colonel
in uniform then started

1539
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:28,429
talking about the
operation, the program,

1540
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:30,998
how the United States
government,

1541
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,900
and it was always the
United States government,

1542
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,735
it wasn't Air Force or Army

1543
01:20:34,837 --> 01:20:36,204
it was the United States
government,

1544
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:39,173
how they progressed
from the early days,

1545
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:42,910
meaning the crash
retrieval operations

1546
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:47,715
in the late '40s until now,
which was the late '70s.

1547
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:50,885
And then the more he
spoke, the more I realized

1548
01:20:50,987 --> 01:20:52,720
that what I saw was real.

1549
01:20:52,822 --> 01:20:55,056
I mean this guy wouldn't
be sitting here,

1550
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,160
standing here talking to
us with the people in the room

1551
01:20:59,262 --> 01:21:01,929
briefing into
this high-level program

1552
01:21:02,031 --> 01:21:05,366
if it was a hoax.

1553
01:21:05,468 --> 01:21:09,937
A fractured hall of mirrors
with a quicksand floor

1554
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:13,941
that nobody knows
exactly what

1555
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:18,312
the truths are and everybody
has found themselves

1556
01:21:18,414 --> 01:21:21,115
completely suspicious
of the motives of any

1557
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:25,286
human being because
counter-intelligence

1558
01:21:25,388 --> 01:21:28,923
in England and the United
States and a lot of

1559
01:21:29,025 --> 01:21:31,192
other countries have
worked overtime

1560
01:21:31,294 --> 01:21:35,696
to misinform and to
tell the public

1561
01:21:35,798 --> 01:21:38,899
and the media there is nothing
to the UFO phenomenon.

1562
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:43,137
It's a lie - I have no
question about it -

1563
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:48,242
and my work is to try
to shed some light on

1564
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:55,283
what could be so threatening
out of some other

1565
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:59,020
intelligence from some
other part of the universe

1566
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,656
or it's been here for
two billion years

1567
01:22:01,758 --> 01:22:04,358
and it's not
extraterrestrial but

1568
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,427
we're the new ones on the block.

1569
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:10,731
What is it that is
considered so threatening

1570
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,900
that governments
will kill people

1571
01:22:13,002 --> 01:22:14,268
to keep it silent?

1572
01:22:21,077 --> 01:22:23,377
They can't come forth and say,

1573
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:26,047
"Yeah, OK, we had
contact in 1947,

1574
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,381
all this is real."

1575
01:22:27,483 --> 01:22:28,416
What would that do?

1576
01:22:28,518 --> 01:22:30,051
That would open up
a Pandora's Box,

1577
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:31,986
because there would be
millions and millions

1578
01:22:32,088 --> 01:22:34,188
and millions of people
asking questions

1579
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:37,124
that somebody has to answer.

1580
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:38,693
The easiest thing for
the government to do

1581
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:41,295
is just to say "no comment"

1582
01:22:41,397 --> 01:22:44,131
or "No, it I didn't happen."

1583
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:48,135
But there are so many
people, so many people

1584
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:50,705
within the government
that have come forth

1585
01:22:50,807 --> 01:22:54,141
with information saying,
"It did happen,

1586
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:56,811
it's real," and the
reason I'm doing it

1587
01:22:56,913 --> 01:22:59,814
is because I asked the
government a long time ago,

1588
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:01,849
"Hey, what am I
supposed to say?"

1589
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:02,950
And they're going to say,

1590
01:23:03,052 --> 01:23:05,419
"You stick to the
fact it's not real."

1591
01:23:05,521 --> 01:23:07,822
But when the government
tried to discredit me

1592
01:23:07,924 --> 01:23:10,157
on something then I
went to them and said,

1593
01:23:10,259 --> 01:23:13,828
"Listen, you're telling
everybody it's not real,

1594
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,263
and I know it's real,
and you know it's real

1595
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,165
and all these other
people know it's real,

1596
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:20,267
so I'm going to
tell the public

1597
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,703
what I know about it."

1598
01:23:22,805 --> 01:23:24,438
And the government
basically said,

1599
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,473
"Do what you gotta do."

1600
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:34,081
(Robert Durant off-camera)
Let's take one step at a time.

1601
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:35,916
You're looking
at Richard Doty,

1602
01:23:36,018 --> 01:23:39,053
and by looking at
him, you're taking

1603
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:42,390
a glimpse into a whole machine

1604
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:45,259
that now has a life of its own.
