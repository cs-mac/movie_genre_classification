1
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:20,125
Go.

2
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,508
Please leave.

3
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:26,294
- Please leave.
- I'm not going to leave you here alone.

4
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,404
- Go.
- I'm going to go with you.

5
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,480
Please leave.

6
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:37,764
Bong Soon.

7
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,469
Don't cry.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,304
We don't have much time left.

9
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,822
Please leave.

10
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:52,661
Bong Soon.

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,602
There is something I want to tell you.

12
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:01,655
Please leave.

13
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:08,128
There's not that much time left.

14
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,094
Please leave.

15
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:31,872
I'm not leaving.

16
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,895
I will stay by your side.

17
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:35,896
Don't be afraid.

18
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,698
Okay?

19
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,530
Please open the door.

20
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:54,804
Please let me save him.

21
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,540
Step aside!

22
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:44,861
You're fine.

23
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,892
I'm relieved.

24
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>[Episode 15]
[Level Up]</i>

25
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,041
That must hurt.

26
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,059
Does it hurt a lot?

27
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,422
I'm okay.

28
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,705
Your clothes are torn.

29
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,689
When I get my paycheck,
I will buy you pretty clothes.

30
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,649
- Really? You promise?
- Yes.

31
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,558
Bong Soon.

32
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,409
Let's go.

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,486
- Who is it?
- It's Dad. He says come home early.

34
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,802
Hurry up. Let's eat and go home.
He must be very worried.

35
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:07,649
Shall I not go home tonight?

36
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:18,175
Gosh.

37
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:22,316
What are you thinking?

38
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,500
I wasn't thinking anything.

39
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,655
Gosh.

40
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:32,237
It's hot in here.

41
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,794
You're driving me crazy again.

42
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,313
Dad told me to hurry up and come home.

43
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,174
Let's hurry up and eat.

44
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,504
Your hand... I will drive.

45
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:54,995
I'll drive.

46
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:59,452
- Tonight... We...
- Huh?

47
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:09,042
Let's stay together...

48
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,927
Hello?

49
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:14,504
- Yes, Father.
- My dad?

50
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,150
Yes, of course.

51
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,809
We're heading home now.

52
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,398
Yes. We will be there soon. Don't worry.

53
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,211
Okay.

54
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,951
What? Did Dad tell you to hurry up?

55
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:32,014
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

56
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:04,441
- Go in.
- Okay.

57
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,853
You should go home and sleep.

58
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,601
Why did you say that then?

59
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,473
I...

60
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:22,175
Today was the happiest day of my life.

61
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,169
I will get going. Bye.

62
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:14,593
Seems like I won't be
getting any sleep tonight.

63
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,200
Gosh.

64
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,156
<i>Leave. Please leave.</i>

65
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:51,070
<i>There is not that much time left.</i>

66
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:55,030
<i>Please leave!</i>

67
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,787
How can I leave?

68
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,137
You were trying to save me...

69
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:38,349
<i>I'm never going to leave you here alone.</i>

70
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,578
<i>Please leave.</i>

71
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,416
<i>I'm not leaving.</i>

72
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,626
<i>I will stay by your side.</i>

73
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,881
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

74
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:49,847
I will protect you.

75
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:53,434
So that no one in this world
can hurt you.

76
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:55,460
I will protect you.

77
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,596
<i>I...</i>

78
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,819
<i>Today was the happiest day of my life.</i>

79
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,335
<i>Shall I not go home tonight?</i>

80
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,943
I'm losing my mind here.

81
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,754
<i>Shall I not go home tonight?</i>

82
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,083
<i>Shall I...</i>

83
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:53,771
<i>not go home tonight?</i>

84
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:55,464
Gosh.

85
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,012
I just...

86
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,540
I wanted to see you.

87
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,204
Did you have a good night sleep?

88
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,393
Let's go.

89
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,878
Please blow air here.

90
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:03,245
- Do I have something on my face?
- No. I just like looking at it.

91
00:15:03,246 --> 00:15:05,039
Please stop.

92
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,609
- Hello.
- Secretary Gong, when did you get here?

93
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,452
I've been here since yesterday.

94
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:12,207
- Is your head okay?
- Ah, yes. I have a hard head.

95
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,352
It's a relief that at least
your head is hard.

96
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:19,165
- Look at me.
- Secretary Gong is here.

97
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,420
- It's not okay.
- It's okay. Who cares?

98
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,932
- It's not okay.
- It's okay.

99
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,703
Secretary Gong, tell Team Leader Oh
to come to my room.

100
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:30,753
He went to the hospital.

101
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,734
- Why?
- He was trying to escape yesterday

102
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:36,716
and his foot got
stuck in the emergency door.

103
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:40,708
He gets himself stuck everywhere.

104
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,056
Okay. Keep up the good work.

105
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,099
Thank you, ma'am.

106
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,372
Be careful.

107
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,264
Get away from me.

108
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,406
Kwang Bok...

109
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,717
Oh my.

110
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,503
<i>Who are you?</i>

111
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:40,035
<i>Why do I feel like I'm seeing myself?</i>

112
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,589
<i>We look very much alike.</i>

113
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,901
<i>You could be another me.</i>

114
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,621
I'm in your heart.

115
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,402
Title: Won Bin.

116
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,766
That's so funny. Did you say
the title is "Won Bin?"

117
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,317
Mine is Hyun Bin then.

118
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,613
This is the poem collection
that fake monk left behind.

119
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,290
It's so touching.

120
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,313
There is this poem here. Listen.

121
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,266
Title: A dog that has been
chasing after a duck.

122
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,996
The dog chased after the chicken.

123
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,705
The chicken was faster than the dog.

124
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:15,826
The dog ended up staring at the roof.

125
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,997
The dog later found out that
the chicken had a long leg.

126
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,783
A long leg.

127
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,699
- It gives me chills.
- It's not bad at all.

128
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,567
I think he left the building
when things got chaotic here.

129
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:32,613
The police will be here to check
the CCTV and the office.

130
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:35,458
- Okay. Be cooperative.
- Okay.

131
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,075
- You can get going now.
- Okay.

132
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,074
Where did she go again?

133
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:03,949
Kim Jang Hyun.

134
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,786
I'm going to get you.

135
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:16,094
<i>Step up the inspection. Don't let
a single person run away.</i>

136
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,151
<i>Don't let him escape.</i>

137
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,673
Okay?

138
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:22,437
- Please take a look at this.
- It's him.

139
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:26,681
- It's him. The one who was on the news.
- He is the bad guy.

140
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,904
He looks just fine.

141
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,058
- I'm scared to go home alone at night.
- It's him.

142
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:38,083
This is nonsense.

143
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:41,679
Gosh, this is giving me a headache.

144
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,613
What is going on here?
Where am I supposed to begin?

145
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,073
That bastard.

146
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,026
He is driving me crazy.

147
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:54,767
He fell from a cliff, right?

148
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,033
He fell and he drowned.

149
00:18:57,034 --> 00:18:58,535
How is he still alive?

150
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,533
That's what I mean.

151
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:04,074
Team Leader Yook.
According to the Bomb Squad

152
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,293
the bomb exploded in the sky.

153
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:07,839
They said that CEO threw the bomb.

154
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,304
- What?
- But I don't think it makes sense.

155
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:15,391
No one could throw it that far.

156
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,007
It's strange.

157
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:20,706
He threw the bomb up at the sky.

158
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:23,515
- That Avengers Girl. Do Bong Soon.
- Yes.

159
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,084
She works there, right?

160
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,804
Yes.

161
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:31,401
His target was not CEO Ahn Min Hyuk.

162
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,314
It was her.

163
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,990
Do Bong Soon.

164
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:37,458
He knew about your secret power

165
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,942
and set a trap?

166
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,564
That's right.

167
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:47,788
Kyung Shim told me that
you lost your power the other day.

168
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,764
Are you okay?

169
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:52,468
Well, Gook Du...

170
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,382
I got my power back now.

171
00:19:54,383 --> 00:19:56,009
I'm strong again.

172
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,013
- Then, that bomb...
- Yes.

173
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:03,008
- I threw it.
- That's a relief.

174
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:07,295
How could that be possible?
That's miraculous.

175
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:11,834
I prayed.

176
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,949
I prayed that I could save him.

177
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:21,557
Did CEO Ahn know that you had

178
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,884
a bomb strapped to your body?

179
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,698
Yes.

180
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:30,564
Then he knew it...

181
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:33,835
And he still stayed by your side?

182
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:35,558
Yes.

183
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,735
We can't write a report.

184
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:49,076
No one is going to believe us anyway.

185
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,831
- You should get going.
- Okay.

186
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,615
- Here you go.
- I should go check the scene.

187
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,207
Okay. Don't skip meals.

188
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,392
- Bong Soon.
- Yes?

189
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:09,596
It's a relief that you are safe.

190
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:13,365
And it's a relief that you are
back to the old you.

191
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:17,612
- Thank you.
- I have always got your back.

192
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:20,292
- You know that, right?
- I know.

193
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:24,085
I feel safe.

194
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,029
Bye.

195
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm not sure yet, but...

196
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,517
<i>[Most Wanted]
[Reward: 10 Million Won]</i>

197
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,853
The police went back to the station.
We cooperated with them.

198
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:01,220
I let them into the Machine Room
and the rooftop.

199
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,237
Good job. Secretary Gong.

200
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,585
- Yes?
- Let's set up a pop-up window

201
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,519
so that people can see it when they
log in to our game server.

202
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,307
Let's make Kim Jang Hyun's picutre
pop-up when people log in.

203
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:14,187
We should also include the description
and the reward.

204
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:16,561
Let the users see it.
As many as possible.

205
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,988
Don't ever let him escape ever again.

206
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,702
I'm going to get him.

207
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,917
- That moron.
- Okay.

208
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:33,489
CEO Ahn.

209
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,043
I'm not sure if I should tell you this...
Never mind.

210
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:41,488
What is it?

211
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:44,420
Well.

212
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:48,478
About that detective
who came here today...

213
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:51,218
- I think his name is Bok Du.
- Gook Du, Gook Du.

214
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,495
Yes.

215
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:55,863
- That detective...
- What?

216
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:58,459
Do Bong Soon...

217
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,860
He...

218
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,200
He hugged Do Bong Soon.

219
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,965
What?

220
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,286
- He hugged her?
- Well.

221
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,977
When? Where?

222
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,747
- How?
- Well.

223
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,004
A while ago at the lobby...

224
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,546
How could he...

225
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:41,592
- Do it.
- What? Do what?

226
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:47,074
Do a simulation. Show me how
he hugged my girlfriend.

227
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:50,130
- What do you mean a simulation?
- I said do a simulation.

228
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,566
Oh, okay.

229
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,046
Don't you hesitate.
Show me that situation.

230
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,047
- You are Gook Du.
- Okay.

231
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,816
Show me. Think of me as Bong Soon.

232
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:02,037
- I will be Bok Du then.
- Gook Du!

233
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,612
- Okay.
- Gosh.

234
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:07,651
Bong Soon is a bit shorter then this.

235
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:10,710
Bong Soon is a bit shorter.

236
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:14,027
And he is quite tall.

237
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,528
Yes. I think she is about this tall.

238
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,834
Gook Du came closer and hugged her.
He seemed manly.

239
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,865
He wrapped his arm around her
like this and hugged her.

240
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:27,901
She looked comfortable resting
her head on his chest.

241
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:32,229
She seemed like
she was in her mother's arms.

242
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,209
It's warm.

243
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:18,680
No, no, no.

244
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,418
Hey.

245
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,201
Let's get out of here.

246
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:27,190
I'm sorry, CEO Ahn.

247
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:39,256
About Monk Zanimooddean.

248
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,362
- He is Monk Nijamuttin.
- Right?

249
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:43,544
I thought so. Anyway.

250
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,951
Did you do a background check on him?

251
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:47,589
I had a chance to get to
know him in person.

252
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,224
Why do I have to do a background check?

253
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:52,534
Sir, when did you first meet him?

254
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,613
Do you remember how I got stabbed by.

255
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:02,304
Mang Gu from Garibongdong
three years ago?

256
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:06,228
I remember that.
That "Don't ask" case.

257
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:09,368
- You ran for your life...
- Hey!

258
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:12,538
When did I do that?

259
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,115
Anyway.

260
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:18,814
Back then, a monk treated me by
using his "energy technique."

261
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,935
I didn't have to get actual surgery.

262
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:24,983
I have been sponsoring him since then.
It has been two years.

263
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:28,615
I saw him at the dry sauna
the other day.

264
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:30,855
He had a tattoo on the side.

265
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,079
It was the map of our country.

266
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,150
He could have done that.
He loves South Korea very much.

267
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:38,960
But...

268
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:42,670
Somewhere near the South Sea

269
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:44,464
he had an arrow and
it said "My Hometown."

270
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:47,014
Maybe he used to live there when
he first came to South Korea.

271
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,554
That could be his second hometown.

272
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:55,072
Don't waste your time worrying about
those things. You go do youe job right.

273
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,429
Right?

274
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,978
Right.

275
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:09,186
<i>Don't look for me.
I want to live my life too.</i>

276
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:13,205
Is he out of his mind?

277
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,470
- Is he trying to run away from home?
- Ma'am, what should we do?

278
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,939
We don't have pie or tart.
We have nothing.

279
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,836
We have to close the bakery today.

280
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,222
How... Run away?

281
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,343
Oh. Hello, Secretary Gong.

282
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:09,358
Do you know where CEO Ahn is?

283
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,546
He must be on the rooftop or he could
be wandering around the building.

284
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:17,831
As you know, when he gets angry
or hyper he does that.

285
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:20,365
He is upset again? Why?

286
00:28:23,613 --> 00:28:25,844
- I'm sorry.
- What? Secretary Gong.

287
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:37,613
My goodness.

288
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,676
Do Bong Soon!

289
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,401
Yes?

290
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,352
Oh, no. Sir...

291
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:47,497
Does it hurt a lot?

292
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,394
Don't worry.

293
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,325
I will make coffee for you.
You were brewing already.

294
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:55,161
What are you? Who are you?
What's your identity?

295
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:58,911
I told you I'm Do Bong Soon from
Dobong-gu, Dobong-dong.

296
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:02,084
You go back to your planet.
Get out of this Earth. Leave.

297
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:06,083
Sir, I'm not Dooley.
How can I leave Earth?

298
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:10,228
You like a spoonful of sugar
in your coffee, right?

299
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:11,829
Stop being coy.

300
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,727
I'm going to see the end of you.
I won't miss it for the world.

301
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:17,847
Gosh, Sir.

302
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:24,807
When the new employee gets here,
please be nice to her. Don't bother her.

303
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:27,902
Oh, it's a utensil set.

304
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,285
Isn't this so pretty?

305
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:31,875
This is my gift to you.

306
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,420
Bye.

307
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,351
- Hello?
- It's me, Ahn Min Hyuk.

308
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,398
- What's up?
- Are you free today?

309
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,968
I have something to tell you in person.

310
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:06,390
I have something to
tell you in person too.

311
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:08,008
I will text you the time
and the location.

312
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:10,429
You can do...

313
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,660
Hello?

314
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:17,135
I just don't like him.
I just can't like him.

315
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,422
You didn't eat your only
meal today, right?

316
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,381
Let's go eat.

317
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:28,979
I don't have to eat.

318
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,712
- Let's go somewhere else.
- What?

319
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,208
- I just want to make sure this...
- Min Hyuk.

320
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:45,187
Can I call you like that when
we are by ourselves?

321
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:49,518
<i>Gosh. I have to get
the lead in the beginning.</i>

322
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,226
<i>Don't fall for her.</i>

323
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:57,981
I don't care how you call me.
What matters is how you feel...

324
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,644
Can I call you "Min Min?"

325
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:12,275
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

326
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:14,311
Let's go. Wait.

327
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:17,830
Weren't you going to tell me something?

328
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,746
I don't have to tell you now.

329
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:23,074
I give my employees a hug too.
That's not a big deal, right?

330
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:24,679
- Shall we go eat? Let's go eat.
- Yes.

331
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,782
She is so annoying.

332
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:35,024
What in the world is this?

333
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:38,063
Are you a chieftain in Africa?
What are all these things dangling here?

334
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,297
- What?
- You have spoons and chopsticks here.

335
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,677
What do you need those for?

336
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:47,111
Do Bong Soon made these for me.

337
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:51,769
She is the weirdest creature
I have ever seen.

338
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,930
Do you take lessons at a pottery studio
or something? Do you do metal work?

339
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,698
Oh my.

340
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,243
Forget it.

341
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:03,571
Don't you think you should tell me
about what happened in the office?

342
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:06,237
Why were you guys hugging each other?

343
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,884
We were doing a simulation.

344
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,007
- Were you jealous?
- Oh my.

345
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,699
Why are you laughing at me?
Don't look at me.

346
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,441
Are you crazy? People are looking at us.

347
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,218
Since when did they become close friends?

348
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:28,546
You can eat it just like this.

349
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:38,514
- It's going to take forever to cut it.
- It's delicious.

350
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:41,542
I have too meet someone after work.

351
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,073
- Who?
- There's this guy who I just can't like.

352
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:56,910
Wow, isn't she amazing?

353
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:59,304
Who is this model?

354
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:04,049
- Should we pick her?
- She is a perfect match for our game.

355
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:07,948
Who should I choose?

356
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:10,967
Just pick her. You used to like her.

357
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,709
Look at this... look.

358
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,109
Isn't she amazing?

359
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,455
There are more pictures.
Would you like to see?

360
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:24,932
When? When did I like her?

361
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,792
Secretary Gong,
what are you talking about?

362
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,119
Didn't I tell you to use a male model?

363
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,739
CEO Ahn, why are you being like this?
We've never used a male model.

364
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,075
You said male models cost more,
and you don't like them.

365
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:38,593
What are you saying, Secretary Gong?

366
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:39,747
Are you not feeling well?

367
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,288
You said that, remember?

368
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,019
You've always liked this model.

369
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:47,648
She looks so scary.

370
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,622
Why are her legs so uselessly long, huh?

371
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,229
Get out. Get out.

372
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:55,628
Why you acting like this?
Really, CEO Ahn...

373
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:58,409
<i>Gook Du, I need to talk to you.
See you later tonight.</i>

374
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:00,726
Why you being this way to me?

375
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,770
CEO Ahn likes male models.

376
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,207
- Bong Soon...
- Bong Soon...

377
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,393
- Go ahead.
- No, you can go first.

378
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,935
I need to make one thing clear with you.

379
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:59,035
- Bong Soon and I...
- Wait.

380
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:03,614
Why do you keep using informal speech
with me?

381
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,596
Gosh, this punk...

382
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:07,624
Then you can do it too.

383
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,224
I have manners, unlike you.

384
00:35:10,225 --> 00:35:12,529
I don't speak informally
to people I'm not close to.

385
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:16,169
Do you think I'm speaking
informally to you because we're close?

386
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:18,483
Do you think I want to get close to you?

387
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:21,246
That's what I'm saying,
so why are you speaking informally to me?

388
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,959
Do you want to get closer to me?

389
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,069
You're a funny guy.

390
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:35,486
You...

391
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,622
Do you like Bong Soon?

392
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:41,453
What? Do I like Bong Soon?

393
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:47,392
How dare you ask me that?
Who are you to ask me that?

394
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:50,111
You're seriously a piece of crap.

395
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,013
I should be the one saying that.

396
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:54,730
Hey.

397
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,479
Don't hang around my girlfriend anymore.

398
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,578
I let you mouth off long enough.

399
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:12,059
Well, I suppose this was bound
to happen sooner or later.

400
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,809
Yeah, it took longer than I thought.

401
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,246
- Should we go?
- Don't complain after I beat you up.

402
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,109
- You punk!
- Oh...

403
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,650
What are you doing here?
How did you know to come?

404
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:23,722
She came to meet me.

405
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,863
Why would you meet my Bong Soon?

406
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,206
What's it to you if I do?

407
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:28,857
Stop it, already.

408
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:35,034
Seriously, what's wrong with you two?
People are staring.

409
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:40,535
Wait, then the guy you said you were
going to meet is...

410
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,564
Anyway...

411
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,496
Let's catch Kim Jang Hyun together.

412
00:36:49,497 --> 00:36:51,446
I asked to see you to say that.

413
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:56,325
But, today doesn't seem like
the right time to discuss that.

414
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:58,353
Let's just drink.

415
00:36:58,354 --> 00:36:59,881
- No.
- Why?

416
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,427
Why, why?

417
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,525
- Who are you to say no?
- She's my friend.

418
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:05,938
- What about you? You... punk.
- You...

419
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,097
- What kind of cop says... punk?
- It's up to me, you... punk.

420
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:10,100
You must be... crazy. Hey!

421
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:12,506
I'll just pour it.

422
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,585
I'll just pour it for you.

423
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:17,781
Cheers.

424
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:29,438
Get up there. Gosh, these legs.

425
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:30,926
Why are their legs so long?

426
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,493
<i>Mom, I'm going to work.</i>

427
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:58,720
Mom, I'm going to work! Dad, I'm going!

428
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,651
Your dad didn't come home yesterday.

429
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:02,437
What?

430
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:05,309
What? Dad didn't come home?

431
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,602
Your dad ran away.

432
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,238
- Ran away?
- Ran away?

433
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,683
- But...
- Why?

434
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,055
He left on his own.

435
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:16,112
You hit him, right?

436
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,197
No, I didn't.

437
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,125
You did hit him again.

438
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,685
He chose to leave on his own.

439
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,158
You think you're right?

440
00:38:58,453 --> 00:38:59,855
Seriously...

441
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:20,061
I feel really nauseous inside.

442
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:22,460
Yet, I'm in a really good mood.

443
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,421
You must be uncomfortable there.

444
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,506
She could've given him at blanket,
at least.

445
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:37,226
Good morning! Did you sleep well?

446
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:40,050
Yes. You should eat something
for your hangover.

447
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:42,811
What is it? Why are you so down?

448
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:46,593
My dad... ran away from home.

449
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:48,866
Ran away?

450
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,102
Bong Soon, thank you for the meal.

451
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:13,217
It's food from my house,
so you should thank me.

452
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:14,846
You did this before, too.

453
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:17,792
Thanks for the food.

454
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:20,676
Yum.

455
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:25,906
Then I'm going to talk about
what I brought up yesterday.

456
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,026
I'm going to catch Kim Jang Hyun myself.
Help me out.

457
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:59,101
Why are you insisting on doing this
here on our own?

458
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:02,068
All the focus and attention is on
the police right now.

459
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:04,912
We need to make a move from a
different direction than the police.

460
00:41:04,913 --> 00:41:09,534
But... why is he going to be involved?

461
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:12,092
I really hate working with you too.

462
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:13,963
- What did you say, punk?
- You're the punk.

463
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:15,604
Enough!

464
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:19,785
Can you put aside personal feelings
for just a moment?

465
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,789
If you two aren't going to help me,
I'll do it on my own.

466
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,167
- No!
- No!

467
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:32,971
Fine. I'll help you.

468
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,275
But, you can't make moves on your own.

469
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:37,977
My condition is you have to
discuss everything with me first.

470
00:41:38,654 --> 00:41:40,651
Well, okay.

471
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:43,796
Anyway, this is what I think.

472
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:45,601
Kim Jang Hyun knows that I'm alive.

473
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:47,930
Then he will want to target me.

474
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,371
That is a valid conclusion.
He's very obsessive.

475
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,242
There's a nationwide warrant
out for his arrest.

476
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:56,798
Things are different for Kim Jang Hyun.
He can't move around freely.

477
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:59,920
Then we have to make it
so that he can't stay hidden.

478
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:03,129
Now that he is in this predicament,
what will he end up doing?

479
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:07,150
The police believe he'll be looking
to smuggle himself out of the country.

480
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,769
- Smuggle himself out?
- It's the last resort for criminals.

481
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,720
Everyone knows his face, so it will be
hard to make a fake passport.

482
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:16,119
It's more likely he'll use a broker
and get on a cargo ship.

483
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,299
Illegal smuggling.

484
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,203
Broker.

485
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,160
We need some information right about now.

486
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:32,037
Hello, this is Ahn Min Hyuk.

487
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:35,806
Mister, you still owe me, don't you?

488
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:37,656
Yes.

489
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,160
I'll look into it.

490
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,963
What is the trend for smuggling people
out these days?

491
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:51,546
There's a high chance that a criminal
will be smuggled out via cargo ship.

492
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:54,217
Look into the brokers for smuggling.

493
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:57,918
You know Choong Shik,
one of Wol Sa's guys?

494
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,179
You can ask him, he'll know.

495
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,121
Do Bong Soon and Choong Shik.

496
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,048
Why aren't any of the talented people
working for me?

497
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,718
Why? Huh?

498
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,538
- You're right.
- I'm talking about you guys.

499
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,922
I have to do something
to get him to make a move.

500
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:24,862
You shouldn't have used
the knife with him.

501
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:27,052
You can't do it like that.

502
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:29,973
Should we kill them all? They all died.

503
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:32,000
Who's calling now?

504
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,835
They really died.

505
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:39,075
Sister!

506
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:41,737
You're doing well, right?
I've been reading your blog.

507
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:45,025
- <i>Yes, Sister.</i>
- I have a favor to ask.

508
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:46,824
Yes, yes.

509
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,563
- I accept your orders.
- We accept them.

510
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:51,485
- Have a good day.
- Goodbye.

511
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:52,496
I love you.

512
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:57,436
Hey, she wants us to put up
a picture of that punk, Kim Jang Hyun.

513
00:43:57,437 --> 00:43:59,813
- She wants everyone to see.
- The order came directly from her?

514
00:43:59,814 --> 00:44:02,653
Then this is an order from the boss.

515
00:44:02,654 --> 00:44:06,650
Yes, this is our first real job.

516
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:08,827
- We shall catch him!
- Let's do it!

517
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:11,680
Let's go!

518
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,214
Come on!

519
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,925
That looks amazing.

520
00:44:15,926 --> 00:44:18,297
- Put it up.
- Press the button.

521
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:22,489
Good job, good job.

522
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:24,930
Hey.

523
00:44:28,323 --> 00:44:29,564
Have you seen him?

524
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:33,147
Have you seen him around here?

525
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:51,750
I think it's him.

526
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,771
Should I report it?

527
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:56,062
Hello. This is the police, right?

528
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:05,092
I need to buy something.

529
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,178
Okay.

530
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:15,468
It's kind of expensive.

531
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,183
Two more.

532
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:35,049
The gun is loaded.

533
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:41,659
It's from Russia.

534
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,270
The KGB uses this.

535
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:51,244
It's me. You know that guy Baek Ta's
guys are looking for?

536
00:45:51,245 --> 00:45:52,869
That guy with the warrant out for him.

537
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,689
He just came by here.

538
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:56,622
Yeah.

539
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,951
Oh, really?

540
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:01,426
Okay then.

541
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:06,485
Boss, Kwang Bok can't come to Seoul.

542
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:08,537
- Why?
- He went to his hometown.

543
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:10,787
He was walking around
because he was bored.

544
00:46:10,788 --> 00:46:13,813
He accidentally touched a beehive
and got attacked by bees.

545
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,131
All over his jaw, at that.

546
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:17,816
Did he commit treason in his past life?

547
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,028
He might as well die.

548
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:22,064
He has no luck at all.

549
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,345
It's Choong Shik calling.

550
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:25,669
Choong Shik.

551
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:27,986
What!

552
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,506
Okay.

553
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:32,072
Why are you getting angry?
Did he find him?

554
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:33,546
There are six guys in total.

555
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:38,989
For the 15th, one young guy chose the
time, ship number, and paid upfront.

556
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,043
I think it's him.

557
00:46:41,044 --> 00:46:43,854
- Then find out where he is.
- The problem is...

558
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:48,503
He bought a gun from Deuk Gu
at the pawn shop.

559
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:49,685
A gun?

560
00:46:50,616 --> 00:46:51,869
A long one.

561
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,104
A rifle.

562
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,895
Say it quickly all at once. Hurry up.

563
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:05,086
- Hello.
- <i>It's me.</i>

564
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:06,798
11:00 p.m. on the 15th.

565
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:09,206
It's a cargo ship heading to
Shandong, China.

566
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:12,480
But, he bought himself sniper rifle.

567
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:41,875
Do you need a bag?

568
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:00,586
<i>He asked if there's a reward
for calling in with the tip.</i>

569
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,126
It's not a prank call, right?

570
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:04,546
<i>I checked the CCTV,
and I'm sure it's him.</i>

571
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:05,614
Okay.

572
00:48:06,185 --> 00:48:07,822
He showed up at a store in Songdo.

573
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,666
He's already in that area?

574
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:10,924
The information was right.

575
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:12,525
He's getting ready to smuggle
himself out.

576
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:14,825
Still, he won't leave so quietly.

577
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:16,035
I think so too.

578
00:48:16,555 --> 00:48:19,503
The weapon he got is a sniper rifle.

579
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:23,415
He will hide somewhere and try to
shoot Bong Soon before leaving.

580
00:48:23,975 --> 00:48:26,963
He'll want to call Bong Soon out to
a place where it's easy to shoot her.

581
00:48:26,964 --> 00:48:30,231
We need to get him to a place we want,
and not where he wants.

582
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:31,566
That's how we can catch him.

583
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:34,653
How can you become more and more
fearless with each passing minute?

584
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:37,151
Don't worry. I'll do a good job.

585
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:38,775
I'm Do Bong Soon.

586
00:48:38,776 --> 00:48:40,912
Yes, you're Do Bong Soon,
not Wonder Woman.

587
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:43,332
Now, you're not even scared of guns.

588
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,810
Bong Soon, by any chance...

589
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:53,758
if he happens to call you,
you need to hurt his pride.

590
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,349
He can't handle being looked down on
by a woman.

591
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,910
That's when you need to tell him
to come to a place we choose.

592
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,367
Then hang up first.

593
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:02,627
He will take the bait.

594
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:04,703
Okay, I got it.

595
00:49:13,988 --> 00:49:17,526
According to the information
Gook Du has gathered...

596
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:22,425
he may be going from Incheon Port to
China's Shandong on the 15th.

597
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,441
There's a very high chance
this will happen.

598
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:26,699
This path goes to the trade ports.

599
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:32,523
We will be staking out this area here
very quietly.

600
00:49:32,524 --> 00:49:34,400
Then we'll get him, got it?

601
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:37,220
Please, let's get him this time.

602
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:39,397
- Yes.
- Let's go.

603
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:43,592
How can you sell something like this
in a neighborhood store?

604
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:44,787
It's not even cheap.

605
00:49:44,788 --> 00:49:48,619
The egg tarts smell like eggs.

606
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,847
That just means they're that fresh.

607
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:56,430
Egg tarts would smell like eggs.
Would it smell like sweet potatoes then?

608
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:59,263
Give me a refund right now.

609
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:01,774
What?

610
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:06,597
You ate four out of the dozen.

611
00:50:06,598 --> 00:50:09,543
It's not right to ask for a refund.

612
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:11,903
Just give me the refund.

613
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:15,744
Gosh, I was suffering
eating those yucky tarts.

614
00:50:15,745 --> 00:50:18,230
- It's yucky?
- Yes, it is.

615
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:22,133
Just refund it for her.
How much is it, anyway?

616
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:25,150
- How much do you want?
- It's 1,500 won per tart so...

617
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,068
No, don't do that.
This customer is saying nonsense.

618
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:30,820
You've done this before, too.
You're an expert at this.

619
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:32,970
- What did you say?
- I'll show you.

620
00:50:32,971 --> 00:50:34,403
This isn't the first time.

621
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:37,563
What makes you think
you can act this way?

622
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:39,135
What kind of person are you?

623
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,657
Yes, customer. It smelled like eggs.

624
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:45,079
It must have bothered you a lot.

625
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,117
Of course I will give you a refund.

626
00:50:48,118 --> 00:50:49,849
Soon, what are you doing?

627
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,619
Oh, you look so pretty today.

628
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,038
Really, you do.

629
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:59,166
Next time, I'll do a better job
making it for you.

630
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:02,280
Here you go. Thank you.

631
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:03,744
Come back again.

632
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:06,834
Your makeup looks so great today.

633
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:08,650
Please get home safely.

634
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,552
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

635
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:13,977
Yes. Thank you.

636
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,088
Oh, CEO Ahn.

637
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:19,451
- Hello.
- Oh, yes.

638
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,367
What about Bong Soon?

639
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:24,595
I dropped her off at home and
thought I should say hello to you.

640
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:25,821
Oh my!

641
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:29,388
My goodness.

642
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:32,130
I'm a friend of Bong Soon's mom.

643
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,579
CEO Ahn, shall we sit for a bit?

644
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,294
- Yes, of course.
- Sit, sit.

645
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,725
- Soon.
- Yes.

646
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:47,298
- What would you like?
- I'm fine.

647
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:49,338
You should drink something.

648
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,938
- Coffee?
- Sure.

649
00:51:50,939 --> 00:51:53,559
- An americano here.
- Okay.

650
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,718
I will make sure to bring Father
back home.

651
00:51:57,285 --> 00:51:58,592
What do you mean?

652
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:01,346
Bong Soon seems very worried.

653
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:05,163
Um...

654
00:52:05,712 --> 00:52:09,953
I just gave him freedom.

655
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:12,993
Freedom, freedom.

656
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:17,836
We have such deep love in
our relationship.

657
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:21,961
Every now and then,
we need to be apart.

658
00:52:21,962 --> 00:52:23,671
It's necessary.

659
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:26,173
It's not healthy if it's too passionate.

660
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:27,582
That's true.

661
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:31,555
By the way, CEO Ahn.

662
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:32,591
Yes.

663
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:42,181
Could you possibly tell me your birthday
and time of birth?

664
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:45,169
Why do you need to know, Mother?

665
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,343
Well, it's just...

666
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,622
Is it to check my marital harmony
with Bong Soon?

667
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:56,842
Well, not necessarily for that...

668
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:58,149
Please do that.

669
00:52:58,515 --> 00:53:00,802
And let me know the results.

670
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,797
If they say we're not a good match...

671
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:04,736
- If they say that?
- If they do?

672
00:53:05,455 --> 00:53:09,025
Keep going until you find we're a great
match, the perfect match!

673
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:10,967
Can you do so until you find
someone who says that?

674
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:13,491
Yes!

675
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,551
Amazing.

676
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:22,140
I knew I liked you.

677
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:24,146
I'm curious about it too.

678
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:26,154
- Right?
- Well, then...

679
00:53:26,658 --> 00:53:31,159
CEO Ahn, I need your birthday.

680
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,332
Shall we get your time of birth too?

681
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:36,201
We shall.

682
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:01,407
<i>I, Do Bong Soon, used my strength</i>

683
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:05,210
<i>to save three women and my friend,
Kyung Shim.</i>

684
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:12,020
<i>This time, I will make sure to catch the
kidnapper who took them.</i>

685
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,278
Hello.

686
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:43,448
<i>Somehow, you managed to live.</i>

687
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:45,837
Kim Jang Hyun?

688
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:49,951
Where are you?

689
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,281
Are you curious about where I am too?

690
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,092
Shouldn't we meet?

691
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:56,868
Why? You found your strength now.

692
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:58,968
You want to catch me now?

693
00:54:59,618 --> 00:55:03,615
You're not going to run out of fear
from a little girl like me, are you?

694
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:05,474
Scared of a mere girl?

695
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:07,474
You are scared.

696
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:09,604
You're no match for me.

697
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:11,610
You say I'm no match for you?

698
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,648
You can show up if you're confident.

699
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:15,979
You remember that construction site
we met at before?

700
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,600
I'll wait for you there tonight.

701
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:28,678
It's tonight.

702
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:34,602
Don't worry. I'll never get hurt.

703
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,511
Okay.

704
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,430
Hey, but I need some time too.

705
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,279
I need time to accept my girlfriend's
unique situation.

706
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,156
Look at me, okay?

707
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:03,649
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me.

708
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:14,971
Okay.

709
00:56:49,002 --> 00:56:52,421
<i>Kim Jang Hyun, I will catch you today.</i>

710
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:27,229
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

711
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,097
Yes.

712
00:57:29,098 --> 00:57:31,288
Kim Jang Hyun will be hiding
in a good place to shoot.

713
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:32,808
Be careful.

714
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:48,665
<i>Kim Jang Hyun,
stop hiding like a coward.</i>

715
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,843
<i>Face me in a proper fight.</i>

716
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,745
The roof, to the right.

717
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:04,070
Bong Soon, Bong Soon!

718
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:06,040
Bong Soon, are you okay? Bong Soon!

719
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,087
In Gook Du, follow Kim Jang Hyun.
I know where he's going.

720
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:55,403
<i>He decided to leave earlier.
He's going to Incheon Port tonight.</i>

721
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:56,511
Incheon Port.

722
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:30,942
Hey, Kim Jang Hyun.

723
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,245
The container to the left,
50 meters ahead of you.

724
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:45,504
Go around the right.

725
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,076
Head right from there.

726
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:25,910
<i>No, that's a dead end.</i>

727
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:34,368
Right from there.

728
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:37,839
Turn to the right.

729
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:41,678
You're almost there.

730
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:54,533
Okay!

731
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:19,410
But, you...

732
01:02:20,176 --> 01:02:22,202
I'm sure I shot you.

733
01:02:22,203 --> 01:02:25,654
I'm the type of person who won't be
satisfied until I complete my task.

734
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:33,767
This is a bulletproof vest.

735
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:35,743
Nothing will get through this.

736
01:02:36,736 --> 01:02:38,789
Bong Soon, Bong Soon!

737
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,828
Bong Soon, are you okay? Bong Soon!

738
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,600
Gosh...

739
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:45,700
This is strong.

740
01:02:46,223 --> 01:02:48,181
I'm going to go crazy.

741
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,151
In Gook Du, Bong Soon is safe.

742
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,310
- Get going.
- All right.

743
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:24,687
I told you that you're no match for me.

744
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,589
Oh, you're here.

745
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:13,890
Kim Jang Hyun!

746
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:20,107
Oh... nice shot.

747
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:36,384
<i>Kim Jang Hyun, you try being locked up.</i>

748
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:39,684
<i>You'll have to live forever
locked up like this.</i>

749
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:41,064
Hey!

750
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,894
<i>[Strong Woman Do Bong Soon]</i>

751
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:42,170
<i>Do you know what's different about him?</i>

752
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,494
<i>I see myself in his eyes.</i>

753
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:47,755
<i>When I see myself in his eyes,
I look so happy.</i>

754
01:05:47,756 --> 01:05:50,327
<i>Bong Soon is like me.</i>

755
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:52,737
<i>She has to be there in order for me
to feel like I exist.</i>

756
01:05:52,738 --> 01:05:54,926
<i>If she's not there,
I feel like I don't exist.</i>

757
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:57,137
<i>I like CEO Ahn.</i>

758
01:05:57,138 --> 01:05:58,518
<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

759
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,695
<i>You should fly free now.</i>

760
01:06:00,696 --> 01:06:03,637
<i>I don't think I can save the world
on my own.</i>

761
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:06,992
<i>I really want to make good use
of this strength I was given back.</i>

762
01:06:06,993 --> 01:06:10,238
<i>I wonder how I managed to fall in love
with such a great woman.</i>

763
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,242
<i>I'm going to protect you too, Min Hyuk.</i>

764
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:14,051
<i>Like a girl
standing in front of a dungeon.</i>
