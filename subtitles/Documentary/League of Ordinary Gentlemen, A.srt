1
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,111
Moorgate Passage.

2
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,247
Moorgate Passage.

3
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,959
I see it over there!

4
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,468
Bleeding rat-wags!
What's gotten into them?

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,521
What in God's name is that?

6
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,735
Halt!

7
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,282
Halt!

8
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,078
-Blimey!
-Stop!

9
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,830
-Come on!
-Halt!

10
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,665
In the name of the law!

11
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,004
-Halt!
-How the hell do we stop this thing?

12
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,798
I said, halt!

13
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,302
Here.

14
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,138
Careful, mates. Careful.

15
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,145
There's men inside!

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,252
Please.

17
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,785
Bring the scientist with us.
Kill any who resist.

18
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,831
Do we have him?

19
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,043
Draper at your service, sir.

20
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,257
The world, Herr Draper.
I want the world.

21
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,683
Really?
That's so frightening.

22
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't wander off.

23
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,579
Where's Quatermain?

24
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,458
That gentleman at the back.

25
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,890
Do I have the pleasure of addressing
Allan Quatermain?

26
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,895
Yes, you do, sir. Indeed you do.

27
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,856
You're not what I expected.

28
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,150
I presume you're another traveler...

29
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,362
...got it in your head
to sample the Dark Continent.

30
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,074
And while you're at it,
hunt down old Allan Quatermain...

31
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,701
...and have him tell his adventures.

32
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,497
-Well...
-You just fill a seat, sir.

33
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:57,292
You can fill my glass.
Bruce, double.

34
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,634
I'll regale you with how I found King
Solomon's Mines, or I could relate my...

35
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,096
It is not your past that interests me.

36
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,390
My name is Sanderson Reed.

37
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,227
I am a representative
of Her Majesty's British government.

38
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,979
The empire needs you.

39
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,898
But the question is...

40
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,192
...do I need the empire?

41
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,737
Perhaps I should toddle off.
Should l, Allan?

42
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,990
Yes, of course, Nigel, you toddle off.

43
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,075
Toddling.

44
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:35,539
Nigel is useful for keeping
the story seekers at bay.

45
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,708
I'm Quatermain.

46
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,711
The empire is in peril.

47
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:47,176
You're probably too young to know,
but the empire is always in some peril.

48
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,263
We need you to lead a team
of unique men like yourself...

49
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,349
...to combat this threat.

50
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,395
Regale me.

51
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:03,609
There is great unrest, countries set at
each other's throats, baying for blood.

52
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,613
The trouble of which I speak could
set a match to the whole thing. War.

53
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,825
-With whom, exactly?
-Everyone.

54
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,911
A world war.

55
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:19,499
-That notion makes you sweat?
-Heavens, man, doesn't it you?

56
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,960
This is Africa, dear boy.

57
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,755
Sweating is what we do.

58
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,008
Where is your sense of patriotism?

59
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,428
God save the queen.

60
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,598
-God save the queen. God bless her.
-God save the queen.

61
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,851
That's about as patriotic
as it gets around here.

62
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,312
But you're Allan Quatermain.

63
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,733
Stories of your exploits have thrilled
English boys for decades.

64
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,906
That I know, and Nigel has done
a grand job reminding me.

65
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:56,036
But with each past exploit...

66
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,998
...I've lost friends.
White men and black...

67
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,584
...and much more.

68
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,296
And I am not the man I once was.

69
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,550
The gentleman over there.

70
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,511
-We're in for the long haul.
-Exactly.

71
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,055
-Mr. Quatermain?
-Why, yes indeed, sir.

72
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,896
Wrong Quatermain.

73
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,273
That's him.

74
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,777
Get down!

75
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,448
-They're indestructible.
-No, just armor-plated.

76
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,798
Automatic rifles? Who in God's name
has automatic rifles?

77
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,135
That's unsporting. Probably Belgium.

78
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,993
Allan!

79
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,801
Wicked waste.

80
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,679
Look out!

81
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,123
Good old Britannia.

82
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,085
Wasn't there another one
of these buggers?

83
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,294
Mr. Quatermain!

84
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,632
Bruce, Matilda.

85
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,429
Our friend might have some information.

86
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,060
But he's so far away.

87
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,480
Yes, I thought he was.

88
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,943
God, I hate getting old.

89
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,416
-Did you mean to just wound him?
-Obviously.

90
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,423
Stop him! I need information!

91
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,222
Bloody poison.

92
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,854
You may have no love for the empire,
but I know you love Africa.

93
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,024
A war in Europe will spread
to its colonies.

94
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:26,121
It appears the war has arrived.

95
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,499
Very well, Reed...

96
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,877
...I'm in.

97
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,713
Excellent.

98
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,799
Pack for an English summer.

99
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,865
You made good time getting here.

100
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:48,036
Not as good as Phileas Fogg,
Around the World in 80 Days.

101
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,478
Where are we going, Australia?

102
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,740
And here we are, sir.

103
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't like theatrics.

104
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:52,643
After Africa's veldts, London's weather
isn't helping your mood, I see.

105
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,895
Identify yourself.

106
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,065
I'm known by many names,
Mr. Quatermain.

107
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,236
My underlings call me sir.
My superiors call me M.

108
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,446
M?

109
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,782
Just M.

110
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:12,120
I must say, the delight is mine,
meeting so notable a recruit...

111
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,458
...to this newest generation of the
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

112
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,751
League of what?

113
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,879
There have been times
when a danger upon the world...

114
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,842
...required the services
of singular individuals.

115
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,010
How very curious.

116
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,973
This museum is full of the curious.

117
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,934
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo.

118
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,020
I know of Mr. Quatermain.

119
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,648
And I know of you, captain.

120
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,526
Rumor has it that you're a pirate.

121
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,612
I'd prefer a less provocative title.

122
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,532
-I'm sure you would.
-Gentlemen, please.

123
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,951
Nations are striking at nations.

124
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,580
Every attack marked by the use
of highly advanced weaponry.

125
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,624
These attacks
are all the work of one man...

126
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,546
-...who calls himself the Fantom.
-Very operatic. What's in it for him?

127
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,006
Profit.

128
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:09,136
Those machines are his creations, the
work of scientists he holds imprisoned.

129
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,973
His attacks have nations clamoring
for the weapons that assail them.

130
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,144
-Then it's a race for arms.
-And millions will perish.

131
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,482
There's one last chance to avert war.

132
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,028
The leaders of Europe
are to meet secretly in Venice.

133
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:30,574
And you believe that this Fantom
will attack that conference?

134
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,950
If he can find it.

135
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:36,538
We need a team to stop him in Venice.
This team consists of six members.

136
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,834
-You'll have four days.
-Four days to get to Venice?

137
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,629
-It's impossible.
-Let me worry about that.

138
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,426
Well now,
extraordinary gentlemen indeed.

139
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,303
One of them is late.

140
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,724
-Harker, the chemist.
-Oh, chemist, eh?

141
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,310
Do we get to blow something up then?

142
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,564
My eyesight must be worse
than I thought.

143
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,108
No, your eyesight's fine.

144
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,948
No games, M.

145
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,285
Some time ago, a talented,
albeit misguided, man of science...

146
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,788
...discovered the means
to become invisible.

147
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:22,918
-Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
-Well, he did, but his process didn't.

148
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,839
You see, I stole it,
and here I stand for all to see.

149
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,008
-Is this some parlor game?
-Believe it.

150
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,928
Easy now, Allan.

151
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,182
I'm feeling a bit of a draft
in my nether regions.

152
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,144
And I must say, it's quite refreshing.

153
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:47,860
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief.

154
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:53,574
Now, I thought invisibility
would be a boon to my work.

155
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,120
Well, you can imagine,
it was my undoing.

156
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:02,583
Once you're invisible,
it's bloody hard to turn back.

157
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,585
We finally caught him.

158
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,714
And they'll provide an antidote.
Well, that's if I'm a good boy.

159
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,465
And are you a good boy?

160
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,512
I guess you'll find out, won't you?

161
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,435
Am I late?

162
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,896
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.

163
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,275
Please tell me this is Harker's wife
with a sick note.

164
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:33,280
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.

165
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,617
Gentlemen, Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker.

166
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,079
Mina's prior acquaintance
with a reluctant League member...

167
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,541
-...may prove useful.
-I'm waiting to be impressed.

168
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,879
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are two more members to recruit.

169
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,633
-The clock hands turn, gentlemen.
-Kicking us out already?

170
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,928
A moment ago,
it was sherry and giggles.

171
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:12,945
-What in God's name is that?
-I call it an automobile.

172
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,656
Yeah, but what is it?

173
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,450
The future, gentlemen.

174
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,286
The future.

175
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,458
-This is my first mate.
-Call me Ishmael. Please.

176
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,949
So how did M get you?

177
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,784
None of your business.

178
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,539
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.

179
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:10,919
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure
danger the way I do.

180
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,715
And I imagine you with quite the library,
Mr. Quatermain.

181
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:18,635
All those books you must have read
merely by looking at their covers.

182
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:24,016
I've had women along on past exploits
and found them to be, at best...

183
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,477
-...a distraction.
-Do I distract you?

184
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:32,107
My dear girl, I've buried two wives
and many lovers...

185
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,652
...and I'm in no mood
for more of either.

186
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,490
-You can send them my way...
-Skinner, shut up.

187
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,620
-Shall I wait, captain?
-No, bring my lady to me.

188
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,667
This is a charming spot.

189
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,545
Does Jack the Ripper live here?

190
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,433
-Good evening.
-Mr. Dorian Gray?

191
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:52,479
-I am indeed.
-We came by way of M.

192
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,567
M for mystery.

193
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,321
Well, I've told him and I'm telling you,
I'm not interested.

194
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,156
Dorian.

195
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,329
Mina?

196
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,258
Charming decor.

197
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,844
You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.

198
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,346
And you don't miss a thing,
do you?

199
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,765
Oh, sometimes.

200
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,856
Scotch, anyone?

201
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,608
Please, help yourself.

202
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,652
Don't let it ruin your makeup.

203
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:46,909
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take
Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.

204
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:51,580
Yes, well, I've seen too much
in my life to shock easily.

205
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,084
Although, I must say
I was surprised to see you again.

206
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,004
Well, our last parting
was such sweet sorrow.

207
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,675
So you're nothing more
than an enticement.

208
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,554
Nevertheless,
your presence intrigues me.

209
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,226
They say you're indestructible,
Quatermain.

210
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:16,271
Well, a witch doctor
did bless me once.

211
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,941
I had saved his village.

212
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:24,321
He said Africa
would never allow me to die.

213
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,865
But you're not in Africa now.

214
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:28,742
No.

215
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,247
I confess a curiosity as to what
the files say about Mr. Gray.

216
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,251
We, all of us, have traits useful
in this endeavor.

217
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:42,756
A hunter, scientist,
even Skinner has stealth.

218
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,384
-Cheers.
-What have you?

219
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,928
I have experience.

220
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:53,600
Gray and I have met before,
many years ago at Eton College.

221
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,477
A lecture, no doubt.

222
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:59,940
You, the nation's hero,
Dorian, the eager listening boy.

223
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,859
Quite the reverse.

224
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,195
It was Gray visiting Eton...

225
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,532
...and I was the boy.

226
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,082
What is it?

227
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:31,430
-Gray?
-They are not mine.

228
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,640
They're mine.

229
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,609
First meetings usually
warrant introductions.

230
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:48,238
Of course. I am the Fantom.

231
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:55,078
You are the League of so-called
Extraordinary Gentlemen.

232
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,623
Introductions made.

233
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:03,795
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quatermain,
not blind.

234
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,130
Drop the gun.

235
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:13,347
Your mission is to stop me.
That, of course, I cannot permit.

236
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:17,601
So I give to you all a special
one-time invitation.

237
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,811
Join me.

238
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,065
You think we'll help start a war
that will consume the planet?

239
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:26,568
While you profit
from your arms race?

240
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:31,698
I cannot deny that fortunes
are made in war.

241
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:36,745
Imagine the riches
a world war will yield.

242
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,957
-He's not wrong.
-Speak for yourself.

243
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,694
Draw your pistol!

244
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,780
I walk a different path.

245
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,256
Run, James!

246
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,312
Hang on.

247
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,446
Night-night.

248
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,472
Dorian!

249
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,198
What are you?

250
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,409
I'm complicated.

251
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,141
Damn.

252
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:49,521
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.

253
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,357
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Mina?

254
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:55,694
Oh, she's probably hip-deep
in some sort of trouble.

255
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,114
Don't be such an alarmist, Mr. Q.

256
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,950
And my hips
are none of your business.

257
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,623
Shoot!

258
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,083
Go on!

259
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,717
I guessed as much, that they
would do anything to protect you.

260
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,387
See, now that's your biggest mistake.

261
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,766
Thinking that I need them
to protect me.

262
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,452
Extraordinary.

263
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,958
Boy, they told me European women
had funny ways.

264
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,628
You missed a spot.

265
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,258
Excuse me.

266
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,052
And you are?

267
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,764
Special Agent Sawyer
of the American Secret Service.

268
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,308
Then America is aware
of the situation?

269
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,688
If war starts in Europe, how long
will it take until it crosses the Atlantic?

270
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,317
I followed you. I knocked out a straggler,
and I took his place.

271
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:22,531
Very noble. But this is a private party,
and you're not invited.

272
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,326
Actually, Dorian has declined...

273
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,912
...so we are one shy of a full deck.

274
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,458
On the contrary, the battle
was just the spur I needed.

275
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,295
That and the thrill
of a friendship renewed.

276
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,133
So you're not needed.

277
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,640
-Winchester.
-That's right.

278
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,311
-It's modified, American style.
-American-style shooting too.

279
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,564
Well, whatever it takes.

280
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,735
You like it, I brought two.

281
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:03,906
You're in.

282
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,913
-So, what's the next port of call?
-Paris.

283
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,624
Just one last member to recruit.

284
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,753
Capture is more the word,
and it will be quite a hunt.

285
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,255
You make him sound like
some kind of animal.

286
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:25,844
Oh, speaking thus, Mrs. Harker,
your conduct a moment ago...?

287
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:31,225
Indeed. We are all aquiver
with curiosity.

288
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,312
Well...

289
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,485
My husband was Jonathan Harker.

290
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:45,405
With a professor named Van Helsing,
we fought a dangerous evil.

291
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:51,245
It had a name, Dracula.
He was Transylvanian.

292
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,372
European?

293
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:57,501
One of those radicals the newspapers
love to report on?

294
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,212
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.

295
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:08,136
Is the vampiric sucking of people's
blood radical behavior?

296
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,898
Our transportation is forthcoming.

297
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,692
A boat?

298
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:26,113
It travels on water,
if that's what you mean.

299
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:33,537
And beneath it.

300
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:58,270
Behold Nautilus,
the Sword of the Ocean.

301
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,693
Next stop, Paris.

302
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,830
I don't see what we need
a big monkey for.

303
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,918
Well, this big monkey has terrorized
the Rue Morgue for months.

304
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:24,963
Imagine the mayhem
he'll give the enemy.

305
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,597
-You missed!
-I'm not trying to hit him.

306
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:37,476
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.

307
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,069
Make him turn left, boy.

308
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,576
If you can't do it with one bullet,
don't do it at all.

309
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,372
-He's doubled back.
-Precisely. Come on.

310
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,461
Look out!

311
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,423
That was naughty.

312
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:14,096
-Thanks.
-Eyes open, boy.

313
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,849
I can't protect you all the time.

314
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,479
He's afraid.

315
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,232
I can't smell anything.

316
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,600
Perfect.

317
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,311
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hyde.

318
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:15,324
"This hunt's too dangerous for a woman,
even one such as you. Leave it to me."

319
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,124
Good God.

320
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,552
Hello, Dorian.

321
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:39,473
The great white hunter's
bagged his prize.

322
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,810
Or the prize bagged him.

323
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,192
Stay back, if you value your life.

324
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,374
-You scratched me.
-Better me than him.

325
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,587
Well, this is nice.

326
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:13,507
Mr. Hyde.

327
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,301
You've done terrible things in England.

328
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:21,056
So terrible that you fled the country.

329
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:25,227
Now, I'm ashamed to say that
Her Majesty's government...

330
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:29,481
...is willing to offer you amnesty...

331
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:32,651
...in return for your services.

332
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,405
Do you want to go home?

333
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:38,657
Home?

334
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,536
"Home's where the heart is, "
that's what they say.

335
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,581
And I have been missing London so.

336
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:50,085
Its sorrow is as sweet
to me as a rare wine.

337
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,924
I am yours.

338
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,638
Don't be afraid.

339
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,100
-Who says I'm afraid?
-You do!

340
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,644
You stink of fear!

341
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,608
Quite the parlor trick.

342
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,945
You wait till you see my next one.

343
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,164
Dr. Jekyll...

344
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,250
...at your service.

345
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,965
So...

346
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,509
...the League is set.

347
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,851
So is the date for the conference.

348
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,937
-We have three days.
-Three days?

349
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,940
Can this canoe do that?

350
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:39,945
You underestimate the Nautilus, sir.

351
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,282
You underestimate her greatly.

352
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,188
She's out of your league.

353
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,694
Mina?

354
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:26,325
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.

355
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,747
Fortune rewards the bold.

356
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:39,129
If you require help during the voyage,
Mrs. Harker, just let me know.

357
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:43,634
I'm curious how you think
you'll assist me, Agent Sawyer.

358
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,261
Heavy lifting.

359
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,684
Light banter.

360
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:56,230
-I'm a useful kind of guy.
-You're sweet.

361
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,774
And you're young.

362
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,277
Neither are traits that I hold
in high regard.

363
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:13,080
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.

364
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:16,250
Mr. Quatermain.

365
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,086
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Skinner.

366
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,673
-Captain.
-Nemo.

367
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,874
The plans the Fantom stole from
the Bank of England. These are copies.

368
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,294
Da Vinci's blueprints of Venice.

369
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,591
Its foundations...

370
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,968
...and waterways.

371
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,723
So he'll attack the conference by sea.

372
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,451
Easy, Allan, easy.

373
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:37,372
Skinner! I want you dressed
at all times!

374
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,627
Or it's my boot up your ass!

375
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,803
Dinner is served, Mr. Quatermain.

376
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,223
I can offer you a jacket,
if you require.

377
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,183
Oh, thank you, no.

378
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:01,271
But thank you for your
contributions so far.

379
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:07,611
I may have been overly rude earlier...

380
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,947
...when I called you a pirate.

381
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:14,701
And I may have been overly charitable
when I said I wasn't.

382
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,246
But I try to live in the now...

383
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:21,458
...where the ghosts of old wrongs
do not abide. What of you?

384
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,753
I don't believe in ghosts,
although I've seen my share.

385
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,506
Your past haunts you.

386
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,596
Vanity, pride...

387
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:40,936
...mistakes that cost me someone dear.

388
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,773
So now you throw yourself
in harm's way?

389
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,444
Old tigers, sensing the end,
they're at their most fierce.

390
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,948
And they go down fighting.

391
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,515
They're not how I left them, captain.

392
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,977
That's all I'm saying.

393
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,274
Powder?

394
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,652
You think sabotage?

395
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,238
We ain't that far off course.

396
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,052
Did you want something?

397
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,805
No, I was just wondering why
you signed up for all this.

398
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,769
Nemo told me you hate
the British Empire.

399
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,896
They called, and I answered.

400
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,066
Yeah, well that ain't all of it,
though, is it?

401
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:16,990
Sorry I asked.

402
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,710
A few years ago...

403
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:33,048
...the British approached me with
a mission for queen and country.

404
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,093
That sounds like the morning ride
to work for you.

405
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:39,429
I signed on without hesitation.

406
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:41,932
I even took my son along.

407
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:47,312
I led and my son followed.

408
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:50,983
He died in my arms.

409
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:59,783
After that, I washed my hands
of England and the empire and...

410
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:05,998
...the legend of
Allan-bloody-Quatermain.

411
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:16,842
Now...

412
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:19,887
...would you like to learn how to shoot?

413
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:25,058
-I can already.
-I saw, it was very American.

414
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:29,188
Fire enough bullets and hope
to hit the target.

415
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,942
Sawyer, I'm talking about
pipping the ace...

416
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,612
...at 900 yards.

417
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,365
Try.

418
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:46,413
Easy, easy.

419
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,632
-Aim.
-That's easy.

420
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,759
Allow for wind, target movement.

421
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:02,429
-Yeah, that's easy too.
-This is the part that's not.

422
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,224
You have to feel the shot.

423
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,851
Take your time with it.

424
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,354
You have all the time you need.

425
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:14,191
All the time in the world.

426
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,528
Take your...

427
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:21,448
Too soon.

428
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:25,869
But that was bloody close.
And at 500 yards too.

429
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,579
Again.

430
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:39,341
Did you teach your son
to shoot like this?

431
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,014
Quatermain?

432
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,725
That's Kali.

433
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,811
Goddess of death.

434
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:37,482
Nemo worships death,
can we trust him?

435
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,321
He's not the one I'm worried about.

436
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,595
Mina.

437
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,308
I'm identifying a powder
that Nemo found.

438
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:15,729
Magnesium phosphorus.

439
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:18,899
Photographers use it to create a flash.

440
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,442
A camera, perhaps?

441
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:24,488
It appears that someone wishes
to capture this vessel's secrets.

442
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:35,457
I was surprised you ultimately
joined the League.

443
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:42,256
I mean to undo the flaws
in my character.

444
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,758
I want to face my demons.

445
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,344
And what do you know of demons?

446
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:56,353
Do you recall a space
on the wall of my home?

447
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:59,189
A picture was missing.

448
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,901
Although the picture is my portrait...

449
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,281
...I doubt you'd recognize
the face upon it.

450
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:12,244
Every year that passes,
my portrait ages...

451
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:14,538
...instead of me.

452
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,333
When did you last see it?

453
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:23,380
I dare not look upon it myself...

454
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:27,009
...or the magic of the painting
would be undone.

455
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,854
Nightcap?

456
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:41,982
I'm not much of a drinker.

457
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,663
Just a small one then.

458
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,547
How clumsy of me.

459
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,966
We don't want blood everywhere.

460
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:11,345
-Do we?
-No.

461
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,347
Not blood.

462
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:23,607
Yes, Henry. Look, but don't touch.

463
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,735
That's your way.

464
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,072
Just shut up.

465
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,324
-I won't be tricked again.
-Tricked?

466
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,827
You've known what I was about
each time you drank the formula.

467
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,121
Liar! I'm a good man, a good man!

468
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,874
Well, who's lying now?
You want it!

469
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,878
Even more than you want her.
You can't shut me out forever!

470
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,547
-Drink the elixir!
-No!

471
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,007
-She barely even looks at you!
-Be quiet!

472
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:52,553
She looked at me!

473
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,724
Contain your evil, doctor!

474
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:02,437
I'll not have the brute free
upon my ship.

475
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,273
Must I take drastic steps?

476
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,818
-I am in control.
-I very much doubt it.

477
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:13,073
Your talk is all well and good, sir,
but your own past is far from laudable.

478
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,051
Let me out.

479
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,185
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I already had.

480
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:45,022
One of the vials is missing.

481
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,025
Oh, God.

482
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:54,531
So it's clear. With da Vinci's blueprints
and enough explosives...

483
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:58,744
...he could set a bomb that would
blow Venice's foundations to rubble.

484
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:03,874
-He's gonna sink the whole city.
-Yes, and spark off his world war.

485
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,753
I'm afraid that's not the sum
of our problems.

486
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:14,635
Skinner, he's taken a vial
of my formula.

487
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:18,013
-Are you sure?
-Who else?

488
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,433
You've seen the way
the sneaky blackguard operates.

489
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,983
It's the carnival.

490
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:13,694
My God, we must locate that bomb.

491
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,466
We can go no further, captain.

492
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,092
All ahead, stop.

493
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,828
Deploy the divers beneath the city.

494
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,207
-The explosives must be found.
-Aye, aye, sir.

495
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:53,377
The city is vast. It could be anywhere.

496
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,047
-What about Skinner?
-I'd be alert for his treachery.

497
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,228
Bloody carnival.

498
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:13,981
God, I feared the worst.

499
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:15,899
It's all right. We still have...

500
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,123
-The buildings are falling like dominoes!
-We're too late!

501
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,960
There must be more than one bomb.

502
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,296
Nemo!

503
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:41,592
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.

504
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,179
-Get ahead and destroy the next building!
-Interrupt the chain!

505
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:49,850
With a beacon at the coordinates, I could
launch a rocket and take out the domino.

506
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:53,020
That's ridiculous!
We'd never get there in time.

507
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,940
-No room for error, but it could work.
-What are you talking about?

508
00:55:57,149 --> 00:56:01,528
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle.
How can we outrun this?

509
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,621
Care for a spin?

510
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,667
Come on, Jekyll, get in!

511
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:18,170
-I'll need coordinates.
-Can you track this?

512
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:20,339
-Of course.
-Then this is the target.

513
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:22,549
-Launch when you see the flare.
-Right.

514
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:26,261
-Jekyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
-No!

515
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,931
Hyde will never use me again.

516
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:31,391
Then what good are you?

517
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,532
Straight ahead, then turn left.

518
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,117
No, no, take a right
after the canal ports.

519
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:51,912
We must turn left to get ahead of the...

520
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:55,624
Snipers!

521
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,962
Damn Skinner, he must have
told them we were coming.

522
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,938
Dorian!

523
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:25,153
-Can't get a clear shot!
-Then take the wheel!

524
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,115
Sawyer!

525
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:36,498
Sit down, you buffoon. I don't know
how to drive this bloody thing!

526
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,251
Get down!

527
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:41,670
Got it!

528
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:45,382
Save your bullets. These men are mine!

529
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,553
Did you see that?

530
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:55,350
-Did you see what she just did?
-Keep your eyes on the road!

531
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,069
It's a gauntlet!

532
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,823
The vampire lady has us covered!

533
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:44,983
The collapse has reached the carnival.
Time's running out.

534
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,319
Tune the tracer to the car's frequency.

535
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:50,489
-The rocket must be ready to launch.
-Aye, aye, captain.

536
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:11,343
Come on, Sawyer, come on!

537
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,555
-Captain, we must pull out!
-No, we stay and do our job!

538
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:24,481
Remember the flare. I'm off!

539
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:28,610
-What?
-Don't forget, you're the target.

540
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,304
-We'll be smashed apart!
-Nemo says we stay, we stay.

541
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:06,190
He's overtaken the collapse!
Be ready to launch!

542
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,289
Launch!

543
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,261
Bravo, boy.

544
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:02,788
He's done it.

545
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,897
Venice still stands.

546
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,114
You've failed.

547
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:46,748
You see yourself as the brave
John Bull.

548
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:51,545
But you're weak.

549
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:56,842
You run from the memory
of your son's death.

550
01:01:57,217 --> 01:02:00,679
You should have trained him
a little better.

551
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:08,604
You may as well have put the gun to
his head and pulled the trigger yourself.

552
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:14,943
Oh, yes, I know all about you.

553
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,449
I know all about your spy.

554
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,576
Do you?

555
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:29,499
Mr. Gray? What happened?

556
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:32,294
Misadventure. Have the others returned?

557
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,797
You're the first, hopefully not the last.

558
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:39,718
That bastard, Skinner.
A lot to answer for.

559
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,679
Skinner? No.

560
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:44,765
Me.

561
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:05,911
You?

562
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,623
You don't know the half of it.

563
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,682
The Fantom is M.

564
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,143
And the hunt is still on.

565
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,938
-What are you talking about?
-The Fantom is M...

566
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,607
-...the man who recruited us.
-Let me see that.

567
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:38,694
-But how?
-We'll get our answers.

568
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,989
-Where are the others?
-Dorian's missing in action.

569
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:47,744
And Mr. Skinner must have fled
when he realized we knew.

570
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,206
And Sawyer?

571
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:54,293
He'll live to fight another day.

572
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:04,469
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats
for this evening.

573
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,433
Captain!

574
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,027
It was Gray...

575
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,987
...not Skinner.

576
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:27,159
Gray has tricked us all.

577
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:40,964
What is it?

578
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:43,592
The sound of treachery!

579
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:00,275
What is that thing?

580
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:03,028
My exploration pod.

581
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:25,217
-We could track it.
-I intend to catch it!

582
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:06,633
That is us.

583
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,802
That is the Nautiloid.

584
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,346
We will be upon them soon.

585
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,391
You okay?

586
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:17,477
Just a little shaken.

587
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,698
Nemo?

588
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:32,242
It's nothing of mine.

589
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:38,665
Captain, the noise came from this.

590
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:40,834
A recording disk?

591
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,637
Ready, professor?

592
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,806
Recording.

593
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,895
Gentlemen, if you're hearing this...

594
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:03,065
...then every step leading up to it
has gone as planned.

595
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,692
And I have been true
to the goals set to me.

596
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,444
Yes, it's me, Dorian.

597
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:10,781
As you know by now,
I'm no loyal son of the Empire.

598
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:14,493
My loyalty to Mr. M comes
in no small part from his possession...

599
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,746
...of something I hold very dear
to my heart...

600
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:20,374
...something I would do anything
to regain.

601
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:23,126
-Are you all right?
-My ears hurt. It's nothing.

602
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,921
Everything so far
has been misdirection.

603
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,924
Sanderson Reed,
the assassins in Kenya...

604
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:32,928
...your recruitment and mission,
the secret conference, a myth.

605
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:37,057
Even the League itself. There is
no League. There never was.

606
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:39,852
It was a ruse to get me closer
to my goals.

607
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,062
He likes the sound of his own voice.

608
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:45,732
You see, I want you, each of you,
even tired old Quatermain.

609
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,485
He'll capture Hyde
where all others have failed.

610
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,572
The question is why.
Why all this mask and mystery?

611
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,368
Because in the war to come, I intend
to wield the greatest weapon of all:

612
01:07:56,535 --> 01:07:58,745
The power of the League itself.

613
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:02,583
Turn it off, Henry.
Please, turn it off.

614
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:06,879
To that end, I set my wolf
among you sheep...

615
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,297
Growl.

616
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:11,300
... who'll gain your trust,
quietly lead you astray.

617
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:15,220
And all the while, I'll collect you,
the parts of you I need.

618
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,264
Nemo's science.

619
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:18,765
Magnesium phosphorus.

620
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:21,059
Skinner's skin sample.

621
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:23,687
You scratched me.

622
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:26,148
Jekyll's potion.

623
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:30,485
And Mina's blood.

624
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:35,908
He's stolen us, and we let him.

625
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:39,411
If you fail to save Venice,
then I get my war.

626
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,288
And if you succeed...

627
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:45,167
... well, it's a small price to pay
for Gray to go about his task.

628
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,170
War will come, sooner or later...

629
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:50,672
...as inevitable as summer into autumn.

630
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:54,426
Now, some of you, perhaps Quatermain
if he isn't dead...

631
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:57,596
... will pause to ask why I'm letting
you know all this.

632
01:08:57,763 --> 01:09:00,766
What fool reveals his stratagem
before the game is over?

633
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:05,270
It is over, for you...

634
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:08,357
...because my voice isn't
the only sound being made.

635
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:13,612
While I've rambled on, a secondary layer
of inaudible sound...

636
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,908
...higher than humans can hear,
audible to dogs and lower animals...

637
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:23,539
...has been heard by crystal sensors
dotted about your vessel.

638
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:26,917
Sensors attached to bombs.

639
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,462
"Bomb" voyage.

640
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,719
Out of the way!

641
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:21,305
We have to surface!

642
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:24,391
We're taking in water!
Controls are not responding!

643
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,562
Primary engine room almost full!
Aft bulkhead open. Pump valves jammed!

644
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,772
-Seal it off!
-There are men in there!

645
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:34,610
For the greater good, we must seal it!

646
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,039
We can do it, Henry.

647
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:48,832
What are you talking about?

648
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:52,586
You know we can do it, together!

649
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:04,973
Seal it! Seal it up!

650
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,392
Wait!

651
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:10,145
Don't close it!

652
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:12,981
-What are you doing?
-It's our last chance.

653
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,192
But I'm ordered to close it!

654
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,110
Then close it.

655
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:20,322
Seal it up.

656
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:38,358
Bravo, Edward. Bravo!

657
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:14,478
Let's not make a saint out of a sinner.
Next time, he may not be so helpful.

658
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:17,689
Can we still follow Gray?

659
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:22,945
Well, we were the faster,
but now we're the tortoise to his hare.

660
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:26,573
-So we're done?
-No, we're alive.

661
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,619
If M has any ideas to the contrary,
that gives us an edge.

662
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:33,664
We're getting a signal.

663
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,626
Morse code.

664
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:40,295
-What's it say?
-"Hello, my freaky darlings."

665
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:41,713
Skinner?

666
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:46,301
"Hiding onboard little fish
with Gray and M.

667
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:52,391
On way to base, east by northeast.
Follow my lead."

668
01:14:46,737 --> 01:14:48,822
Good work...

669
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:50,741
...all of you.

670
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:53,076
Captain?

671
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:55,621
All ahead, full!

672
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,347
If Skinner's headings are correct...

673
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:17,100
... we will pass through
the treacherous Straits of Tartary...

674
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:20,020
...and enter the Amur River,
which empties out...

675
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:26,777
...into the frozen lakes of Mongolia,
virtually inaccessible to outsiders.

676
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:58,600
Peasant settlements.

677
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,477
They're all deserted.

678
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:03,063
Why deserted?

679
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:08,277
Fear, no doubt.

680
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:40,434
M's summer retreat.

681
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,353
This is where Skinner signaled
he'd meet us.

682
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,314
So we wait.

683
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:12,716
Skinner?

684
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:56,218
-We heard a noise.
-It was nothing.

685
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:07,312
Just an old tiger sensing his end.

686
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:11,817
Perhaps this was not his time
to die after all.

687
01:18:16,613 --> 01:18:20,200
-I've been waiting all week to do that.
-Get a grip, man.

688
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,786
Well, I thought I just did.

689
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:25,747
Mina.

690
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:28,959
-Report!
-Well, hello to you too.

691
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:32,504
And need I remind you,
I am naked in the snow.

692
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:38,010
I can't feel any of my extremities,
and I mean any of them.

693
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,933
With all the suspicion on the ship...

694
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,853
...I knew you wouldn't believe
I wasn't the spy.

695
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,856
I thought it was best to disappear.

696
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:52,941
So, what are we dealing with?

697
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,194
The fortress is vast.

698
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:00,199
Furnaces produce iron for making
M's weapons of destruction.

699
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:14,213
They're pieced together on the factory
floor by a private army of ruthless men...

700
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:16,590
... who share his vision.

701
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,887
But the worst was to come.

702
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:28,769
In the dry dock, M's best minds
pervert Nemo's dream.

703
01:19:30,687 --> 01:19:33,982
-The Nautilus?
-Nautili. There's eight, for now.

704
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:37,986
-What about the kidnapped scientists?
-M holds their families hostage.

705
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:42,115
The men work,
or the women and children die.

706
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:45,577
-Monstrous!
-That isn't the half of it.

707
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:49,957
The scientists are forced to work night
and day to make new versions of us.

708
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:54,795
Invisible spies, an army of Hydes,
vampiric assassins.

709
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:58,298
M leaves for Europe today
with a sample of the chemicals...

710
01:19:58,465 --> 01:20:01,093
...to sell to the most eager nation.

711
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:06,139
-I'll not let my evil infect the world.
-Do you think any of us feel differently?

712
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,225
Chimney pipes laced to buildings...

713
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:11,562
...and bombs in the furnaces
would make quite a bang.

714
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:16,692
But someone needs to blow that place
to hell, and I am least likely to be seen.

715
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:21,488
Skinner, I didn't know that you were
such a bare-faced liar.

716
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:25,117
All that time pretending
that you weren't a hero?

717
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:27,744
Shut up, or I'll come to my senses.

718
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:33,292
And besides, any more like me,
and I'll lose the franchise.

719
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:39,840
No, this cannot be a hunt
to the death, more's the pity.

720
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:44,178
We must take M alive
if his secrets are to be uncovered.

721
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,305
Not Gray.

722
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:48,265
He's lived long enough.

723
01:20:48,432 --> 01:20:51,685
-Oh, I'll handle him.
-No.

724
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,981
Nemo, you and Hyde
will free the prisoners.

725
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:59,276
Sawyer and I will deal with M.

726
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,737
Then the game is on.

727
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,491
Do you mind?

728
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:10,662
Night-night.

729
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:21,423
Your painting's in your room.

730
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:26,929
In return for the League, that was our
deal, and I'm glad to see you honor it.

731
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,388
So, what now?

732
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:33,727
London. I've had my fill of violence.
Now I'm in the mood for vice.

733
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:37,523
You could stay, share my dream.

734
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,363
I've lived long enough to see the future
become history, professor.

735
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:49,201
Empires crumble.
There are no exceptions.

736
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:51,870
You think you're better than me.

737
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:57,709
You forget, I've seen your painting.

738
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,187
Skinner said turn right at the column.

739
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,272
Oh, great. Which one?

740
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,984
This way.

741
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:09,615
You lead, and I'll follow.

742
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:14,161
The scientists.

743
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,747
They're for Nemo.

744
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:35,224
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.

745
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,184
They're moving out.

746
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:39,603
Let's hope Skinner's up to the task.

747
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,313
You, help him out!

748
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:11,510
Release them!

749
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,136
Quietly!

750
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:16,431
Get them back to the ship.

751
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:58,599
Intruders! Intruders!

752
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:00,851
Intruders!

753
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:23,707
James, here's your box of tricks!

754
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,962
The brute's potion,
the vampire's blood...

755
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:33,967
...the Indian's science
and mounted samples of invisible skin.

756
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,178
They'll be all the rage in Europe.

757
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,597
The Nautiloid is fueled and ready.

758
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:45,646
-We have trouble.
-Trouble? I call it sport.

759
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:50,609
Intruders! Indians! I think it's
Captain Nemo and his men!

760
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:52,528
The prisoners are escaping!

761
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:55,656
How many times do I have
to kill these cretins?

762
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:58,033
-Make this the last.
-Damn them.

763
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,060
Nemo, get the scientists!

764
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:28,397
Is that all you've got?

765
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:57,885
Do not move, M.

766
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:04,975
Or would you prefer
Professor James Moriarty?

767
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:09,605
James Moriarty,
the so-called Napoleon of crime?

768
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:15,485
That man died at Reichenbach Falls.
He died, and I was reborn.

769
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:21,033
Watch out!

770
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,453
Eyes open, boy.
Can't protect you all of the time.

771
01:27:41,762 --> 01:27:44,389
Hello, lover.

772
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,232
Mina.

773
01:27:56,485 --> 01:27:57,778
You're alive.

774
01:27:57,945 --> 01:28:00,948
It's possible I can't die.

775
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:06,495
The same could be said of you.

776
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:11,083
Let's put it to the test.

777
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:19,550
-Minx.
-Do you realize what you've done?

778
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:21,552
What you've let out of me?

779
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:24,221
A woman's wrath. Oh, I'm petrified!

780
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,940
We'll be at this all day.

781
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:53,041
The bedroom, Mina, does it give
you memories or ideas?

782
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,459
Ideas.

783
01:28:56,837 --> 01:29:01,133
If that had been permanent,
I'd have been very upset.

784
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:04,178
Your painting.

785
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:13,896
I hoped I'd get to nail you
one more time.

786
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,857
I didn't think it'd be literally.

787
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,374
Skinner?

788
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:39,588
It's okay. It's Skinner.
What the hell are you doing here?

789
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:41,882
What makes you think I'm Skinner?

790
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:50,033
Sawyer!

791
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,202
Run for it!

792
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:02,254
Keep moving!

793
01:31:02,462 --> 01:31:05,007
Go over! Go, quickly!

794
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:21,315
Come on! You want more?

795
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,652
No!

796
01:31:28,155 --> 01:31:30,949
Not the whole thing.

797
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:53,472
You are so lovely.

798
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:07,653
Thank you.

799
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:12,824
You broke my heart once.

800
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:15,702
This time you missed.

801
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:19,748
You spoke once of wanting
to meet your demon.

802
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:31,552
Here he is.

803
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,994
Skinner?

804
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:03,250
That's the last time I play
with matches.

805
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:29,276
End of the line, Moriarty.

806
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:41,788
To the death, but you'll need Hyde
to make it mine.

807
01:33:41,997 --> 01:33:44,041
He'll be making his own fun.

808
01:33:49,129 --> 01:33:51,131
Nemo!

809
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:57,054
Here!

810
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,182
Nemo!

811
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:10,692
Nemo, run!

812
01:34:30,003 --> 01:34:31,713
What is that thing?

813
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,800
It's me on a bad day.

814
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,353
He's too strong. We're trapped.

815
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,149
No, he's burning through the formula
at an accelerated rate.

816
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:38,655
He'll soon change back.

817
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,575
Nemo!

818
01:35:57,799 --> 01:36:00,594
I hope I've got your fire
when I'm your age.

819
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,556
You will not live beyond today.
That I promise you.

820
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:24,034
Hyde. Come on.

821
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:26,453
My formula's done.

822
01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:48,433
Watch out!

823
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:57,067
Think you'll come in here
and wreck this? I'll rebuild it.

824
01:37:07,035 --> 01:37:09,580
There'll be others like me,
Quatermain.

825
01:37:09,788 --> 01:37:12,541
You can't kill the future.

826
01:38:09,097 --> 01:38:11,391
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?

827
01:38:11,725 --> 01:38:15,604
The League, me, Skinner.

828
01:38:16,313 --> 01:38:17,564
Wrong.

829
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:20,817
Wrong about your little
American friend as well.

830
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:23,237
Do you really think
he's ready for action?

831
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:27,366
I think you've trained him about as well
as you trained your son.

832
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:04,111
Get him.

833
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,952
-It's too far.
-Take your time.

834
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:14,371
You're ready.

835
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:23,380
Take your time.

836
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:57,998
I got him.

837
01:40:01,043 --> 01:40:05,881
May this new century be yours, son...

838
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:10,260
...as the old one was mine.

839
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:03,355
You remember he swore Africa
wouldn't let him die?

840
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:06,191
I wish the old boy had been right.

841
01:41:10,487 --> 01:41:12,573
What's next?

842
01:41:12,781 --> 01:41:14,867
I have long hidden away
from the world.

843
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:20,372
Now I wish to see it anew
as the century turns.

844
01:41:20,581 --> 01:41:22,791
You're all welcome to join me.

845
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,628
We've all been hiding
in one form or another.

846
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:31,049
The Nautilus awaits.

847
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:33,760
So who's coming?

848
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:39,683
So long, old chap.

849
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,977
Goodbye, Allan.

850
01:41:48,775 --> 01:41:50,861
Goodbye.

851
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,616
Thanks.
