1
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,084
Go! Go!

2
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,537
Jessica, are you
dating anybody?

3
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,923
Jessica, is it true?

4
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,005
The magazine says that you're
still in love with Nick.

5
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,273
Jessica, who are you dating?

6
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,033
I love you, Jessica!

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,242
Jessica?

8
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,387
Jessica, is it true that
you're still in love with Nick?

9
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,212
Jessica...

10
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,484
It's a really, weird, scary

11
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,549
feeling.

12
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,614
- Jessica, is it true...
- You're disoriented.

13
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,229
You can't see in front of you.

14
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,024
It's false imprisonment.

15
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,604
I can't get away.
I can't get out.

16
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,806
I can't get out of a store because
these guys are blocking the door.

17
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,192
Can't get to my car.

18
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,711
When I'm in my car,
they're surrounding me.

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,552
I can't see.

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,202
They flash light bulbs.

21
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,281
It's nighttime.

22
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,803
My vision is impaired.

23
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,108
Back off.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,210
Back off!

25
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,247
Jessica?

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,549
Jessica?

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,250
Jessica...

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,675
It's high stress.

29
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,737
♪ Bright lights, big
city going to my head ♪

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,376

36
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:40,702
I've been shooting since the
'80s, and celebrity photography

37
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,951
has changed a lot.

38
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:47,775
With big award shows, there are
about 50, 60 guys in the pen,

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,861
and they're all fighting
for the same image.

40
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,816
They're trying to get a head shot
or a full-length fashion shot.

41
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,318
They're screaming at the
celebrities, trying to get eye

42
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,654
contact into their camera.

43
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,645
Rihanna, you didn't look... - I, on
the other hand, I'm outside the pen.

44
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,022
I'm on the red carpet, where
I go right up to them.

45
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:14,181
I can make them pose for me, give
me eye contact, or set up a shot.

46
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,638
You'll talk to the p.R. People.

47
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,541
They'll even tell you, flat-out, "we
don't need all these photographers.

48
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,607
It's just for camera and show.

49
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,746
Basically, all we need is,
like, five or six guys.

50
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,615
But no, we want all these
photographers here because it

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,653
looks great on camera, and it
makes it look more glamorous."

52
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,698
It's Hollywood.

53
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,758
If you look in the magazines
and on all these websites and

54
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:41,863
TV shows and seen all these celebrities,
where does it really come from?

55
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,425
The red carpet is just one
piece of what's become a

56
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,634
billion-dollar-a-year industry.

57
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:01,101
This is the second time
I've seen this picture.

58
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,341
I adore it.

59
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,885
I think you will, too.

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,924
In the days of hedda hopper,
at the premiere of something,

61
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,927
the studios would hire photographers,
but it was gracefully waiting.

62
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,517
"May I take a picture?"

63
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,318
It was all agreed upon.

64
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,949
Client would walk in a room
and say, "hey, how'd you get all

65
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,400
these photographers here?!"

66
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,936
- You know?
- Nobody bothered anybody.

67
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,504
I didn't cross your fence.

68
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,298
You didn't cross my fence.

69
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,560
Now it's become something
totally different.

70
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,194
I'm getting a shot!

71
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,915
Someone jumping
over your wall, okay?

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Your wall.

73
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,751
You know, how is that
not a clear line?

74
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,885
You can't do that, right?

75
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,987
This is a perfect example
...Marc and I getting married.

76
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:44,926
We took every precaution and every measure
so we could have a private moment.

77
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,662
Decided to do it in the
backyard, invite 20 people.

78
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,897
They thought they were
coming to a barbecue.

79
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,499
So, some of them are not
even that dressed up.

80
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,501
Wearing shorts.

81
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,635
Marc built the runway.

82
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,903
Literally... hammer and
nails, 'cause to get a

83
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,249
contractor to do that,
it would have been...

84
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,641
We couldn't trust anybody.

85
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,777
We had to do it all
ourselves, which is fine.

86
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,546
It was actually a beautiful
experience in its own way.

87
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,156
But even with that,
they found a way.

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,022
Helicopter comes over, right
as I'm walking down the aisle.

89
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,140
We couldn't hear each
other making the vows.

90
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,895
The people who were there
couldn't hear our vows.

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,463
Till this day, I'm not sure

92
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,030
if she said yes, because...

93
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:24,823
Did you?

94
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,633
You did, right?

95
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,802
You know, technically, you can get out
of this, because I never heard it.

96
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,905
But that place
wasn't even sacred.

97
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,719
Shouldn't our home,
at least, be sacred?

98
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:51,303
Yeah, at getty images, we're
selling an image every single second.

99
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:55,934
And within the news or editorial
area, about 40% of all those

100
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,768
images are entertainment images.

101
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,804
I get the same names
thrown at me.

102
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,705
"Oh, do you work with
Annie leibovitz?

103
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,674
Do you work with
Patrick demarchelier?"

104
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,611
But the most published
photographers in the world are

105
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,112
the entertainment photographers.

106
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,583
A lot of people may not have
heard of them, but these folks

107
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,953
are being published in the thousands
and thousands every week.

108
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,588
Photographers... the
difference in photographers.

109
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,056
Well, I guess there's
three kinds.

110
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,859
You got the guys that you
regularly see on the scene, like

111
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:29,030
Kevin and guys from wire image, where
you see them at all the shows.

112
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,797
You kind of become
friends with them.

113
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,667
They're not looking
for a bad shot.

114
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,617
They're looking for
something interesting.

115
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,088
Cool... no problem.

116
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,140
Then, you got the "stalkerazzis,"
you know, who go

117
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,609
through anything to get a shot
and who sit there like you're

118
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,845
eating lunch with a bag with a
big camera in it and whip it out

119
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,847
on you, like, a moment's notice.

120
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,883
And then some of the worst offenders are
just the creepos with the cellphones.

121
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,886
They're acting like they're
looking for a number when I'm

122
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,157
buying a Boca burger, which I
don't want anybody to know about.

123
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,058
You know what I mean?

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,991
I eat steaks and meat.

125
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:58,782
I'm a badass.

126
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:01,696
I'm in the Boca burger
section, like... "Fuck!"

127
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,521
You know?

128
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:03,878
So, I'm like that.

129
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,147
Those people suck.

130
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,394
People with mobile phones.

131
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,739
You can't go anywhere without being
photographed, basically, now.

132
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,739
You have to be very careful.

133
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,809
You have to accept it, you have
to be aware of it, and you have

134
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,331
to behave accordingly.

135
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,073
Now, the regular citizens
have become paparazzis.

136
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,345
You're not safe anywhere.

137
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,240
Anyone can sell you.

138
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,957
Anyone can sell a piece of you.

139
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:38,651
The kind of fascination that we have
with celebrities changed over time.

140
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,383
We used to go and see movies in
these amazing movie houses, many

141
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,801
of which were not only built to look
like palaces but were called palaces.

142
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,117
And we would sit in the dark,
and we would watch these huge,

143
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,700
larger-than-life people... idols
that were literally like deities.

144
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,963
The first people who appeared in
movies, their names weren't used.

145
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,133
The audience had to make up their
own names for these people.

146
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,104
Mary pickford, for instance,
became known as "the girl with

147
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,734
the curls," because the
studios didn't promote them.

148
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:25,695
They knew if they promoted them that
they would have to pay them more.

149
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,962
Pickford really changed
that, personally.

150
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,159
She and her mother invented
stardom and the percentage deal.

151
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,992
"The movie makes so much
money, I make so much money."

152
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,650
Unheard of, unthinkable.

153
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:45,458
And she married Douglas Fairbanks, who,
on the male side, did the same thing.

154
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:53,376
Back when Hollywood was in its
golden age, it was glamorous

155
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:57,912
and beautiful and mysterious, and
you wondered how they lived.

156
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:02,699
And if they did a spread in somebody's
house, it was just so special.

157
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,185
And now we're so exposed.

158
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,503
There's no mystery.

159
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:09,854
Today, celebrity is an
industry, and in every industry,

160
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,545
you have raw material.

161
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,863
And the raw material in the
celebrity industry is an actual

162
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,966
body, an actual flesh-and-blood
person, who has feelings, has

163
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,556
emotions, has a family.

164
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,899
That raw material is shaped.

165
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,104
You have to look a certain way.

166
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:28,209
So, they have a stylist and ay.

167
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,278
Publicist and a manager and an
agent that help form the raw

168
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,752
material into the
finished product.

169
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,185
Second of all, you have
authorized publicity, things

170
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,056
that the celebrity and his or
her publicist have decided will

171
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,792
become part of this person's
image... interviews, magazine

172
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:49,930
covers, the actual films, the
products in which the star appears.

173
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:53,267
And then you have the
unauthorized publicity, which is

174
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,557
paparazzi photography and
gossip, unsanctioned.

175
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,941
But, at the same time, it still contributes
to the formation of the image.

176
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,980
Next, media takes this image
and gives it to the consumer.

177
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,819
As far as outlets, there's print,
there's television, and there's online.

178
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,721
<i>So, some of the authorized
outlets would be people,</i>

179
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:15,955
"entertainment tonight,"

180
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,218
"extra," "access Hollywood," and then a
star's website or a star's fan club.

181
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:23,872
Unauthorized?

182
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,933
<i>In print, we have in
touch and life & style.</i>

183
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,838
There's gossip blogs, like tmz,
Perez Hilton, dlisted, gawker.

184
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,374
So, bottom line, all these
different players... they're all

185
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,460
interconnected and
symbiotic on one another.

186
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,888
Watch the cars behind you guys.

187
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,124
Have a great day.

188
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,859
I don't know who that was.

189
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:53,700
Do you know?

190
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:54,838
No. Pretty hot.

191
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,447
There she is. Look.

192
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,041
And she sells?

193
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,860
Oh, fuck, yeah, she sells!

194
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,538
Yeah, yeah, she
sells, for sure.

195
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,340
Usually, they run,
what, $250, $500.

196
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,165
Truthfully.

197
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,336
Usually, they're $50, $250,
to as much as $250,000.

198
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,214
Oh, there's keyshawn Johnson.

199
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,872
Because here's the deal.

200
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:18,284
You may get nothing today, but
you may come today or tomorrow

201
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,778
and make more in one day
than most make in a year.

202
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,715
For the love of the game.

203
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:34,935
The problem is, it has to be
the most audacious, the most

204
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,406
outrageous, the most intrusive behavior
may get the most saleable shot.

205
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:43,649
The agencies are trying to get
that to sell them to magazines

206
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,997
or video outlets that
will pay money for it.

207
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:50,084
And the public buys the magazines
and watches the shows.

208
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,878
So, it's that whole cycle.

209
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:56,113
Hey, guys!

210
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,049
Get back!

211
00:11:58,984 --> 00:11:59,784
Guys, guys!

212
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:01,394
Mike, right here.

213
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,344
Part of the game is
to provoke a reaction.

214
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,369
Get back, guys.

215
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,338
Best thing that will happen
is somebody will take a swing at

216
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,560
them, you know, or start
pushing or screaming.

217
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,409
That's a better shot.

218
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,522
It's more money.

219
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:19,946
Who are you dating?!

220
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,081
They usually bring up
ex-girlfriends, ex-wives.

221
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,216
They say stuff about Pam.

222
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,885
There's not too much they can
really say to get my goat.

223
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,088
It's more invading your
space, getting in your face.

224
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,255
You're like, "wait a minute.

225
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,324
I don't know you, dude.

226
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,226
You're gonna come at me and
try to get a reaction?"

227
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,360
There's my reaction.

228
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,361
We're all good.

229
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,264
I've given them one or
two of those in my time.

230
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,101
But now you just have to know
that that's the photograph that

231
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,731
they want, and you just have
to not give it to them.

232
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,442
What they're trying
to do is provoke you.

233
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,245
Like, "oh, you were voted
worst 'this' or 'that.'"

234
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,050
and if they do provoke you, they
have won, and you have lost.

235
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,456
- Me, on the other hand...
- Yeah.

236
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:03,355
Marc doesn't have as much
of a tolerance for that stuff.

237
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:07,292
So, we try not to put him in
those situations too often.

238
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,129
Lindsay, big smile!

239
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:14,133
They kind of want Lindsay Lohan to
melt down in public so they've got their

240
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:14,958
photograph.

241
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,105
This week in the celebrity spotlight,
Lindsay Lohan is jail-bound...

242
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,541
And, you know, half the time
she gives them the thing they

243
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,912
want, and it's very sad, because it's
like, this girl was a good actress.

244
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,957
She had talent.

245
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,413
She made records, you know?

246
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:30,499
And now it's kind of
she's become their toy.

247
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:32,498
It's frightening.

248
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,055
There is a uniquely American
sport called "grandicide."

249
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:43,848
We build someone up to spectacular
heights in order to tear them down.

250
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,465
It's a vicious cycle.

251
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,257
You build up.

252
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,167
You break her down.

253
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,981
The next famous person
comes back again.

254
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,407
Next thing, you have to
break them down again.

255
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,441
So, you just sit back and watch.

256
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:59,500
I know it's only a couple days in,
but they say it's gonna go number one.

257
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:07,454
...superstar whose shocking private
life became an international soap opera.

258
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,157
...questioning whether
she can be a good mother.

259
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,260
...self-destructive cocktail of
courtrooms, psych wards, and paparazzi.

260
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:17,958
That moment of her just
looking in the camera shaving

261
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,433
her head was such a
powerful moment.

262
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,499
It was like, "fuck you, guys."

263
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,814
I mean, there was something about
it that was just "fuck you."

264
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,066
You know? She had enough.

265
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:33,413
<i>She broke in front of all of our
eyes, and then people captured that.</i>

266
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,048
But it was really sad to me.

267
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:38,484
People used to be able to
develop kind of quietly, and if

268
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,255
they made mistakes, the whole
world didn't know about them.

269
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,225
Gee, Mickey, we don't
know how lucky we are.

270
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,561
But that's not the
way it is anymore.

271
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,364
Now, really horrible behavior and
people who are definitely in

272
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,034
trouble and need help are often
just seen as people who are

273
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,436
supposed to entertain you.

274
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:57,481
This is a mess.

275
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,111
Our celebrity images are
supposed to be seamless.

276
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:09,383
But when those cracks open, it's kind
of dirty, but it's also fascinating.

277
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,283
I am on a drug.

278
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:11,451
It's called "Charlie sheen."

279
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,588
But then, you know, if it cracks
open too wide, there's nothing left.

280
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,257
You borrow my brain for
five seconds and just be like,

281
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,325
"dude, can't handle it!"

282
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,460
He's a train wreck.

283
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,229
He's an absolute train
wreck, which is fabulous.

284
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,019
It's great.

285
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:26,727
You know you shouldn't look,
but you're just curious.

286
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,588
Come on, Mr. "p."

287
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,726
I'm darryn lyons, "Mr. paparazzi,"
and this is my mini-me, Mr. "p."

288
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,548
I started as a news
photographer on a local paper,

289
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:45,430
but my passion was
certainly photography.

290
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,359
A lot of the world, looking from
the outside in, live really

291
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,162
disinteresting lives, and I
think that is what's captured

292
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,165
the culture of celebrity today.

293
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,167
I'm a true believer
in the image.

294
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:04,303
I've been to Bosnia on the frontline
getting shot at in full metal jacket.

295
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,273
I've won press photographer for
the year in the United Kingdom

296
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,307
two years in a row.

297
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,378
I've won all the awards you can
imagine being a photographer.

298
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,348
The fact of the matter is,
awards don't pay the mortgage.

299
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,183
I saw celebrity as being the
huge moment of the future.

300
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,032
With mrpaparazzi.Com, I embraced
it, and I'm still embracing it.

301
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,392
Celebrity isn't gonna go away.

302
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,798
It's been around
since time began.

303
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,697
You know, Julius
Caesar was famous.

304
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,083
Napoleon was famous.

305
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,635
They were famous
in different ways.

306
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,225
Your key is mass media.

307
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,998
It had taken Napoleon a
lifetime to become famous.

308
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,576
It took Charlie chaplin a month.

309
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:47,784
One day he was nobody, and a
month later he was known in the

310
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,009
deepest jungles of Africa.

311
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:55,321
He couldn't appear in public
without a mob coming around him.

312
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:58,725
And he had to invent
strategies to deal with that.

313
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,659

Celebrity today means
anyone who's famous.

321
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:29,322
Now, you can be famous... you
know, guy who was in a balloon

322
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,190
who floated across the country.

323
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:32,235
Is that a star?

324
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,202
You know... Is Jeffrey
dahmer a star?

325
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,936
The real name of
the game is fame.

00:17:55,773 --> 00:18:00,587
Historically, the American dream meant
that anyone could come to America and

335
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,590
through hard work could own a home
and provide for their family.

336
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:08,629
Now, the American dream has
really transformed into anyone

337
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,285
can become a celebrity.

338
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,432
Say something with
that great radio voice.

339
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,801
When you're listening to
nothing but the best of oldies...

340
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:17,819
♪ So hold your head
up, and you'll go far ♪

341
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,576
The way that people talk about
YouTube is that anyone who

342
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,526
puts a video on YouTube
can become famous.

343
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:30,487
Everyone can deny Justin bieber
a contract, but then because

344
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:35,827
enough people are interested
him, he can still become famous.

345
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,531
It's this idea that if you have
talent, and if you make that

346
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:46,094
talent visible, then you can be voted,
in our Democratic society, to be a star.

347
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,337
I think a recent survey of
British children under 15 said

348
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,608
they wanted to be a doctor or a nurse
or an architect or a photographer.

349
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,034
No, they just wanted to
be either rich or famous.

350
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:02,416
I want to be famous, but,
like, the "Jersey shore" people,

351
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,751
like on a reality
show or something.

352
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,205
I had sex with Vinny.

353
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,243
You had sex with Vinny.

354
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:09,729
Bring it on!

355
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,492
You know, "Jersey shore's"
a huge success because we're

356
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,561
nutjobs, and we don't care
what people think about us.

357
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,763
So, I think that's why
everybody loves us.

358
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,938
In general, a reality celebrity
is like a one-use celebrity.

359
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,371
You pay a little for them, but
then you can exploit them until

360
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:26,607
they disintegrate.

361
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,909
There are people out there
now that are completely

362
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:33,410
celebrities and absolutely
famous who don't work...

363
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,814
Who don't even work.

364
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,874
They have nothing to sell.
They have no product.

365
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,916
- There's...
- It's so scary.

366
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,384
I hate reality television.

367
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,728
I think it's the lowest
common denominator.

368
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:49,862
It's mind rot to me.

369
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,111
It numbs my brain.

370
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,467
And the people being called
celebrities and have their own

371
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,570
reality shows, I
want to kill them.

372
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,504
Told you you
wouldn't regret it.

373
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,308
I think what people
misunderstand is that we're in

374
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,609
the entertainment industry.

375
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,611
We're not these serious people,
and everyone's just gotten so

376
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:08,615
used to all these actors taking
themselves so seriously, when

377
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,516
it's really just
a joke industry.

378
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,584
It's supposed to be fun.

379
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:12,629
You need a keg.

380
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:17,523
There's nothing wrong with the
Kim kard... all of those people.

381
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:21,528
If that's how they choose to make
a living, more power to them.

382
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,614
It's not my... my line
of work is different.

383
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,400
I want to entertain people.

384
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,486
Reality TV is, in a
way, the new vaudeville.

385
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,084
There's nothing real
about reality TV.

386
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,746
People are led to believe that
it's real, and it's the big lie.

387
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,812
There's nothing real about it.

388
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,791
I'll tell you the first
time it bothered me.

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,701
I walked out of my house.

390
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,984
I wanted to go and get my
mother-in-law a birthday present.

391
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,793
And I walked out, and, for the
first time ever, there were all

392
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,416
these photographers outside.

393
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:26,254
And my first instinct, curiously
enough, because we're

394
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,410
kind of all animals,
basically, was to run.

395
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,965
But then I got scared to run,
because I was pregnant, and I

396
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,527
didn't trust the streets
of New York to be my ally.

397
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,774
And I started crying, and I said to the
photographers, "please don't chase me.

398
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,683
I'm pregnant.

399
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,399
Please don't chase me."

400
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,472
And they kept following me.

401
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,981
And I went into a building.

402
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,984
I saw a doorman in a building,
and I said to him, "is it okay?

403
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,919
Can I come in your building?"

404
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,325
And he took me down
to the garage.

405
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,892
And there was a couple, and
they were on a motorcycle.

406
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,482
And they saw me crying.

407
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,064
And she and I traded clothing,
everything... from head to

408
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,935
toe... and I got on the back
of her boyfriend's motorcycle.

409
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,006
And she walked out in my clothes, and he
took me elsewhere and dropped me off.

410
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:17,778
But it's just gotten exponentially
worse ever since then.

411
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,603
Sarah!

412
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:19,502

413
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,577

417
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,996
The paparazzi life
is like the lottery.

418
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:40,032
You might want to take a day
off, but that might be the day

419
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,030
when something major happens.

420
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,921
Oh, he just gave up.

421
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:44,971
He gave up... quitter.

422
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,220
You're hours away.

423
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,708
I start off very early in the
morning, and I go late at night.

424
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,978
And I try to do it six days a
week, if not seven days a week.

425
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,520
Got to do that
celebrity rain dance.

426
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,507
Come on!

427
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,051
Bring them in. Bring them in.

428
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,028
Bring them in.

429
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:02,789
I love what I do because I get
to drive up and down the streets

430
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:07,494
of my favorite city in the world, Los
Angeles, California... - How are you?

431
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,862
- ...interact with celebrities...
- It was awesome!

432
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,130
...meet the tourists.

433
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:13,132
I can take a day
off when I want.

434
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,134
I'm my own boss.

435
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,802
I have no one to answer to.

436
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:16,869
Loving life, man.

437
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:17,710
Loving life.

438
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:55,654
They would work
together in teams of two.

439
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,216
One of the photographers would
aggravate the celebrity they

440
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:04,988
were shooting, start some kind
of confrontation, so that the

441
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,126
other one could take
the photograph.

442
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,591
The advent of the paparazzi took
on a whole different nastiness.

443
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,865
Paparazzi were "I'll
get you at any cost.

444
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,635
And I'll get it if it
means killing you."

445
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:21,011
And the competition among
them was so fierce.

446
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,950
♪ I can't stop this
feeling deep inside of me ♪

447
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:33,276
Ron galella was probably the
first well-known paparazzi, who

448
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,668
every day woke up and decided
to focus his lens on

449
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:42,920
Jackie Kennedy no matter what
she was doing or where she was.

450
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:46,553
♪ I... I'm hooked
on a feeling ♪

451
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,775
♪ high on believing that
you're in love... ♪

452
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,165
Age has been good to Ron, because
he got a lot of very bad press.

453
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,163
He was seen to be a parasite.

454
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,926
His photography's now being collected
by serious photography collectors.

455
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,977
But, you know, when Ron was
working, it was completely

456
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,315
different from the
way it is now.

457
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,087
Getting your picture taken
went from something where you

458
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:27,635
felt that somebody was honoring
you, a part of you... your work,

459
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:32,152
your beauty, your youth,
something... to a hunt.

460
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:37,447
And most of the time, instead of
celebrating something about you,

461
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:42,480
a lot of the time is trying to
find something wrong with you.

462
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,634
I'm not out to get a bad
shot of Lindsay Lohan.

463
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,183
I'm out to get a shot.

464
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,985
Now, if she's doing good,
well, I'm taking a good shot.

465
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,955
If she's doing bad, well, in her
eyes, I'm taking a bad shot.

466
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,817
To me, it's still the shot.

467
00:26:58,048 --> 00:26:59,613
No, no, no, no, no, no.

468
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:06,832
You're about the rudest
people I've ever run into.

469
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,936
Thank you.
No wonder people come up and slap you.

470
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,303
He threw the finger at me.

471
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,396
I don't blame him!
You're an asshole!

472
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,108
They use us as a scapegoat.

473
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,042
"Oh, paparazzi... bad.

474
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,211
Well, you took the picture, and
they wrote about it, but you

475
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,812
shouldn't have
took the picture."

476
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:22,849
Well, okay, but they still sold
magazines, and you still read it.

477
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,850
Hey, I got a question.

478
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,053
Who do you think people hate more, the
parking enforcement or the paparazzi?

479
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:28,878
You guys.

480
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,047
Really?

481
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,080
Yeah.

482
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:35,261
I think it's really easy to
blame the paparazzi because

483
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:39,365
they're actual bodies right there
that we can pinpoint as the cause.

484
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,770
There are photos of the paparazzi getting
in celebrities' faces, whereas the

485
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,871
writers and editors,
completely unseen.

486
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,808
And we certainly don't
want to blame ourselves.

487
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,043
I think the
paparazzi has a place.

488
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:54,113
40% of many of the magazines
have paparazzi photos.

489
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:57,063
They're an important
part of the industry.

and they're all there, and

497
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,936
there's no men around me, that's

<i>Either ok or us.</i>

<i>I'll pick that up before
a sports illustrated.</i>

00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:27,188
<i>Perez Hilton and tmz andok
magazine... yes, I do read them all.</i>

501
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,216
If someone I know is on
the cover and it has the big

502
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:33,852
headline, I want to
know what's happening.

503
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,022
If there's a controversy,
like, an argument between

504
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,292
people, and I know it's gonna be,
like, ongoing, that's when I buy.

505
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,882
Good gossip, basically.

506
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,114
<i>Confidentialgoes behind the
headlines for its stories...</i>

507
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:07,287
stories that we feel, that I
feel, the public should know.

508
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,291
Robert Harrison published
kind of pulpy skin magazines out

509
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,459
<i>of his apartment in the 1940s,
and then he started confidential</i>

510
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,368
in the 1950s.

511
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:26,336
<i>Confidential basically made
what had to that point been</i>

512
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:27,994
unspeakable speakable.

513
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:33,606
So, women's sexuality, having relationships
between races, even homosexuality.

514
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,385
<i>Confidential was operating
entirely outside of the system</i>

515
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,188
and had no qualms about reporting
on these sorts of things.

516
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,225
Some of the stories were
outrageous, like, "I boiled my

517
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,961
baby in the oven this morning"

518
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,029
and things like that,
terrible things.

519
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,496
And there were people
who believed it.

520
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:56,034
And our damage control was just
ignore it, 'cause it will go away.

521
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,971
And most of the time, it did.

522
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,975
The outlaw magazines took
advantage of the fact that there

523
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,445
were secrets that they could
basically use as blackmail.

524
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,844
The classic story, of course, was the
story about rock Hudson's homosexuality,

525
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,658
<i>which confidential had absolute
evidence of, and they said,</i>

526
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,919
"give us an exclusive story,
and we won't print it."

527
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,365
So, the studio took a much
lesser actor, who was also gay,

528
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,484
and they sacrificed him
Pretty sleazy stuff.

529
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,955
But it was business.

530
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:36,155
<i>Confidentialbecame extremely popular
in a very short amount of time.</i>

531
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,113
I mean, upwards of 5 million
copies of month at its height.

532
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:43,549
But all of these stars,
including Maureen O'Hara,

533
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:47,119
<i>liberace, and Dorothy dandridge,
filed suit against confidential</i>

534
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:49,554
for the various things
that were said about them.

535
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:53,025
- If they don't feel it, evidently...
- Robert Harrison agreed to

536
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,094
basically stop covering the
stars, and then the stars and

537
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,097
the studios would
stop suing him.

538
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,131
So, he sold it off.

539
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,067
I think it's a
part of americana.

540
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,153
I think it's gonna live
long after I'm gone.

541
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,521
You're so funny.

542
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,080
I mean, you're never gonna get the ball...
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:17,617
Looking for all those sort of
fun, little, behind-the-scenes

544
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,386
kind of images that are gonna
make a reader feel like that

545
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,222
they were really there...
someone stepping on someone's

546
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,558
train, someone greeting someone,
saying, "hi," Nicole Kidman,

547
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,427
Keith urban going out on their
date night, things like that.

548
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:32,064
- We can do a wide shot of the cast...
- From this we pick a few

549
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:35,001
hundred pictures, and I would
say, in terms of our space in

550
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,538
the magazine, we have room for six
consecutive pages of award-show coverage.

551
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,506
Now, something really juicy happens
at the show, you never know.

552
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:44,310
You could get a cover story out
of it, or it could go in the

553
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,244
"hot stuff" section
and be a gossip item.

554
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,580
Mila kunis looked amazing.

555
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:51,250
So, we might run a full-length
dress shot of her, in which case

556
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:54,219
we can't necessarily run another
picture of her inside with

557
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,289
Natalie Portman, even
though it's really cute.

558
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,831
So, it's really just
a giant puzzle.

559
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,494
...whether or not that runs in a
different section of the magazine.

560
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,319
Right.

561
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>Us weeklywas launched in the
1970s to compete with people.</i>

562
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,403
<i>People magazine was
first published in 1974.</i>

563
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,606
One of the first issues had
Gerald Ford not, like, in a

564
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,332
suit, in the white house.

565
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,677
He's in a pool, and
his shirt is off.

566
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,414
So, it's really trying to give
this intimate look into these

567
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,315
different personalities' lives.

568
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,385
And it was a tremendous
success immediately.

569
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,089
<i>Us weekly was actually published
by the New York times company</i>

570
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,292
originally and eventually sold
it to jann wenner, the founder

571
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:34,459
<i>of rolling stone.</i>

572
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:37,597
It has been a monthly, a
biweekly, and a weekly.

573
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,567
They have changed its format,
its tone, who they're covering.

574
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,504
He tried everything,
and none of it worked.

575
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,182
<i>It seemed like people
was invincible.</i>

576
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:52,271
<i>Around 2002, Bonnie Fuller
took overus weekly, and she</i>

577
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,259
changed the face of
celebrity reporting.

578
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,618
A lot of the magazines would
feature these glamorous shots of

579
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,455
<i>celebrities, and at the time us
weekly wasn't doing that well.</i>

580
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,690
<i>And so the only photos that
us weekly could afford were</i>

581
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:08,461
those shots that magazines
wouldn't print.

582
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,531
I was interested in
celebrities being glamorous, but

583
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,600
then I also wanted to see the
human side of them, too.

584
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,404
And so, we created a section
called "stars are just like us."

585
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,245
♪ Whoo-ooh ♪

586
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,727
♪ if I could escape ♪

587
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,248
♪ whoo-ooh ♪

588
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,764
♪ if I could escape ♪

589
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:27,185
♪ whoo-ooh ♪

590
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:31,617
Bonnie snapped up those shots
of celebrities taking out their

591
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,485
garbage, picking up their kids.

592
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,120
It was a home run for us.

593
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:38,623
I guess I was a pioneer,
because that was the first time

594
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:42,117
that paparazzi photos had
been presented that way.

595
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:47,739
She definitely has the good
hair and then the pretty... hello.

596
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,293
Yeah.

597
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,504
She's so gorgeous.

598
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,706
Everybody wants to know who
it is and kind of become the

599
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,296
expert and the insider.

600
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,276
So, we want to always give that.

601
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:01,613
<i>That's one of the reasons why
they come here, to us weekly.</i>

602
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,250
The way that we lay it out, it
always does feel like you were

603
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,555
like a member of
the party there.

604
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,732
And they love it.

605
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:35,547
- Do you know if this thing...
- 'Cause if not, I'll take it.

606
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:36,305
It's not.

607
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,803
It's Keith and Nicole.

608
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,696
Is that nowhere?

609
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,377
Well, then I'm using it.

610
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,278
All right.

611
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,489
Let me just check...

612
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,656
Can't not use Halle Berry.

613
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,360
It's a crime against humanity not to run...
All right.

614
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,498
All right.

615
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,605
Everybody wins.

616
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,630
When Bonnie and I worked
together as editors at

617
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:55,567
<i>us weekly, I broke the story
that Britney Spears and</i>

618
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,435
Justin Timberlake had broken up.

619
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,605
And then the next week, we had a
follow-up to that story, and we

620
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,208
created these soap operas.

621
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,310
There was a time when I was
on the tabloids every week for

622
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:06,578
maybe two year straight...

623
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:07,555
Try every day.

624
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,781
...and a soap opera.

625
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,282
[ "The young and the restless"

626
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:18,391
If you're in a relationship, and
you're in the tabloids all the

627
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,560
time, it's like, "well,
maybe that part was true.

628
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,460
Maybe it wasn't."

629
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:24,330
Then, all the sudden, you're a
victim to believing what they're

630
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,598
saying and what they're writing.

631
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,467
Gossip is itself just as much
of a product as a movie is.

632
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:33,914
Actual people's lives are turned
into a story for us to consume.

633
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:39,329
For example, with the love triangle
of Brad pitt and Angelina jolie and

634
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,090
Jennifer Aniston and also with
Liz Taylor and Eddie fisher and

635
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:48,723
Debbie Reynolds in the 1950s,
each of the people in both of

636
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,429
these situations was given a
role to play... the temptress,

637
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:56,761
the innocent man in the
middle, and then the victim.

638
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:59,864
And once Jennifer Aniston was
made the victim, it's very

639
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:03,302
difficult for her to become
something else, which is the

640
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,272
reason why there are still
magazine covers now, years

641
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:10,543
later, saying Jennifer Aniston can't find
love, Jennifer Aniston can't get over

642
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:14,447
him, because that is still her
role is victim, when, really,

643
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,417
she's of course found happiness, and
she's dated other people and whatever.

644
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,853
But that has been the role in
which she has been slotted.

645
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:25,279
<i>In the early days ofus
weeklybecoming successful,</i>

646
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:29,527
<i>people magazine began to
feature more of these breakups</i>

647
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,895
and who's dating whom.

648
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,321
<i>Whenuswanted to scoop
people, at whatever cost, so</i>

649
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:39,471
that they could claim the exclusive and
thus attract bigger newsstand sales.

650
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:42,741
There was this great photo
of Jennifer Lopez reading

651
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,844
<i>us weekly, and we
wanted that shot.</i>

652
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,480
<i>But people magazine
outbid us all day.</i>

653
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,748
It kept going up and
up and up and up.

654
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:53,518
<i>And people never published those
photos, but they paid tens of</i>

655
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:56,822
<i>thousands of dollars just so
that we couldn't publish them.</i>

656
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,861
What happened is a series of
bidding wars for photos under

657
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,630
Bonnie Fuller and Janice min
after her that really escalated

658
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:07,764
the photo price for all photos.

659
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:10,802
Even small photos inside the
magazine, they still wanted to

660
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,868
be the only ones who had them.

661
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,440
Bonnie Fuller
flipped the demand.

662
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:19,844
So, instead of just tracking the moments
when a star was either doing something

663
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:23,449
scandalous or doing something
that was absolutely glamorous,

664
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,786
really on, the paparazzi now
needed photos of the stars doing

665
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:31,029
everything in between, which
meant near 24-hour surveillance.

666
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:44,804
Once you spot a car, you look
at the last three numbers of the

667
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,505
license plate that you
match with the car.

668
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,251
Nicky Hilton... black
range rover, 069.

669
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,511
Paparazzi know all the
license-plate numbers.

670
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,748
They know all the tail-plane
numbers of their planes.

671
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,616
Find out and then
call me or text me back.

672
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:02,519
They pay people off... valet
Parkers, the doormen at hot

673
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,410
restaurants and clubs.

674
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,484
Whoo! We got Paris Hilton.

675
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,960
They have a network
of informants.

676
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,822
Check out what's happening.

677
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:13,598
Want to see if our crowd's moving
across the street right now.

678
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,000
There's a lot of
paparazzis and their cars.

679
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,668
You see the guy's
got the trunk open.

680
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:17,713
There's a path.

681
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,170
Get down in position ourselves.

682
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,511
So, nobody's talking about...

683
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,802
When you know you see one,
you just got to deal with one

684
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,737
guy, and you hope and pray that
he doesn't start calling all his

685
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:53,672
friends, you know?

686
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:54,497
Go, go!

687
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,810
Within 15 minutes, there are
5 other people that are there.

688
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,946
Let the two guys get the
shot and be done with it.

689
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,985
But why there has to be 50
people getting the same shot...

690
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,182
If I saw someone I want to
photograph walk out of the

691
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,725
house, I sure as hell
wouldn't call my buddies.

692
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,539
Why not enjoy the
entire piece of steak?

693
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,563
I don't get the whole call
friends and relatives and...

694
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:26,335
It's literally being pursued
like prey, like an animal.

695
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,674
What's "the price of beauty"

696
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,574
really worth?

697
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,572
There's no kind of structure.

698
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,846
There's no type of regulations.

699
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,980
There's just "get that picture.

700
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,506
Get that shot.

701
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:39,412
I don't care what it takes."

702
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,833
They don't care about
breaking the law.

703
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,594
They'll climb a wall and
take pictures over the gate.

704
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,663
They've done it at my
office, in my backyard.

705
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,525
They do it, the helicopter.

706
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,670
You're in your backyard, and the
helicopter's coming that low,

707
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,103
and you keep running in.

708
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,237
And it's like a stupid game of,

709
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:02,832
you know...

710
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,011
Have you ever tried to reason

711
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:09,681
with... I know that... -
I've always tried to reason.

712
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:12,155
Oh, my God, have I
tried to reason.

713
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:15,088
I have tried to
reason with them.

714
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,755
I have had talks about "come on.

715
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,433
There's better things
that you can do.

716
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,757
You can achieve your dreams."

717
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,281
I mean, it's stupid.

718
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,832
It's just gotten out of control.

719
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:36,574
There are certain instances
where the paparazzi are gonna

720
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,110
just overexcite themselves.

721
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:38,935
Move!

722
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,124
You got to move!

723
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:41,846
Cameras get broken.

724
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:45,749
People get hurt... the aggression,
the hits, the elbows.

725
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,087
You won't get no video, man.

726
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,649
I try to avoid it, but
this is what it's all about.

727
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,823
Get that shot, no matter what.

728
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,706
I had a very public
relationship that fell apart,

729
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,743
and I was diagnosed with breast
cancer, and I had never been an

730
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,877
a-list celebrity before.

731
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,612
I pretty much was just
photographed on red carpets and

732
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:18,106
maybe the occasional lunch
at the Ivy or whatever.

733
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:21,819
But once that happened... once I
was diagnosed, and I was going

734
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:25,056
through such unhappiness and
such real dark chaos in my

735
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,462
life... I couldn't
leave my house.

736
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:32,139
And it really made me, I guess,
start to dissect what it is that

737
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,103
would make that such an
interesting thing to photograph

738
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:42,822
and is that what sells magazines is
seeing somebody at their lowest?

739
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:51,899
A word that has become absolutely
meaningless today is "unspeakable."

740
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,786
There's nothing that's
unspeakable anymore.

741
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:56,648
You know, stars' cellulite.

742
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,240
They pump gas, too.

743
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,259
There are still love triangles.

744
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:05,250
It's degrading to women, especially
the way they show women celebrities.

745
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,090
It's just, like... - I
was in Hawaii, and I have

746
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,450
this horrible bikini shot that a
paparazzi got and crap light and

747
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,613
a weird angle, and
it's terrible.

748
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,234
And it was everywhere.

749
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,889
And they did everything to just
make me look like I was just

750
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,754
this beached whale
with cellulite thighs.

751
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:33,292
It was just so bad, and I was like,
"oh, my God, do I look like this?"

752
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,746
I have a little girl.

753
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:36,761
I don't read this
in front of her.

754
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:39,732
I don't really read any of
my magazines in front of my

755
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,868
daughter because I don't want
her to get that bad body image

756
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,670
at such a young age, and
it happens really young.

757
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:49,741
I've had little girls as a teacher
tell me they're fat at four years old.

758
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:51,943
Where are you getting this from?

759
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:55,813
I think the magazines and
the media are the catapult.

760
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,355
That's the breeding
ground for them.

761
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:04,089
<i>Whether it be people, us,
instyle, glamour, vogue... they</i>

762
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,808
all portray women as
this untouchable goal.

763
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:37,672
You can create the illusion that
someone is a normal, ordinary person.

764
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:42,263
In other words, Joan Crawford
vacuums her own house, or she

765
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,263
has the perfect family.

766
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:49,594
Or you can create the illusion that
they're aloof and aristocratic goddesses.

767
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,845
But control was the
name of the game.

768
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:59,399
And the whole apparatus
grew up around that need.

769
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:05,465
The studio system determined which
movies the stars would appear in.

770
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,396
It also determined where they
would live, what cars they would

771
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,417
drive, and, in certain
cases, who they would marry.

772
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:19,506
It also provided them
with protection.

773
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:24,546
All of the images came through the
studio's publicity department.

774
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:30,897
So, if you were running a fan magazine,
and you ran a photograph which was

775
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,004
unflattering, that was it.

776
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:37,047
You didn't get another
photograph not only of that star

777
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:42,139
but of all the other stars that were
working for that particular studio.

778
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,918
If one of their stars was
involved in a scandal, the

779
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,585
studio would rush right
in and do damage control.

780
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,350
It could be hushed up.

781
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,152
So, the control at that
time was fairly easy.

782
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,436
It's just not the case anymore.

783
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:03,040
The mainstream media can say,
"we won't report about 'x, '

784
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:06,411
'y, ' or 'z, '" and it's still
gonna be widely known because so

785
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:08,980
many are reporting
it on the Internet.

786
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:13,087
So, the kind of control that
celebrities and their managers

787
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:18,619
and their studios used to have over their
images simply does not exist anymore.

788
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,195
Tmz is not about getting the
next tom cruise interview.

789
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,174
It's just not.

790
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:28,933
And so, I don't think
there's as much leverage.

791
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:32,304
Harvey levin got his start
as a lawyer and correspondent

792
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,174
covering the o.J. Simpson
trial in the 1990s.

793
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,600
Police are banking on
blood in the Ford bronco...

794
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:43,217
He started tmz in 2004, and
what tmz is doing is taking the

795
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,810
tactics, the form, the
colors, the general ethos of

796
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:50,489
<i>confidential, and just
transferring it to new medium.</i>

797
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,324
A little over half
past the hour now.

798
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,860
Here's a look at the stories
that you may have missed.

799
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:59,297
Lindsay Lohan... - Cable news pushed
the network news to be faster and more

800
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:00,122
immediate.

801
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:04,036
And now the network news and
cable news are in many ways

802
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,054
responding to what
happens on the Internet.

803
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:21,953
Media habits have totally changed
ways of getting information.

804
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:23,054
People go online.

805
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,922
They don't wait for a weekly.

806
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:27,491
They don't wait for a
monthly magazine anymore.

807
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:31,734
When some news breaks, they want
to know now what's going on.

808
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:34,498
Whenever something happens
to Justin bieber... like, his

809
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:37,168
birthday was yesterday...
Google, sent to my phone.

810
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:39,642
Robert pattinson
got a new haircut.

811
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,172
Sent to my phone.

812
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:44,462
Tmz just fascinat... I'm
obsessed with tmz.Com.

813
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:49,248
In 2006, tmz broke the story
of Mel Gibson's arrest, which

814
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,317
drove a tremendous amount
of traffic to the site.

815
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:56,492
Since then, tmz has grown into
an incredibly well-read site.

816
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,373
They then went on to use the
base product, this raw footage

817
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:18,110
from the website, and then came
up with a way that he could

818
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,578
repackage it on television.

819
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,732
Today, on "tmz"... -
Finally, snooki is good.

820
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,384
Nicole, you were amazing
on "wrestlemania."

821
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:27,518
You did a great job.

822
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:31,156
If you ask around, and you
say, "why do you come to tmz?"

823
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,458
Increasingly, what you're gonna
hear people say is, "they seem

824
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:36,161
to get the stories first."

825
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:40,268
When I was running msnbc, we
would do our best to make sure

826
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,991
the source was credible.

827
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:47,574
But these news operations simply
don't have the time or the

828
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,171
ability to fact-check some
of what they're reporting.

829
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:56,649
You know, that was a terrible
misquote, and it's very good

830
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:58,874
that you brought that up.

831
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,453
I never said that
in that context.

832
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,290
He never talked to those people, and
I never talked to those people, either.

833
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,290
They make up things!

834
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:07,267
Yeah, they do!

835
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:12,630
It's very tough, unfortunately, for
a celebrity to sue a publication.

836
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:14,356
You have to prove malice.

837
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:16,368
You have to prove negligence.

838
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,304
Also, a lot of celebrities don't
want to draw attention to a

839
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:24,342
story that is completely wrong
or defamatory or give publicity

840
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,478
to some blogger who's
working out of his garage.

841
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:31,516
If you sue that person, suddenly
you make their site relevant.

842
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,518
<i>I had a big, famous lawsuit
againstthe sunnewspaper in</i>

843
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:38,022
britain a long time ago, in the
'80s, which drove me crazy... it

844
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:41,058
went on for a year and a half
That said that I slept with

845
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,527
underage rent boys, gave them
drugs, urinated on them.

846
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,230
I mean, it made my life hell.

847
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,567
But I got a front-page apology, which
was the most important thing for me.

848
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:51,435
"We were wrong. We're sorry."

849
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,072
Now, people can just make up
what they want on the Internet,

850
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,407
and as soon as they put it on the
Internet, it goes worldwide.

851
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:58,076
So you're forever
denying things.

852
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,478
They discourage you from
going after the tabloids.

853
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:03,382
Like, a lawyer will be like,
"it's gonna cost you so much

854
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,284
money, and it's gonna take so
much time, and it's not gonna

855
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,621
make a difference, and nobody's gonna
care about the story tomorrow."

856
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,123
And they convince you
to just deal with it.

857
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:16,230
When all the sudden you're
hearing rumors that are not true

858
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:20,393
on a CNN crawl, that... you
sort of go, "this is CNN."

859
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,668
I don't take it personally
at this point, but there was

860
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:30,067
something about the outlet of CNN that
felt like that's a prestigious channel.

861
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,212
If you respond to certain things,
you're right in the sandbox with them.

862
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,315
If you don't respond, the story
now grows because of the viral

863
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,418
world and because of
24-hour news cycle.

864
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,865
So, we're constantly trying to
figure out how to put out a fire.

865
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:48,791
Perfect example is Tiger Woods.

866
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,494
He didn't say anything.

867
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:54,266
He issued a statement that he
had "transgressions," and then

868
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,734
he disappeared for months.

869
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,977
Women came out of the woodwork,
and it ended up being a giant

870
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:02,810
scandal because he
let it blow up.

871
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,435
Think of this as a system.

872
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,181
Anything that happens here also
has a chain reaction throughout

873
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,484
the rest of the industry, like
Tiger Woods, who, we were being

874
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,752
served a very tightly
controlled image.

875
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:18,489
As soon as the scandal broke, a
watch company or nike doesn't

876
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:22,255
want their name affiliated
with this sort of behavior.

877
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:33,054
- This morning, tmz reports...
- Tmz is saying... - Tmz has learned...

878
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,712
Until very recently, major
news organizations wouldn't have

879
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:40,968
cited a tmz as a source.

880
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,593
And now they do.

881
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,351
There's something beyond just
reporting who's making out with whom.

882
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,455
Therein lies the love/hate relationship
that we have with someone like levin.

883
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,324
He's illuminating things that we
maybe don't want to know about

884
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,326
that we also feel we
should know about.

885
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,529
But then, on the flip side,
there's a lot of sagging flesh

886
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:00,867
and giving the
camera the finger.

887
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:06,622
So, a blog will have unauthorized
content that may or may not be false.

888
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:11,511
Maybe in a post right above or
below, journalistic content.

889
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,683
It's dictating that we learn
how to do our homework, not

890
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:23,621
believe everything we're reading in
blogs because everybody has an angle.

891
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:27,592
We're at a really dangerous
spot as far as our inability to

892
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,474
discern what is fact
and what is fiction.

893
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:37,636
You have no choice but
to believe what you read.

894
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,839
You have no choice but to
believe what you read.

895
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,306
- This one...
- Yeah.

896
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:43,375
...kind of shocks me.

897
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,610
Yeah, yeah.
But it's probably not even true.

898
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,578
And we'll read it.

899
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,964
We'll still read it.

900
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,372
Yeah.

901
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,455
You can't beat the truth of
a camera, and this is what the

902
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,257
celebrities are paranoid about.

903
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,847
The camera doesn't lie.

904
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,263
It doesn't stop the Botox, it
doesn't stop the surgery, and it

905
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,213
doesn't stop you having
sex with a costar.

906
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:09,141
This is real.

907
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,873
No one can lie about
this picture.

908
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,361
It's there.

909
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:16,507
And that's one of the great,
historical significances that

910
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,643
photography and the
media bring today.

911
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,744
The problem is with
the celebrities.

912
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:21,846
It's instantaneous.

913
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,300
They have no control.

914
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,451
Even when we're talking about
authorized photos, there's still

915
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,252
a lot the celebrities
can't control.

916
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:32,087
♪ Take it out, baby, and
show me what you really want ♪

917
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,644
♪ they'll not ever see
the beauty inside ♪

918
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:43,467
This is pretty much how
we receive things back here.

919
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:46,621
Pretty much their entire
body gets retouched.

920
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,607
Well, you can kind of see.

921
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:52,489
Here, where it asks
to cut in, we cut in.

922
00:52:57,806 --> 00:53:02,500
We have to make sure that all the
red carpets match, and it doesn't.

923
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:05,858
So, we're gonna
have to fix that.

924
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,937
Some of the time, the people in
the background that you see are

925
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,137
not really there
or are duplicated.

926
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:20,060
We get rid of stains on her dress...
And we try to get rid of ht wrinkles.

927
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:26,648
Paparazzi shots need a lot more
tlc than a photo that we get

928
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,346
from a great photographer.

929
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:31,583
That's definitely
a lot less work.

930
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:35,654
And let's help her a little bit,
'cause she looks a little tired.

931
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,148
Sometimes we get photos
that are, you know, green.

932
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,352
Yeah, but we can fix that.

933
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:46,259
The idea that a picture
never lies is simply not true.

934
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:52,473
A picture captures somebody at
a particular moment in time.

935
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,840
A celebrity can tell a joke
and pull a face or something.

936
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:59,944
And then, when that person is in
trouble, that image will appear,

937
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:02,681
and it will look like it was
shot at the same time in

938
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,715
reaction to something
that they've done.

939
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,461
So, images don't
always tell the truth.

940
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,866
It's the context.

941
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,986
The context is very important.

942
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,627
So, I think people need to be more
discerning when they're looking at images.

943
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,897
Renee zellweger's probably one
of the toughest shots to get

944
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,600
because she doesn't really come
out and be seen as often as we'd

945
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,986
like her to be seen.

946
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,466
Haven't seen you in a while.

947
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:29,425
You're looking great.

948
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,781
That was exhilarating.

949
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:41,636
I enjoy making her smile and laugh
and making her feel good, you know?

950
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,489
The ride is about staying in the
public eye, because if you're

951
00:54:45,514 --> 00:54:48,927
forgotten, then my camera goes
down, and then the world doesn't

952
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,397
know or even want to care
about who they are anymore.

953
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,764
You'll be gone in a flash.

954
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,286
It's called Hollywood.

955
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,259
Who makes them famous?

956
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,293
Well, actually, I do.

957
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:07,664
They're reliant on the paparazzi to
photograph them to make them money.

958
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,028
That's delusional.

959
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,680
That is absolutely delusional.

960
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,631
Paparazzi do not keep
your career alive.

961
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:21,458
You know, we're not saying,
"don't take our pictures."

962
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:23,795
We understand there's
a market here.

963
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,699
But a photograph of you in your
backyard sunbathing topless,

964
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,668
'cause you can and you should
be able to, that's a violation.

965
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:35,873
And a photograph that's in a
magazine... there's an agreement

966
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:39,231
that this is my job, and
I'm to be photographed.

967
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:42,746
One is like having someone rob
your house and go into your

968
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:45,817
panty drawer, and the other
is something artistic and

969
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:50,672
beautiful, and both are in agreement
that this is going to take place.

970
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,142
There's a difference.

971
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:54,092
Vitamin water zero hotline.

972
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:54,958
This is Ellen.

973
00:55:54,983 --> 00:55:55,960
How can I help you?

974
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:01,155
As long as you're famous, you become
an enormous commodity in this country.

975
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:05,904
My guest tonight is somebody
who's been in the center of a

976
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,971
huge scandal rocking
America this week.

977
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,561
And news is a business.

978
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:12,653
Newspaper entities
need to sell papers.

979
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,366
Websites want traffic.

980
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,983
Television networks
want ratings.

981
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:20,485
Developing news out of
California... Lindsay Lohan...

982
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,788
Increasingly, the way to get that
is to have an entertainment component.

983
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:27,725
...record-setting weekend,
to the tune of $30 million.

984
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,862
...and more than $155
million this opening weekend.

985
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,799
Every Sunday night, what's the
first item we see on the news?

986
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,634
How much money a movie
made over the weekend.

987
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:41,005
- "Avatar" is at the number-one spot...
- I mean, "avatar" hit a

988
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,875
billion, and it's bigger than the
security breach at the airport.

989
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,056
It's bigger news.

990
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:47,736
Why?

991
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:51,616
Nick paton Walsh joining us
live from kabul, Afghanistan.

992
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,457
Many thanks.

993
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:53,918
She made sure he
got the message.

994
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:57,989
Wait until you hear about Charlie sheen's...
The concept of hard news has

995
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,034
really changed.

996
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:02,754
- Charlie sheen insists...
- A lot of what used to be

997
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:05,503
considered tabloid
is now mainstream.

998
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,900
Frankly, they stopped telling
important news about the world,

999
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:11,694
and they just tell gossip.

1000
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,839
Maybe you need a... like,
sometimes, you, you know, watch

1001
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,775
so many things or somebody's
gotten stabbed, like, all day

1002
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,978
long, and there
was a flood here.

1003
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,880
There's an earthquake there.

1004
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:26,851
Like, maybe you kind of want to know the
new shirt that Brad pitt's wearing.

1005
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,889
Who doesn't like a good Hollywood
escape from time to time?

1006
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,958
There's an argument that
celebrities act as "info-tainment"...

1007
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,594
...parkinson's
awareness month.

1008
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:41,132
Michael j. Fox... - ...actually often
helping issues of real concern getting

1009
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,722
into the public domain.

1010
00:57:42,824 --> 00:57:45,869
So, for instance, if
tragically, a celebrity is ill

1011
00:57:45,894 --> 00:57:49,940
with breast cancer or something
like that, it does raise awareness.

1012
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:52,281
Does speak to the
importance of screening...

1013
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,710
But there's concern on the

1014
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:57,081
other hand that focusing so much
on the minutiae of how famous

1015
00:57:57,106 --> 00:58:00,784
people live their lives is just
diverting attention from issues

1016
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,688
which the press should be
filling their pages with.

1017
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,570
Sarah Palin, entertainment
or journalism?

1018
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:09,960
Sarah Palin is a very good
example of the way in which

1019
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:12,630
celebrity culture has
influenced politics.

1020
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,100
I'm ready, and cross my fingers,
hoping it wasn't a mistake.

1021
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,902
I mean, say what you
will about Sarah Palin.

1022
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:21,806
She has been brilliant in
manipulating her image.

1023
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,973
What an adrenaline rush.

1024
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:25,677
I think there's real
indecision over whether or not

1025
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,246
Sarah Palin really wants to be
president, or if she just wants

1026
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,179
to be a celebrity.

1027
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:30,214
I think it's unclear.

1028
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,851
It certainly is the question that's
united Hollywood and Washington.

1029
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:37,597
Democracy becomes
another reality show.

1030
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,755
Is trump actually serious
about running for president?

1031
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,021
That's not good for anyone.

1032
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,807
If the mainstream media were
to fold, and celebrity tabloids

1033
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:56,379
were the only people out there
publishing, it would mean that

1034
00:58:56,898 --> 00:59:00,027
our entire system of
democracy has collapsed.

1035
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:05,018
Democracy relies on an informed
electorate to make educated

1036
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,781
decisions at the ballot box.

1037
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:14,745
You can only do that if you have access
to truthful, timely information.

1038
00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:20,013
The public has a lot of
responsibility here.

1039
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,069
The paparazzi doesn't get
away with this in a vacuum.

1040
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:29,172
So, I think citizens need to
step up and start valuing that

1041
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:33,347
information they're getting from
their local news gatherers.

1042
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:36,781
...the Paris Hilton story.

1043
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,915
Wait a second here.

1044
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,982
Hold on a second.

1045
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:40,150
I'm gonna make a point.

1046
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,119
We're not covering
this, all right?

1047
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:43,054
Yeah, exactly.

1048
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,812
Easy, easy.

1049
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,790
I'm done with the
Paris Hilton stories.

1050
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,324
What do you have
against Paris Hilton?

1051
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:49,159
I have nothing
against Paris Hilton.

1052
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,194
That was not the issue.

1053
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:54,981
The issue was the story and whether
or not it was worthy as the lead.

1054
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,825
Paris, I love your lips.

1055
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,217
I think at this point it's
getting to be supply leading

1056
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,920
demand, because look at how
many magazines there are now.

1057
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:19,190
It's like, "do we
really need that?"

1058
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,392
But people keep picking them up.

1059
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,831
I'll walk through an airport,
and there will be three out of

1060
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:30,967
four people buried in this
magazine, and I'll walk through,

1061
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:33,237
and no one will notice
me, which is great.

1062
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,971
But there is some irony there.

1063
01:00:34,996 --> 01:00:37,076
And I understand it, 'cause
I can get sucked into it.

1064
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:40,310
I can spend 20 minutes on an
airplane and flip through that

1065
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:45,083
stuff, and I can be in that world, reading
about who's dating who or looking at

1066
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,851
somebody's cellulite on
a beach or whatever.

1067
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:49,713
And it makes me feel awful.

1068
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,161
You know, the celebrities
are famous people.

1069
01:00:58,186 --> 01:00:59,163
They know that.

1070
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,866
They work hard, I think, to
become a celebrity in the first

1071
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:06,270
place, and then you got their
picture all over the magazines.

1072
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,005
I don't feel guilty at all.

1073
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,906
Plus, I'm buying the magazines.

1074
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:13,243
It costs me a little bit of money
to even buy the magazines.

1075
01:01:13,268 --> 01:01:14,911
So... I don't feel guilty.

1076
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:16,279
It comes with your job.

1077
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:17,937
You asked for this life.

1078
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:22,119
You wanted to be in the limelight,
in the spotlight, so deal with it.

1079
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:25,022
Yeah, I kind of asked for
this life and kind of knew that

1080
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:27,023
this was part of it
that comes with it.

1081
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:30,194
But the same way the magazines make
money, they make money for me.

1082
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,130
They get the word out that I
have a record out there and put

1083
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:36,032
me in some light that hopefully
shines that people connect to

1084
01:01:36,057 --> 01:01:38,642
and make them want
to hear my record.

1085
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,895
There's a price to fame.

1086
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,066
Are you willing to pay it?

1087
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:46,810
Yes, that's part of your
job is promoting your work.

1088
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:50,915
But not... I don't think it's your job
when you're going to a yoga class.

1089
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,049
That's not your job.

1090
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:55,747
That's an invasion of privacy,
and they need to stop.

1091
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:56,877
Look.

1092
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:58,540
I have a great life.

1093
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:03,633
I wouldn't trade myself, even
with the paparazzi following me.

1094
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:10,784
But not because I have a great life
they should feel like they own it.

1095
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:25,300
We represented Barbra
Streisand for many, many

1096
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:30,155
years, and I got into the habit
of carrying a large, black

1097
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,517
umbrella, whether the weather
called for it or not.

1098
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,362
And if I saw photographers
coming towards us, I would open

1099
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,498
the umbrella, and like two
fools, we would walk down the

1100
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:45,101
street with the umbrella in front
of me so the photographers

1101
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:46,504
would not take her picture.

1102
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,978
She did not want
her picture taken.

1103
01:02:49,364 --> 01:02:54,126
On the other hand, Frank Sinatra,
who we represented, controlled that

1104
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:57,939
part of his celebrity by
never appearing in public.

1105
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,018
Sinatra wouldn't walk
down the street.

1106
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:04,388
If he had to go from here
to there, it was in a car.

1107
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,525
Do you remember when we were
in the trunk of somebody's car,

1108
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,843
trying to get away?

1109
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,283
- In Gina's car?
- Mmhmm.

1110
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,395
We were just
laying in the trunk.

1111
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,397
I'm like, "when
did this happen?"

1112
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:16,055
I wanted to go shopping.

1113
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,469
I'm like, "I'm in a trunk
with my girlfriend," and I'm

1114
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,971
like, "this is your life?"

1115
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,105
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it.

1116
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,406
I was like, "I beg to differ.

1117
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:24,375
I beg to differ."

1118
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,444
You feel out of control, like
you have no control over this,

1119
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:30,380
and then you realize, "I have
to actually change my life."

1120
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:32,106
We've moved out of Miami.

1121
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:38,007
We've taken measures to just sort of
concentrate on the quality of life.

1122
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:45,183
There's a lot of places where you can
live, where there are not paparazzi.

1123
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,531
You don't have to be
in the public eye.

1124
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,937
There's ways to
avoid the cameras.

1125
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:53,003
And then they'll say,
"well, she's isolated.

1126
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:54,371
She lives a rarefied life.

1127
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:56,507
She doesn't have
the human touch.

1128
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,416
She's not..."

1129
01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:01,002
Well, I'm desperate to be
like you and you and you.

1130
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,451
They told me
they're coming over.

1131
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:08,700
The big black guy?

1132
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,226
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

1133
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:11,771
Here comes Spencer.

1134
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:13,367
Here she comes.

1135
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,316
Hey!

1136
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,290
Hey, Happy Birthday, Spencer!

1137
01:04:17,585 --> 01:04:18,946
My birthday present.

1138
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,224
Let's see it. Let's see it.

1139
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:26,103
The problem always is that certain
celebrities invite in the attention.

1140
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:30,141
And so, the response of the media
is, "well, we're getting called."

1141
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,207
They should have an agreement.

1142
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:36,013
Whether it's the Paris hiltons
or the girls that don't have an

1143
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:40,418
issue with it, the "Jersey shores," all
those television shows... there should

1144
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,485
be an agreement.

1145
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,322
But it doesn't mean that everybody
else is a free-for-all.

1146
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,090
What could any guy want more
than this on his birthday?

1147
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:48,339
Wow! Look at that.

1148
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:52,758
A lot of the time, they're
told where to be and when.

1149
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:55,832
Yeah, it becomes kind of a game.

1150
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:59,096
I've got Darren coming out.

1151
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:01,471
I'm gonna walk him down.

1152
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:04,107
Well, when he comes, we'll
definitely... - Okay.

1153
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:08,146
Publicists either tip you,
or they'll give information out

1154
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:12,549
indirectly, what the client won't
even know, just to build more hype.

1155
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:13,384
They're supposed to.

1156
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,565
That's their job.

1157
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,420
Yeah, she was twittering us.

1158
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,022
She tweets. She told us.

1159
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,522
Twitter has become
another source.

1160
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:21,491
She was actually
telling us to come here.

1161
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:24,261
That's fine, but the owners
of the establishment don't want

1162
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,295
you on their property.

1163
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,364
It's not her. It's them.

1164
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,400
One time we had a source
that was giving us specific,

1165
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,634
incredible information.

1166
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,139
It was almost as if it was coming
from Angelina jolie's mouth herself.

1167
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:39,543
On when pitt flew into Africa...
private, little resort... we had

1168
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:43,854
three or four minutes to get the
picture that was bought in an

1169
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:46,485
<i>auction overnight
by us magazine.</i>

1170
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,188
Unauthorized publicity
definitely has a role in

1171
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,424
maintaining a star's visibility,
and I think that today

1172
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:58,161
celebrities have learned to
allow just enough coverage, so

1173
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:01,699
as to make it seem like you are
giving some of yourself but at

1174
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:05,125
the same time maintaining
a semblance of privacy.

1175
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,339
I mean, someone like Brad
and Angelina have a really

1176
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,540
meticulously
maintained star image.

1177
01:06:10,565 --> 01:06:15,939
But they also allow slight moments of
authenticity that make them interesting.

1178
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:21,690
Angelina jolie knows exactly
the moment that you need to have

1179
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:26,089
this particular part of her
persona exposed to the world,

1180
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,427
this particular part of her life
exposed to the world, and she's

1181
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:31,529
brilliant at it.

1182
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:35,398
You have to constantly be
able to reinvent yourself, and

1183
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:39,302
the ones who stay before us
really are the ones who, one way

1184
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:44,442
or another, manage to do something that
keeps us interested and fascinated.

1185
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,478
That, to me, smells
celebrity double standards.

1186
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,000
I don't agree with it.

1187
01:06:49,137 --> 01:06:51,549
I think it's completely
and utterly wrong.

1188
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:55,286
Like, Angelina and Brad pitt
say, "under my terms, I'll put

1189
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,522
my children on the front of a
magazine for 15 million bucks.

1190
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:02,460
But when you're photographing me
in a public place, unh-unh-unh,

1191
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,493
that's not on."

1192
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,151
I don't understand that.

1193
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,663
That was a very
interesting case.

1194
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,232
We worked with them for free.

1195
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,266
They wanted all the
money to go to charity.

1196
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,601
So, it worked perfectly.

1197
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:15,438
The value of an exclusive image
is very high, because that baby

1198
01:07:15,463 --> 01:07:18,409
or that wedding hasn't
been photographed before.

1199
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,478
So, if we can work with the
celebrities and get those

1200
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:24,581
pictures out first, it is a
massive disincentive to the

1201
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:28,319
paparazzi to chase after them,
because they're not gonna get a

1202
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,453
lot of money for the third
picture of the baby, when the

1203
01:07:30,478 --> 01:07:33,675
first pictures have been
published everywhere.

1204
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:40,046
Publicity... You know, it's a game
played for the benefit of everyone

1205
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:45,333
involved up to a certain point.

1206
01:07:46,427 --> 01:07:49,896
And that certain point is
where it gets dangerous.

1207
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,618
Drive out the garage.

1208
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:05,188
Couple yards down the street,
one, two, three, four cars.

1209
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:08,692
They'd all be smoking cigarettes,
waiting for you to come out.

1210
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,506
Jump in their cars,
and then you're off.

1211
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:14,464
The main car runs
a yellow light.

1212
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:17,500
Everybody behind that person,
the ten cars, are running

1213
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:19,503
lights until it
turns green again.

1214
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:22,705
Then you find yourself
driving kind of like crazy just

1215
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,227
to get away from them.

1216
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:26,576
One in the front, one in the
back, one on the side... you

1217
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:27,578
feel like a trapped rat.

1218
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,846
It's a matter of
playing chicken.

1219
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:33,089
Either you're gonna stop, or
you're gonna crash into the car.

1220
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,561
Nicole Richie was chased by a
paparazzi and got in a car accident.

1221
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,511
Thank God her children
weren't in the car.

1222
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:00,171
It can get really dangerous.

1223
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:02,773
Look what happened to Diana.

1224
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,553
Reports say a vehicle
carrying the princess and her

1225
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,889
entourage was being
chased by photographers.

1226
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:17,393
Several hours after the accident, French
emergency services were still at the

1227
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:20,207
scene, cutting people
from the wreckage.

1228
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,870
This isn't the time for
recriminations but for sadness.

1229
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:30,307
However, I would say that I
always believed the press would

1230
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,374
kill her in the end.

1231
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,477
But not even I could imagine
that they would take such a

1232
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,681
direct hand in her death,
as seems to be the case.

1233
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,851
It would appear that every
proprietor and editor of every

1234
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:44,355
publication that has paid for
intrusive and exploitative

1235
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,691
photographs of her, encouraging
greedy and ruthless individuals

1236
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:53,022
to risk everything in pursuit of Diana's
image, has blood on his hands today.

1237
01:09:56,425 --> 01:10:00,437
Well, if the publishers have
blood on their hands today, so

1238
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,740
do the readers of
those magazines.

1239
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:07,710
After the whole shock of her death,
people started putting flowers outside

1240
01:10:07,735 --> 01:10:08,911
Buckingham Palace.

1241
01:10:08,936 --> 01:10:12,749
And several legitimate news
photographers were assaulted

1242
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:17,588
because they were taking photographs
of people putting the flowers there.

1243
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:21,627
The people who assaulted them
were the same people who had

1244
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:28,672
bought the magazines that made
her image a valuable commodity.

1245
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:34,937
Photographers would not have
chased her if they couldn't have

1246
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:37,547
got good money for
those photographs.

1247
01:10:37,632 --> 01:10:40,977
And it was the people who were
buying the magazines that were

1248
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:43,179
ultimately supplying that money.

1249
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:47,707
When princess Diana died,
there was that sense of

1250
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,976
"wow, this is gonna change everything."

1251
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:53,423
What was sort of the immediate
impact, do you think?

1252
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:57,394
I think media interest in
princess Diana and particularly

1253
01:10:57,485 --> 01:11:00,070
her death led to a
change of culture.

1254
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:04,160
The commercial demand for
those kind of photos fell.

1255
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:08,871
But, unfortunately, in the last
few years, as the younger royals

1256
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:13,250
starting to join the family, the
media interest in them and the

1257
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:15,676
intrusion is escalating again.

1258
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:20,918
...is just 16 days away... -
And on the big day, a viewing

1259
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,662
party in London's iconic
trafalgar square...

1260
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:26,522
...the world is waiting for,

1261
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:30,493
the first real... - ...more
than a billion pairs of eyes.

1262
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:34,630
...on a fairy tale we've all
been living and breathing.

1263
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,600
...echoes of Diana's "I dos."

1264
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,414
Reminds me so much
of Diana's wedding...

1265
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:02,659
What I love about teaching
history is to say, "well, this

1266
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:06,407
isn't the first time
this has happened."

1267
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,494
You can go back and show how
it all happened before.

1268
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:02,046
It's a madhouse around here.

1269
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,484
George, welcome to the party!

1270
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,870
We should rush this,
Britney-style, man.

1271
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:09,801
I'm going in.

1272
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:11,979
This is a gang-bang.

1273
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,243
It's a gang-bang.

1274
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:14,721
Kim!

1275
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:16,591
Very nice.

1276
01:13:18,726 --> 01:13:20,291
I am a photojournalist.

1277
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:21,679
It's an art.

1278
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,843
No, they're not journalists.

1279
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,977
Paparazzi are people
with a camera.

1280
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:29,512
Anyone can get a camera.

1281
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,048
You can go to the drugstore
and buy a disposable camera.

1282
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:33,683
Now you're taking pictures.

1283
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,718
You're all the sudden
this journalist?

1284
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,553
No way are they a journalist.

1285
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:40,022
If they're allowed to do
it... if they're allowed to

1286
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:43,026
chase you, if they're allowed to
invade your privacy, and they

1287
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,762
know they're gonna make money off
of it, they're not gonna stop.

1288
01:13:46,787 --> 01:13:49,833
If you're a photographer,
take a decent photograph.

1289
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,101
Go and learn your trade.

1290
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,871
Make some beautiful photographs, like
Irving penn or someone like that.

1291
01:13:54,896 --> 01:13:56,597
What you do is just crap.

1292
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:57,899
It's crap.

1293
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,043
It must be frustrating.

1294
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,633
It must be frustrating.

1295
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:06,287
What I think might be even more
frustrating is to never see a

1296
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,235
photographer again.

1297
01:14:14,815 --> 01:14:16,924
Paparazzi are doing journalism.

1298
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,695
They are gathering information.

1299
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:25,022
They're telling a story of some sort
and disseminating it to an audience.

1300
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,780
The first amendment protects
artists in their ability to be

1301
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:36,142
creative and sometimes risqué.

1302
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:39,086
And it also protects
the paparazzi.

1303
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:44,588
But it doesn't necessarily mean that it
protects against each and every action.

1304
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:47,606
There definitely are
limits to free speech.

1305
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:51,788
You don't get to publish
false things about somebody.

1306
01:14:52,253 --> 01:14:55,994
You don't get to publish
obscenity, child pornography.

1307
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,533
You do not get to invade
someone's privacy by shooting

1308
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:04,040
with a long telephoto lens
into somebody's bedroom.

1309
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:08,215
The supreme court has said you
don't get to do those things.

1310
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:12,214
You tell me this kind of
behavior is covered by what

1311
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,250
journalism should be covered by?

1312
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:15,431
That's just bull.

1313
01:15:18,246 --> 01:15:19,046
Back off.

1314
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:21,582
Wow, dude.

1315
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,716
No way. Are you kidding?

1316
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,504
These people are
behaving terribly.

1317
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,821
It's beyond rude and
crude and unacceptable.

1318
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,029
But it's very hard to
legislate good behavior.

1319
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,714
I'm not somebody for more
laws, more laws, and more laws,

1320
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:47,150
to say who can shoot a picture
and who can't and where they can

1321
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,651
put it and what they can do.

1322
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:51,754
I mean, that's part of the beauty
of our society is the freedoms.

1323
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:54,691
But there's got to be something
that we can stand up morally, as

1324
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,227
a culture, and say, "hey, that's
not cool taking a picture of

1325
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,227
that kid over there.

1326
01:15:58,252 --> 01:15:59,068
Cut it out."

1327
01:16:00,988 --> 01:16:01,688
How?

1328
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:06,723
He's the manager of this big, big, big...
I love to walk my son to school

1329
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,139
because it's the time of
day that he's very open.

1330
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:12,817
The whole world is
interesting to him.

1331
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:17,047
And to have long lenses aimed
at you, purposefully getting in

1332
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:21,250
your... never mind your physical
path but your emotional path...

1333
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:26,241
it's actually a scary feeling... like
having sharpshooters aimed at you.

1334
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,419
All righty, here it is.

1335
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,968
The more intimate shots are
the ones that people criticize.

1336
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,703
"Well, why don't you
leave them alone?"

1337
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,701
But there is a demand for it.

1338
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:45,227
We just shoot and submit
them into the library.

1339
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:49,847
It's up to the agencies, the
publication, the TV networks,

1340
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,437
the websites and blogs.

1341
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:56,988
I want to be like my dad when
I grow up so I don't have...

1342
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,803
Wherever you read it or saw it,
ask them why do they publish it?

1343
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,330
Cute kids are popular, and
celebrities have a lot of cute kids.

1344
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:11,348
A lot of women love to
look at cute babies.

1345
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:20,260
Now they're having
covers of these magazines.

1346
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:24,265
It's like, "who's the
cutest Hollywood baby?"

1347
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:28,204
They haven't decided to
become a famous person.

1348
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,918
So, you can't do that to them.

1349
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:34,924
There are so many outlets now
to sell pictures of celebrity

1350
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:37,928
kids, and there's so much
money to be made in it.

1351
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:41,263
You can't even argue with
somebody about the ethics of it.

1352
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:45,802
I can't explain to somebody, "I'm a
high-profile person, but my son isn't.

1353
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,170
And just because he's with me
It's not like a handbag.

1354
01:17:48,195 --> 01:17:49,215
He's a person."

1355
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,307
And it's worrisome.

1356
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:52,829
It's really worrisome.

1357
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:55,257
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1358
01:17:57,104 --> 01:17:58,882
How's everything
going, Britney?

1359
01:17:58,907 --> 01:17:59,707
Stop.

1360
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:04,087
Whoever flashes these lights
at my kid again, I'll push your

1361
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,056
face through the
back of your head.

1362
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:06,813
You got it?

1363
01:18:06,814 --> 01:18:07,895
Get back, back, back, back.

1364
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,140
That includes you.

1365
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,293
I know. I know.

1366
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:11,118
Jack!

1367
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:12,686
Stop it!

1368
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,251
Stop taking pictures!

1369
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:16,958
Stop it!

1370
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:18,513
I'm not kidding!

1371
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:23,458
Stop taking pictures!

1372
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,900
Stop it!

1373
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:30,248
The thought is
devastating to me.

1374
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:34,001
It's frightening, terribly
frightening to me.

1375
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:38,855
Wow, it really just made me really
upset to think about that, right?

1376
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,159
I mean, to have someone
following your children is...

1377
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,585
It's entering a place that
just no one should be.

1378
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,590
Leave children out of it.

1379
01:18:49,957 --> 01:18:54,243
They didn't ask to be famous, and
they have their rights, too.

1380
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,947
The kids ought to
be doing the suing.

1381
01:18:57,431 --> 01:19:01,444
And that might be a way legally
to get some traction on this.

1382
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:05,347
There are very different
laws of privacy via the English

1383
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:07,350
courts than the American courts.

1384
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,353
J.K. Rowling brought proceedings
on behalf of her very young son,

1385
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:15,225
and it was held that her son had
a reasonable expectation of

1386
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,129
privacy, that he wouldn't be
followed around by photographers

1387
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:22,264
on the street, in the same way
that any ordinary child wouldn't

1388
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,200
be photographed
by the paparazzi.

1389
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:27,904
And it was a landmark case,
because it established that the

1390
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,340
children of famous people should
be treated in the same way as

1391
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:33,678
the children of
ordinary parents.

1392
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,512
A 3year-old suing me in
court, I think, is wrong.

1393
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:38,882
I think it's
absolutely ridiculous.

1394
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:42,919
The fact of the matter is, the j.K.
Rowling case... I didn't lose the case.

1395
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,321
She was just given the
right to go to a trial.

1396
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:48,258
But it was... you take on the
world's richest woman, and it

1397
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,325
was David and goliath.

1398
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:52,495
In France, they can't
take a picture of my child.

1399
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,404
It's illegal.

1400
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:58,182
It's night and day, if you compare
Paris to Los Angeles or New York.

1401
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,138
Here, in the United States,
probably any judge under the law

1402
01:20:03,163 --> 01:20:07,043
is going to say, "hey, no, you don't
get to follow them wherever."

1403
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:10,946
You know, the very first case
out there... jacqueline Kennedy

1404
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:15,218
had a lawsuit against Ron galella because
she was concerned for the safety of

1405
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,876
Caroline and young John.

1406
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:22,395
And she was able to get it
declared in New York that he had

1407
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,155
to stay a certain distance
away from those children.

1408
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:33,425
Since then, there's pretty much been a
truce around presidential children.

1409
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:38,008
But I think it's a little bit
different from what children of

1410
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,598
celebrities experience.

1411
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:47,638
I remember it was night,
and it was really cold.

1412
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:55,225
So, imagine the flashes on a baby that's,
like, two months, three months old.

1413
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,815
So, I told, "take her."

1414
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:02,197
And when they were taking my picture,
they were all over, and they didn't care.

1415
01:21:02,222 --> 01:21:03,499
They pushed the baby.

1416
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:05,429
It nearly went to the floor.

1417
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:09,166
And then, of course, I charge
after the photographer.

1418
01:21:09,229 --> 01:21:11,206
I made sure the baby was okay.

1419
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:12,864
And I was just so angry.

1420
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,478
My child could have had a
really serious accident.

1421
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:21,129
When you're two, three, on the street
He could have stepped on her!

1422
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,553
That just ought to be illegal.

1423
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,143
It's a little criminal.

1424
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,937
There should be certain
rules, I think.

1425
01:21:35,256 --> 01:21:38,500
I just feel like it's an
invasion of privacy and that

1426
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:42,204
these kids really don't need
that kind of attention at this

1427
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:43,658
point in their lives.

1428
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:48,111
Even if their mom or their
dad is the famous one, it

1429
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,478
doesn't give the
paparazzi no right.

1430
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:51,280
The children aren't
nothing to do with it.

1431
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:53,316
Yeah, but that's what
everyone wants to see.

1432
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,017
Everyone wants to
see their kids.

1433
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:56,386
Don't they? That's
why they do it.

1434
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,176
I suppose.

1435
01:21:57,177 --> 01:21:58,112
- It's true.
- Yeah.

1436
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,490
It's kind of sad, but it makes
me more interested in what

1437
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:04,627
the kids are doing because,
like, that's the new generation

1438
01:22:04,652 --> 01:22:06,353
of celebrities coming up.

1439
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:22,278
The public has to take some
degree of some responsibility

1440
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:28,221
and demand that these sort of
photographs not be published,

1441
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:33,216
that they put pressure...
economic, political, social

1442
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:38,163
pressure... on media entities
to say, "we don't want this.

1443
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:39,843
We won't have it."

1444
01:22:40,287 --> 01:22:42,598
Could you just let
them be normal people?

1445
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:44,052
You should be normal.

1446
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,436
You should be going home
and enjoy yourself.

1447
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,303
Disgusting what you're doing.

1448

1449
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:50,364

1450
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:58,471
Wow.

1451
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,859
I took a total of
289 pictures today.

1452
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:09,971
<i>Here, atus weekly, we get about
750,000 to a million images a month.</i>

1453
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:14,654
Images are coming at us
from all different angles.

1454
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:20,425
And anybody whose eyes are working will
see about a thousand images a day.

1455
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:25,607
We should be asking ourselves,
"what's happening in this photo?"

1456
01:23:25,632 --> 01:23:29,745
Where it was taken, when it was
taken... context is everything.

1457
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,307
We are drenched and piled
over with media coverage.

1458
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:38,877
I'm not gonna say it's
good for us or bad for us.

1459
01:23:40,547 --> 01:23:41,703
It is what it is.

And we're gonna have to
make the best of it.

1461

magazines, and we're
invested in reality TV.

1463
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,606
But we don't have an
interconnectedness that is
