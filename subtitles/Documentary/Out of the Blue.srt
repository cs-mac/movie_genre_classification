Hello, Tim.

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,007
<i>Oh, I can see you there...</i>

7
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,967
I salute the flag...

...in my liberty and justice.

9
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,889
Shut up!

Dad.

I'm going without you, Jasmine.

00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:37,651
I don't want to come.

24
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,944
Come on. I'll race you.

00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,278

Hmm.

35
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,149
Mm. Mmm.

36
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,195
I'll change your sheets
and put them through.

37
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,363
Did you put your towel out?

38
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,866
I'll do it, Mum.

39
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,951
Did you put your towel out?

40
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:29,619
Your towel, Jimmy.

Mmm. Hmm?

42
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,585
I wish you wouldn't feed
that dog while you're eating.

43
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,087
You just don't like him.
Does she?

44
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,964
Dogs have to have breakfast, too.

45

<i>Otherwise, how would they look after
Mum when I'm away?</i>

Do you mind
if I have a look around?

48
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,285
There's been washing missing.

49
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,161
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,539
<i>Underwear. Off clotheslines.</i>

51

Hey, Jasmine.
Good morning, Chiquita.

56
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:38,850
Good morning.

57
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,018
Where's your dad?

58
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,478
He's on his way.

59
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,734
What's the matter?

60
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,486
<i>Mum says fizzie's poison.</i>

61
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:50,737
Will you take these in?

62
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:52,739
If it was poison,
I'd be dead already.

63
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:53,990
Hi there.

64
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,493
Hey.

65
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:57,827
Grr!

66
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,089
Mmm.

67
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,008
Ecch!

68
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,176
Come on.

69
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,636
<i>Oy. Oy, oy.</i>

70
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,096
Lunches.

71
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,056
Come on, you guys.

72
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,727
Five clients today.

73
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,355
Four bods and my mum.

74
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,440
Going to tell her?

75
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:31,319
Yeah. Yeah. She'll...

76
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,654
Did you tell Rewa?

77
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,991
Not yet.

78
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,784
How about the girls?

79
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,001
You tell them, Julie-Anne.

80
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,462
Why?

81
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,098
<i>Okay.</i>

82
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,729
And all here together
for dinner, shall we?

83
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,397
Goose dinner.

84
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,041
Jason's birthday present.

85
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>Oh.</i>

86
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,960
Got your keys?

87
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:30,504
Got my keys.

88
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,796
Glasses?

89
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,925
Got your head?

90
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,593
My head? I think.

91
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:39,179
Well, don't forget to tell
Heather I want to see her...

92
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,555
I won't forget.

93
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,266
<i>Oh.</i>

94
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,608
Tina!

95
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,859
Hurry up, you two!

96
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,608
Good morning, Stu.

97
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:57,776
Morning, Nick.

98
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,404
Two sugars.

99
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,781
Stirred.

100
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:06,826
Stirred.

101
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,582
<i>Ohh...</i>

102
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,168
<i>Okay, I'll take care of these.</i>

103
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,924
They're linked?

104
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,884
Not... No, no.
Don't think so.

105
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,180
Dogs.

106
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,140
Father lost another five ewes.

107
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,517
Two dogs.

108
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,060
Very timely.

109
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,854
I'll head up there this afternoon.

110
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,730
Yeah, you probably aren't
going to find them.

111
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,065
Take a rifle up with you.

112
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,525
It will look like we mean action.

113
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,152
There.

114
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,487
Here we go.

115
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,615
Reports.

116
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,130
Barbecue at the crib Sunday
if the weather holds?

117
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:03,341
Mate, if the weather holds,
I'll be on the bloody roof.

118
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:07,095
I'll tell Fiona.

119
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,598
I'll bring Jordan out.

120
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,017
I'll give you a hand
with the roof Saturday morning.

121
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,894
All right. You're on.

122
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,605
<i>Oh, hey, Stu,
keys to the gun, please.</i>

123
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:16,122
Banker's check made out to
Frontier Guns and Ammunition.

124
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,542
That it, Mr. Gray?

125
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,087
There's a banking fee
of $2.00 on that check.

126
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,466
$2.00.

127
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,801
It's the standard fee

128
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,303
for a bank check, Mr. Gray.

129
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,268
You've never charged me before.

130
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,854
No way.

131
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,438
There's no way.

132
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:45,026
I've banked here all my life.

133
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,072
My father used to bank here.

134
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,243
<i>No wayl</i>

135
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,330
<i>I've banked here all my lifel</i>

136
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>My father banked herel</i>

137
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,876
<i>Am I not his son?</i>

138
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>Well?</i>

139
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,381
<i>All right?</i>

140
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,800
<i>It's my moneyl</i>

141
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,220
<i>I've got a rightl</i>

142
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,014
<i>It's my moneyl</i>

143
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,973
It's been giving me gyp, Gar.

144
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,310
If I want to see behind me,
I have to turn my whole body.

145
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>Ow.</i>

146
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,104
Relax, Mum.

147
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,607
You're tight as a drum.

148
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,320
Pain is just a symptom.

149
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,988
You've got to ask yourself why.

150
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,114
It's a mother chakra.

151
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,742
Smoking buggers her up.
Don't smoke.

152
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,913
Gar, no lecture.
Just the massage.

153
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,790
Quietly.

154
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:34,719
Julie-Anne and I,
we're going to move in together.

155
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,974
<i>We get on, you know?
Our energies.</i>

156
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,893
What do you think?

157
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,478
What do the kids think?

158
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,481
When?

159
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,984
We'll tell them tonight.

160
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,569
I wanted you to...

161
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,739
Well, I'm happy for you.

162
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,534
<i>I wish you both well.
Of course I do.</i>

163
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:00,161
The kids will be okay.

164
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,288
They tell me...

165
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,498
<i>Oh, bloody David.</i>

166
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,797
Leave those bloody dogs alone!
So help me I'll...

167
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,091
David!

168
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:24,978
He gets worse and worse.

169
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,106
Like here goes.
He's got a pile of rocks out there.

170
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,609
He just sits there and...

171
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,485
You and he used to be...

172
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,446
And then he helped you
build this place.

173
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,822
Baby-sat your kids.

174
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,073
Years ago, Ma.

175
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,617
Lately he's...

176
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,036
Guy's eccentric, Gar.

177
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,704
No crime in being eccentric,

178
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,707
or they'd lock up half the Spit.

179
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,375
They'd lock you up.

180
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,609
Help you?

181
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,488
I called you about a Papoose.

182
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,906
Gray. David Gray.

183
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,116
<i>Oh, yeah. I put it away for you, mate.</i>

184
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,953
Best balanced sporting rifle about,

185
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,704
from what I read and what I hear.

186
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,415
Yeah, probably, for the price,

187
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,209
Winchester or Remington

188
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,418
probably best of the range, but...

189
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,003
Tough fellow, too, eh?

190
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,427
Thanks.

191
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,846
See.

192
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
Nice.

193
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,769
But not too heavy.

194
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,689
Good in the hand.

195
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,317
Good weight.

196
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,572
Nice action.

197
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,948
All-weather.

198
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,285
Probably best all-weather
at that price.

199
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,372
Nice. Nice.

200
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,999
Take a silencer?

201
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,043
Not much call for a silencer
on a. 22 like this one.

202
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,170
No. You could, right?

203
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,714
We can get a thread
put on it for you.

204
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,799
You want to look at a silencer?

205
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,970
No.

206
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,513
Tell you what.

207
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,141
Put the thread on.

208
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,226
I'll put a deposit on it.

209
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,978
I'll come back and pay the balance.

210
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,146
<i>Okay.</i>

211
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:33,231
Friday, okay? Next Friday.

212
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,482
100 deposit.

213
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,860
Suits me.

214
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,862
Appreciate your professional approach.

215
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,197
You don't get it everywhere.

216
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,199
A bad day?

217
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,451
Town's full of idiots and incompetents.

218
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,369
I know what you mean, mate.

219
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,505
I'm not a Peeping Tom, Stu.

220
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,967
No? Well, people see you
sneaking around at night.

221
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,939
You got a girlfriend?

222
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,823
David! The mail came for you.

223
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,278
Mum, we're home!

224
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,446
Hi!

225
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,114
Hi. Julie-Anne, it's Friday!

226
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,868
Come on. Mind what's happening
to you, or you won't get any.

227
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
<i>Oh.</i>

228
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,788
All homemade.
There was no poison.

229
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,830
- Mm.
- Mm.

230
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,916
I've got something to tell you.

231
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,584
Can we go down to the beach?

232
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,044
Quiet, you kids, all of you.

233
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,129
Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

234
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,841
All right, what I want to say...

235
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,009
<i>Oh, look, you get on so well together.</i>

236
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,512
We all do. And, um...

237
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,097
here you all are.

238
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,808
I love you all. I really do.

239
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,770
Garry and I, we love
each other very much,

240
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,190
and we want for us all to be together.

241
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,775
What do you think of that?

242
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,318
Hmm?

243
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,614
Which house?

244
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,575
Which one?

245
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,742
That's not fair.

246
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,286
I want to live at my house

247
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,122
with my mum and my dad.

248
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,790
I don't want to live with Garry.

249
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,250
I want to live with you.

250
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>Yeah, it's all right, kikabhai.</i>

251
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,627
I'll always be here.

252
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,296
Your dad will still be your dad.

253
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,506
Garry will just be Garry.

254
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,509
I'm staying with Dad.

255
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,891
It's not fair.

256
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>Okay, nobody has to do anything</i>

257
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,602
they don't want to do.

258
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm going to the beach.

259
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,398
I'm going where my dad is.

260
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,275
I've got one photo
left in the camera.

261
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,401
<i>Come on, you guys. Outside.</i>

262
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,529
<i>Come on. Outside, you lot.</i>

263
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,780
Chop-chop.

264
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,011
You're going to go down
to the beach with your dad?

265
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,476
Race you!

266
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,019
I'll beat you!

267
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:34,486
<i>Ya ya ya ya ya</i>

268
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,446
What are you going to do with this?

269
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,822
Going to get the party started.

270
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,865
<i>Oh.</i>

271
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:39,908
<i>Ya ya</i>

272
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,451
All right.

273
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,832
Turn that bloody thing down,

274
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,959
you selfish bugger!

275
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,848
Hello, Ma.

276
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,974
Hi.

277
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,851
Hey, hey, what have I got for you?

278
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,519
Look at that.

279
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,981
<i>Oh, yum. Oh, yum.
It's good to see you.</i>

280
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,107
I did the washing.

281
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,775
You didn't get around to the lawn.

282
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,569
You're slipping, Mum.

283
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,112
Get out now.

284
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,657
You'll catch the last of the sun.

285
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,534
Slave driver.

286
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,910
Come on, come on, come on.

287
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,624
All right.

288
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,626
Would you like to bless
our food, Chiquita?

289
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,046
Jasmine? Rewa?

290
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,009
<i>Okay.</i>

291
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,886
<i>E te Atua.</i>

292
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,470
<i>Bless this food, O Lord,</i>

293
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,265
<i>and your tamariki
Jasmine, Rewa, Chiquita,</i>

294
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,641
and Garry and me,

295
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,853
so that by eating well
we will live well

296
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,646
and be happy together.

297
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,149
<i>Ake, ake, ake.</i>

298
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,400
Amen.

299
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,362
Dig in.

300
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,697
Yum.

301
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,367
I just wanted to say...

302
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,039
I'm very, very happy.

303
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,435
After you?

304
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,274
Useless.

305
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,845
Patch!

306
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,556
Patch?

307
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,516
Patch! Here, boy!

308
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,020
Garry said he'd fix your bike, Rewa.

309
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,480
Why don't you help him?

310
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,275
Can I be excused, too, Julie-Anne?

311
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,317
Yeah. Away you go.

312
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,201
Have you seen Patch, Mum?

313
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,579
<i>Oh, he'll be down
in the ditch, son.</i>

314
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,581
That's where he goes.

315
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,083
Come on, Patch!

316
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,837
I think I'll go and help Dad, too.

317
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,975
Get off my property!

318
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,310
You think you own the place!

319
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,978
Get out of there,
you trespassing horror!

320
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,189
Don't talk to my kids like that.

321
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,149
Calm down, David. Go on.

322
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,651
Don't you tell me what to do.

323
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,028
Think you're king of Aramoana.

324
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,487
This is my property, and I'll...

325
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,656
Yeah, you got something,
you sort it with me.

326
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,908
Why are they yelling?

327
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,492
Fuck you, Garry!

328
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,706
You stay away from my girls!

329
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,832
Shit.

330
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,468
Inside!

331
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,606
Fireworks?

332
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,651
Too late for fireworks, Vic.

333
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,528
I'll take a look.

334
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,895
What happened?

335
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,771
Did you cut yourself?

336
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,445
Julie-Anne! Julie-Anne!

337
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,284
<i>Oh, little dear.</i>

338
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,660
David shot me!

339
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
He shot me!

340
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,623
And he shot Dad!
Dad's lying on the grass!

341
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,749
My God!

342
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,376
<i>Oh, God.</i>

343
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,670
- He's dead, he...
- Wait there.

344
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,214
Bullet to the head.

345
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,673
Sweetheart, hold this to you.

346
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,675
And Rewa and Jasmine,
they were in the house.

347
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,552
<i>Take this. Oh, God.</i>

348
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,595
And David...

349
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,055
Get in there.

350
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,140
I'm going to take you
in the van, darling.

351
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,683
I'm going to put you in.

352
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,354
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

353
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,231
Come on, get in there.

354
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,148
In the van.

355
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,442
It'll be all right.

356
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,444
<i>Oh, God.</i>

357
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,592
Rewa!

358
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,927
- I'm scared, Julie-Anne.
- Rewa!

359
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,346
Julie-Anne, I'm scared.

360
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,515
I'm scared!

361
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,977
I'm coming back, sweetheart!

362
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,436
Get down!

363
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,188
I'm coming back!

364
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,904
Get down! Get down, Chiquita!

365
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,625
Is that a backfire?

366
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,967
Shit.

367
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,763
It's on fire!
Garry's place is on fire!

368
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,432
I'll get Tim!

369
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,062
Tim, wake up!
Holden's place is on fire!

370
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,273
Wake up, Tim!
We're going to need your room!

371
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,454
Never, I tell ya.

372
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,874
Jesus Christ.

373
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,667
What the hell's going on?

374
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,795
Get out! Get out!

375
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,047
David's got a gun!

376
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,007
I think he's gone bloody!
Now get out!

377
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,675
Go! Get out!

378
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,678
<i>Okay, put them...</i>

379
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,306
Jesus Christ.
Leave the goat!

380
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,557
Come on!

381
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,612
The key.

382
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,381
Chiquita's dad is dead.

383
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,718
Hold on. Hold on, love.

384
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,886
You all right?

385
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,697
Look! It's on fire!

386
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,160
Stanley, look!

387
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,745
What in the bloody
hell's going on?

388
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,413
Stanley, whatever can we do?

389
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,124
How about getting
into the bloody fire?

390
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,419
- Kids, stay down!
- Don't move!

391
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,004
Stay down, kids!

392
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,507
No! Stay down!

393
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,285
There's a man with a gun!

394
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,828
Get out of the way!

395
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,961
What's going on?

396
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,712
The man in the car said something...

397
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,672
Said a gun.

398
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,798
A gun.

399
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,217
Hey, that's a fire.

400
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,469
By golly, it is, too.

401
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,501
Gee... Gee...

402
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,544
Run!

403
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,503
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

404
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,838
Run! Run!

405
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,881
I can't!

406
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:01,923
Aah!

407
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,011
Aah! Aah!

408
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,787
<i>Oh...</i>

409
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,081
<i>Oh, God.</i>

410
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,797
Are you all right?

411
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,551
I... I'll come over there.

412
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,136
Don't. Don't.

413
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,014
I need an ambulance.

414
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,225
I'll get... I'll get Jimmy.

415
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,652
I've just had my hips done.

416
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,405
Well...

417
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,699
hang on.

418
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,993
It might take me a bit.

419
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,295
Ah, shit.

420
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,523
<i>Ohh!</i>

421
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,033
Mum, wait!

422
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,591
You're all right, sweetie.

423
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,551
What happened to her?

424
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,303
Have you seen Rewa or Jasmine?

425
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,679
Have you seen Rewa?

426
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,098
Rewa, Rewa, Rewa!

427
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,766
Rewa!

428
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,867
<i>Oh!</i>

429
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,130
Jimmy.

430
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,882
Jimmy!

431
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,968
Are you here, son?

432
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,651
There's a johnny out here
shooting people.

433
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,432
Nick? Phone.

434
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,603
Thank you.

435
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,937
Yeah.

436
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,097
<i>Gray is the offender.</i>

437
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,643
<i>Yeah. Roger. David Gray, 37 years,</i>

438
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,437
<i>uh, he's certainly eccentric.</i>

439
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,234
Is that you?

440
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,155
The... The man said
the ambulance is on its way.

441
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,698
<i>Oh, good idea.</i>

442
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,244
And the police are on their way, too,

443
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:24,329
so you'll soon be out of it.

444
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,208
I don't think I know you.

445
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,251
Yes, you do.

446
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,546
I'm Jimmy Dickson's mother.

447
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,548
Jimmy, with the little dog.

448
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:35,924
<i>Oh, yeah. Patch.</i>

449
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,467
Yeah.

450
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,180
He hasn't come home.

451
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,392
I'm worried about him.

452
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,477
How old is he?

453
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,937
45.

454
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:53,108
<i>Oh. Well, he'll be lying low.</i>

455
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:57,195
<i>Oh, have you got a wife?</i>

456
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,446
I should be ringing her.

457
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,741
I'm divorced. Twice.

458
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:05,537
Ha. Made a bit of a mess of my... ha...

459
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,123
Any children?

460
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,625
Don't see them very much.

461
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,921
Well, they're busy these days.

462
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,047
Yeah.

463
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,718
I see Jimmy all the time.

464
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,635
<i>Oh.</i>

465
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,512
And Heather keeps an eye on me.

466
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:23,889
Huh?

467
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,974
She's my daughter-in-law, really,

468
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:26,892
but we're very close.

469
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,102
Right.

470
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:31,479
How are you going?

471
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:34,399
Not so good.

472
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,484
Is that a siren?

473
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:47,120
I'll give that ambulance
another call, shall I?

474
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,163
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

475
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:52,334
Yeah.

476
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,715
<i>Approaching?</i>

477
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,800
<i>Go ahead.</i>

478
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,469
<i>Approaching Whataroa Bay,</i>

479
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,680
<i>which would mean 3 or 4
minutes away from the scene.</i>

480
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:08,099
Just approaching
the roadblock now.

481
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,695
<i>History, the man was shot a short time ago.</i>

482
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,155
<i>About a minute ago.</i>

483
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,911
Confirming I've got Constable
Russell Anderson with me.

484
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,665
Save a bit of the fire for me, Sid.

485
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,416
Sorry, mate.
Didn't know you were coming.

486
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,253
What have you got?

487
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,004
38.

488
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,298
<i>Armed Offenders is on its way.</i>

489
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:54,604
Hey, Nick.

490
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:55,730
Gents.

491
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,567
Locked the station keys

492
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:01,152
in the safe, left it wide open.

493
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:03,864
You guys got any spare radios?
Mine's bust.

494
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,532
Just the car radio.

495
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,798
Darren.
I could've taken you out.

496
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,258
It's David Gray.
I've seen him.

497
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:24,426
Dirty Bird automatic.

498
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,468
Up here.

499
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:27,429
Can I shoot him if I see him?

500
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:28,889
Give your. 22 to Russell, Darren.

501
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,848
It's Dad's.

502
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,516
How many rounds you got?

503
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,642
About 15.

504
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,644
Good man.
You look after the car for me.

505
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:39,649
Shit. Hold up, Stu.

506
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,340
<i>Officer Guthrie here.</i>

507
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:48,677
Get full staff at Aramoana.

508
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,971
<i>General fire order.</i>

509
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,931
<i>If you're approached
by this person</i>

510
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,599
<i>with an automatic weapon,</i>

511
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,184
<i>you are to identify him.</i>

512
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:57,519
<i>Call on him to surrender.</i>

513
00:48:57,644 --> 00:49:00,564
<i>If he doesn't, he has to be shot.</i>

514
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,984
Repeat. He can be shot.

515
00:49:58,747 --> 00:49:59,664
Psst!

516
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,918
Shit. Scared the living
shit out of me.

517
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,594
Jesus.

518
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,264
Where's the offender?

519
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,684
I think he's in there.

520
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:20,727
You think?

521
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,729
I can hear him banging about.

522
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:23,980
Where's Stu?

523
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:26,149
He's around the back.

524
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,443
Should we just peel off?

525
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,028
Bugger off.

526
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,363
You got a radio?

527
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:32,739
No.

528
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,664
Russ, you go around
the south side.

529
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:42,123
Hook up with Paul, okay?

530
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,041
<i>Okay.</i>

531
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,292
I'll take this position here.

532
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,252
- Darren.
- Yeah?

533
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:46,711
Go back to the car radio.

534
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,463
Tell Stu we're in position.

535
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:51,591
Relay any orders from Stu
back here to me, okay?

536
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,051
Yeah. Good as gold.

537
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,739
<i>Officer Guthrie.</i>

538
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,116
<i>We're receiving, sir.</i>

539
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,993
<i>We do not know
where the offender is,</i>

540
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,912
<i>but we are assuming
he is in his house.</i>

541
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:24,958
What are you doing?

542
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,334
Want to see what's going on.

543
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:27,377
Fuck off.

544
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,880
Do you hear me? Fuck off.

545
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:32,591
If the madman doesn't shoot you,
I fucking will.

546
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,050
Now fuck off.

547
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,573
Jesus Christ.

548
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:12,631
Nick.

549
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,511
Nick.

550
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,847
Vanessa.

551
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:25,644
Is that you, Vanessa?

552
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:28,688
Nick. Nick, help me.

553
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,357
Help me.

554
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:33,985
Can you move?

555
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,028
I...

556
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,821
Can you move to me?

557
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:43,995
I... I can't.

558
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,083
I can't... Legs can't move.

559
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,417
Nick.

560
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:00,470
Nicky,

561
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,598
can you see the kids, Nick?

562
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,809
Can you see Stacey?

563
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,817
I'll be with you soon, Vanessa.

564
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,902
Nick, just find my babies.

565
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,407
Just find the kids, Nick.

566
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:39,259
Jimmy.

567
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,844
Jimmy?

568
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,686
<i>Police emergency.</i>

569
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:51,897
I rang you before.

570
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,191
The ambulance hasn't come.

571
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,484
Poor devil's very bad.

572
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:57,736
<i>He'll be okay.</i>

573
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:59,696
<i>We want you to secure your house.</i>

574
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:01,489
He's by himself out there.

575
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,158
<i>I want you to shut the windows.</i>

576
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,118
I should go back.

577
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:07,829
<i>No. Shut your windows, lock the doors,</i>

578
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:10,457
<i>and keep out of sight.
Can you do that for me?</i>

579
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,583
Lock the door.

580
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,793
Shut the window.

581
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:15,337
Keep out of sight.

582
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,638
Poor beggar.

583
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,175
Halt! Police!

584
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:04,886
Stop and put your firearms down!

585
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,274
I can see him.

586
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:18,733
The offender is on foot, can confirm.

587
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,527
He's got a backpack.
His face looks blackened.

588
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,821
Walking in a northerly direction.

589
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,200
Shall we to the others?

590
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,874
Shit.

591
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:35,208
I've lost sight of the offender.

592
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,002
Lost sight of him.

593
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:38,253
We're heading across the road

594
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:39,379
towards Harvey's position.

595
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:45,218
Nick.

596
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,647
You all right, mate?

597
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,233
I need to find my boy
and his friend on bikes.

598
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,276
Have you seen them?

599
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,319
No.

600
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,278
He's got fair hair.

601
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,529
Will you be all right?

602
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:06,072
We'll be back soon. I'm sorry.

603
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,318
Guthrie, ops.

604
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,820
I have eyeball on the back
of the offender's crib.

605
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:01,753
Stop, David!
Stop or I'll shoot!

606
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,464
Don't shoot!

607
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,261
Fuck.

608
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:36,162
<i>Oh, shit, shit, shit.</i>

609
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:38,999
I just got one shot at him,
and he's gone for cover.

610
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:43,670
Jesus. Something
exploded in the house,

611
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,672
which is making me very nervous.

612
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:32,112
<i>Knox, copy?</i>

613
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,240
<i>Copy.</i>

614
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,702
<i>Sergeant Guthrie's been shot dead.</i>

615
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:42,038
<i>Repeat: Sergeant Guthrie
has been shot dead.</i>

616
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:45,584
<i>We require dogs
in the area immediately.</i>

617
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,335
<i>We've lost sight of the offender.</i>

618
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:35,842
The phone's very loud, Heather.

619
01:00:35,926 --> 01:00:37,302
<i>I've rung the police.</i>

620
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:39,679
<i>They say there's nothing
to worry about, Gran.</i>

621
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,516
But the man down by the phone box
is very bad.

622
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,684
<i>Well, no one can get in or out, Gran,</i>

623
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,353
<i>not even the ambulance.</i>

624
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:48,772
<i>They've sealed the village off
for an hour or so.</i>

625
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:51,483
<i>Look, just stay where you are.</i>

626
01:00:57,948 --> 01:00:58,865
<i>Ohh...</i>

627
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,242
<i>Are you all right, Gran?</i>

628
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:02,953
<i>Gran?</i>

629
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:07,541
Yes.

630
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:15,757
I want to go
to the toilet, Heather.

631
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:17,551
<i>I'm sure it's okay.</i>

632
01:01:17,551 --> 01:01:19,636
The toilet's outside.

633
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,805
<i>Oh.</i>

634
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,432
<i>Use the shower.</i>

635
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:27,853
I couldn't.
It's... It's unhygienic.

636
01:01:27,978 --> 01:01:29,646
<i>I'll clean it for you.</i>

637
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,148
<i>I'll scrub it, Gran, if you like.</i>

638
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:34,317
Next time I'll ring you.

639
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:35,902
It's quieter.

640
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:37,571
<i>Okay, love.</i>

641
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:39,739
<i>Uh, 20 minutes, see.</i>

642
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:40,782
Right.

643
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:42,576
<i>- On the dot.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

644
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:04,139
<i>What is the situation there?</i>

645
01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:06,349
<i>Is there any member
of the public there</i>

646
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,727
<i>we can safely evacuate?</i>

647
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:24,701
<i>You reckon he's in there?</i>

648
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,543
We could clear it.

649
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:56,191
Nick, we don't have
the training for this.

650
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:46,444
I could have shot him.

651
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:52,826
He was square in my sights.

652
01:05:55,203 --> 01:05:57,205
I waited...

653
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:59,165
hesitated.

654
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:04,588
Fucking gone.

655
01:06:11,678 --> 01:06:14,723
Come on.
Let's get rid of these guns.

656
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:14,574
Shh.

657
01:08:00,036 --> 01:08:01,288
Ness.

658
01:08:01,371 --> 01:08:02,414
Vivian?

659
01:08:02,414 --> 01:08:03,999
You hold on, girl. Hold on.

660
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,041
Stop.

661
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,084
I'll be back.

662
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,695
Please don't shoot me. Please.

663
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,697
Please don't.

664
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:44,122
I'm not going
to shoot you, sweetie.

665
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:48,710
Stacey?

666
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:57,052
I'm Paul. We're policemen.
We're here to help.

667
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:58,303
<i>Okay?</i>

668
01:08:58,303 --> 01:08:59,763
Stacey, you know me.

669
01:09:01,348 --> 01:09:03,934
I'm Jordan's dad, Nick.
You remember?

670
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:06,645
Yeah.

671
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,981
Do you know
Leo and Dion, too?

672
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:12,484
They're asleep.

673
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,544
<i>Okay, look, sweetie,</i>

674
01:09:30,627 --> 01:09:33,046
everything's going to be
all right, okay?

675
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:36,258
Sweetheart, okay?
We're here to help.

676
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:40,971
I'm just going to be down here.
I'll be right back.

677
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:47,310
We got to get them out of here.

678
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,562
Use your ute.

679
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:50,856
I may have lost my keys.

680
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:52,440
Fuck.

681
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,652
<i>One of us has to go for help.</i>

682
01:09:57,946 --> 01:09:59,531
You go.

683
01:10:04,202 --> 01:10:07,664
If you see him, you shoot him.

684
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:09,833
Don't hesitate.

685
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:21,428
Ness, I got Stacey.

686
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:22,762
Huh?

687
01:10:22,888 --> 01:10:24,222
You hang on, girl.

688
01:10:24,347 --> 01:10:25,599
You hang on. Stay awake.

689
01:10:25,682 --> 01:10:27,976
We're going to get you
out of here, okay?

690
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,061
<i>Okay? Hang on.</i>

691
01:10:33,315 --> 01:10:35,275
Whereabouts do you live, Stacey?

692
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:37,360
Mercury's Bay.

693
01:10:37,485 --> 01:10:40,822
My tummy hurts.

694
01:10:42,157 --> 01:10:43,950
Do you want me to lift you down?

695
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:48,205
I want to stay with Dion and Leo.

696
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:50,832
<i>Okay.
Are you cold, sweetie?</i>

697
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:13,772
It's okay.

698
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,486
It's okay. It's okay.

699
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:21,363
We're safe here.

700
01:12:06,408 --> 01:12:07,784
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

701
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,835
Knox, it's Harvey.

702
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:18,295
It's cleared.

703
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:26,845
<i>Okay. you're on.</i>

704
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:28,847
We're going to get you out of here.

705
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,016
<i>Okay, it's time to go.</i>

706
01:12:32,809 --> 01:12:34,352
Ness.

707
01:13:14,518 --> 01:13:15,852
Here you go.

708
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:18,063
Yeah. They all right?

709
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,399
It's okay.

710
01:14:00,897 --> 01:14:03,191
Hey, Stace.

711
01:14:04,776 --> 01:14:06,319
Do you remember

712
01:14:06,403 --> 01:14:08,613
when I came to your kindie?

713
01:14:10,907 --> 01:14:13,827
And you and Jordan were
playing on the jungle gym.

714
01:14:13,952 --> 01:14:16,538
Do you remember that? Yeah?

715
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:19,666
And you had
the big wooden truck,

716
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:21,459
and Jordan was in the back,

717
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,336
and I pushed you guys.

718
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,880
Yeah.

719
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:28,842
And then your teacher, Mrs., uh...

720
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:31,553
What's her name?

721
01:14:31,678 --> 01:14:33,221
What was the teacher's name?

722
01:14:33,346 --> 01:14:34,556
Mrs. Ivey.

723
01:14:34,681 --> 01:14:36,474
Ah, Mrs. Ivey.

724
01:14:36,558 --> 01:14:38,435
She read us that story.

725
01:14:38,435 --> 01:14:40,729
<i>Hairy McClary.</i>

726
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:45,108
From Donaldson's Dairy.

727
01:14:45,233 --> 01:14:47,319
Hercules Morse,

728
01:14:47,402 --> 01:14:50,447
as big as a horse.

729
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,241
<i>Bitzer Maloney.</i>

730
01:14:53,325 --> 01:14:55,243
All?

731
01:14:55,243 --> 01:14:56,995
Skinny and bony?

732
01:14:56,995 --> 01:14:57,954
Yeah.

733
01:14:58,038 --> 01:15:00,540
And Muffin McLay...

734
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:01,583
like...

735
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,877
A bundle of hay.

736
01:15:04,002 --> 01:15:06,505
And Scarface Claws.

737
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:10,008
The toughest tom in town.

738
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:11,593
That's it, that's it.

739
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:15,764
And he raced them,
and he chased them

740
01:15:15,889 --> 01:15:19,643
all the way home.

741
01:15:19,726 --> 01:15:21,603
Stace, hey, look at me.

742
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:24,105
That's it, that's it.
You can stay awake.

743
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:27,234
And he raced them,
and he chased them

744
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,821
all the way home.

745
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,698
Yeah. Good.

746
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:35,909
That's a girl.

747
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:12,005
Patch?

748
01:17:15,258 --> 01:17:18,595
Hang on. Hang on, Patch. Hang on.

749
01:17:21,223 --> 01:17:22,974
<i>Oh, you little horror.</i>

750
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,236
<i>Ohh...</i>

751
01:17:38,823 --> 01:17:40,617
Where does it hurt, Patch?

752
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:42,369
Where does it hurt?

753
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:35,333
<i>...Wales and the New Zealand
Governor General...</i>

754
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:07,073
<i>...doesn't sound too rosy.</i>

755
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:10,619
<i>...because David loved...</i>

756
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:12,704
<i>She did talk
to her son himself.</i>

757
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:15,207
<i>She sort of feels
that maybe one or two...</i>

758
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:28,136
<i>...his family is staying</i>

760
01:21:30,597 --> 01:21:32,307
<i>But he says having
everyone together</i>

761
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,267
<i>has been a great boost
for his mother.</i>

762
01:21:34,267 --> 01:21:36,269
<i>He says she's been
completely overwhelmed...</i>

763
01:23:10,614 --> 01:23:13,033
I heard a policeman
had been shot.

764
01:23:16,453 --> 01:23:18,246
I thought it was you.

765
01:23:28,423 --> 01:23:30,634
It was Stu.

766
01:23:32,302 --> 01:23:33,970
It was Stu.

767
01:23:55,659 --> 01:23:58,578
Those kids...

768
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:00,997
and Vanessa.

769
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,098
There.

770
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:19,766
<i>Oh...</i>

<i>Shots firedl He fired shots at usl</i>

People in Aramoana,
near Dunedin,

774
01:27:11,813 --> 01:27:13,481
are waking this morning to a tragedy

775
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:15,859
which hit the tiny township last night,

776
01:27:15,984 --> 01:27:18,153
leaving at least two dead,
several missing...

777
01:27:18,153 --> 01:27:19,321
...feared dead.

778
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:20,238
...might meet again

779
01:27:20,363 --> 01:27:22,115
outside David Gray's house.

780
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,075
<i>...have told New Zealand News</i>

781
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:26,411

782
01:27:26,494 --> 01:27:27,746
in the Utakura Harbor town.

783
01:27:27,871 --> 01:27:28,997
<i>Others have been told</i>

784
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:30,999
to pull their blinds
and stay inside.

785
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:33,585
If they venture outside,
there is a possibility...

786
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,795
<i>They may have
to shoot the crazed gunman</i>

787
01:27:35,879 --> 01:27:37,464
on the loose in
Aramoana near Dunedin.

788
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:42,469
<i>Just a revised death toll

<i>on the Aramoana shooting.</i>

790

<i>There are now 11 people
dead from the shooting.</i>

791
01:27:47,265 --> 01:27:49,976
<i>Uh, they include three children...</i>

792
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,645
<i>two boys and a girl...</i>

793
01:27:51,645 --> 01:27:53,104
<i>a number of women...</i>

<i>Gran?</i>

795
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,419
I... I went to sleep, Heather.

796
01:28:57,419 --> 01:28:59,087
<i>I was worried.</i>

797
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:01,798
<i>It's been on for an hour.</i>

798
01:29:01,923 --> 01:29:05,760
What about Jimmy, yeah?

799
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:11,099
I think of him lying
out there somewhere.

800
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:12,851
<i>You mustn't, Gran.</i>

801
01:29:14,936 --> 01:29:18,481
Cold and hurt.

802
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:21,818
<i>We're all here together, Gran,</i>

803
01:29:21,902 --> 01:29:24,112
<i>waiting for you.</i>

804

<i>We're so proud of you.</i>

808

Down there, down there.

809
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:18,513
Drop your weapons

<i>Oh, good. Good.</i>

811
01:41:01,893 --> 01:41:05,146

<i>In my eye</i>

<i>And an ocean of swallowed pride</i>

01:41:14,197 --> 01:41:16,491
<i>There's a heart here</i>

815
01:41:16,616 --> 01:41:20,787
<i>That beats like a drum</i>

<i>There's a temple in my mind</i>
