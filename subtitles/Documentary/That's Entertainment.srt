<i>- If the song - If the song</i>

154

<i>- Head - Head</i>

156
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,402
That's just a sample of what's been going
on around here for the past 40 years.

157
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,113
The work was hard, but it was great fun.

158
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,408
Because the people you worked with
really knew what they were doing.

159
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,621
It was said that through those doors
passed the most famous stars in Hollywood.

160
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,291
I don't think you'll find anyone around
this town who will argue about it.

161
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,294
Here's one of the most lovely
and talented of those stars...

162
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,004
...Miss Elizabeth Taylor.

163
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,771
I was 10 years old when I first came to MGM.

164
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,108
And I spent most of the next 18 years
of my life...

165
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,486
...behind the walls of that studio.

166
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,697
As a young girl growing up
in that strange place...

167
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,742
...it's hard to recall
what was real and what wasn't.

168
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,164
Perhaps, my most vivid memories
were of MGM musicals.

169
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,667
Just to stand there on the set and watch...

170
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:55,505
...the singing and the dancing.
It was like fantasy come true.

171
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,050
Total innocence. Loveliness.

172
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,472
[SINGING] <i>I</i> love a melody

<i>Birds on the wing</i>

176
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,691
TAYLOR: <i>I made my musical debut
when I was 15 years old...</i>

177
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,859
<i>...in</i> a <i>film called Cynthia.</i>

178
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,655
<i>I was certainly no threat
to Jane Powell or Judy Garland...</i>

179
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,115
<i>...as you will see.</i>

180
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,994

00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:34,002
<i>Whenever I hear</i>

183
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,380
<i>The music</i>

<i>Spring</i>

186
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,892
Maybe that experience helped give me...

187
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,438
...the enormous regard
that I have for musical talent.

188
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,733
And believe me, at MGM, I saw the best.

What wonderful years those were at MGM.

241
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,337
One day, I remember meeting a terribly
handsome young man from England.

242
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,883
He'd just started work at the studio.
Naturally, I fell wildly in love with him.

243
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,885
I still adore him.

244
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,555
He's still one of my closest
and dearest friends.

Peter Lawford.

246
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,410
This building, or what's left of it...

247
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,372
...was, among other things,
Tait College in Good <i>News.</i>

248
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,418
You might say that June Allyson,
Mel Torme and I graduated from here.

249
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,755
We were all under contract to MGM
in those days.

250
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:57,593
And the studio pretty much told us
what pictures we were gonna appear in.

251
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,930
They put us in dramas, comedies
and in my case...

252
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,600
...don't ask me why, an occasional musical.

253
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,855
As a singer or dancer, I was ill-equipped
to compete with Astaire or Kelly...

254
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,025
...but we did what we were told to do.

here at home...</i>

257
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,331

a very special kind of escape...</i>

258
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,126
<i>...both during the war and afterwards.</i>

259
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,798
<i>The films we made here had a certain style...</i>

260
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,008
<i>...a look that was unmistakable.</i>

261
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,137
<i>Whether it was the directing,
or the writing, or the scenery...</i>

262
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,515
<i>...the costumes, the lighting,
I don't really know.</i>

<i>But somehow you could always tell
that it was an MGM movie.</i>

00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,187
<i>Especially the musicals.</i>

00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,043
By the 1950s, the movie musical
was reaching a level...

341
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,672
...of inventiveness and sophistication
that was pretty hard to top...

342
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,757
...even by today's standards.

343
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:34,096
But it wasn't always like that.
And here's someone to tell you about it.

344
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:38,434
And he's pretty hard to top too.
Mr. James Stewart.

345
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,605
In the late 1920s and early '30s...

346
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,902
...these 200 acres of real estate
were seeing a panic, pandemonium.

347
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:53,949
Sound pictures had replaced silent films
virtually overnight.

348
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,245
The only actor in town that wasn't worried
was Rin Tin Tin.

349
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,999
As long as he could bark,
well, sound was no threat to him.

<i>STEWART".
For MGM and the rest of Hollywood...</i>

351
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,300
<i>...there were gloomy days ahead.</i>

352
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,555
<i>Some of the biggest silent stars
spoke with thick foreign accents.</i>

353
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:20,642
<i>Others had a lisp
or talked through their noses.</i>

354
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,355
<i>The early microphones seemed
to exaggerate the flaws...</i>

355
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,900
<i>...that silent film had hidden.</i>

356
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:32,821
<i>As quickly as the sound stages went up,
careers collapsed.</i>

357
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,284
<i>The studio heads were desperate.</i>

358
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,872
<i>Where would the new stars, the new
personalities come from, they wondered.</i>

359
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,168
<i>Well, the answer was obvious.
From the theater, from Broadway.</i>

360
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:51,006
<i>Theatrical experience suddenly became
a passport to Hollywood...</i>

361
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,344
<i>...even if it meant no more than
a few weeks of summer stock.</i>

362
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:00,015
<i>Over the next few years,
a steady stream of hopefuls...</i>

363
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:04,520
<i>...marched through the gates of
every studio in town, including MGM.</i>

364
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:13,195
<i>I should know, I was one of those
hungry young actors from the East.</i>

- Okay, Fred.

<i>STEWART". Musicals were the most popular
commodity in the early '30s.</i>

<i>Most of them really weren't very good.</i>

<i>But if audiences suffered,
they didn't complain.</i>

374
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,554
<i>The real victims were the dramatic actors.</i>

375

428
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,348
<i>STEWART". Jean Harlow's musical talents
were somewhat limited...</i>

<i>...and the studio usually used

00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:19,167
<i>...they figured the song was so good
that even my singing couldn't hurt it.</i>

456
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,629
<i>[SINGING] We'd be so grand</i>

457
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,714
<i>At the game</i>

458
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,759
<i>So carefree together</i>

459
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,847
<i>That it does seem a shame</i>

460
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,975
<i>That you can't see</i>

461
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,063
<i>Your future with me</i>

462
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:44,192
<i>'Cause you'd be, oh</i>

463
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:51,158
<i>So easy to love</i>

464
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,787
I know that you'll join us in giving
a really rousing, rip-roaring reception...

465
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,665
...to Harry Van and Les Blondes. Mr. Van.

466
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,752
<i>STEWART". Norma Shearer and Edward
Arnold looked on as Clark Gable...</i>

467
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,547
<i>...made his musical debut in Idiot's Delight.</i>

468
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,633
GABLE: Hello, people, and thanks a lot
for that very lovely reception.

469
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,470
Thanks a million,
and I won't settle for a cent less.

470
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,055
In our modest act tonight,
we'll be ably assisted...

471
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,893
...by Professor Palova and his talented
team. Give them a hand, folks.

472
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,565
Okey-dokey, fellas. Take it away.

473
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,612
- This will be amusing, Achille.
- I hope so.

474
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,076
<i>[SINGING] If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to</i>

475
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,954
<i>Why don't you go Where Harlem sits?</i>

476
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,956
<i>Puttin' on the Ritz</i>

477

<i>Spangled gowns upon the bevy Of highbrows</i>

478
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,671
<i>But down the levee All misfits</i>

479
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,423
<i>Puttin' on the Ritz</i>

480
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:52,719
<i>That's where each and every Lulu Belle goes</i>

481
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,932
<i>Every Thursday evening With her swell beaus</i>

482
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,099
<i>Rubbing elbows</i>

00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,936
<i>Come with me and we'll attend The jubilee</i>

484
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,855
<i>And see them spend Their last two bits</i>

485
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,815
<i>Puttin' on the Ritz</i>

486
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,883
<i>STEWART". Clark Gable surprised everyone
with his delightfully corny routine.</i>

487
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,594
<i>And yet, his fans were just outraged...</i>

488
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,139
<i>...to see him even try singing and dancing.</i>

489
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,976
<i>Their hero was above such nonsense.</i>

490
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,688
<i>But it was perfectly all right
for a youngster named Judy Garland...</i>

491
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,440
<i>...to dedicate a song to their idol.</i>

492
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,277
GARLAND [SINGING]: Dear Mr. <i>Gable</i>

493
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,738
<i>I am writing this to you</i>

494
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:58,660
<i>And I hope that you will read it
So you'll know</i>

495
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:02,789
<i>My heart beats like a hammer</i>

496
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,667
<i>And I stutter and I stammer</i>

497
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:11,006
<i>Every time I see you At the picture show</i>

498
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,845
<i>I guess I'm just another fan of yours</i>

499
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:23,643
<i>And I thought I'd write And tell you so</i>

500
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>You made me love you</i>

501
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,238
<i>I didn't wanna do it</i>

502
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,825
<i>I didn't wanna do it</i>

503
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,456
<i>You made me love you</i>

504
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,875
<i>And all the time you knew it</i>

505
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,878
<i>I guess you always knew it</i>

506
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,715
<i>You made me happy</i>

507
00:43:54,382 --> 00:44:00,847
<i>Sometimes you made</i> me <i>glad</i>

508
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:07,145
<i>But there were times, sir</i>

509
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:12,567
<i>You made me feel so sad</i>

510
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:18,114
<i>You made me sigh 'cause</i>

511
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,867
<i>I didn't wanna tell you</i>

512
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,495
<i>I didn't wanna tell you</i>

513
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,291
<i>I think you're grand</i>

514
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,959
<i>That's true</i>

515
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:35,048
<i>Yes, I do, 'deed I do You know I do</i>

516
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:40,053
<i>I don't care what happens
Let the whole world stop</i>

517
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,433
<i>As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the top</i>

518
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,395
<i>'Cause you know</i>

519
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,398
<i>You made me</i>

520
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:58,363
<i>Love you</i>

521
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,827
"Dear Mr. Gable" was a milestone in its day.

522
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,623
It was the first time a studio permitted
a song to be dedicated to one of its stars.

523
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,084
And it was sung by a little girl...

524
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,963
...who would soon become MGM's newest star.

525
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,217
And here's someone who can tell you
more about that remarkable talent.

526
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,096
He's a remarkable talent himself.
Mickey Rooney.

527
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,330
This is Carvel Street.

528
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,417
For anyone who's ever seen
an Andy Hardy movie...

529
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,545
...well, this is where
they were all shot, right here.

530
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:59,257
Over there, that was
Polly Benedict's home across the street.

531
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,843
And this was the home of the Hardy family.

532
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,305
The picket fence is gone,
and the mailbox too...

533
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:08,308
...but it's still the Hardy home.

534
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:12,937
It might seem strange
that a person could spend over 20 years...

535
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,523
...growing up on the same movie set.

536
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,234
But in a way, that's what happened to me.

537
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,489
I was about 10 years old when I first came
to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer...

538
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,365
...and I was raring to go.

539
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,172
ROONEY: The <i>movie</i> was Broadway to Hollywood.

540
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:41,925
<i>And you guessed it, it was a musical.</i>

541
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,469
[APPLAUSE]

542
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,893
Well, we-- We all change a little
over the years, don't we?

543
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:56,606
You know, when you've been raised
at a studio, the way I was...

544
00:46:56,773 --> 00:47:00,401
...you learn a certain ability
that time can't seem to erase.

545
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,696
You learn to recognize real talent.

546
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,907
You see so many people come and go...

547
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,368
...that when an exceptional talent
comes along...

548
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:11,246
...it seems to stick out like a sore thumb.

549
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,749
I was a seasoned veteran of 17
when I first had the opportunity...

550
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,253
...of working with the great
and wonderful Judy Garland.

551
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,589
I knew when I saw her
standing before the camera...

552
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,383
...that she had that certain magic.

553
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,052
Her talent seemed to jump
right off the screen at you.

554
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,179
GARLAND [SINGING]: Do re <i>mi</i> fa so la <i>ti</i> do

555
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,766
<i>RODNEY: Judy and I became close friends
when we did a series of films together...</i>

556
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:35,562
<i>...that the studio called
"backyard musicals."</i>

557
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,022
<i>Audiences seemed to love the pictures...</i>

558
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,483
<i>...even though the plots
were suspiciously alike.</i>

559
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,361
<i>Only our names seemed to change.</i>

560
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,029
How do you do?

561
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,283
Good morning. I'm Betsy Booth.

562
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,702
- I sing, you know.
- I know, I heard you.

563
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,328
You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?

564
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,956
This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.

565
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,708
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.

566
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,127
Danny, this is my grandchild,
Ms. Ginger Gray.

567
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:02,630
- Yes, we've met.
- This is my cousin, Ms. Polly Williams.

568
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,091
Mr. Daniel Churchill, a junior.

569
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:08,136
Ms. Barton, this is Ms. Essex,
the once famous "Baby Rosalie."

570
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,638
How do you do? This is Mickey Moran.

571
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,973
How do you do?

572
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,517
My name's Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?

573
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,853
- I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.

574
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,104
You're welcome.

575
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,650
- I want success.
- And you'll have it.

576
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:26,905
I know you will, Mickey. Just think
when our names are up in electric lights.

577
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,408
You the big composer and producer,
and me the singing star.

578
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,119
We could have our own great
modern dance orchestra.

579
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,955
We've got everything we need here.
We've got the brass...

580
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,582
...the piano and the reeds.

581
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,336
We can make our own arrangements,
specialties and play for all the dances.

582
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,963
We've gotta have a great show
with a million laughs.

583
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,424
And color, a lot of lights to make it sparkle.

584
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,344
And songs, wonderful songs
with you out there selling them.

585
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,511
It'll be wonderful.

586
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,640
Say, that's not a bad idea.

587
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,517
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.

588
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,103
Why, it looks as if you'll need
a whole city block.

589
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,356
Yeah. Sure, that's it.

590
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,150
Right in the neighborhood,
and everybody'll come to it.

591
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:06,861
A Western rodeo, once a year
we'll bring back the West.

592
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,905
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James, Buffalo Bill.

593
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,990
- A hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.

594
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,242
- Glorious costumes, happy, carefree.
- Gay!

595
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,912
I'm gonna write a show for us
right here in Seaport.

596
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,207
It'd be the most up-to-date thing
these hicks around here have seen.

597
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,709
Opening night, we'll have
Max Gordon and Sam Harris...

598
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,545
...down to give us the once-over.
How about it, kids?

599
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,966
<i>- They call us babes in arms - We never dance</i>

600
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,386
<i>- They think they must direct us
- But no chance</i>

601
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,806
<i>- But if we're babes in arms - High romance</i>

602
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,351
<i>- We'll make them all respect us
- Why, oh, why</i>

603
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,187
<i>Why have we got our arms</i>

604
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,899
<i>What have we got our sight for?</i>

605
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,860

<i>RODNEY". When our movies took off
at the box office...</i>

608
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,833
<i>...we found our budgets taking off too.</i>

609
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,753
<i>So they moved Judy and I
out of the backyard and into the barn...</i>

610
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,505
<i>...then to the high school gym...</i>

611
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,926
<i>...and later to a Broadway stage
that would never have fit in a real theater.</i>

612
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,595
<i>Where we got all that energy,
I'll never know.</i>

613
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:18,266
<i>But a lot of it was inspired
by our director, a genius...</i>

614
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,851
<i>...Busby Berkeley.</i>

<i>We left Topeka We left Eureka</i>

<i>Strike up the band</i>

who worked on this lot with Judy...</i>

643
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,312
<i>...and some of MGM's best musicals...</i>

644
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,899
<i>...are a direct result
of his considerable talents.</i>

<i>Gene Kelly.</i>

646
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,322
This is MGM's New York street.

647
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,783
And for as long as I can remember...

648
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,662
...this has been the busiest standing set
on the whole backlot.

649
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,455
Any actor or actress...

650
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:13,167
...who made more than one or two films
at this studio...

651
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:17,588
...sooner or later probably would find
himself shooting a sequence here.

652
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,925
Which reminds me,
if you're a song-and-dance man...

653
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:23,678
...and you've spent some time in pictures...

654
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,472
...inevitably, some interviewer will ask:

655
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,141
"Who was your favorite dancing partner?

656
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:33,521
Was it Rita Hayworth, or Vera-Ellen,
or Leslie Caron?"

657
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:37,441
But if you're smart,
you'll never give them a straight answer.

658
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,112
I'm gonna break that rule right now.

659
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,072
It may not be gallant...

660
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:47,660
...but I'd like to show you
the greatest partner I've ever danced with.

<i>KELLY: When you dance with Fred Astaire,
you really have to be on your toes.</i>

<i>This</i> number from Ziegfeld Follies...

663
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,387
<i>...was the only time we've had a chance
to work together.</i>

664
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:10,057
<i>But I'd change my name to Ginger
if we could do it again.</i>

665
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,809
<i>KELLY". Fred Astaire has been the tops...</i>

666
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,478
<i>...in every field of show business
he ever entered.</i>

667
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,731
<i>And the motion-picture musical
owes him a great deal.</i>

ASTAIRE [SINGING]: The way you wear your hat

669

<i>The way you sip your tea</i>

<i>The memory of all that</i>

671

<i>No, no They can't take that away from me</i>

672
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,507
<i>The way your smile just beams</i>

673
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,470
<i>The way you sing off-key</i>

674
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:17,226
<i>The way you haunt my dreams</i>

675
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:23,315
<i>No, no They can't take that away from me</i>

676
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:28,154
<i>KELLY". When he starred in a series
of musicals with Ginger Rogers...</i>

677
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,948
<i>...they quickly became
the most popular dance team...</i>

678
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,033
<i>...in the history of motion pictures.</i>

679
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,578
<i>But for Fred, as an individual...</i>

680
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,289
<i>...it was only the beginning
of a screen career...</i>

681
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:41,876
<i>...that would delight
several generations of moviegoers.</i>

00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,949
ASTAIRE [SINGING]: Stand <i>up</i> and sing

683
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,285
<i>We've got the gang together</i>

684
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,412
<i>We always sang together</i>

685
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,581
<i>Stand up and sing</i>

686
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,417
KELLY: <i>Over the years,
Fred Astaire's trademark would become...</i>

687
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,919
<i>...the top hat and tails.</i>

688
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,047
<i>He wore the outfit
in his very first film appearance...</i>

689
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:30,549
...Dancing Lady <i>with</i> Joan Crawford.

690
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,916
BOTH <i>[SINGING]:
I guess I'll have to change my plan</i>

691
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:08,796
<i>I should have realized There'd be another man</i>

692
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,299
KELLY: <i>Jack Buchanan,
the debonair British musical star...</i>

693
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:14,343
...joined <i>Fred</i> in The Band Wagon.

694
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:18,514
BOTH <i>[SINGING]: Until the big affair began</i>

695
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,935
<i>Before I knew where I was at</i>

696
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,856
<i>I found myself upon the shelf
And that was that</i>

697
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:31,652
<i>I tried to reach the moon</i>

698
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,280
<i>But when I got there</i>

699
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,075
<i>All that I could get was the air</i>

700
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,996
<i>My feet are back upon the ground</i>

701
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:48,335
<i>I've lost the one girl I'd found</i>

702
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:54,675
<i>KELLY". But besides elegance,
there's a lot more to the Astaire style.</i>

703
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,220
<i>Fred was constantly striving for perfection.</i>

704
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,556
<i>Rehearsing hour after hour...</i>

705
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,933
<i>...searching for a new step
or a new device...</i>

706
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,645
<i>...that would bring something fresh
to each of his numbers.</i>

707
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,407
<i>KELLY".
Because of his ingenuity and precision...</i>

708
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,368
<i>...audiences never realized
how much incredible effort...</i>

709
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,203
<i>...Fred poured into his work.</i>

710
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,706
<i>He made it all appear so easy.</i>

711
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,251
<i>In</i> Royal <i>Wedding,
Fred danced with</i> a <i>hat rack.</i>

712
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,713
<i>And as usual, he made his partner look good.</i>

713
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,422
KELLY: In The Barkleys of Broadway...

714
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,008
<i>...Fred and choreographer Hermes Pan...</i>

715
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,929
<i>...conceived the brilliant
"Shoes With Wings On" number.</i>

716
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,516
<i>KELLY". Fred and director Stanley Donen...</i>

717
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:11,019
<i>...collaborated on this mind-boggling routine
from</i> Royal <i>Wedding.</i>

718
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,898
<i>Movie buffs are still arguing
about how it was done.</i>

719
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,528
<i>KELLY". The gimmicks Fred used
were exciting and fun.</i>

720
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,905
<i>But his talents were so extraordinary...</i>

721
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,908
<i>...that he could easily get along
without them.</i>

722
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,369
<i>This is the Astaire I love to watch.</i>

723
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:53,330
<i>With a lovely partner like Cyd Charisse...</i>

724
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,165
<i>...a simple setting...</i>

725
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,919
...a <i>marvelous song by Howard Dietz
and Arthur Schwartz...</i>

726
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,588
<i>...these are the only ingredients
Fred would need...</i>

727
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,715
<i>...to create a classic moment.</i>

728
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,802
<i>"Dancing in the Dark" from The Band</i> Wagon.

729
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,360
Fred Astaire was and is a unique talent.

730
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,695
There'll never be another like him...

731
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,573
...and that's what I love
about our profession.

732
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:54,326
Because every so often
an artist comes along...

733
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,995
...who's impossible to compare
with anyone else.

734
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:00,540
<i>KELLY". Here's another
of my favorite dancing partners...</i>

735
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,042
...Donald O'Connor.

736
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:06,296
MGM seemed to acquire talent
the way you and I pick up paper clips...

737
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,090
...by the handful.

738
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,675
When I was at the studio...

739
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:14,054
...we were up to our ears in tenors,
baritones, tap dancers, pianists...

740
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,098
...and they were all good.

741
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,725
But this set belonged pretty much
to one star...

742
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,560
...and one star alone.

743
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:23,313
I only wish we'd had a chance
to work together.

744
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,818
Well, she was not only a lovely actress,
with a beautiful face and figure...

745
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:31,530
...but she could also sing and dance,
and even handle comedy.

746
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:37,077
And if that wasn't enough,
she was dynamite in the water.

747
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,455
Of course I'm talking about
Ms. Esther Williams.

748
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,000
O'CONNOR: <i>A champion swimmer...</i>

749
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,628
<i>...Esther was working as a model
in a Los Angeles department store...</i>

750
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:49,423
<i>...when MGM talent scouts discovered her.</i>

751
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,305
<i>The studio built a special swimming pool
for her on the backlot...</i>

752
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,434
...and starred her in a film <i>called</i>
Bathing Beauty.

753
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,269
<i>The rest is history.</i>

754
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,694
<i>O'CONNOR". MGM featured Esther
in a series of spectacular productions.</i>

755

[APPLAUSE]

1224
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:02,823
Thank God for film.

1225
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:06,619
It can capture a performance
and hold it right there forever.

1226
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:10,456
And if anyone says to you,
"Who was he?" or "Who was she?"

1227
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,458
Or "What made them so good?"

1228
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:17,213
I think a piece of film answers that
question better than any words I know of.

1229
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:20,800
My generation... Well, we're just beginning.

1230
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:25,221
It takes a lot of film
and a lot of experience...

1231
01:51:25,888 --> 01:51:28,474
...and a lot of talent to become a real star.

1232
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:33,104
Now here's somebody who I think
qualifies on all of those counts. Oh, boy.

1233
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,647
Mr. Bing Crosby.

1234
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:39,568
You know, one sound stage,
well, it looks pretty much like another.

1235
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:42,822
But a backlot, out here
where they shoot the exteriors...

1236
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:46,951
...that seems to me that the backlot
reflects the personality...

1237
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:48,786
...the character of its studio.

1238
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,162
This was the biggest...

1239
01:51:50,329 --> 01:51:53,666
...and I think, perhaps,
the best backlot in all of Hollywood.

1240
01:51:54,083 --> 01:51:58,254
Of course the old backlot looks
a little shabby right now, sort of scruffy...

1241
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,673
...kind of an illusion on an illusion...

1242
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,634
...but that's because
most Hollywood filmmakers...

1243
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,594
...they don't use backlots any more.

1244
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:07,430
They prefer the real thing.

1245

1249

[LAUGHS]

1266
01:53:15,206 --> 01:53:17,917
Well, it was vigorous. Spirited, anyhow.

1267
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:22,171
I was, what you might call,
a casual participant in MGM musicals...

1268
01:53:22,338 --> 01:53:24,173
<i>"because over 20 years went by...</i>

1269
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:26,842
...between the little effort
which you've just seen...

1270
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:28,469
...and my next attempt.

1271
01:53:28,636 --> 01:53:31,013
And I found fantastic changes had occurred.

1272
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:34,725
They had color, oh, stereophonic sound,
even wide screens.

1273
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:38,979
And MGM, in a loose moment,
had decided to give me another chance...

1274
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:42,191
...in a little pastiche
to be called High Society.

1275
01:53:42,358 --> 01:53:45,736
This starred Grace Kelly, Louis Armstrong,
and Celeste Holm...

1276
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,863
...and was directed by Chuck Walters.

1277
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,741
Oh, yes, there was another
featured performer in there.

1278
01:53:50,908 --> 01:53:53,911
What was his name?
A brash young newcomer. Frank, uh--

1279
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:56,914
A clever kid.
He had a lot to offer too. Frank, uh--

1280
