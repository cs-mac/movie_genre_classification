1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,999
For a long time

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,959
I watched the ocean
without understanding it.

4
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,999
I could see the enormous energy
the feel of water.

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,279
I was amazed at the deep blue color.

6
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,159
I breathed the air
of the vast open waters.

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,279
But in reality, I saw nothing.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,879
Here in Shark Bay in Australia

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,599
the cliffs whisper to me
the history of the earth.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,079
They are born from the ocean of life,

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,719
a vast graveyard arise
billions of skeletons of sea creatures

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,839
standing on the seabed have accumulated
when the earth itself was only ocean.

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,599
These organisms
created the air that I breathe

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,959
and the atmosphere that protects me.

15
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,799
I see strong tidal
cutting those tracks in the sand.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,959
I do not see that this movement
is the source of all life.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,759
I see how the wind shapes the dunes.

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,079
I do not see the profound relationship
between the earth and the sea.

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,239
I see how salt makes the earth white.

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,239
I do not see what the ocean brings to life
on the continents.

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,679
I see vast prairies
which colonize the depths

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,279
as I have never seen on land.

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,759
But at Shark Bay, there is more.

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,599
Here lies the origin of our story,

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,919
of us, humanity.

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,919
It starts here
with a colony of living fossils,

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,599
bacteria attached to the surface
of ocean life, the stromatolites.

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,079
I am a descendant
of this form of life,

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,439
whose birth dates
4 billion years.

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,239
I came from the ocean.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,159
And now,

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,319
looking at the ocean,
I only see us, humanity.

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,279
We are seven billion people.

34
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,719
We have formed the world
in our image.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,199
On the shores of the ocean

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,039
We have built large cities
where we live in millions.

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,079
We dug ports, flattened islands
to build factories.

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,879
The ocean has given us all mineral
resources of the globe.

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,399
We process materials, smelting steel,
cutting and chopping.

40
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,639
Hundred thousand ships
crisscrossing over the seas.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,999
Everything that lives and grows on earth,
eventually comes into our iron grip.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,999
We even carry the woods.

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,159
We constantly digging in the ocean
to nourish us.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,439
We have become a super predator.

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,959
We put our lives in boxes.

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,399
We ship 600 million containers,
thanks to the ocean.

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,039
The ocean
which gave us the opportunity of globalization.

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,159
The planet is ours.

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,119
And how do we go from here?

50
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,559
I am aware
the consequences of my power.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,679
Overfishing, global warming,

52
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,599
depletion of natural resources, pollution,

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,959
my actions have many consequences.

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,079
I know this

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,839
because I am able
to understand what is happening to me.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,199
How did I reach this point

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
where I no longer see
what is happening around me?

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,759
To understand this,
we must go back to the beginning.

59
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,079
In the beginning the earth itself was destroyed

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,199
and was plagued by violent convulsions.

61
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,559
The melting accompanied by
violent meteor impacts

62
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,759
from the solar system.

63
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,599
This battlefield created an atmosphere

64
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,159
which was stormy, red of nitrogen,
carbon and hydrogen.

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,119
And water vapor, which probably came from
ice comets of the galaxy...

66
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,759
The surface of the earth
was like a huge bubble

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,759
which was heated under pressure
to more than 700°C.

68
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,199
Then the fire cooled
and the vapors condensed

69
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,319
to produce the greatest of all earthly
floods.

70
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,159
That was four billion years ago.

71
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
The flood covered almost all
the earth's crust.

72
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,319
The water washed over the prehistoric rocks,

73
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,639
loaded with salt,
so that it eroded.

74
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,079
The earth was a world of salt water.

75
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,639
This water was called the ocean.

76
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,599
An ocean planet was born.

77
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,399
During the Ice Age,

78
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,039
700 million years ago,
the temperature dropped.

79
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,079
The planet remained white
20 million years ago

80
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,399
and then began to melt
by a powerful greenhouse effect

81
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,039
that was created
by the carbon of the volcanoes.

82
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,279
There were several ice ages
which were interspersed with heat.

83
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,159
From this period

84
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,999
comes the vast icy areas
to the north and south poles of the globe.

85
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,999
These areas act as chillers
in a huge climate machine.

86
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,119
Close to the equator

87
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,799
the sun heats the ocean, which seems to boil.

88
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,719
This contrasts
between the hot and cold regions

89
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,319
generates powerful airflow.

90
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,399
These are the winds
which are essential in this story.

91
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,879
The cold, heavy winds descend
from the polar regions

92
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,079
and collide with warm, light air
of the equator.

93
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,279
These winds, which rotate
by the rotation of the earth,

94
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,279
forming giant vortices.

95
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,799
If the winds come into contact
with the ocean, they push the water.

96
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
They generate strong currents

97
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,079
capable of moving millions of
cubic meters of water through the ocean.

98
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,159
The ocean is everywhere
furrowed by whirlpools,

99
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,399
some of which run for years.

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,479
This movement spreads heat
from the surface of the blue planet.

101
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,199
The warm water from the tropics
rises toward the poles.

102
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,039
This water cools, becomes even more compact
and is loaded with salt

103
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,719
back into the depths.

104
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,519
The water travels through the depths
towards the bottom of the ocean,

105
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,759
propelled by its own weight.

106
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,919
It brings with it the polar cold.

107
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,559
Ultimately, it collides against the bottom

108
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,479
and returns to the waters
to the surface, where the weather warms up.

109
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,319
It takes 1,000 years for one drop of water
to complete this ocean cycle.

110
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,719
These flows have created
a temperate climate on earth.

111
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,319
Thanks to this,
it is a living planet.

112
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,879
When the sun is powerful
and flows are rising to the surface

113
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,479
there is an extraordinary phenomenon,

114
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,279
so immense that it is
visible from space,

115
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,799
It is called a "bloom",
an explosion of life.

116
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,439
This life that appears,
is known as plankton,

117
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,999
"Floating life"

118
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,319
because it cannot move by itself,
instead following the currents.

119
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,039
This "blooms" comes from the energy of the sun.

120
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
They occur between the surface
and the first hundred meters,

121
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
to where the rays of the sun
can penetrate the ocean.

122
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,879
The tiny algae that appear

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,399
form an immense marine prairie
floating in the water.

124
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,639
The biomass produced every year

125
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,079
represents half
of the vegetation on earth.

126
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,839
Some microalgae
resemble distant galaxies.

127
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,999
They are protists - 
unicellular, very old organisms.

128
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,759
Most consists of only a cell 

129
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,639
surrounded by a silicate
or calcium carbonate skeleton.

130
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,119
At this level,

131
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,319
The distinction
between plant and animal is unclear.

132
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,599
Some of these green cells
have limbs that they push upstream,

133
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,719
to increase
the surface facing the sun..

134
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,959
All these microalgae consume carbon
and provide oxygen in return.

135
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,159
Half of the air we breathe,
comes from the microalgae.

136
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,879
The ocean is the blue heart of the planet.

137
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,639
The plant bloom
trigger another explosion of life,

138
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,519
of billions of herbivorous animals
that feed on the sea prairie.

139
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,159
These animals are only a
few millimeters in size, often even smaller.

140
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,279
They are classified as jellyfish,
crustaceans, cells, shellfish, larvae,

141
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,879
thousands of groups of species.

142
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,479
The most important of these
are the innumerable krill,

143
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,239
the small shrimp that graze algea
day and night.

144
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,799
And copepods, water fleas,

145
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,919
which are kind of jumping
with their limbs to move forward.

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,119
The copepods are pursued
by carnivores in the plankton,

147
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,919
especially by arrowhead predators

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,399
who are voracious
and armed with teeth of silicon.

149
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,599
Every moment of life 
is an act of survival.

150
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,199
Prey and predators alternate
constantly

151
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,599
and there is always a bigger
predator to swallow the previous ones.

152
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,679
This huge food chain nourishes all
organisms, from small to large.

153
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,959
The plankton is an open book

154
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,519
where we can read
the history of the ocean.

155
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,119
For 3 billion years
life evolved here

156
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,119
in this sea prairie.

157
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,519
Some very old species,
as the gelatinous animals,

158
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
can only occur in the ocean.

159
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,519
In perfect harmony
with the fluid environment

160
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,159
they possess an elastic body

161
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,719
which they simultaneously
can absorb food and move.

162
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,719
Sometimes, they cling to each other

163
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,999
and form a huge chain making it
easier to move along with the flow.

164
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,039
It looks chaotic,

165
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,999
but every living creature
is organized down to the smallest detail.

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,519
These explosions of life
eventually disappear,

167
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,199
consumed by lack of food sources
or eradicated by an invisible enemy,

168
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,639
an attack by a virus.

169
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,959
Billions of viruses,

170
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,319
whose biological role is
in the regulation of any explosion of life.

171
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,679
Nature does not support excess.

172
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,519
At the end of the winter

173
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,799
mackerel have left their hibernation
in the depths of the ocean.

174
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,639
They come to the surface
looking for the sea prairie.

175
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,999
As many fish species,
they feed on this invisible plankton,

176
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,799
The food chain
interconnects the species.

177
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,119
The fish have no leader,

178
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,159
but still know to maneuver
in perfect formation.

179
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,799
Each fish is continually aware
of the presence of its neighbors,

180
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,959
and respects their distance.

181
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,359
This self-organization
is a fundamental law of the group.

182
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,199
It allows them to hunt as a school

183
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,879
and increase the chances
to find an area rich in food.

184
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,439
The first to find one,

185
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,279
may guide the other
with a single movement.

186
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,439
The food chain
takes another turn.

187
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,159
The sailfish is the fastest
fish in the ocean.

188
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,119
It feeds on other fish,
not plankton.

189
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,999
The dorsal offers exceptional stability
to achieve its goal.

190
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,719
A sailfish of 100 pounds consume
in his life 1000 pounds mackerel,

191
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,519
who consumed 10,000 pounds
zooplankton

192
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,759
that grazed 100,000 pounds
phytoplankton.

193
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,239
For every pound of swordfish,
must be 1000 times more of the sea prairie.

194
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,399
The food chain is a relentless hierarchy,
a pyramid structure.

195
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,239
Some species prefer to help each other.

196
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,039
Manta rays only eat plankton.

197
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,119
The wingspan of six meters
provides protection for other fish.

198
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,679
They, in return, rid their host
of smaller fish parasites.

199
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,359
Others opt for the whale shark,

200
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,479
the biggest of all fish.

201
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,079
The traveler travels the entire ocean,
also in search of plankton.

202
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,759
it's the longest fishing trip,
in search for the smallest catch.

203
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,359
Solidarity also plays a role
in this liquid immensity,

204
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,079
4000 meters deep,
that covers two thirds of the planet.

205
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,159
Sometimes this journey
is interrupted by land...

206
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,239
Here at Raja Ampat in Indonesia

207
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,519
land appeared when the ocean
withdrew two billion years ago.

208
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,479
These limestone hills were
once at the bottom of the ocean.

209
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,159
As in Shark Bay, Australia,

210
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,239
they are made of
billions of plankton skeletons

211
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,519
which accumulated in the geographical
era when the ocean covered the planet.

212
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,119
As the water receded,

213
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,999
erosion carved the rock
to a lush sanctuary.

214
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,439
A labyrinth of 1500 islands
of fossilized plankton.

215
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,039
The archipelago of Raja Ampat.

216
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,639
is the heart of a region
rich in biodiversity.

217
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,479
Here lives more than
1400 species of fish,

218
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,719
and a quarter of all marine species.

219
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,159
The source of this extraordinary diversity
is again life itself.

220
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,119
In contact with the land surface,
something wonderful happened.

221
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,719
Part of the plankton left
nomadic life and settled here.

222
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,239
The marine life decided
to create a new world.

223
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,879
That was only 500 million years ago.

224
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,919
A revolution in the ocean.

225
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,879
This family of plankton
created the coral reefs.

226
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,319
Coral is an animal
that we rarely see.

227
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,439
What we see during the day,

228
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,239
is the calcium carbonate skeleton
which serves as shelter,

229
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,719
a skeleton that looks like a tree,
branches or leaves.

230
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,159
To  survive in these nutrition-poor,
oligotrophic waters,

231
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,119
coral provides shelter to
aalgae that feeds on sunlight.

232
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,999
The algae are the driving force
of the construction

233
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,519
with the aim of getting
the best place in the sun.

234
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,999
Each coral struggles against his neighbors
to get more sunlight,

235
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,999
a few millimeters per year.

236
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,679
The petrified forest

237
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,479
is the most populous ecosystem
on the ocean planet.

238
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,119
Here you can hide, and hunt.

239
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,679
Each has its own territory.

240
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,399
Everything is coded to live.

241
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,319
Even the color of the fish is an ornament
camouflage or deception...

242
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,799
Just like a beautiful maritime city,
the gates are crowded.

243
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,719
They come from far away
to get rid of their parasites 

244
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,239
because only the reef provides enough diversity
to ensure such a service.

245
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,359
Millions of years of evolution
have enabled each species 

246
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,839
to  find a place and a role
in this coral metropolis.

247
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,319
The scorpion fish camouflages itself

248
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,959
while the spider crabs
let themselves be colonize by shellfish

249
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,559
and becomes invisible
if thay do not move.

250
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,039
We hide from predators...

251
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,959
Just as in any metropolis
there is no spontaneous life in the reef.

252
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,079
There are codes, social precepts
which should be respected

253
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,919
if you do not want to end up
in the belly of a neighbor.

254
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,799
Hiding has become an art
for these octopuses

255
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,039
the color and texture of their skin
change

256
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,959
to deceive their attackers.

257
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,719
Despite the risks
of this collective existence

258
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,119
a number of species
use the reef as a nursery.

259
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,999
Of the entire ocean

260
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,119
it is still the best place 
for raising a family.

261
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,119
Cuttlefish protect their eggs
by hiding them as deeply as possible

262
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,999
in the branches of the coral
so other fish can not eat them.

263
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,159
The tentacles of the anemones
are poisonous, even deadly.

264
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,359
It is exactly for this reason
that clownfish have chosen to live there.

265
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,599
They become immune at an early age

266
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,559
from rubbing against the tentacles.

267
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,559
These natural vaccinations

268
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,959
enables them to use
the anemone as a refuge.

269
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,519
For those who do not know the reef,

270
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,879
this marvelous city
is actually full of traps.

271
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,959
The Xeniidae is no flower, but a coral.
Lacking a coral skeleton, 

272
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,679
animal plankton entangles
in its tentacles.

273
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,959
At night the reef 
becomes even more dangerous.

274
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,239
The living part of the coral,
the polyp,

275
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,919
is invisible during the day,
and only appears at night.

276
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,359
It hunts with his tentacles.

277
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,159
Motionless in the reef,

278
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,359
it uses ocean currents
to catch its prey.

279
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,199
Woe to him who drift nearby.

280
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,159
The tentacles paralyze everything
that they touch,

281
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,519
by injecting a deadly poison.

282
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,479
Sometimes even a digestive juice
so powerful

283
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,879
that it seems to dissolve life.

284
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,319
The reef is a dangerous predator.

285
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,079
Once caught, the victim can 
not escape from his arms,

286
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,919
pulling it slowly to his mouth,
where it will be consumed.

287
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,999
Once a year, at exactly the same time, 
at the full moon of spring

288
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,839
there is an extraordinary event,

289
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,639
The reef is in a reproductive phase.

290
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,399
It is striking sexual behavior.
The reef makes millions of eggs.

291
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,279
These eggs, called gametes,
males and females, merging,

292
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,919
give birth to larvae -

293
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,319
the future of the coral reefs.

294
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,479
This spawning occurs
once in the year,

295
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,599
it only lasts a few hours,

296
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,639
and relies on perfect timing
between all the corals of the same species.

297
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,519
The larvae are dispersed by the flow

298
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,279
for several days and nights.

299
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,719
They set out to conquer
a new space.

300
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,359
The larvae that survive, fasten
to new walls in the seabed,

301
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,919
to perpetuate the vast
coral city that gave birth.

302
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,879
It is a continuous expansion.

303
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,759
For 500 million years,

304
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,439
coral grows, dies and grows again.

305
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,519
They have forged an empire
visible from space.

306
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,279
The largest living structure
of the planet.

307
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,399
All fauna of the ocean

308
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,119
is closely or remotely connected
with these oases of life.

309
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,039
In Polynesia
groupers make a long journey

310
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,119
to lay their eggs
on the side of the reef.

311
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,479
The huge gathering
for these, usually solitary, animals

312
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,959
is to protect their offspring.

313
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,359
But this meeting is also visited
by gray sharks on the prowl.

314
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,359
During their lives,
female groupers begin

315
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,959
to change sex
and become males

316
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,119
once reaching above
a certain weight and age.

317
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
They spawn by leaps and bounds,
mixing seeds.

318
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,839
The females, which have been weakened by
spawning, are an easy prey.

319
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,079
The shark attack.

320
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,479
They will kill some grouper

321
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,079
but, paradoxically, this predation
is vital to the entire species 

322
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,079
that would otherwise reproduce
too fast and become too large.

323
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,559
Again, nature does not tolerate excess.

324
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,679
There is always a regulator
hovering over another.

325
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,959
Hammerhead sharks
are formidable hunters.

326
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,879
They appeared 20 million years ago
and are top predators.

327
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,719
The hammer-shaped head serves as a fin
and promotes agility.

328
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,599
The position of the eyes, wide apart,
offers a 3D vision.

329
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,399
They hunt fish...
and other sharks.

330
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,279
It is as if predation dictated
the evolution of the species.

331
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,599
And here we come into the picture.

332
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,679
Here we are, man.

333
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,359
The last link in the chain of life.

334
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,399
We have no predator above us.

335
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,399
We fish for all living things,
Millions of sharks each year.

336
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,759
Often, just for the value of the fins.

337
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,319
We started here,

338
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,759
on the other side of the ocean mirror.

339
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,279
We occupied the emerging land.

340
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,759
A long time ago, 
we built villages to protect us,

341
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,479
as they still exist
at San Blas in Panama.

342
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,959
We can not swim like fish,

343
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,039
So we devised boats
to move around the oceans.

344
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,959
Then we built a world

345
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,599
like other species before us
had built.

346
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,639
To build our cities,
we constructed bridges between islands,

347
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,199
We overcame the ocean through land.

348
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,799
We learned to dig through mountains,

349
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,559
divert rivers
and even create new islands.

350
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,999
We built an empire
even greater than the coral reefs.

351
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,199
Our walls, our giant cities,
can be seen from the air.

352
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,679
Through our intelligence, we, the weak
humanity, actually become strong.

353
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,359
Rich or poor,

354
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,119
half of our population
lives within 100 kilometers of water.

355
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,519
Almost the entire population
Sub-Saharan Africa

356
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,839
is concentrated on the coastline.

357
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,719
The city of Lagos in Nigeria alone
has 17 million inhabitants.

358
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,399
There are more than 100,000 people
in the slums on the coast.

359
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,079
The population here has migrated,
and has no land to claim,

360
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,039
So they turn towards the sea.

361
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:56,199
We are more than seven billion people.

362
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,799
With every second that ticks by,

363
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,239
there are two more people on the planet
that must be fed.

364
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,119
And we're hungry,

365
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,079
So we turn naturally
to the ocean to feed us.

366
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,119
Three billion people are directly
dependent on marine resources.

367
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,479
For nearly a billion people

368
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,159
fish is the only source
of animal proteins.

369
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,319
The ocean
forms the core of our survival.

370
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,479
Four million of our fishing boats
depart daily to conquer the ocean.

371
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,239
Most boats are only
small boats such as this,

372
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,439
discharged every morning
on the coast of Senegal.

373
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,999
Fishing was for us
from the start a family affair,

374
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,199
from generation to generation
it was carried and passed on.

375
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,639
Although it is a dangerous profession,

376
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,799
when the earth runs for food,
the poorest always turn toward the ocean.

377
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,839
Total worldwide,

378
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,919
counting indirect jobs
and families

379
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,319
fishing sustains
500 million people.

380
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,759
Here I see the abundance of the ocean,

381
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,839
able to feed an entire people.

382
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,759
Since the beginning of our history

383
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,679
We have collected
natural seaweed on the coast.

384
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,559
They have been around 3 billion
and a half years.

385
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,119
We have learned to cultivate the sea
as we cultivated the land.

386
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,039
Seaweed require only six weeks
before it can be harvested.

387
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,199
It only need sunlight
and the movements of the currents.

388
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,839
Today, in Bali in Indonesia,

389
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,159
we cultivate seaweed and we extract
a nutritious gelatine.

390
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,879
This form of agriculture
produces 15 million tons of seaweed

391
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,319
that is exported worldwide.

392
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,599
Brown, green and red seaweed
serves all purposes,

393
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,239
medicine, textiles, fertilizer, food.

394
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,599
We make small farms of the sea,

395
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,199
transforming it to estuaries and
aquaculture fields.

396
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,959
There are more than 530 000 hectares of the globe
dedicated to the cultivation of seaweed,

397
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,959
thus providing millions sea farmers
their livelihood.

398
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,199
In South Korea's Wando archipelago,

399
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,679
there are more than 200 islands transformed
to seaweed farms.

400
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,159
These beautiful paintings
are huge nets spread out in the sun,

401
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,519
used for crop drying.

402
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,159
Of the 30,000 species of seaweed
which grow in the sea,

403
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,639
there are around 50 edible.

404
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,599
Here we cultivate kelp,

405
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,199
large seaweed that can
grow to three meters in length.

406
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,959
ln Asia, seaweed is a
basic source of food.

407
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,319
These sugar-sweetened leaves contain
proteins, mineral salts and vitamins.

408
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,799
We have fished for the last 40,000 years,

409
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,879
continually improving on our equipment
and technique.

410
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,479
Once again my strength comes
from my intelligence,

411
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,039
which compensates for my weaknesses.

412
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,079
It allowed me to imagine
nets more elaborate, increasingly effective.

413
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,479
What changed everything,
was the invention of the deep sea trawl,

414
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,639
a large network with a funnel-shaped
opening like the mouth of the whale shark.

415
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,919
Our nets are so large
some 40 km long.

416
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,599
Fishing has become an industry.

417
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,999
It is no longer a family affair,
but investment and technology.

418
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,599
In order to increase our catch,
fishermen have formed flotillas.

419
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,479
Then whole factories went out to sea.

420
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,479
We use probes, radar,
and focus all our resources

421
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,959
on the hunt for marine life.

422
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,439
Each year we catch
90 million tons of fish, worldwide.

423
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,639
Half of this catch is made by only one
percent of our fishing boats.

424
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,599
Our trawlers, our trawls and nets are
so great that we do not choose our catch.

425
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,879
We take what comes,

426
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,319
and sort it later
depending on the market value of the fish.

427
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,279
Peruvian anchovy,
Alaskan pollock, Atlantic herring,

428
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,719
we capture it all.

429
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,599
There is no limit to our hunting,
except the set fishing quotas.

430
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,119
But who can avoid
going over it?

431
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,919
Worldwide, 80% of commercial fish stocks

432
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,599
are fully exploited
or over-exploited.

433
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,119
Our fishing has reached a ceiling.
The biological limit is reached.

434
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,239
How did it come to this?

435
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,279
Through our intensive fishing
millions of fish are sacrificed.

436
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,679
This is wasteful,
what is rejected after the catch,

437
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,119
or fish
who are crushed in our nets.

438
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,759
Fish that died for nothing.

439
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,479
As the surface stock is exhausted,
I fish deeper.

440
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,079
Our fishing trawlers are now
at more than 3000 meters.

441
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,359
I fish blind,
fauna that I barely know.

442
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,999
The fauna of the abyss,
who lives alone in the dark.

443
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,639
At that depth
the light disappears gradually.

444
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,959
There dwells life in this absence of light.
And what a life!

445
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,199
Around 100 meters below are ctenophores.

446
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,479
These gelatinous creatures
have luminous organs

447
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,679
to deter their enemies.

448
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,719
Deeper, at 1000 meters below the
surface, in the twilight of the ocean,

449
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,239
we find the siphonophores.

450
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,839
They are the largest species of plankton.

451
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,359
Some are up to 50 meters.

452
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,359
Their bodies are not distributed,
but grouped.

453
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,639
On one side is their stomach

454
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,719
and on the other the swim bladders
they use to float.

455
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,559
In between there is a net that they inflate
to catch any food falling from the surface.

456
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,079
Descend into the depths
is like traveling in a biological time machine.

457
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,919
There are perhaps 2000 species
of live fish in the depth.

458
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,639
A terrifying bestiary.

459
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,119
The Viperfish can eat things
greater than itself.

460
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,359
Or Saccopharynx - deep sea eels
who swallow everything that comes along.

461
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,959
Survival is difficult at 1500 meters depth.

462
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,719
Around 3000 meters there is no light.

463
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,759
It is the realm of the squid,
a prehistoric cousin of the octopus.

464
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,639
This octopus has blue blood
loaded with copper.

465
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,799
The huge eyes detect the slightest variation
in contrast above him, towards the surface.

466
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,959
His vision is fully adjusted
to the shadows.

467
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,919
If debris lands on the bottom,

468
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,519
crabs, eels and carnivorous sponges
gorge themselves.

469
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,319
Invisible in the mud, billions
of bacteria break down the remains.

470
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,079
The species here live slower,
and gets older - 

471
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,799
sometimes up to 150 years old -

472
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,479
because of the extreme pressure
at 4000 m depth,

473
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,599
at the bottom of the ocean.

474
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,759
There is little oxygen.

475
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,839
And yet here we are.
In this world we barely know.

476
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,879
We are here because we are afraid
to run out of a substance.

477
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,039
We are looking to feed
our addiction to oil.

478
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,879
The ocean seems to be made of water.

479
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,359
But in reality it is a alliance
between life, chemistry and geology.

480
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,079
All waste, the corpses,

481
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,599
particles of seaweed
which originate from the surface,

482
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,879
every tiny cell of the ocean
ends his life here in the "marine snow".

483
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,319
Over millions of years

484
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,399
carbon, in the form of plankton,
has built up on the bottom of the seas.

485
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,359
It accumulates in thick layers
and forms rocks which we call limestone

486
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,999
and that peaks up stabbing
each lower level of the sea.

487
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,679
Sometimes it happens that such piles of corpses
does not form a rock,

488
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,239
but gradually merges into one organic
substance, sticky and black.

489
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,399
Oil!

490
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,439
It occurs almost everywhere
on the seabed and on land,

491
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,599
where the ocean
once covered the planet.

492
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,799
We began pumping pockets in
shallow places.

493
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,079
But these supplies are running out

494
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,839
and we look farther and deeper.

495
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,599
Now we are exploring deposits at
up to 7000 meters depth.

496
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,239
The last oil reserves for tomorrow

497
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,559
are found in the most
inaccessible areas of the sea.

498
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,399
This fire is burning plankton,
burning life.

499
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,319
We have 20,000 oil platforms
in the seas of the world.

500
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,599
Every year we burn the equivalent
of one million years plankton.

501
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,559
Our industrial revolution has taken
the planet 100 million years to make.

502
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,799
We transport each year two billion tons
of oil aboard our supertankers,

503
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,919
which are the largest moving
constructions that exist.

504
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,039
Oil is the main source of energy
for our civilization.

505
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,159
This energy propels me forward
to all boundaries.

506
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,319
Who else dwell
that in this gigantic ship's holds

507
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,799
a part of the biogeological history
of the ocean is transported?

508
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,839
This revolution has changed our lives.

509
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,439
But also that of the planet.

510
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,039
We need our transport so badly

511
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,479
we have divided America into two
to connect the seas.

512
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,159
We created the Panama Canal,

513
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,999
a cut of 80 kilometers
through the jungle.

514
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,919
It allows each year 13,000 ships
to go faster, farther.

515
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,599
Every 45 minutes
a ship crosses the mountain.

516
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,599
To feed the locks of my channel

517
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,519
we created a huge lake,
Lake Gatun, which stores rainwater.

518
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,079
If there is little rain, it can entail
techical problems.

519
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,319
Raw materials, gasoline,

520
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,199
factory ships,
car transport, cruise ships,

521
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,919
an infinite variety
of vessels.

522
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,039
We carry three quarters
oo our merchandise over the ocean.

523
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,239
The flagship of all our boats is
the container ship,

524
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,159
on which thousands of
identical metal boxes are transported.

525
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,799
The riches of the world
from our power plants,

526
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,599
gives me wealth
and means

527
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,799
to turn our villages
into huge cities.

528
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,399
Here in Panama there was only jungle.

529
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,279
Today the money is flowing with the tide.

530
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,719
Rotterdam, Durban,
San Francisco, Singapore,

531
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,159
our ships weaving a web
between the continents.

532
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,359
The ocean brings our cities
together into a single world.

533
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,359
All sea routes come together in Asia.

534
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,279
Of the top 50 ports in the world
there are 11 in China.

535
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,399
And the most important is Shanghai.

536
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,799
The city lies at the end
of a 34 km long bridge,

537
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,279
on an island in the open sea, which was
razed to build a deep water port.

538
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,919
At the kilometer long wharf

539
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,159
giant cranes are each year unloading
30 million containers

540
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,199
which are to be changed,
re-used, or stored.

541
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,399
Who knows where our containers go
and what's inside?

542
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,319
Container transport is just a game.

543
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,679
Empty boxes to be filled,
full boxes to be emptied.

544
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,679
We have 600 million containers
on the ocean circulation.

545
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,119
They are the link
in the world we have created.

546
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,839
The ocean gave us globalization.

547
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,399
The demand is so great

548
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,679
that our container fleet
has tripled in less than 10 years.

549
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,679
There are at this moment
three thousand cargo ships being built

550
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,679
in Korea, China and Japan
which provide 90% of world production.

551
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,239
Everything here is oversized.

552
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,879
Gigantic shipyards
with more than 10,000 employees

553
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,599
renew and expand the existing units.

554
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,319
We build ships
that are more than 400 meters long,

555
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,959
the size of four football fields.

556
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,159
This relentless growth
of the shipping industry

557
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,759
is a reaction
to another industrial need.

558
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,279
The world factories have moved here.

559
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,319
The ocean also made globalization
of our industries possible.

560
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,639
A single ship can bring a whole forest
to the factories,

561
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:44,759
which turn it into paper, boards,
furniture, finished products.

562
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,119
China is the world's largest importer
of timber.

563
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,719
Thanks to the oceans, no forest is safe.

564
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,399
More than 500 tonnes of raw materials
comes every year by sea to Shanghai.

565
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:22,319
Stocks of iron ore, coal, wood, copper,

566
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,039
rare minerals
we tear from the planet.

567
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,959
Near the harbor, 
other factories

568
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,239
produce steel and chemicals
to make materials

569
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,399
that others build, compose
and package

570
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,119
for export all over the world.

571
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,479
The lives of seven billion people
is connected to this part of the world.

572
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,079
What can fishermen still catch

573
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,759
from the waste from the factory
at the heart of this degenerate world?

574
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,879
Our tentacle-like cities
grow like mushrooms.

575
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,959
Shanghai is a symbol
of our impetuous rush.

576
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,119
Twenty-three million people live 
in this megalopolis.

577
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,119
More than 6 000 skyscrapers
shoot into the air.

578
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,719
and 20 000 new projects
are in development,

579
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,359
a frenzy of construction
reaching into the heavens.

580
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:51,359
Every country in the world dreams
the rate of growth of Shanghai and China.

581
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,559
The city sprawls across the country,

582
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,039
but its fortune is thanks
to the fact that it meets the ocean.

583
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,839
The ocean planet is my planet.

584
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,519
But if we're ever wrong?

585
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,519
The ocean whence we came,
now seems so far away.

586
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,919
Within only 200 years

587
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,599
we violently disturbed four
billion years of natural history.

588
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,959
We never see the beauty of life anymore,

589
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,959
but only what it can do to our species,
what it can produce for us.

590
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,479
Everything around us is alive,
and suffers our existence.

591
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,759
We all leave our traces
wherever we go.

592
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,999
It is said that sperm whales dreams
with their head upside down.

593
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,399
But are not we all dreaming,

594
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,359
to think that we can continue
with this insane growth

595
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,399
without any consequences?

596
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,999
Hundred of our ships
sail continuously

597
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,839
across the seas of our planet.

598
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,759
The more our needs expand,
the more numerous our machines are.

599
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,279
Whatever we do,

600
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,759
our industrial civilization
destroys the natural world around it.

601
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,359
The risk of pollution becames
a threat to all our neighborhoods.

602
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,239
Our giant engines burning
tons of gas per hour.

603
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,519
We spit everywhere polluting materials
the sky and the ocean.

604
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,319
In the polar regions
the permanent ice cap melts

605
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,159
as a result of global warming.

606
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,959
In those regions are no factories,
no machines,

607
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,799
and yet this warming is caused
by our own carbon emissions.

608
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,039
Fossil energy, oil
that we need for our civilization,

609
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,079
heats the ocean.

610
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,279
But the melting of the Arctic
has another, more serious consequence.

611
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,839
ln the north, by melting
of the permanent ice sheet,

612
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,359
dark waters are revealed.

613
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:24,759
The water absorbs the sun's heat,
which used to be reflected by the ice.

614
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,639
And the phenomenon is growing.

615
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,759
The ocean itself accelerates global warming.

616
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,039
In Greenland,
just as in the Arctic,

617
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,199
land-based glaciers melt.

618
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,919
As they melt, trickling streams of fresh water
flows into a salty sea..

619
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,519
The great movement of ocean currents,

620
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,959
this stream that circles the globe
and regulates the climate,

621
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,039
gradually becomes clogged.

622
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,199
What will be the consequences?

623
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,599
None of us has lived through
such a change to find out.

624
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,519
More than 20,000 kilometers away,
far away from the polar regions,

625
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,599
Climate chaos is already being felt.

626
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,919
It is not visible at the surface.

627
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,439
To see it, we need to go reef diving
in the tropics,

628
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,559
such as near the Blue Hole in Belize,

629
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,439
the second largest coral reef in the world.

630
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,279
Corals are very sensitive
to temperature changes.

631
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,399
A difference of only one degree for
a few weeks is enough to kill them.

632
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,599
Then only
a reef of white skeletons remains.

633
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,799
These bleachings intensified recently.

634
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,919
Scientists worry.

635
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,959
A quarter of the corals on the planet
died within 50 years.

636
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,119
The immediate problem is not their death,
but rather the impact of their disappearance.

637
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,479
They die and leave nothing behind.
The sea is a desert oasis.

638
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,199
Further offshore, the vastness of the ocean
hides something else.

639
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,159
After the corals, the other critical factor is
the health of the plankton.

640
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,719
More and more
scientific missions on this ocean

641
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,399
are just beginning to discover
more effects.

642
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,479
They try to understand
what will change in marine life.

643
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,399
The life that feeds us.

644
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,399
It seems that the plankton,
the basis for all food chains

645
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,319
are moving towards polar regions,
where the water is still moderate.

646
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,879
In 50 years it has moved
1200 km further north.

647
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,479
This redistribution of plankton
has effects on marine life.

648
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,839
Every year the Cownose Ray migrates 

649
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,679
between Brazil and the temperate zones
in search of food.

650
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,759
Every year, the journey brings them a little
higher, slightly more to the north.

651
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,279
The global warming
disturbs the ecology of the ocean.

652
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,159
With this change,
our fisheries change.

653
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,319
But I know
that we can not stop fishing.

654
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,679
ln Chile, where one quarter
of world tonnage is fished,

655
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,559
the sea is the income for thousands of
traditional fishermen and their families.

656
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,599
Many have large debts
to pay for their boats.

657
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,079
The commercial species are scarce,

658
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,399
So they fish for what remains.

659
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,399
Previously we ate no Chilean sardine
or Peruvian anchovies.

660
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,759
But now we fish more
than 10 million tons each year.

661
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,079
This is an extraordinary attack
on a single species,

662
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,719
the only one still living in these waters.

663
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,599
Along the coast of Chile

664
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,799
a powerful flow rises
from the bottom of the ocean.

665
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,599
It is rich in plankton
and sardines flourish.

666
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,879
This is an upwelling flow.

667
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,719
It circulates the water and provides nutrients.

668
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,879
Seals and birds hunt the small
fish around the rising water of life.

669
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,879
The Chileans fishing with trawls,

670
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,439
very long tubes that are closed,
collect just over 40 tonnes per load.

671
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:50,399
Five hundred thousand fish in each net
is sucked into the machine.

672
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,559
Sardines live only a few years,
so they reproduce rapidly.

673
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,599
This is the last bluefish
still surviving 

674
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,079
even as catches increase.

675
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,239
But we do not eat this fish.
We catch it to make flour out of it.

676
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,239
Fish flour that we feed farmed fish.

677
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,319
In total, 25 million tons of fish
annually is grown,

678
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,999
of which the most
comes from Norway and Chile.

679
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,559
We grow only species
with a high market value,

680
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,999
such as sea bream, sea bass and salmon.

681
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,559
You need several kilos of sardines
to produce one kilo of farmed fish.

682
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,639
Our farms are an industry that is
based on a natural food source.

683
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,239
But what do we do if
there are no sardines anymore?

684
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,879
And as our food sources run out, we
continuously push our luck further and further.

685
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,759
The open sea is a free zone.

686
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,039
Two-thirds of the ocean belongs to everyone

687
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,279
and therefore belongs to the first to use it.

688
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,839
Off the coast of West Africa 

689
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,679
shipowning thugs make poor fishermen
plunder the last areas that are rich in fish.

690
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,559
Aboard their wrecks,
these men are left to themselves,

691
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,879
refueled once a month,
if they are lucky.

692
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,399
Men and boats who seem
to have no value to anyone.

693
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,079
In Mauritania, port of Nouadhibou

694
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,079
degenerated to a graveyard
of pirate fishing.

695
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,599
Hundreds of boats off the coast
seized, abandoned wrecks,

696
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,159
probably already replaced
by other vessels.

697
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,079
The pirate ships gather
in less supervised areas,

698
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,039
as the African sector.

699
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,239
At sea, these illegal vessels

700
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:38,319
reload their cargoes on board
of authorized vessels 

701
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,879
so their catch can be legally sold
on international markets.

702
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,919
In the worst-case estimates, illegal fishing amounts
to as much as 26 million tonnes of catch,

703
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,959
a quarter of the global total.

704
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,039
Gain dominion over the seas.

705
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:17,439
In the sea,
90% of large predators has disappeared.

706
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,479
One of the last of these,
Atlantic bluefin tuna,

707
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,919
is on the brink of extinction.

708
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,439
Yet they are legally fished
in the Mediterranean,

709
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,679
one of the last refuges of
this species, where they reproduce.

710
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,039
The tuna are caught in a very large net
that is closed like a pen.

711
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,839
The catch is caught alive
and fattened in a nursery

712
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,039
before slaughter
and sales on international markets.

713
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,039
This fish is a luxury food source.

714
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,999
A top quality tuna weighs 300 kilos

715
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,079
and can sell for more
than 500,000 euros.

716
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,999
Corruption and lies prevail everywhere.

717
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,279
The tuna fishing fleets benefit from
millions of euros in European subsidies.

718
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,599
We respect no quotas,

719
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,279
We take no precautions
for the preservation of the species.

720
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,399
At this rate, the extinction of the tuna
is a matter of a few years..

721
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,399
We plunder the common good

722
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,119
because it belongs to no one 
and it seems vast.

723
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,559
But what remains for tomorrow?

724
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,439
There are, at the time,
400 marine areas declared dead,

725
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,679
empty of food sources,
or unable to sustain life.

726
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,679
Other species are rapidly increasing in number.

727
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,359
Jellyfish have existed for
almost one billion years on Earth.

728
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,959
They have survived all known extinctions of species.

729
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,199
The red tuna was one of their predators.

730
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,119
The disappearance of this tuna upsets
a millennial-old balance.

731
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,159
Scientists and fishermen find that
across the ocean jellyfish are increasing.

732
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,599
The ocean is a gelatinous mass

733
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,959
and this imbalance
is a trap that awaits us.

734
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,439
Far from land, far away from where we live,

735
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,519
the ocean hides
another fact for us.

736
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,399
The currents spread
our chemicals,

737
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,639
polluters of our industrial creation,
all over the world.

738
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,399
On average, there are more than
46,000 pieces of plastic waste

739
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,159
per square kilometer sea water.

740
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,199
That which kills these birds,
comes out of our houses,

741
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,359
even though we're
thousands of kilometers away.

742
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,239
Annually, we pour six billion pounds
of plastic waste in the sea.

743
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,039
Plastic does not degrade,
but micro-fragments.

744
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,719
What that birds eat, the fish eat,

745
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,599
eventually ends up on our plates

746
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,359
while we dig the ocean to fish,
for our fisheries.

747
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,759
By polluting this world,
we poison ourselves, too.

748
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,879
The ocean is so vast that we thought
that it was an inexhaustible source.

749
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,919
We were wrong.

750
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,519
The ocean planet has actually
a limit to its renewal,

751
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,879
which we should learn to respect.

752
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,279
That's why since the dawn of time,

753
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,359
everything on earth
respects the rhythms and limits.

754
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,159
That is the origin of the famous law
of natural balance.

755
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,079
I would like to stay on earth.

756
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,639
I want to be there tomorrow.

757
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,439
I have long looked for these fish.

758
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,959
I think I'm like them:

759
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,599
I develop myself through consensus in a group.

760
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,399
Even if I understand what happens to us,

761
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,319
I can not choose
the way things radically change.

762
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,399
But perhaps that our collective consciousness
can trigger a chain reaction...

763
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,439
and save our species.

764
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,239
I want to believe
that we can react in time.

765
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,959
Twenty years ago in Rio,

766
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,519
people came together for a large
conference on the future of the Earth.

767
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,639
That was in 1992.

768
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,319
In that year,

769
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,239
our leaders voted on
2500 recommendations

770
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,279
to protect the planet.

771
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,639
I believed that it was a symbolic beginning
of a new era.

772
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,799
But it was actually
the beginning of a long road...

773
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,599
What has happened since?

774
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,239
There have been other conferences,
other world summits,

775
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,959
ultimately with very little result.

776
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,999
The risk of an unpopular decision,

777
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,759
competition, corruption, passivity
have blocked any action.

778
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,719
But we, humanity,

779
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,439
have in the past 20 years
made an enormous leap forward.

780
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,919
Public awareness has evolved.

781
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,559
We are now concerned about the environment.

782
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,719
But that's not enough.

783
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,799
Time is gaining on us.

784
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,679
With this rate
we are moving towards a catastrophe.

785
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,159
Even in the heart of the city
Rio, overlooking the ocean,

786
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:14,239
I am forbidden to enter the sea
because of disgusting pollution.

787
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,799
We had a pool built into
the most beautiful bay in the world to swim,

788
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,879
but that has become very dangerous
for our health.

789
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,999
ln Rio, we have, as elsewhere in the world,

790
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:48,359
a giant statue of Christ put up,
a symbol of eternity,

791
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,639
to protect ourselves.

792
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,439
He looks thoughtfully out over the ocean,
but what can he do for us?

793
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,239
No religion or belief
will save us.

794
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,559
It is not a time to believe
in heavenly promises.

795
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,719
Only with our intelligence, we can
foresee the future and prepare.

796
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,679
We can still
change direction.

797
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:21,359
There is still time for a humanistic
and responsible stewardship,

798
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,319
for our ocean planet to continue.

799
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:56,079
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS

800
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,399
RESPECT QUOTAS

801
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,359
STOP FUNDING
FOR INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES

802
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,359
PERMANENTLY BAN DEEP SEA FISHING

803
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,799
PROMOTE SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES

804
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,319
BUY ONLY THINGS WITH AN ECO LABEL

805
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,199
ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE FISHING

806
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,279
POLLUTION MANAGEMENT

807
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,559
CONTINUE DEEP SEA EXPLORATION

808
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,879
MAINTAIN THE ANTARCTIC TREATY

809
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,199
MAKE A TREATY
FOR SPAWNING AREAS

810
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,399
80% OF BIODIVERSITY IN THE SEA
IS STILL UNKNOWN

811
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,239
WE MUST INVEST IN RESEARCH

812
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,319
AND PROTECTING OUR SEAS
GENETIC HERITAGE

813
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,999
PROTECT ALL ECOSYSTEMS
SO MARINE LIFE CAN BE RESTORED

814
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:14,039
IN 2012 THE PROTECTED AREAS 
WAS ONLY 1% OF THE OCEAN

815
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,519
LET'S PROTECT 20% OF THE OCEAN
BY 2020

816
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:49,839
IT IS TIME FOR AN INTERNATIONAL
STEWARDSHIP TO BEGIN

817
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:02,319
NOW LET'S ACT

818
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,679
With our deepest thanks to all those
who already work for the welfare of the ocean.
