1
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,406
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,076
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,744
They're following us.

4
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:24,707
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:52,329
This is it.

6
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,872
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

7
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,248
A friend of yours?

8
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,249
A competitor.

9
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,668
He was good.

10
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,336
He was very, very good.

11
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,215
Se単or... nobody's
come out of there alive.

12
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,258
Please...

13
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,585
Se単or.

14
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:14,863
Stop.

15
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,990
Stay out of the light.

16
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,554
Forrestal.

17
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,598
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

18
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,519
That's what scares me.

19
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,371
Stay here.

20
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,414
If you insist, se単or.

21
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:23,870
Give me the whip.

22
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,288
Throw me the idol.

23
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,999
No time to argue.

24
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,376
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

25
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,003
Give me the whip!

26
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,629
Adios, se単or.

27
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,754
Adios, Satipo.

28
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,626
Dr. Jones.

29
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,545
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

30
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,130
which I cannot take away.

31
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,507
And you thought I had given up.

32
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,644
You chose the wrong friends.

33
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:23,896
This time, it will cost you.

34
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,150
Too bad the Hovitos...

35
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:31,487
don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

36
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,113
Yes, too bad.

37
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,365
You could warn them,

38
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:38,076
if only you spoke Hovitos.

39
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:26,245
Jock! Start the engines!

40
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,913
Get it up!

41
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:34,628
Jock, the engines!

42
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,922
Start the engines, Jock!

43
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:28,844
There's a big snake
in the plane, Jock!

44
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:31,763
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

45
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:34,016
I hate snakes, Jock!

46
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,267
I hate 'em!

47
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:38,645
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

48
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,536
''Neo,'' meaning ''new''

49
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:58,123
and ''lithic''... I-T-H...

50
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,875
...I-C, meaning ''stone.''

51
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,710
All right, let's get back
to this site:

52
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,004
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

53
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:10,176
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

54
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,558
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean

55
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:21,603
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

56
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,563
This site also demonstrates...

57
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:28,150
...one of the great dangers
of archaeology..

58
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,362
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place..

59
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:33,822
no, I'm talking about folklore.

60
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:35,657
In this case,
local tradition held

61
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,160
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site,

62
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:41,788
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

63
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,707
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

64
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,710
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

65
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,837
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

66
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,297
that were found in another, uh..

67
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,715
in the area, give us a r..

68
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,343
Uh...

69
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,430
...reason to da..
to, uh, to-to date this,

70
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,098
uh, find as we have.

71
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:03,141
Um...

72
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,227
Any questions, then?

73
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,020
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

74
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,438
Um, don't forget..

75
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:14,318
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

76
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,528
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

77
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,622
I had it, Marcus.

78
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,249
I had it in my hand.

79
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,542
What happened?

80
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,335
Guess.

81
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,504
Belloq?

82
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:36,755
You want to hear about it?

83
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,215
Not at all.

84
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,175
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

85
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:41,926
conforms to
the lnternational Treaty

86
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,386
for the Protection
of Antiquities.

87
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:45,012
It's beautiful, Marcus.

88
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:45,888
I can get it.

89
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,056
I got it all figured out.

90
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:48,724
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

91
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:49,892
I need $2,000. Look..

92
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:50,935
Listen to me, old boy.

93
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:52,394
I brought some people
to see you.

94
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:53,353
Look.

95
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,438
I got these pieces.

96
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:56,106
They're good pieces, Marcus.

97
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,233
-Look.
-Indiana...

98
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:01,236
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

99
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,820
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least

100
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,280
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

101
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:05,531
But the people
I brought are important,

102
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,574
and they're waiting.

103
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:07,575
What people?

104
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,493
Army Intelligence.

105
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,995
They knew you were coming
before I did.

106
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,413
Seem to know everything.

107
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,456
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

108
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

109
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,543
What am I, in trouble?

110
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,753
Yes, Dr. Jones,

111
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,379
we've heard a great deal
about you.

112
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,214
Have you?

113
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,550
Uh, professor of archaeology,

114
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,093
expert on the occult,

115
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,261
and, uh, how does one say it?

116
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,972
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

117
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,931
That's one way of saying it.

118
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,932
Why don't you sit down?

119
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,892
You'll be more comfortable.

120
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,059
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

121
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,354
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

122
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,773
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

123
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,566
at the University of Chicago.

124
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,610
Yes, I did.

125
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:48,487
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

126
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,615
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

127
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,450
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

128
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,160
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

129
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:56,828
We were friends, but, uh...

130
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,748
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

131
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,291
Mmm.

132
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,918
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

133
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:07,046
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

134
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,089
I understand.

135
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,257
Uh...

136
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:13,927
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

137
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,847
intercepted a...
a German communiqu?

138
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,975
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

139
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,810
-Now, to Cairo...
-See, over the last two years,

140
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,603
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists

141
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:24,729
running around the world

142
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:28,024
looking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

143
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:29,400
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

144
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,526
He's crazy.

145
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,569
He's obsessed with the occult.

146
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,530
And, right now, apparently,

147
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,865
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

148
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,408
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

149
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,702
Now, we've got some
information here,

150
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,288
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

151
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:47,291
''Tanis development proceeding.

152
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,545
''Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

153
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,965
Abner Ravenwood, U.S.''

154
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:57,300
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

155
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,595
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

156
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:01,679
Well, it..

157
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,139
The city of Tanis
is one of the possible

158
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,182
resting places of the Lost Ark.

159
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:05,850
The Lost Ark?

160
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,310
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

161
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,436
The chest the Hebrews used

162
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,854
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

163
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,480
What do you mean,
''commandments''?

164
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,940
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

165
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,483
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

166
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,692
The original stone tablets

167
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,570
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

168
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,072
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

169
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,491
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

170
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,492
Well, I...

171
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,535
Oh, look.

172
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,203
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

173
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,454
and put them in the Ark.

174
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:29,830
When they settled in Canaan,

175
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,291
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

176
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:33,500
In Jerusalem.

177
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,168
Where it stayed for many years.

178
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,504
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

179
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,588
Where?

180
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,423
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

181
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,383
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

182
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,551
-Shishak.
-Yes.

183
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,429
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

184
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,390
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

185
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,392
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

186
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:52,976
called the Well of Souls.

187
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,436
Secret chamber?

188
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,063
However, about a year

189
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,607
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

190
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,860
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

191
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:04,821
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

192
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,531
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

193
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:10,659
Uh-huh.

194
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:13,203
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

195
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,830
Now you seem to know, uh,

196
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,998
all about this Tanis, then.

197
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,749
No, no, not really.

198
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,377
Ravenwood is the real expert.

199
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,920
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

200
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,380
Collected some of its relics.

201
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,216
It was his obsession, really.

202
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,843
But he never found the city.

203
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:32,346
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

204
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,056
An American being mentioned
so prominently

205
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,308
in a secret Nazi cable.

206
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,392
Oh, rubbish.

207
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:38,685
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

208
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,687
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

209
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:42,855
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

210
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,857
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

211
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,526
and they think Abner's got it.

212
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,112
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

213
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,530
Well, the staff
is just a stick..

214
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:52,906
I don't know, about this big,

215
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,575
nobody really knows
for sure how high..

216
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,577
and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

217
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:00,330
with an elaborate headpiece...

218
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,416
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

219
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,251
And what you did was

220
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,753
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis..

221
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:09,171
a map room with a miniature

222
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,756
of the city all laid out
on the floor-

223
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:13,258
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

224
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,969
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

225
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:18,889
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

226
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:22,809
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

227
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,812
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

228
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,438
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

229
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:30,441
What does this Ark look like?

230
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,900
Uh...

231
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,861
There's a picture of it
right here.

232
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,241
That's it.

233
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,207
Good God.

234
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,668
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

235
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:51,919
Uh...

236
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,546
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

237
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,590
Lightning...

238
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,592
fire...

239
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,719
power of God or something.

240
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,680
I'm beginning to understand

241
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,931
Hitler's interest in this.

242
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,599
Oh, yes.

243
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,601
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

244
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:12,229
and laying waste
to entire regions.

245
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,358
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

246
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,526
is invincible.

247
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,922
You did it, didn't you?

248
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,465
They want you to go for it.

249
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,967
Oh, Marcus!

250
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,678
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

251
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:50,014
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

252
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:51,265
And the museum?

253
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,558
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

254
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,934
Oh, yes.

255
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:58,104
Oh...

256
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:00,607
The Ark of the Covenant.

257
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:03,401
Nothing else has come close.

258
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,944
That thing represents everything

259
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,071
we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

260
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:11,033
Mmm!

261
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,203
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

262
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:16,371
I'm really rather envious.

263
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,706
I've got to locate Abner.

264
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:19,582
I think I know where to start.

265
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,881
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

266
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,382
Possibly, but...

267
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:31,051
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

268
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,761
believe me, Indy.

269
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,846
What do you mean?

270
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:37,933
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

271
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,852
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

272
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:45,648
Not something to be taken
lightly.

273
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,693
No one knows its secrets.

274
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:53,197
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

275
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:55,699
Oh, Marcus.

276
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,908
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

277
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:57,868
You sound like my mother.

278
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,411
We've known each other
for a long time.

279
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,370
I don't believe in magic,

280
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:02,539
a lot of superstitious
hocus-pocus.

281
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:03,748
I'm going after a find

282
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,708
of incredible
historical significance.

283
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,501
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

284
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:10,838
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

285
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:22,807
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

286
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,808
Thank you.

287
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,793
Shh... shh...

288
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,728
Shh...

289
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,467
Give him space!
Give him space!

290
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:32,926
Go on, Regan!

291
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,055
Shh! Shh!

292
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,557
Shh! Shh! Shh!

293
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,641
Hello, Marion.

294
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:34,441
Indiana Jones.

295
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:37,944
Always knew, someday,

296
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,488
you'd come walking back
through my door.

297
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:42,532
I never doubted that.

298
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:44,951
Something made it inevitable.

299
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:47,870
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

300
00:25:47,953 --> 00:25:50,873
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

301
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,792
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

302
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,545
I never meant to hurt you.

303
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:57,796
I was a child.

304
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,047
I was in love.

305
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:00,882
It was wrong and you knew it!

306
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,258
You knew what you were doing.

307
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:02,842
Now I do!

308
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,010
This is my place.

309
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:05,219
Get out!

310
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,265
I did what I did.

311
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:10,724
You don't have to be happy
about it,

312
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,476
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

313
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,730
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

314
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,148
Bronze piece, about this size,

315
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:20,108
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

316
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:21,234
You know the one I mean?

317
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:23,236
Yeah.

318
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:24,487
I know it.

319
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,655
Where's Abner?

320
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:28,616
Where's Abner?

321
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:29,867
Abner's dead.

322
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:37,624
Marion, I'm sorry.

323
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,752
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

324
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:43,254
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

325
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:45,006
Well, say it again, anyway.

326
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:46,174
Sorry.

327
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,842
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

328
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,844
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

329
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,805
looking
for his little bits of junk.

330
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,307
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

331
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:58,018
Everybody's sorry for something.

332
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,145
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

333
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,354
You going to give it to me?

334
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:02,522
Maybe.

335
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,440
I don't know where it is.

336
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,860
Well, maybe you could find it.

337
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,362
3,000 bucks.

338
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:14,283
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

339
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:17,202
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

340
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,412
It's important, Marion.

341
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:21,623
Trust me.

342
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,584
You know the piece I mean?

343
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,252
Do you know where it is?

344
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,298
Come back tomorrow.

345
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,509
Why?

346
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:37,387
Because I said so, that's why.

347
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:45,061
Ha!

348
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:47,229
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

349
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:56,877
Good evening, Fraulein.

350
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,212
The bar's closed.

351
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:02,340
We... We are...

352
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,300
not thirsty.

353
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,635
What do you want?

354
00:29:05,802 --> 00:29:08,721
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

355
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:11,265
Surely he told you
there would be

356
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,058
other interested parties.

357
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,560
Must've slipped his mind.

358
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:19,230
The man is... nefarious.

359
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:23,610
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

360
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,945
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

361
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:28,864
Oh, almost certainly.

362
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,908
Do you still have it?

363
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,998
No.

364
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,917
But I know where it is.

365
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,712
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

366
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:49,842
Your fire is dying here.

367
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,553
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

368
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:54,888
Listen, Herr Mac...

369
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:59,559
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

370
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:02,061
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

371
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:05,481
Fraulein Ravenwood,

372
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:09,485
let me show you
what I am used to.

373
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:14,907
Take your hands off me!

374
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,827
Take your lousy hands off!

375
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,375
Wait a minute.

376
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,668
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

377
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:30,045
That time is passed.

378
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:31,714
You don't need that.

379
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:34,758
Wait...

380
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:37,928
I'll tell you everything.

381
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:42,223
Yes, I know you will.

382
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,105
Let her go.

383
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,091
Whiskey.

384
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,600
Shoot them.

385
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,477
Shoot them both.

386
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,821
My medallion!

387
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,038
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

388
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,873
how to show a lady a good time!

389
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,541
Boy, you're something!

390
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,709
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

391
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,711
Until I get back my $5,000,

392
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,880
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

393
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:31,091
I'm your goddamn partner!

394
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,627
Cairo, city of the living.

395
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:12,379
A paradise on earth.

396
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:15,423
Silence!

397
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:16,966
Why do you forget yourselves?

398
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,009
What is this?

399
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,636
Where did this animal come from?

400
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,015
Oh... oh, no.

401
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:29,102
Cute.

402
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:31,146
What an adorable creature.

403
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:35,275
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

404
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:37,819
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

405
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:48,245
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

406
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:50,372
You're the best digger in Egypt.

407
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:54,084
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

408
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:57,462
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

409
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,213
The excavation is enormous.

410
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:03,175
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

411
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,428
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

412
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,222
When did they find the map room?

413
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:09,890
Three days ago.

414
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:11,850
They have not one brain
among them.

415
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,185
Except one.

416
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,438
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

417
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,024
What's his name?

418
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:21,442
They call him ''Bellosh.''

419
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:30,784
Belloq. Belloq.

420
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:33,578
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

421
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:36,831
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

422
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:41,294
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

423
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,130
Who can tell us
about these markings?

424
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,343
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

425
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,262
Indy...

426
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:56,850
there is something
that troubles me.

427
00:35:56,975 --> 00:36:00,019
What is it?

428
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,979
The Ark.

429
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,398
If it is there, at Tanis,

430
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:07,818
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

431
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,821
Death has always surrounded it.

432
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:13,198
It is not of this earth.

433
00:36:13,198 --> 00:36:15,033
Do we need the monkey, huh?

434
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,326
I'm surprised at you, Jones-

435
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:19,078
talking that way about our baby.

436
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:20,746
He's got your looks, too.

437
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,789
And your brains.

438
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,749
Oops!

439
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:24,917
I noticed that.

440
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:27,544
She's a smart little thing--
smart.

441
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,506
Hey!

442
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:32,716
Hey, where you going?

443
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,634
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

444
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:39,722
Come on. Come on.

445
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:40,681
Okay...

446
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:41,724
Marion.

447
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,725
What's this?

448
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,185
It's a date.

449
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,811
You eat 'em.

450
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:36,941
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

451
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,068
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

452
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,111
Who says I haven't?

453
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,280
I do.

454
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,282
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

455
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,792
He said you were a bum.

456
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,418
Oh, he's being generous.

457
00:37:57,418 --> 00:37:59,462
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

458
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:01,464
You know, he loved you
like a son.

459
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:03,466
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

460
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:04,717
Not much, just you.

461
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,984
Marion, get out of here!

462
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,027
Duck!

463
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:08,692
Right.

464
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:53,066
Shh! Shh!

465
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:00,448
Marion!

466
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:22,843
Help! Over here, Indy!

467
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,637
Get out of the way!

468
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,096
Move! Move it!

469
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:28,599
Help me!

470
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:35,355
You can't do this to me!

471
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:37,315
I'm an American!

472
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:39,025
Indy!

473
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:44,405
Indiana Jones!

474
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,781
Help me, Jones!

475
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:07,593
Jones!

476
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,594
Marion!

477
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,432
Indy!

478
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,056
Marion...

479
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:37,425
Dr. Jones.

480
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:05,576
You looking for me?

481
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:16,169
Belloq.

482
00:43:16,252 --> 00:43:17,712
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

483
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:19,630
I ought to kill you right now.

484
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,300
Not a very private place
for a murder.

485
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:26,262
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

486
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:29,389
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

487
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:32,309
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

488
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:34,519
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

489
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:37,188
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

490
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:50,200
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

491
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,370
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

492
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,289
after so many
stimulating encounters.

493
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,166
I almost regret it.

494
00:43:58,207 --> 00:43:59,834
Where shall I find
a new adversary

495
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:01,794
so close to my own level?

496
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:03,838
Try the local sewer.

497
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,426
You and I are very much alike.

498
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:11,720
Archaeology is our religion,

499
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:16,349
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

500
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:19,852
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

501
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:23,397
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

502
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:26,233
lt would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

503
00:44:26,317 --> 00:44:28,402
to push you out of the light.

504
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:31,988
Now you're getting nasty.

505
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:34,199
You know it's true.

506
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:36,159
How nice.

507
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:38,202
Look at this.

508
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:40,037
It's worthless.

509
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:42,581
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

510
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:43,708
But I take it,

511
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,501
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

512
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:49,254
it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

513
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,214
Men will kill for it.

514
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,884
Men like you and me.

515
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,136
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

516
00:44:57,136 --> 00:45:00,723
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

517
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:03,434
All in good time.

518
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,895
When I am finished with it.

519
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,523
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

520
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,525
It's a transmitter.

521
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,444
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

522
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,112
And it's within my reach.

523
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:21,701
You want to talk to God?

524
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:23,494
Let's go see Him together.

525
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:25,412
I've got nothing better to do.

526
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,208
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

527
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:32,210
Uncle Indy!

528
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:35,046
Next time, Indiana Jones,

529
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,590
it'll take more than children
to save you.

530
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,468
Uncle Indy!

531
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:56,066
I thought I would
find you there.

532
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:58,359
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

533
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:09,077
Marion's dead.

534
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:10,495
Yes, I know.

535
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:12,664
And me! And me!

536
00:46:12,747 --> 00:46:14,291
I'm sorry.

537
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:16,167
Life goes on, Indy.

538
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,086
There is the proof.

539
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:21,923
Uh-oh.

540
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:23,424
I have much to tell you.

541
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:26,093
First we will take them home,

542
00:46:26,176 --> 00:46:27,636
and then I will take you
to the old man.

543
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,935
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

544
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,479
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

545
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:26,774
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

546
00:47:26,899 --> 00:47:29,818
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

547
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:31,278
A headpiece like that one,

548
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:33,530
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

549
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,657
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

550
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,578
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

551
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,330
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

552
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,126
They made their calculations
in the map room?

553
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:48,585
This morning.

554
00:47:48,585 --> 00:47:50,879
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

555
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:53,548
When they came out
of the map room,

556
00:47:53,632 --> 00:47:56,009
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

557
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,761
out away from the camp.

558
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:00,721
The Well of the Souls, huh?

559
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:04,767
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

560
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:06,268
Sit down.

561
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:07,978
Come, sit down.

562
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:09,938
What is it?

563
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:12,274
This is a warning

564
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:14,776
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

565
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:16,444
What about the height
of the staff, though?

566
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:17,529
Did Belloq get it off of here?

567
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:18,613
Yes.

568
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:20,073
It is here.

569
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:21,908
This were the old way,

570
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:24,410
this mean six kadam high.

571
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:25,703
-About 72 inches.
-Wait!

572
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,125
''And take back one kadam

573
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:36,087
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is.''

574
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:50,267
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

575
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:52,144
Are you absolutely sure?

576
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:55,814
Belloq's staff is too long.

577
00:48:55,897 --> 00:48:58,650
They're digging
in the wrong place.

578
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,404
I am the monarch of the sea

579
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:04,364
I am the ruler of the..

580
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,042
Bad dates.

581
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,350
I told you not to be premature

582
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,769
in your communiqu?to Berlin.

583
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,063
Archaeology is not
an exact science.

584
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:42,232
It does not deal
in time schedules.

585
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,359
The f端hrer is not
a patient man.

586
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:47,862
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

587
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:49,447
You led me to believe...

588
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,948
Nothing!
I made no promises.

589
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,992
I only said
it looked very favorable.

590
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:56,328
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

591
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,288
my calculations were correct.

592
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:00,207
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

593
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:04,044
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

594
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,087
At about 9:00 in the morning.

595
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,297
Not much time, then.

596
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,216
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

597
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:13,511
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

598
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,887
Let's go, come on.

599
00:54:21,446 --> 00:54:22,989
Sallah.

600
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:25,825
Sallah!

601
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,667
They're here.

602
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:47,220
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

603
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,013
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

604
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:53,684
If you want water,
I will get you water.

605
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:55,060
No problem, no problem.

606
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:10,491
I thought you were dead.

607
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,368
You must have switched baskets.

608
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:17,998
Are you hurt?

609
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:20,709
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

610
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,044
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

611
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,004
Cut me loose.

612
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:25,171
Quick.

613
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:27,632
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

614
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,846
What's wrong?

615
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:34,889
Cut me loose.

616
00:55:34,972 --> 00:55:36,348
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

617
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:38,600
The Ark's here?

618
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:40,310
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

619
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:41,770
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

620
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:42,771
If I take you out of here now,

621
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,439
they'll start combing
the place for us.

622
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:45,899
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

623
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,610
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!

624
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:50,153
Marion, I hate to do this,

625
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,780
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

626
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,199
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

627
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:58,202
I'll be back to get you.

628
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:00,078
Jones, what's the matter?

629
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:47,330
That's it.

630
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,456
Who knows?

631
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:50,583
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

632
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:53,044
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

633
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:57,006
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

634
00:56:57,006 --> 00:56:58,090
Perhaps...

635
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,842
Perhaps the girl can help us.

636
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:01,176
My feeling exactly.

637
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:04,429
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

638
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:06,806
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

639
00:57:06,806 --> 00:57:09,350
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

640
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,478
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

641
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,021
That is not your reputation.

642
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:15,523
But it needn't concern you.

643
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:18,108
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

644
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:25,407
Heil Hitler.

645
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,025
Indy! Here!

646
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,985
We've hit stone!

647
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,656
Clear it off.

648
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,116
Come on, find the edges.

649
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:15,633
Good, good, good.

650
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:17,301
You see, Indy? You see?

651
00:59:17,343 --> 00:59:19,261
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

652
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,138
As a team, boys! As a team!

653
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:24,057
Push!

654
00:59:29,354 --> 00:59:30,521
Get 'em in there.

655
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:31,481
Get 'em under.

656
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:32,440
Good, good, that's it.

657
00:59:32,607 --> 00:59:33,649
Watch your toes.

658
00:59:41,156 --> 00:59:42,908
Carefully, carefully!

659
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:56,587
Sorry, Indy.

660
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:00,007
Indy...

661
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:02,634
why does the floor move?

662
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:06,096
Give me your torch.

663
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,375
Snakes.

664
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:39,751
Why did it have to be snakes?

665
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:46,508
Asps.

666
01:00:46,508 --> 01:00:49,093
Very dangerous.

667
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:50,303
You go first.

668
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:11,823
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

669
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:15,201
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

670
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:17,077
so please, eat something.

671
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:26,211
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

672
01:01:26,294 --> 01:01:27,462
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

673
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:28,671
No food, no water.

674
01:01:28,713 --> 01:01:30,840
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

675
01:01:30,882 --> 01:01:33,968
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

676
01:01:33,968 --> 01:01:35,803
they are necessary evils.

677
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:37,471
They're not my friends.

678
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:39,807
However, with the
right connections,

679
01:01:39,807 --> 01:01:41,767
even in this part of the world,

680
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:44,936
we are not entirely uncivilized.

681
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:48,356
It's beautiful.

682
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:50,900
I would very much like
to see you in it.

683
01:01:53,027 --> 01:01:55,237
I'll bet you would.

684
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:01,076
All right.

685
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,085
What do you got to drink
around here?

686
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:15,965
We don't have much time.

687
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:17,966
Soon they will come to harm you,

688
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:20,010
and I will not be able
to stop them,

689
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:22,596
unless you are able
to give me something

690
01:02:22,596 --> 01:02:24,598
to placate them.

691
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:27,642
Some, uh, piece
of information...

692
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:30,436
which I can use
to protect you from them.

693
01:02:30,561 --> 01:02:32,772
I've already told you
everything I know.

694
01:02:32,855 --> 01:02:35,566
I have no loyalty to Jones.

695
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:38,193
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

696
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:46,534
Marion, you are beautiful.

697
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:54,750
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

698
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,296
Steadily.

699
01:02:59,296 --> 01:03:01,340
Steadily. Whoa!

700
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:04,759
Down...

701
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:05,885
Down.. Whoa.

702
01:03:05,885 --> 01:03:07,053
Carefully, carefully!

703
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:09,305
You all right, Indy?

704
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:16,979
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

705
01:03:25,153 --> 01:03:25,904
Whoa...

706
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,289
I told you it will be all right.

707
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:55,347
Huh...

708
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,440
Sallah, get down here!

709
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,626
You pour.

710
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,898
Oh, that's good.

711
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,569
Whoops.

712
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,535
What is this stuff, Rene?

713
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:37,871
I grew up with this.

714
01:06:39,373 --> 01:06:40,874
It's my family label.

715
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,738
Well... I have to be
going now, Rene.

716
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,742
I like you, Rene, very much.

717
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,453
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

718
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:27,917
We meet again, Fraulein.

719
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,754
You Americans,
you're all the same.

720
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:37,009
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

721
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,956
Now...

722
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:15,127
what shall we talk about?

723
01:09:32,823 --> 01:09:35,743
All right... take it up!

724
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:37,870
Easy!

725
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:41,206
You're as stubborn as that girl.

726
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,750
You like her too much, I think.

727
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,588
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

728
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:52,758
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

729
01:09:57,179 --> 01:09:59,014
Shliemann! Wake your men!

730
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:01,224
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

731
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,185
Go on, get out of here.

732
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:05,145
Hyah!

733
01:10:22,994 --> 01:10:24,162
Sallah!

734
01:10:24,246 --> 01:10:25,247
Hello!

735
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:27,207
Hello!

736
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,876
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

737
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,503
in such a nasty place?

738
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:34,547
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

739
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:35,548
Thank you, my friend,

740
01:10:35,548 --> 01:10:37,966
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

741
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:39,426
That's right, isn't it?

742
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,804
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

743
01:10:44,264 --> 01:10:46,141
So, once again, Jones,

744
01:10:46,224 --> 01:10:49,352
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

745
01:10:49,435 --> 01:10:51,979
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

746
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:54,482
You're about to become
a permanent addition

747
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,150
to this archaeological find.

748
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:57,484
Who knows?

749
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:59,695
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

750
01:11:02,155 --> 01:11:03,865
Son of a bitch.

751
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:05,825
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

752
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:08,203
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

753
01:11:08,286 --> 01:11:10,163
But I do not wish to leave you

754
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:12,582
down in that awful place
all alone.

755
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:14,500
Slimy pig, you let me go!

756
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,751
Stop it!

757
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,005
Marion!

758
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:21,048
Hang on.

759
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:23,341
Don't...

760
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:25,010
-Indy!
-Don't fall!

761
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:27,429
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

762
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,434
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

763
01:11:41,358 --> 01:11:42,359
Snakes!

764
01:11:43,985 --> 01:11:45,487
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

765
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:48,239
The girl was mine!

766
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,198
She's of no use to us.

767
01:11:49,282 --> 01:11:51,325
Only our mission
for the f端hrer matters.

768
01:11:53,661 --> 01:11:55,788
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,

769
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:58,248
if you have that
clearly in mind.

770
01:11:58,248 --> 01:12:00,375
It was not to be, ch辿rie.

771
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:03,086
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

772
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:06,006
Indiana Jones...

773
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,173
adieu.

774
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,645
No!

775
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,071
Take this.

776
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:33,906
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

777
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:35,157
Thank you.

778
01:12:35,324 --> 01:12:37,868
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

779
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:42,080
Indy!

780
01:12:42,247 --> 01:12:44,791
Ow! Jesus!

781
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:49,003
Where did you get this?
From him?

782
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:50,421
I was trying to escape.

783
01:12:50,505 --> 01:12:51,464
No thanks to you.

784
01:12:51,506 --> 01:12:53,007
How hard were you trying?

785
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:54,133
Well, where the hell were you?

786
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:55,509
Watch it, watch it.

787
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:56,844
What are you doing?

788
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:58,512
For the fire!

789
01:13:00,556 --> 01:13:02,265
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

790
01:13:02,432 --> 01:13:03,934
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

791
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:05,644
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

792
01:13:09,856 --> 01:13:11,232
Ah...

793
01:13:11,232 --> 01:13:13,192
Where are you going?

794
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:14,693
Through that wall.

795
01:13:14,693 --> 01:13:17,112
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

796
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:18,781
What do you mean by that?

797
01:13:30,249 --> 01:13:32,710
Indy!

798
01:13:32,793 --> 01:13:35,629
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

799
01:14:00,485 --> 01:14:02,237
Indy!

800
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,405
Here we go!

801
01:14:03,488 --> 01:14:04,447
Get ready!

802
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:08,368
Indy, the torch is going out!

803
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:50,823
Indy?

804
01:15:11,134 --> 01:15:12,885
Marion!

805
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:15,429
Look. Look.

806
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:55,299
They're going to fly it
out of here.

807
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:56,717
When that Ark gets loaded,

808
01:15:56,759 --> 01:15:58,969
we're already going
to be on the plane.

809
01:16:03,723 --> 01:16:07,519
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

810
01:16:07,685 --> 01:16:08,937
To the Ark.

811
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,897
When we are very far
from here.

812
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,648
That will do.

813
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:09,242
Hey, you now.. come here!

814
01:17:09,409 --> 01:17:10,785
Come here!

815
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,304
Indy!

816
01:19:08,226 --> 01:19:10,353
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

817
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:16,901
Look out!

818
01:19:27,702 --> 01:19:29,120
Oh, my God.

819
01:19:29,203 --> 01:19:29,912
Marion.

820
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:32,707
In here! Up here!

821
01:19:35,501 --> 01:19:36,627
Indy, come on!

822
01:19:36,627 --> 01:19:37,670
Hold on!

823
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:39,713
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

824
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:44,843
It's stuck! Indy!

825
01:19:46,052 --> 01:19:47,679
I can't push it off!

826
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:18,457
It's stuck!

827
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:19,958
-Turn it! Turn it!
-It's stuck!

828
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,209
Turn it there!

829
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:22,753
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

830
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:46,775
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

831
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,735
Have it put on the truck.

832
01:20:48,735 --> 01:20:50,194
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

833
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:53,030
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

834
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,204
Jones.

835
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:08,336
Holy smoke, my friends,

836
01:21:08,503 --> 01:21:10,213
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

837
01:21:12,131 --> 01:21:13,591
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

838
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:14,842
If you still want the Ark,

839
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,428
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

840
01:21:17,511 --> 01:21:19,430
Truck?

841
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,681
What truck?

842
01:21:47,997 --> 01:21:49,082
Let's go!

843
01:21:57,548 --> 01:21:59,758
Get back to Cairo.

844
01:21:59,842 --> 01:22:01,968
Get us some transport
to England-

845
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,888
boat, plane, anything.

846
01:22:05,096 --> 01:22:06,097
Meet me at Omar's.

847
01:22:06,097 --> 01:22:07,015
Be ready for me.

848
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,224
I'm going after that truck.

849
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:09,267
How?

850
01:22:09,267 --> 01:22:10,268
I don't know.

851
01:22:10,268 --> 01:22:11,727
I'm making this up as I go.

852
01:25:49,135 --> 01:25:50,678
Ew!

853
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,517
He's there!

854
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:07,942
Idiot! Idiot!

855
01:29:52,692 --> 01:29:54,860
Everything at last
has been arranged.

856
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:56,195
The Ark?

857
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,404
Is on board.

858
01:29:57,404 --> 01:29:59,198
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

859
01:29:59,448 --> 01:30:00,616
Or what is left of you.

860
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:01,658
You trust these guys?

861
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:03,118
Yes.

862
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:05,328
Mr. Katanga.

863
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:12,084
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

864
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:13,919
They are my family.

865
01:30:14,086 --> 01:30:16,797
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

866
01:30:16,922 --> 01:30:19,925
My cabin is theirs.

867
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:21,593
Mr. Jones...

868
01:30:21,802 --> 01:30:24,137
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

869
01:30:24,262 --> 01:30:27,307
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

870
01:30:32,353 --> 01:30:34,605
Good-bye.

871
01:30:35,981 --> 01:30:37,858
Look out for each other.

872
01:30:38,108 --> 01:30:40,235
I am already missing you.

873
01:30:42,487 --> 01:30:44,698
You're my good friend.

874
01:30:46,366 --> 01:30:48,493
Sallah.

875
01:30:51,829 --> 01:30:54,623
That is for Fayah...

876
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:57,251
that is for your children...

877
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,586
and this is for you.

878
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:05,842
Thank you.

879
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:19,521
A British tar is a soaring soul

880
01:31:19,605 --> 01:31:24,192
As free as a mountain bird

881
01:31:24,192 --> 01:31:27,862
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

882
01:31:30,406 --> 01:31:32,241
...a dictator...

883
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:40,749
Where did you go?

884
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:41,875
I'm cleaning up.

885
01:31:43,418 --> 01:31:45,420
Where'd you get that?

886
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,880
From him.

887
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,256
Who him?

888
01:31:48,339 --> 01:31:49,132
Katanga.

889
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,259
l got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

890
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,927
ever to travel
with these pirates.

891
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:55,179
It's lovely.

892
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:56,222
Yeah?

893
01:31:56,222 --> 01:31:57,139
Yeah.

894
01:31:57,139 --> 01:31:58,265
Really?

895
01:31:58,265 --> 01:32:00,058
Yeah.

896
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:13,154
What'd you say?

897
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,287
Wait... I don't need any help.

898
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,955
You know you do.

899
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:29,168
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

900
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:33,756
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

901
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:39,094
You are...

902
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,055
Please, I don't need a nurse.

903
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:43,557
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.

904
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:44,641
Marion, leave me alone.

905
01:32:44,724 --> 01:32:46,101
-What is this here?
-Go away.

906
01:32:46,184 --> 01:32:48,436
Yes, it hurts.

907
01:32:48,603 --> 01:32:49,937
Ow!

908
01:32:50,063 --> 01:32:52,106
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

909
01:32:53,733 --> 01:32:55,484
Here.

910
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:02,491
Here.

911
01:33:10,998 --> 01:33:13,000
This isn't too bad.

912
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:23,510
Here.

913
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:45,280
Jones...

914
01:33:48,116 --> 01:33:50,118
Jones?

915
01:33:52,578 --> 01:33:56,332
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

916
01:34:22,689 --> 01:34:24,065
What is it?

917
01:34:24,232 --> 01:34:25,525
Engines have stopped.

918
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:27,152
I'm going to go check.

919
01:34:37,828 --> 01:34:38,787
What's happening?

920
01:34:38,912 --> 01:34:40,164
We have most important friends.

921
01:34:40,164 --> 01:34:41,915
Holy shit.

922
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,376
I sent my man for you.

923
01:34:44,376 --> 01:34:45,502
You and the girl must disappear.

924
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:46,586
We have a place in the hold.

925
01:34:46,753 --> 01:34:47,295
Come on, go, go, go.

926
01:34:47,462 --> 01:34:48,254
Come on, go, my friend, go.

927
01:35:01,099 --> 01:35:03,518
Where is Dr. Jones?

928
01:35:03,518 --> 01:35:04,561
What's the big idea?

929
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:05,812
Let go!

930
01:35:09,983 --> 01:35:12,652
Don't you touch me.

931
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:58,569
What about Jones?

932
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:01,029
There's no trace yet, sir.

933
01:36:01,029 --> 01:36:03,156
Jones is dead.

934
01:36:04,449 --> 01:36:06,659
I killed him.

935
01:36:06,826 --> 01:36:08,786
He was of no use to us.

936
01:36:08,786 --> 01:36:13,916
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

937
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:16,460
She'll bring a very good price.

938
01:36:16,585 --> 01:36:17,544
Mmm?

939
01:36:17,628 --> 01:36:21,173
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken-

940
01:36:21,173 --> 01:36:23,049
if it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

941
01:36:23,175 --> 01:36:24,342
but leave us the girl.

942
01:36:24,426 --> 01:36:26,302
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

943
01:36:26,302 --> 01:36:27,929
Savage!

944
01:36:28,096 --> 01:36:31,724
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

945
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:33,684
We will take what we wish.

946
01:36:33,684 --> 01:36:35,352
And then decide whether or not

947
01:36:35,436 --> 01:36:37,563
to blow your ship
from the water.

948
01:36:40,691 --> 01:36:42,150
The girl goes with me.

949
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:44,486
She'll be part
of my compensation.

950
01:36:44,486 --> 01:36:46,905
I'm sure your f端hrer
would approve.

951
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:48,656
If she fails to please me,

952
01:36:48,656 --> 01:36:50,783
you may do with her as you wish.

953
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:53,703
I will waste
no more time with her now.

954
01:36:53,703 --> 01:36:54,870
Excuse me.

955
01:37:11,302 --> 01:37:13,012
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

956
01:37:13,095 --> 01:37:14,221
I've looked everywhere.

957
01:37:14,388 --> 01:37:16,891
He's got to be here somewhere.

958
01:37:16,932 --> 01:37:18,142
Look again.

959
01:37:19,935 --> 01:37:21,770
-I found him.
-Where?

960
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,729
There.

961
01:39:48,988 --> 01:39:51,199
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

962
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,159
with your radio instructions,
sir.

963
01:39:53,159 --> 01:39:54,160
Good.

964
01:39:54,285 --> 01:39:55,786
Take the Ark there immediately.

965
01:39:57,538 --> 01:39:59,206
Monsieur...

966
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,794
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

967
01:40:03,877 --> 01:40:06,504
of this... Jewish ritual.

968
01:40:07,964 --> 01:40:10,383
Are you sure it's necessary?

969
01:40:10,383 --> 01:40:12,343
Let me ask you this:

970
01:40:12,343 --> 01:40:16,513
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

971
01:40:16,597 --> 01:40:18,349
for your f端hrer?

972
01:40:18,474 --> 01:40:19,600
Finding out, only then,

973
01:40:19,808 --> 01:40:22,728
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

974
01:40:22,894 --> 01:40:23,895
Knowing, only then,

975
01:40:24,145 --> 01:40:25,939
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

976
01:40:26,106 --> 01:40:29,233
and obtained the one true Ark?

977
01:41:57,564 --> 01:41:58,857
Hello!

978
01:42:01,485 --> 01:42:02,527
Jones.

979
01:42:03,987 --> 01:42:05,363
Jones!

980
01:42:05,363 --> 01:42:07,407
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

981
01:42:13,412 --> 01:42:17,583
Your persistence
surprises even me.

982
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:20,085
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

983
01:42:20,127 --> 01:42:22,754
Dr. Jones...

984
01:42:25,257 --> 01:42:27,717
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

985
01:42:27,884 --> 01:42:30,887
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

986
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:33,055
All I want is the girl.

987
01:42:37,226 --> 01:42:38,894
If we refuse?

988
01:42:38,977 --> 01:42:42,856
Then your f端hrer has no prize.

989
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:44,274
Okay, stand back.

990
01:42:44,274 --> 01:42:45,567
All of you, stand back.

991
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:47,235
Stand back.

992
01:42:47,235 --> 01:42:48,486
Okay, Jones.

993
01:42:48,486 --> 01:42:51,614
You win!

994
01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:53,157
Blow it up.

995
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:00,122
Yes, blow it up!

996
01:43:02,332 --> 01:43:04,334
Blow it back to God.

997
01:43:04,459 --> 01:43:06,461
All your life has been spent

998
01:43:06,503 --> 01:43:09,005
in pursuit
of archaeological relics.

999
01:43:09,172 --> 01:43:13,592
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

1000
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:18,138
You want to see it open
as well as I.

1001
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:20,432
Indiana...

1002
01:43:20,432 --> 01:43:24,728
we are simply passing
through history.

1003
01:43:24,811 --> 01:43:25,812
This...

1004
01:43:28,523 --> 01:43:30,191
This is history.

1005
01:43:39,408 --> 01:43:41,827
Do as you will.

1006
01:46:16,677 --> 01:46:19,096
Marion, don't look at it.

1007
01:46:19,096 --> 01:46:20,305
Shut your eyes, Marion.

1008
01:46:20,305 --> 01:46:22,099
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

1009
01:46:33,776 --> 01:46:36,278
Ah...

1010
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:53,085
It's beautiful!

1011
01:47:03,261 --> 01:47:04,346
Indy?

1012
01:47:04,512 --> 01:47:05,639
Don't look, Marion!

1013
01:47:05,722 --> 01:47:07,098
Keep your eyes shut!

1014
01:48:25,295 --> 01:48:26,296
Marion.

1015
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:01,953
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you

1016
01:49:01,953 --> 01:49:06,416
and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

1017
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:07,584
Oh, the money's fine.

1018
01:49:07,584 --> 01:49:09,502
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

1019
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:10,503
Well, gentlemen,

1020
01:49:10,503 --> 01:49:12,255
I guess that just about
wraps it up.

1021
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:14,298
Where is the Ark?

1022
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:17,384
I thought we'd settled that.

1023
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,720
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

1024
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:20,971
From whom?

1025
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:24,099
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

1026
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:26,351
and it has to be researched.

1027
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:29,354
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

1028
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,646
Dr. Jones.

1029
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:34,316
We have top men
working on it right now.

1030
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:36,819
Who?

1031
01:49:38,487 --> 01:49:40,906
Top men.

1032
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:46,327
Hey, what happened?

1033
01:49:46,369 --> 01:49:47,412
You don't look very happy.

1034
01:49:47,579 --> 01:49:49,372
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.

1035
01:49:49,539 --> 01:49:50,540
What'd they say?

1036
01:49:50,665 --> 01:49:53,709
They don't know
what they've got there.

1037
01:49:53,834 --> 01:49:57,129
Well, I know what I've got here.

1038
01:49:57,254 --> 01:49:58,505
Come on.

1039
01:49:58,505 --> 01:49:59,965
I'll buy you a drink.

1040
01:50:01,925 --> 01:50:03,844
You know...

1041
01:50:03,927 --> 01:50:05,887
a drink?
