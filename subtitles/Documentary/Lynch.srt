1
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,653
(birds chirping)

2
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,741
I think every time you do something
like a painting or whatever,

3
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,906
you 鈥

4
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,825
you 鈥

5
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,711
And sometimes the past
can conjure those ideas and color 鈥檈m.

6
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,006
Even if they鈥檙e new ideas,
the past colors them.

7
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,263
I was born in Missoula, Montana.

8
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:28,136
Then my parents got a house
in Sandpoint, Idaho,

9
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,556
and I lived there for two years.

10
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,188
So, I remember Sandpoint, Idaho.

11
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,276
Little Dickie Smith, my friend,

12
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,282
he and I

13
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,994
sat in a mud puddle under this tree.

14
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,584
My mother dug a hole, or my dad did,

15
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,544
that we could sit in in the hot weather,

16
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,085
and they鈥檇 fill it with, you know,
water from the hose,

17
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,801
and we鈥檇 sit in this mud puddle.

18
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,722
It was so beautiful.

19
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,641
And you get to squeeze mud
and sit with your friend

20
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,972
under the shade of this tree?

21
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Forget it.

22
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,691
And then they moved
to Spokane, Washington.

23
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,943
In those days,

24
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,985
my world was very, very small.

25
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:25,698
It extended up to this grocery store
in one direction

26
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,624
and down to a friend鈥檚 house,

27
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,753
which was, like, two houses down.

28
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,001
And then the other direction

29
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,714
down to my friend Bobby鈥檚 house.

30
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,085
Mostly, we played outdoors all day

31
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,763
and we made our own guns

32
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,552
and we would play war.

33
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,386
And I would draw rifles and pistols

34
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,892
and airplanes and knives
and things like that

35
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,436
鈥檆ause the war
was still kind of freshly over

36
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,942
and, you know, somehow we all got into it.

37
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,178
(girl babbling)

38
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,906
(scrubbing sound)

39
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,320
Because I was always drawing,
my mother did 鈥

40
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,703
This is the greatest thing she did.
One of the greatest things.

41
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,994
She refused

42
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,537
to ever have me have coloring books.

43
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,879
She did not do that
for my brother or my sister.

44
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,167
Somehow,
a really beautiful thing came to her

45
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,886
that those would be restrictive...

46
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,351
and kill some kind of creativity.

47
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,310
And she did not...

48
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,897
ever tell any off-color jokes.

49
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,242
She was totally against any racism.

50
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,201
She was religious,
but not preachy about it.

51
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:17,623
She was a 鈥

52
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,036
But she wasn鈥檛 demonstrative.

53
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,545
She wouldn鈥檛 grab your cheeks
and kiss you.

54
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,048
Not in a million years.

55
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:31,801
But you knew that she loved you

56
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,136
and wanted the best for you

57
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:41,903
and expected you
to, uh, live in a certain proper way.

58
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,543
I never heard my parents argue ever

59
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,844
about anything.

60
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,338
They got along like Ike and Mike.

61
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,376
Super happy household.

62
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,308
You know, as I look back,
I didn鈥檛 think anything of it,

63
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,178
but I had tremendous freedom.

64
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,187
Nobody was overbearing.

65
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,189
It was as if there was
just a foundation of love,

66
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,823
and off we went, you know,

67
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,901
each in our own direction.

68
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,044
One night 鈥

69
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,252
I kind of have the feeling

70
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,627
it was in the fall and it was pretty late.

71
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,055
Usually, my father would go outside

72
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,598
and yell,

73
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,143
鈥淛ohn? David?鈥

74
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,436
And that would bring us home.

75
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,488
But this night, it must鈥檝e been,

76
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,739
I don鈥檛 know, close to that time.

77
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,822
It seemed to be pretty late.

78
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,117
(door closes)

79
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,240
I don鈥檛 know what we were doing,

80
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,617
but from across Shoshoni Avenue...

81
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,253
out of the darkness

82
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,955
comes this...

83
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,256
like, uh, kind of like a strangest dream.

84
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,885
Because I鈥檝e never seen
an adult woman naked.

85
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,515
And she had beautiful, pale, white skin...

86
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,398
and she was completely naked.

87
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,817
And I think her mouth was bloodied.

88
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,616
And she kind of came strangely 鈥

89
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,833
walking strangely across Shoshoni

90
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,835
and came into Park Circle Drive.

91
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,678
And it seemed like
she was sort of like a giant.

92
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,180
And she came closer and closer,

93
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,683
and my brother started to cry.

94
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,227
Something was bad wrong with her.

95
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:33,065
And I don鈥檛 know what happened,
but I think she sat down on a curb, crying.

96
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,201
But it was very mysterious,

97
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,279
like we were seeing
something otherworldly.

98
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,947
And I wanted to do something for her,

99
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,658
but I was little.

100
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,078
I didn鈥檛 know what to do.

101
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,917
And I don鈥檛 remember any more than that.

102
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,309
Like I said, maybe, you know,
my world was no bigger

103
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,559
than a couple of blocks...

104
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,400
up until high school.

105
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,821
Really no bigger than a few blocks.

106
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,615
And that鈥檚 why I say huge worlds

107
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,289
are in, you know, those two blocks.

108
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,868
Huge.

109
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,583
Everything鈥檚 there.

110
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,173
Everything.

111
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,415
And you could live in one place
and have everything.

112
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,672
(thunder rumbling)

113
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,277
The night before we left Boise...

114
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,333
it was a summer night,

115
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,253
but it wasn鈥檛, uh,

116
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,544
a joyful summer night.

117
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:03,134
There鈥檚 a triangle of grass
between our house and the Smiths鈥

118
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,308
And at the base of the triangle,
there鈥檚 a tree.

119
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:14,442
And... I must have said good-bye
to everybody.

120
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,823
The whole family was out there.
My dad was out there.

121
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,979
I think my brother and sister
were out there.

122
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,448
I don鈥檛 know if my mom was there.

123
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,409
She might鈥檝e been just inside the house.

124
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,240
And the Smiths were all out.

125
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,785
We were just out there.

126
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,539
And Mr. Smith came out.

127
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,003
And...

128
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,503
(exhales)

129
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,304
I can鈥檛 tell the story.

130
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,682
I just 鈥

131
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,476
hardly ever...

132
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,061
but, boy...

133
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,974
Then we went to Virginia,

134
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,430
and the day I started school,

135
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,100
there was a huge hurricane.

136
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,640
And the rain was coming down.
You couldn鈥檛 hardly see the school.

137
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:41,188
It was, like, dark almost.
It was so thick, this storm.

138
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,782
There were two other guys
starting school...

139
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:52,289
and those two guys became my friends,

140
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,249
but...

141
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,376
they were not the friends I should鈥檝e had.

142
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,474
See, Boise, Idaho...

143
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,602
seemed like sunshine...

144
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,063
green grass, mowed lawns.

145
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,523
Such a cheerful place.

146
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,727
Such a great place.

147
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:33,081
Virginia seemed like always night.

148
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,251
And...

149
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,966
I developed spasms of the intestines.

150
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,654
I was 鈥

151
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,573
I was 鈥

152
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,907
uh, going into DC and drinking...

153
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:18,825
and sneaking out of the house at night.

154
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,915
It was, um...

155
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,800
It was like 鈥

156
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,889
control it, you know?

157
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,360
It just 鈥

158
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,238
My mother鈥檚

159
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,160
main saying to me a lot

160
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,872
was, 鈥淚鈥檓 very disappointed in you.鈥

161
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,212
I was real busy...

162
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,594
not doing what she wanted,

163
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:53,551
especially when I was in the ninth grade.

164
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,803
I got in with a bad bunch
and got into a lot of trouble,

165
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,927
but I 鈥

166
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,603
I had to live two different lives,

167
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,896
and I always felt

168
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,482
that she thought 鈥

169
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,488
And I don鈥檛 know why she thought this,

170
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,661
and I don鈥檛 know where this thing came in,

171
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,121
but I had the feeling

172
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,701
she thought

173
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,577
I had something really good in me,
you know, like a high potential.

174
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,665
So the reason that she would say
she was disappointed in me

175
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,426
is when she didn鈥檛 see that thing.

176
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,138
Not as an artist,
but like just some kind of thing.

177
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,270
I don鈥檛 know where she latched onto that,

178
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,560
but I kept kind of letting her down.

179
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,342
I never studied.

180
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,589
I never did anything.

181
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,092
I hated it so much.

182
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:20,184
I hated it, like, with powerful hate.

183
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:26,271
The only thing that was important
is what happened outside of school,

184
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,901
and that had huge impact on me 鈥

185
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,608
people and relationships,

186
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,981
slow-dancing parties,

187
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,818
big, big love

188
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,454
and dreams 鈥

189
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,615
dark, fantastic dreams.

190
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,084
Incredible time.

191
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,477
鈾櫔 (鈥淭en Little Indians鈥

192
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,289
(chirping)

193
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,896
I had a girlfriend named Linda Styles.

194
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,480
And one night 鈥

195
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,947
And it was about 9:30 or 10:00.

196
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,240
Somehow I was on the front lawn
of Linda Styles鈥

197
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:13,208
and I鈥檓 meeting this kid, Toby Keeler,

198
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,251
who didn鈥檛 go to Hammond High School.

199
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,955
He went to private school.

200
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:21,085
And Toby told me his father was a painter,

201
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:25,354
and that, you know, kind of realization

202
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,308
that you could be a painter

203
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,020
popped 鈥

204
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,313
And that鈥檚 what I wanted to do
from that second.

205
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,382
So I begged him to take me
to his father鈥檚 studio.

206
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,933
And at that time, Bushnell Keeler
had a studio in Georgetown.

207
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,390
And I only actually saw it once,
that next weekend.

208
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,181
I went 鈥

209
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,977
and I saw his studio.

210
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,940
And it was the classic studio.

211
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,192
I mean, it was so beautiful.

212
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,574
Bushnell could really set up a studio.

213
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,196
Um, many areas set up
for, like, drawing and for painting

214
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,452
and for different kind of experiments.

215
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:34,075
And, uh, it was just

216
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,674
what you would call, you know,
the art life,

217
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,250
you know, right before your eyes.

218
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,940
I don鈥檛 know when I started
using the term 鈥渢he art life,鈥

219
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,980
but one of the things Bushnell did
besides, uh, just being a painter

220
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,608
and living it 鈥

221
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,866
he gave me the Robert Henri book,
<i>The Art Spirit.</i>

222
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,872
And I loved that book.

223
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,964
I can鈥檛 remember much of it now,

224
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,750
but I 鈥

225
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,125
and <i>The Art Spirit</i>
sort of became the art life

226
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:27,883
and I had this idea that you drink coffee,

227
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,967
you smoke cigarettes and you paint.

228
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,560
And that鈥檚 it.

229
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,480
Maybe 鈥

230
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,061
but basically,

231
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,266
it鈥檚 the incredible happiness

232
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,857
of working and living that life.

233
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:21,273
The reason we moved to Virginia
in the first place

234
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,654
is my dad got, uh, promoted,

235
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:29,903
um, basically to a desk job
in Washington, DC.

236
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,529
So we lived in Alexandria, Virginia,

237
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,487
and my father...

238
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:43,133
instead of taking a bus
or driving to work,

239
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,549
would, many days,
wear his forest service uniform

240
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,880
and a ten-gallon cowboy hat...

241
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:56,313
and walk out the front door
and walk into DC.

242
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,349
It was so uncool to me...

243
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:06,780
uh, to see him going off in this, uh,
cowboy hat and this uniform.

244
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,898
But then later,
as it always happens with kids,

245
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:15,487
uh, now it seems, uh, supercool.

246
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,535
And he was his own guy, you know.

247
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,750
He didn鈥檛 鈥

248
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,422
This was what he 鈥

249
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,842
Since my father grew up on a ranch,

250
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,046
and you had to 鈥

251
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,557
if something鈥檚 broke, you have to fix it.

252
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,440
And we were always building things.

253
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,685
Always projects.

254
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:51,402
Always, you know, working
on one thing or another on the weekends.

255
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,656
So this kind of goes into your brain

256
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,369
that you can do these things,
and they鈥檙e 鈥

257
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,081
It made all this work really fun.

258
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:12,379
And he was, uh, a research scientist.

259
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,678
Meaning, he was, uh, looking into things.

260
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:22,678
There鈥檚 a lot of... things,

261
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,647
like when you punch a pin into a bug,

262
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:29,479
there鈥檚 incredible textures

263
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,776
just to a little bug.

264
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,531
Incredible legs on insects,

265
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,994
and wings

266
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,485
and innards.

267
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,462
It鈥檚 unbelievable.

268
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:18,906
(water shuts off)

269
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,078
I wanted to get a studio
in Bushnell鈥檚 studio,

270
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,792
a room he was renting me.

271
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,082
I think it was 40 bucks a month.

272
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:34,841
And my father, bless his heart,
said he would pay half if I paid half.

273
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:37,883
So I got a job at Hurley鈥檚 Drugstore

274
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,347
delivering prescriptions at night.

275
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:46,393
One time I came in during the daytime,

276
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:51,856
and I went to the soda fountain
to get a Coke.

277
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:57,609
And Jack Fisk was the soda jerk.

278
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:02,116
And so he said,
鈥淚 hear you have a studio.鈥

279
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,620
And I said, 鈥淵eah.鈥

280
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:08,962
He said, 鈥淯h, you want somebody else
to share the rent with that?鈥

281
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,460
Then pretty soon, Jack was painting
all the time down there with me,

282
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,174
and it was too small.

283
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:19,344
So then Jack and I got
three more different 鈥

284
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,100
And I knew, uh, my stuff sucked.

285
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,817
But I needed to burn through 鈥

286
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,188
I needed to find what was mine.

287
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,318
And the only way to find it

288
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,196
is just to keep painting and keep painting

289
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,365
and keep painting

290
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,544
and see if you catch something.

291
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:17,114
My father wanted me home
at 11:00 on school nights.

292
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,192
I didn鈥檛 wanna come home at 11:00.

293
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,283
All I wanted to do was paint.

294
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,784
So we had a big fight.

295
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,076
And we never had fights.

296
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,330
But this particular time,
it was really bad.

297
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:35,254
And I remember, like, you know,
it was terrible.

298
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,799
And I said I wanted
to stay out later than 11:00,

299
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,721
and I might have said something like,
鈥淲ell, I鈥檓 going to stay out later than 11:00.鈥

300
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,102
And my father said, 鈥淔ine.

301
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,983
You are no longer a member
of this family.鈥

302
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,859
And he just left the room.

303
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:03,906
And this hit me like
a, you know, sucker punch.

304
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,408
You know, just really.

305
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,080
-And I went up to my room.
-(door closes)

306
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,789
And I remember I just was,
like, you know, devastated.

307
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,790
But then Bushnell called my father.

308
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,206
(phone rings)

309
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,674
鈥機ause I explained to him,
you know, what it was.

310
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,085
And he said to my father 鈥

311
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:28,184
He said, 鈥淚 don鈥檛 wanna interfere
with any of your business,

312
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:32,563
but I would like to let you know
that every day,

313
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,942
David comes down here and is painting.

314
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,440
He鈥檚 not goofing around.

315
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:42,782
And I wish my son
had something that he loved to do

316
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,991
and, you know, was working like this.

317
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,031
I just think it鈥檚 important that you know
he鈥檚 real serious about this

318
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,196
and he鈥檚 really working.鈥

319
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:54,785
And so this went a long way with my dad.

320
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:59,173
And I think after that,
I could come home any time I wanted,

321
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,092
and it was totally cool.

322
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,016
You really couldn鈥檛 ask
for a better father.

323
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:23,565
He didn鈥檛 have
any kind of deviousness in him.

324
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,531
He was really pure

325
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,573
and he was super fair,

326
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,537
just naturally honest and fair.

327
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,659
Whenever I wanted anything,
his first thing was,

328
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,538
鈥淢eet me halfway.鈥

329
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,705
I鈥檇 have to do something,
and he would do something.

330
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,915
And I just, um, saw that

331
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,587
as a super good, you know, thing.

332
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,467
I would be able to get
what I wanted with his help,

333
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,266
but I had to do something too.

334
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,692
-(babbles)
-Are you ready?

335
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,544
Oh, shit.

336
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,064
Oh, fuck.

337
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,275
Oh, you motherfucker.

338
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:45,496
In the tenth grade,
the sunshine starts coming back.

339
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,125
Then I made a whole bunch
of different friends,

340
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,013
and that started a good turn.

341
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,180
Now, all those new friends,
we would go into DC all the time,

342
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,641
but it wasn鈥檛 the same dark vibe,

343
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:02,602
so I still was living,
like, maybe three lives now

344
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:06,976
because I had those friends
and I would do stuff with them,

345
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:11,322
I had my home life
and would do stuff there,

346
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,663
and then I had the, uh, studio.

347
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:23,245
So you act and speak and think one way

348
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,291
in this environment,

349
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:30,665
then you act and speak and think
in this other environment totally different.

350
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,639
And then another way of acting
and speaking and thinking in the other one.

351
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,429
For instance, my girlfriend,
who was a beautiful, wholesome,

352
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,555
wonderful person,

353
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,602
I never brought her home.

354
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,975
I never brought any friends home,
if I could help it.

355
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:54,994
And I kept things very separate.

356
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,543
And I did not want my parents
to go to my graduation,

357
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,288
but they went anyway.

358
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,460
I just, um, was afraid
of what would come out

359
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,841
if everybody got together.

360
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,833
For some reason,

361
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:53,128
I always liked the idea
of going to Boston.

362
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:59,891
And it just sounded
like, uh, a good place.

363
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:06,641
And my father helped me
move everything in,

364
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,846
and then he took me to the supermarket,

365
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:14,068
and we stocked up on a lot of stuff

366
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,860
and brought it back to the apartment.

367
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,855
And then I walked out with my dad

368
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,868
and said good-bye to him on the street

369
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,870
and watched him drive off.

370
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,963
Then I went back in my apartment.

371
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,288
(door closes)

372
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:31,633
And I never left.

373
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,750
It was two weeks before school.

374
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,128
I had a transistor radio,

375
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:41,546
so I sometimes listened to music,

376
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:44,756
but I ended up sitting in a chair.

377
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,732
And the only time I got out of the chair

378
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:51,649
was to, uh, pee or eat.

379
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:56,784
And the batteries
went down and down on the radio,

380
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,570
so I had to hold it to my ear to hear it,

381
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,954
and then it went dead.

382
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:07,202
And so I was just basically
really unable to do anything

383
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:10,497
and definitely unable
to leave the apartment.

384
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,379
And I say it took all my strength

385
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,672
to go to school the first day.

386
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,675
So, it was something
I needed to go through, I guess.

387
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,350
But I still, um, would
much rather stay at home.

388
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:33,733
And there is, uh, always, um,

389
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:36,323
nervousness of going out.

390
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:41,148
(radio static crackling)

391
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
(static continues crackling)

392
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,816
-(car horn honking)
-LYNCH: See you, Mary.

393
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,709
I don鈥檛 get out much.

394
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,632
-Come on.
-(turn signal clicking)

395
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,338
Come on.

396
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:13,502
My father, uh, told me, you know,
I could get this place,

397
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,620
but I had to take a roommate,

398
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:20,497
and my roommate later turned out
to be Peter Wolf

399
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,707
of the J. Geils Band.

400
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,297
He鈥檚 a great musician.

401
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:27,642
And he knows the blues.

402
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,389
But he didn鈥檛 ever lift a brush.

403
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:34,852
And the first night, there was, um,

404
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,484
another guy named Peter
who had a pickup truck.

405
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:44,443
And the three of us, uh,
got in his pickup truck

406
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:50,907
and drove back down
to, uh, New York City, in Brooklyn.

407
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,827
And it was on that trip

408
00:40:55,914 --> 00:41:00,384
that I smoked, um, marijuana
for the first time.

409
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,880
And then it was my turn to drive.

410
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,262
So I was driving on a freeway

411
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:09,261
and pretty soon I hear, 鈥淒avid?鈥

412
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,262
And I said, 鈥淲hat?鈥

413
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,017
And they said, 鈥淒avid.鈥

414
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,020
I said, 鈥淲hat?鈥

415
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:21,313
鈥淒avid!鈥

416
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,978
鈥淵ou stopped on the freeway, man.鈥

417
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,203
And I had stopped right in the 鈥

418
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,698
Not the right lane, but in the middle.

419
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,121
鈥機ause I was watching these white lines

420
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,620
and then it got slower and slower,
it was such a dream.

421
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,635
And the next time I smoked dope...

422
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,729
uh, Bob Dylan was playing, you know,

423
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:06,315
at this big place right down the street.

424
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,401
And so, lo and behold,

425
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:12,697
out of thousands of people
in this, you know,

426
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,412
auditorium kind of thing
which was real steep 鈥

427
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,293
I was way in the back.

428
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:20,831
Out of all those seats, when I sat down,

429
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:25,875
there was this girl sitting next to me
that I鈥檇 just broken up with.

430
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:30,012
Then Bob Dylan came out on the stage

431
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:33,801
and I couldn鈥檛 believe how little he was.

432
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:37,097
And I measured him
with my fingers on my knee,

433
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:43,652
and I said to her,
鈥淗is jeans are only this big.鈥

434
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,190
And then I measured his guitar
and I says, 鈥淗is guitar is only this big.鈥

435
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:54,203
And I wasn鈥檛 even digging the music,
it was so far away.

436
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:57,832
So I wanted to get out of there
really bad.

437
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:01,791
Then when the concert was over,
Peter came back with a bunch of his friends.

438
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:05,537
He said, 鈥淣obody walks out on Dylan.鈥

439
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:10,127
I said, 鈥淚 walk out on Dylan.
Get the fuck out of here.鈥

440
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:14,005
And, um, so that was the end
of Peter as my roomie.

441
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:23,438
I just didn鈥檛 wanna be,

442
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,560
you know, anywhere in this world.

443
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,067
It was, you know, now my world.

444
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,141
I hated Boston.

445
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,600
Boston Museum School was kind of like 鈥

446
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,892
to me like going back to high school.

447
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:08,977
I didn鈥檛 like anything inside that building
except the sculpture department.

448
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:15,321
They don鈥檛 do anything
except make you do these exercises.

449
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:19,025
And it鈥檚 just 鈥

450
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:24,407
And they want the exercises
to be a certain way,

451
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,877
and if your way isn鈥檛 that way,

452
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:31,048
you鈥檙e just gonna, you know 鈥

453
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,625
It鈥檚 a joke.

454
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:37,295
And then no kids
were serious about painting.

455
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:40,755
So, it was just, uh,
a kind of a waste of a year,

456
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,767
and I quit going to school.

457
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,559
And then I heard from Jack.
He was fed up with Cooper Union.

458
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:51,355
I was more than fed up
with Boston Museum School.

459
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,691
And we decided we鈥檙e gonna go to Europe.

460
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:58,494
So, we started making plans,

461
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:01,913
and we found out this guy,
Oskar Kokoschka,

462
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:05,833
had this class in Salzburg, Austria.

463
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,800
So we decided we were gonna go do that.

464
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:17,089
But it was, like, not even half-baked,
these ideas.

465
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:22,135
So we were gonna go for three years.

466
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,522
And 鈥

467
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:27,057
But we came back in 15 days.

468
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,491
So Jack was, really, my best friend.

469
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,830
But when Jack and I came back from Europe,

470
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,538
we had a pretty big falling out.

471
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:49,539
Next thing I hear is he鈥檚 up at
the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts,

472
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:51,924
which made me really happy for him.

473
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,593
But... Bushnell

474
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,472
and some of the painters in that area 鈥

475
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:02,552
I would go to Bushnell鈥檚 and have
coffee with him, you know, every day.

476
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:06,097
And so he got this idea that he said,

477
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:09,352
鈥淟et鈥檚 all snub David.

478
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,903
Let鈥檚 make life miserable for him.

479
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,821
And then maybe
he鈥檒l wanna go back to school.鈥

480
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:20,163
And that鈥檚 what they did.
I鈥檇 go over there, they鈥檇 hardly talk to me.

481
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:25,036
And I just, I鈥檇 get this strange feeling,

482
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:27,498
and Jack telling me how good it was.

483
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:32,329
One day, I said, 鈥淏ush, I think
I鈥檓 gonna go to 鈥

484
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,587
And he said, 鈥淲ell, bully for you.鈥

485
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:38,299
He wrote a letter, secretly, to the school,

486
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:41,301
a really powerful letter on my 鈥

487
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:44,394
I did never know about it till way later.

488
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:48,604
When I went up there to school,

489
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,483
they not only accepted me,

490
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:54,154
but they put me in advanced classes.

491
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,975
And it wasn鈥檛 anything to do with my work.

492
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,857
It was Bushnell doing it.

493
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:00,613
It was great.

494
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:21,719
First of all,
yeah, I wanted to go up there

495
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,970
鈥檆ause Jack said it was good.

496
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:30,432
But Philadelphia was one of the last places
in the world I ever wanted to go.

497
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:33,847
There鈥檚 something about Philadelphia
that I didn鈥檛 like,

498
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,607
and so when I got 鈥

499
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,530
I forget the way the bus goes,
but you鈥檙e not in Philadelphia,

500
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,070
and then you go across a bridge

501
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:45,994
and that bridge takes you.

502
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,124
So, on the bridge, I was saying,

503
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:51,711
鈥淚鈥檓 not in Philadelphia, I鈥檓 not
in Philadelphia, I鈥檓 not in Philadelphia.鈥

504
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,958
Then I got halfway over the bridge
and I said,

505
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,960
鈥淚鈥檓 in Philadelphia, I鈥檓 in Philadelphia.鈥

506
00:47:57,043 --> 00:47:59,253
And I just couldn鈥檛 believe it.

507
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,790
(whirring)

508
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,181
(whirring stops)

509
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:56,354
Philadelphia...

510
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:01,322
was kind of a poor man鈥檚 New York City.

511
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:04,275
So it was a weird town.

512
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:06,651
It was a kind of a mean town.

513
00:49:09,574 --> 00:49:12,204
One woman, who was my neighbor,

514
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,579
reeked of urine.

515
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:20,588
And she was a complete racist.

516
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:24,424
There was another woman

517
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:28,843
who was totally crazy.

518
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:33,469
She was a neighbor,
lived down the street with her parents.

519
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:40,403
And she would go around the backyard
on her hands and knees

520
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,860
and squawk like a chicken

521
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,397
and say, 鈥淚鈥檓 a chicken, I鈥檓 a chicken,鈥

522
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,236
and squawk and squawk

523
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:52,741
and go around and around
in this tall white grass in her backyard.

524
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:56,751
She came up to me one day on the street...

525
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:01,706
and she said, 鈥淥h, my nipples hurt!鈥

526
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:06,213
And she was squeezing her 鈥

527
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:10,298
standing in front of me,
squeezing 鈥檈m and shaking 鈥檈m 鈥

528
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,345
鈥淢y nipples hurt!鈥

529
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:17,481
Then there is, uh, that person
I walked by, you know,

530
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:20,149
going to the store
to get some smokes or something.

531
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:21,808
I鈥檓 walking down the street.

532
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:26,226
There鈥檚 a very nice lady
with her little 鈥

533
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:30,487
her little baby on her lap
out on the stoop.

534
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,452
I鈥檓 walking by.

535
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,332
I say, 鈥淗ow you doing?鈥

536
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:36,749
(imitating lady鈥檚 sarcastic voice)
鈥淗ow you doing? How you doing?鈥

537
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,748
She turned to her baby and said,

538
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,370
鈥淵ou grow up like that
and I鈥檒l fucking kill you.鈥

539
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,170
There was a thick,

540
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,005
thick fear

541
00:50:52,093 --> 00:50:54,553
in the 鈥

542
00:50:55,513 --> 00:50:59,523
There was a feeling
of sickness, corruption...

543
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,232
of racial hatred.

544
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:08,993
But Philadelphia
was just perfect to spark things.

545
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:15,369
And the students were great,

546
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,160
and they were workers.

547
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:23,423
And we had a kind of camaraderie,

548
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:29,629
and it was like the art life,
uh, the art spirit was alive and well.

549
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:44,234
Philadelphia was what started...

550
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:48,779
started, uh...

551
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,198
It was so good for me.

552
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,490
Really, really good.

553
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,578
Even though I lived in fear,

554
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:11,756
I鈥檝e kind of, um, uh...

555
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:15,013
I-It was...

556
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,351
thrilling...

557
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:24,193
to live the art life
in Philadelphia at that time.

558
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:06,584
I...

559
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:12,421
had some kind of a cubicle set up

560
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:16,722
in this painting studio at the academy.

561
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,639
And when I went into my little cubicle,

562
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,600
it was very private.

563
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,889
And there were other cubicles
like that around.

564
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:30,846
But people could work in privacy.

565
00:54:30,937 --> 00:54:33,357
And I was painting a painting

566
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,190
about four-foot square.

567
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,160
And it was mostly black,

568
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:46,789
but it had some green plant and leaves

569
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,211
coming out of the black.

570
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:58,208
And I was sitting back,
probably taking a smoke and looking at it.

571
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,218
And from the painting

572
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,723
I heard a wind.

573
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:08,725
And the green started moving.

574
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:13,152
And I thought, 鈥淥h!

575
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:17,319
A moving painting, but with sound.鈥

576
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:23,616
And that idea stuck in my head 鈥

577
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,911
a moving painting.

578
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,110
One night...

579
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:45,027
I met the man
who was the night man at the morgue

580
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:47,413
at Pop鈥檚 Diner,

581
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:51,870
and I said, 鈥淚 sure would like
to come over there and 鈥

582
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,043
and, uh, see.鈥

583
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,708
And he said, 鈥淟et me know.鈥

584
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,841
Uh, you know, 鈥淟et me know.鈥

585
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:04,218
And so I went across over there,
midnight, rang the bell.

586
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:06,593
This guy lets me in.

587
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:09,426
In the front was a kind of like, uh 鈥

588
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:11,512
had, like, those square tiles,

589
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,178
green and 鈥

590
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:17,693
and it had a cigarette machine,
a Coke machine,

591
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:20,361
some couches and a desk.

592
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,940
So it was kind of like
a lobby room in the front.

593
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:30,158
Then there was this big door
with a glass pane in it and wire in the glass,

594
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:32,541
and a doorknob 鈥

595
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:35,709
You open up that, go down this corridor,

596
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:40,839
and now you鈥檙e in, you know,
the back room where they do everything.

597
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:44,209
But nobody was working
鈥檆ause it鈥檚 鈥

598
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:48,717
And I went into the cold room
and, you know 鈥

599
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,932
(chuckles) He closed the door behind me.

600
00:57:51,596 --> 00:57:56,266
And, um, so I鈥檓 in there sitting,
uh, kind of on the floor

601
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:58,941
and there鈥檚 these, like, bunk beds.

602
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,860
All these people dead 鈥

603
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,030
you know, bodies all around me,

604
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,860
and, um, I just sort of sat there

605
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:11,367
and, uh, felt it.

606
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,618
It was...

607
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:15,502
It was strange.

608
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:19,918
And then I went home.

609
00:58:28,174 --> 00:58:34,014
The thing that gets you is that
you wonder the story of each one.

610
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:36,767
You wonder the story 鈥

611
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,810
who they were, what they did,
how they got there.

612
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:42,895
Just makes you think.

613
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:45,815
And...

614
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,776
it makes you think of stories.

615
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:06,555
This was 1967...

616
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,694
and I was living

617
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:13,567
at 2429 Aspen Street.

618
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:23,040
Peggy had, at that time,

619
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:27,043
sort of started moving in to 2429.

620
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:31,881
And I get a call

621
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,335
that my father had to make a trip

622
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:38,506
from California
out to, say, DC or something,

623
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:43,436
and he would like to come up
and visit, uh, in Philadelphia.

624
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:45,808
So I said, 鈥淥h, my God.鈥

625
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:49,192
I had to make arrangements.

626
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,864
Peggy had to move out 鈥

627
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,653
Uh, not move out, but not be there.

628
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,448
And...

629
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:02,083
I picked up my dad and brought him
back to 2429 Aspen Street

630
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,042
and we had a visit.

631
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,332
And just near the end of the visit I said,

632
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,797
鈥淥h, I gotta show you 鈥

633
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:14,549
And, uh, I took him down to the basement,

634
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:17,892
which was, like,

635
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:21,889
earthen floor, really old.

636
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:25,693
Cobwebs and stuff
all around the ceiling level.

637
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,519
And dirty basement windows.

638
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:31,015
But I鈥檇 set up these little tables,

639
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:36,357
little, like, platforms
out of wood and stuff,

640
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:39,446
and I had all these experiments going.

641
01:01:39,532 --> 01:01:43,412
Like, I wanted to see what fruit
would do after a long period 鈥

642
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:47,615
different stages of fruit
and how it would decay.

643
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:52,917
And I had some dead birds
and I had my mouse in plastic

644
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:56,134
and I had, you know,
a bunch of stuff I鈥檇 collected.

645
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,587
So I wanted to share this with my father.

646
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:01,848
So I took him down to the basement.

647
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,560
And it鈥檚 pretty dim light.

648
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,731
And looking at these things
I鈥檓 sharing with him, right?

649
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:10,895
And he鈥檚 looking at them.

650
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,690
So then we went back up,

651
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:16,074
and we were on the stairway,
and I was ahead of him,

652
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,910
and I was smiling, uh, to myself.

653
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,159
It was great that he got to see this.

654
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:25,873
And I kind of turned with a smile.

655
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:30,004
As we were going up the stairs
I turned back toward him,

656
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:35,343
and I see this pained expression
on my father鈥檚 face,

657
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,876
which he was hiding from me.

658
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,045
Then I got back in the truck

659
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:46,427
and we were driving back
to the, uh, railroad station,

660
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:50,266
and it was in that truck

661
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:53,903
driving back, uh, to the station

662
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:56,072
that he said to me, 鈥淒ave?鈥

663
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:57,741
I said, 鈥淵eah?鈥

664
01:02:57,819 --> 01:03:01,779
鈥淚 don鈥檛 think you should
ever have children.鈥

665
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:09,207
He was 鈥

666
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:14,090
But inside me
I felt there was nothing to worry about.

667
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:17,259
But I still understood why he said it.

668
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,969
He misunderstood, um, my experiments

669
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,801
for, um...

670
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:26,217
(laughs) some kind of, uh...

671
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:30,558
like, diabolical, you know,

672
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:34,653
man who needs serious help,

673
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,901
mentally and probably emotionally.

674
01:03:58,004 --> 01:04:02,804
The ironic part of this is,

675
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:06,184
unbeknownst to me and my father,

676
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:10,807
Peggy, at that very moment, was pregnant.

677
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:16,725
So, uh, that 鈥

678
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:20,275
that鈥檚... uh, interesting.

679
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,290
I started doing a...

680
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:17,633
kind of a split-screen...

681
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:20,168
thing,

682
01:05:20,253 --> 01:05:23,513
and it was gonna be Mary Fisk

683
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,010
dancing on one-third of the screen

684
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:28,718
and...

685
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:34,482
on the other two-thirds an animated thing.

686
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:41,233
So I animated that thing for two months.

687
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:45,033
And I had a hundred feet of film
in the camera.

688
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:49,698
And I didn鈥檛 know technically
what I was doing really,

689
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:54,253
but I took the hundred-foot roll
out of the camera,

690
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:57,003
took it to the lab,

691
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:59,882
and a couple of days later I got it back.

692
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:01,749
And I was standing in the doorway

693
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:06,336
鈥檆ause I opened the door
so I could get sunlight and just 鈥

694
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:09,894
I just wanted to check the first part,
make sure everything was okay.

695
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:13,519
So I unspool 鈥

696
01:06:13,598 --> 01:06:16,228
And I can鈥檛 find anything.
I unspool some more.

697
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:17,979
And it dawns on me

698
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:23,271
that this entire roll of negative is a blur.

699
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,108
And Peggy...

700
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:29,741
Her recollection is that I was really upset.

701
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,449
But... in a strange way...

702
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:41,920
I wasn鈥檛 that upset because...

703
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:47,474
I must have been getting an idea
for something more.

704
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:52,678
And I wanted to do
live action and animation both.

705
01:06:52,762 --> 01:06:55,392
That鈥檚 when I made <i>The Alphabet.</i>

706
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:46,648
So, accidents or destroying something

707
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:49,243
can lead to something good.

708
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:53,737
It can lead to something good.

709
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:57,243
Very controlled things,

710
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:59,907
not being open to...

711
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:03,251
You know, just like being 鈥

712
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:07,173
like these boundaries,
they just screw you.

713
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:12,134
And you have to sometimes make a huge mess

714
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:14,837
and make big mistakes

715
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:16,888
to find that thing

716
01:08:18,139 --> 01:08:20,479
that you鈥檙e looking for.

717
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:28,611
(rotary saw starts whirring)

718
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:30,692
(whirring stops)

719
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:28,174
Right after <i>The Alphabet</i>was finished,

720
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:30,957
right after it was finished,

721
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:35,298
we must have moved up
to 2416 Poplar Street.

722
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:41,772
It must have been right around then...

723
01:09:43,808 --> 01:09:46,308
that we needed money.

724
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:49,145
And...

725
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:55,318
I was sawing wood in the dining room.

726
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,530
And it was like...

727
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:04,947
You know, the sweetness of freedom

728
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:08,172
was just going.

729
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,497
But I loved sawing that wood.

730
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:14,456
It was my last free night.

731
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:17,047
And then I started this job.

732
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:21,933
And I鈥檇 go there, you know,
five days a week.

733
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:34,362
(no audible dialogue)

734
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,991
(rain falling)

735
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:50,787
When I was printing for Rodger LaPelle,

736
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:54,795
Jennifer was, like,
two or three or four months old.

737
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:58,007
I had applied for a grant

738
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,761
to the American Film Institute,

739
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:01,933
an independent filmmakers grant.

740
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:06,772
The winners of the first group
were announced.

741
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,810
And when I read the names of the winners,

742
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,650
I knew I wouldn鈥檛 win,

743
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:18,702
鈥檆ause they were all really
well-established underground filmmakers.

744
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:23,029
So 鈥

745
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:26,036
So I just gave up.
I mean, I didn鈥檛 really give up.

746
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,579
I just said, 鈥淭here鈥檚 no fucking way.鈥

747
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:31,673
So I would go to work printing,

748
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,540
and Philadelphia, you know,
was, like, already...

749
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:39,715
just suck your happiness away

750
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:44,099
and, um, fill you with
a sadness and a fear.

751
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:48,679
So, you know, I didn鈥檛 have
any time, really, to paint.

752
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:53,269
But Rodger would give me $25

753
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:56,145
to come out on Saturday and paint,

754
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:58,152
and then paid me for printing.

755
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,454
And that鈥檚 what kept us afloat.

756
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,444
One day, a few months later,

757
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,320
I said to Peggy,
鈥淐all me if anything exciting happens.

758
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:43,663
I鈥檒l call you
if anything exciting happens.鈥

759
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:46,658
And I headed out to print.

760
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,287
That day...

761
01:12:50,328 --> 01:12:53,748
First I think Peggy received a phone call.

762
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:58,342
Because the phone rang and Rodger
came downstairs from upstairs

763
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,260
sort of smiling

764
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:02,258
and said, 鈥淭he phone is for you.鈥

765
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,100
And it was George Stevens Jr.
and Tony Vellani on the line,

766
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:11,184
and they said, 鈥淒avid, we鈥檙e 鈥

767
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,346
Something like,
鈥淲e鈥檙e very happy to tell you

768
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:17,056
that you have won a grant

769
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:19,607
from the American Film Institute.鈥

770
01:13:21,317 --> 01:13:23,067
And, you know...

771
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,744
It just...

772
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:28,373
(exhales)

773
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,450
Total life-changing phone call.

774
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,250
(no audible dialogue)

775
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:46,629
In the house,

776
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:51,098
I kind of had started to have a setup.

777
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:55,811
And when I made the film,
I had all these rooms

778
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:58,194
to shoot the film right there.

779
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,821
I only had a couple of scenes outside.

780
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,740
It was just 鈥

781
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:05,818
It was just perfect.

782
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:50,565
Tony Vellani came up to Philadelphia
on the train

783
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:54,294
and we filmed <i>The Grandmother.</i>

784
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:57,961
Tony flipped out.

785
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:04,344
I drove him back to the train station,

786
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:09,092
and on the way he said,

787
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:12,755
鈥淒avid, I think you should go

788
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:17,726
to the Center for Advanced
Film Studies in Los Angeles.鈥

789
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:21,733
Well...

790
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:26,358
I almost died and went to heaven,

791
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:28,453
just him telling me that.

792
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:33,120
I鈥檇 seen this booklet of the mansion

793
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,579
and all the stuff going on there,

794
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,750
and I would just look at this booklet

795
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,580
and dream about this place,

796
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:44,376
and here is somebody telling me, you know,

797
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,921
basically he鈥檚 gonna help me get there.

798
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,376
LYNCH: You want a round cake?

799
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,671
-LULA: A round cake.
-LYNCH: Okay.

800
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:31,125
LULA: Can you make a dot?

801
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:38,224
A cake with a candle.

802
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,766
Cake with a candle.

803
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,732
Hot dog!

804
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,900
Here are the babies here.

805
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:52,645
There are the babies.

806
01:16:52,737 --> 01:16:55,447
And there鈥檚 the cookies for the babies.

807
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:57,282
Little tiny cookies.

808
01:16:57,367 --> 01:17:00,247
Little tiny. Yum.

809
01:17:00,328 --> 01:17:01,708
LYNCH: I thought...

810
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:06,963
When I got married I said,
okay, that鈥檚 it.

811
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:09,714
That鈥檚 it.

812
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:17,304
In some way, your life is over.

813
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:20,387
(chuckles) But...

814
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:23,483
it was actually the best thing
that could鈥檝e happened to me.

815
01:17:24,602 --> 01:17:27,562
Because, you know,

816
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:30,647
there are certain things that come along

817
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,153
that get you off the dime.

818
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:35,236
You know what I mean?

819
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:37,621
And...

820
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,869
I didn鈥檛 think of where I would go
if I wasn鈥檛 in Philly,

821
01:17:40,952 --> 01:17:44,872
but it seemed like I was gonna be there.

822
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,503
鈥機ause to get up and move 鈥

823
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:51,875
I had that huge house.
It was such a setup.

824
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:57,184
But I didn鈥檛 know 鈥

825
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,640
It鈥檚 just, um...

826
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,391
It seemed... like...

827
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:14,363
No, I wasn鈥檛 鈥

828
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:17,492
It just 鈥

829
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,619
I don鈥檛 know what would鈥檝e happened
if I hadn鈥檛 gotten that grant.

830
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,871
I really don鈥檛.

831
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:45,932
So when we drove out, we went, um, to 鈥

832
01:18:46,017 --> 01:18:50,437
down Sunset
and turned left on San Vicente,

833
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:53,022
parked the big truck,

834
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,358
and the next morning
was that first morning

835
01:18:55,443 --> 01:18:58,283
I experienced California sunshine.

836
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,743
Unreal.

837
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:03,493
I just stood in the street
and looked up at the sun.

838
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:04,986
It was unbelievable.

839
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:08,294
And it was a kind of a thing where...

840
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:13,294
it was pulling, uh,

841
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:15,048
fear out of me.

842
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:27,602
You know, imagine coming
from Philadelphia and that world

843
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,734
out to LA

844
01:19:30,478 --> 01:19:34,018
and being shown

845
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:36,277
where you鈥檙e gonna go to school 鈥

846
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:40,359
a 55-room mansion on the top of a hill

847
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:43,867
in the best part of Beverly Hills.

848
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,200
And the stables were given to me.

849
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:51,713
And it wasn鈥檛 like anybody else
even wanted them, you know.

850
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,631
It was just they were sitting there,

851
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,507
and I was able to get them.

852
01:19:57,589 --> 01:20:00,339
It鈥檚 just unbelievable.

853
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:02,885
What a gift that was.

854
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:05,349
Unbelievable.

855
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,560
For four years I had those stables.

856
01:20:09,976 --> 01:20:13,686
And able to build down there,
live down there, eat down there.

857
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,572
It was incredible.

858
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,110
(footsteps)

859
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,991
-(muffled chattering)
-MAN: Go.

860
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:29,698
LYNCH: Play it, Fred.

861
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:32,749
MAN: Go.

862
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:40,221
LYNCH: I just love being in that mood.

863
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:45,182
Sometimes I would sit
on the sets at night.

864
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:47,848
I鈥檇 be working or something,

865
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:53,061
and I could imagine a whole world outside

866
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:55,114
that doesn鈥檛 exist.

867
01:20:56,147 --> 01:21:00,937
But it really would be such a world.

868
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:08,872
Around me was the factory neighborhood,

869
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:11,162
and I would imagine it,

870
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:13,366
and it was so real.

871
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:16,206
And sometimes it would rain,

872
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:19,302
and I鈥檇 hear this rain,

873
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,299
and I鈥檇 be in this room,

874
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:26,182
and I knew what the streets
were like out there, and the diners.

875
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:29,257
It was really dark

876
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:32,807
and filled with smoke

877
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:36,192
and big factories 鈥

878
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:38,361
huge smokestacks,

879
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,480
fire and smoke and steel.

880
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:47,618
And these homes with little doilies
and stuffed chairs.

881
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,239
And hot inside,

882
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:53,865
and pipes kind of leaking,
and all these things.

883
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:20,359
I was divorced from Peggy

884
01:22:22,692 --> 01:22:24,902
and living at the stables,

885
01:22:24,986 --> 01:22:29,946
and my brother was visiting
out in Riverside.

886
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:34,789
And my brother and my father
wanted to talk to me.

887
01:22:35,997 --> 01:22:37,537
I sit down.

888
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:40,424
I remember it was dark in the living room.

889
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:43,302
Then the whole thing was,

890
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,050
鈥淕ive up this film...

891
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:49,971
and get a job,

892
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:53,973
because your 鈥

893
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,937
this film isn鈥檛 getting made,

894
01:22:57,018 --> 01:22:59,688
and you鈥檙e wasting your time.鈥

895
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:01,361
This kind of thing.

896
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:04,569
And it got me...

897
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:09,107
It got me really in a deep, deep way.

898
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:11,868
鈥機ause they didn鈥檛 understand

899
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,000
and I just couldn鈥檛 believe it,
what they were saying to me.

900
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:18,539
And they were totally serious.

901
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:22,634
And so I left there and I went back,

902
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:25,091
and my sister was in the back bedroom,

903
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:27,011
and I started crying.

904
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:31,260
But, um, it was 鈥

905
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:36,677
it was just one of those things...

906
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:40,725
where, um,

907
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:43,982
there was no way I was gonna do that.

908
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,240
LYNCH: See, what I wanna do is have the 鈥

909
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:53,780
Mainly the-the-the look on 鈥

910
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:56,037
It鈥檚 so real. I feel like he鈥檚 here.

911
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:58,039
-But anyway, um, uh 鈥

912
01:23:58,121 --> 01:24:02,251
The look on Henry鈥檚 face just when he鈥檚
getting ready to cut. You know, the big cut.

913
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,971
<i>Eraserhead</i>,

914
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:11,589
to me, was one of my greatest,

915
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:15,969
happiest experiences in cinema.

916
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:21,100
And what I loved about it was the world

917
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:26,065
and having it be my own little place

918
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:31,907
where I could build everything
and get it exactly the way I wanted it

919
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:33,908
for hardly any money.

920
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:36,741
It just took time.

921
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:43,919
It just, uh, was so beautiful.

922
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:46,538
Everything about it.

923
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,473
Everything about it.
