1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,200
<i>The defeat and breakup
of the Soviet empire,</i>

2
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,101
<i>culminating in the crumbling
of the Berlin Wall,</i>

3
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,402
<i>is one of the great events
of world history.</i>

4
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:28,303
<i>There were many heroes
in this battle,</i>

5
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:32,504
<i>but to Charlie Wilson
must go this
special recognition.</i>

6
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:37,906
<i>Just 13 years ago,
the Soviet Army appeared
to be invincible.</i>

7
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,908
<i>But Charlie, undeterred,</i>

8
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,110
<i>engineered
a lethal body blow</i>

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,710
<i>that weakened
the Communist empire.</i>

10
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,611
<i>Without Charlie,</i>

11
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,911
<i>history would be hugely
and sadly different.</i>

12
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:55,214
<i>And so,
for the first time,</i>

13
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:59,614
<i>a civilian is being given
our highest recognition,</i>

14
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:01,715
<i>that of Honored Colleague.</i>

15
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:05,617
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the Clandestine Services,</i>

16
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:07,918
<i>Congressman Charles Wilson.</i>

17
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:32,327
<i></i>

18
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>It'd be like Dallas.</i>

19
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:34,529
That's right.

20
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,528
You know what I'm saying?

21
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,229
<i>Like Dallas but set
in Washington.</i>

22
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,130
Yeah.
And you should
say it just like that.

23
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,631
When I pitch it.
You should say it just...

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,230
"Oh, this is fucking great."
You should say it
just like that.

25
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,032
<i>Dallas set
in Washington D.C.</i>

26
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:47,432
You know,
with the intrigue
and the power plays

27
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,133
and the overt
natural sex.

28
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,634
The glamour,
the power.

29
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,634
Do you know
what I'm saying?
It's fucking Dallas.

30
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:53,935
Or,
or Falcon Crest.

31
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:54,936
Yes.

32
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:56,236
That's set in Washington.

33
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,937
Say it to Charlie
like that.

34
00:01:57,937 --> 00:02:01,137
<i>The resistance fighters
disguised us as one
of them.</i>

35
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,639
Charlie.

36
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:07,139
<i>It's like Dallas
but in Washington.</i>

37
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,341
With Crystal
in the starring role.

38
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,441
Yeah.

39
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,941
You tell me when to watch.
I'll make sure I'm home.

40
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,542
You don't think
I can make it happen?

41
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,742
I don't know anything
about how any
of that works.

42
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,044
I do.
You said that
you would listen to him.

43
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:19,245
That's why we're here.

44
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:21,744
Do they routinely
give starring roles
on network programs

45
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:24,046
to people who haven't
acted professionally
before?

46
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,347
<i>She was just on
the fucking cover
of Playboy, Charlie.</i>

47
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,147
Well, I guess
that's just the
same thing.

48
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,948
Would you take
this seriously, please?

49
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,249
I am taking it seriously,
hon, but can you all
tell me something?

50
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,250
What is...
What is Dan Rather
wearing right now?

51
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,951
What?
Dan Rather.

52
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:36,951
What is he wearing?

53
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,051
You're watching TV?

54
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:39,152
Why hasn't he shaved?

55
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:40,552
Well, who gives a damn?

56
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:43,953
Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me,
could you turn that up?

57
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:46,954
Could you just turn up
the volume on the TV?

58
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:48,455
Oh, I'm completely high.

59
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:50,055
Yeah. Okay.

60
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,356
Still, could you just
grab the remote there

61
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,657
and find
the volume button?

62
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,358
Charlie, are we
gonna do business?

63
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,459
Dan Rather is wearing
a turban, Paul. Don't
you want to know why?

64
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,859
He's doing a thing
from India.

65
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,961
No, that's Afghanistan.
Got it.

66
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,761
<i>Appreciate it.
We got it...
We captured it</i>

67
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,362
<i>from the Afghan,
the Afghan army.
Thank you.</i>

68
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:09,963
<i>Does he have
ammunition for this?
He has three.</i>

69
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,964
<i>But does he have ammunition?
A lot of ammunition?</i>

70
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,764
Well, he's talking
about the mujahideen.

71
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:14,965
No, we don't,
we didn't capture any.

72
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:16,166
Priests?

73
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:19,765
No, mujahideen means,
like, holy warriors.

74
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,867
Priests!

75
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,468
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

76
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,668
Paul.

77
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,269
<i>And he was... He is saying
that, you know, America
seems to be asleep.</i>

78
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,370
<i>It doesn't seem to realize
that if Afghanistan goes</i>

79
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,572
<i>and the Russians
go over to the Gulf,</i>

80
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,872
<i>that in a very short time,</i>

81
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,273
<i>it's going to be the turn
of the United States as well.</i>

82
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,574
I'm sure he knows
that in Vietnam...

83
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:41,975
Excuse me.

84
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,376
We were just wondering
what you do for a living.

85
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,176
I'm not a police officer,
if that's what you're asking.

86
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,778
No. We just... We don't
meet a lot of guys here
who both, you know,

87
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,679
know about the world
and like to party.

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
No.

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm a member
of the U.S. House
of Representatives.

90
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,781
I'm sorry?

91
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,382
I'm a Congressman.

92
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,882
Are you kidding?

93
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,382
No. No,
I'm absolutely serious.

94
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:08,283
I'm Charlie Wilson.
I represent the Texas
Second Congressional.

95
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,586
Texas. And this
is Crystal Lee.

96
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,786
This is Paul Brown.
What are your names?

97
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,887
Stacey.
Stacey.

98
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,888
Kelly.
Kelly. Well, it's nice
to meet you both.

99
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,188
If you are a Congressman
should you be in here
with strippers and blow?

100
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,690
Hey, I'm not a stripper.

101
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:27,992
I am a stripper.

102
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,292
I'm a stripper.

103
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,393
Yes, see, they were
talking about themselves.

104
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:34,093
You know, you do
have a point there.

105
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,495
I really should get going.
A little pruney.

106
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,695
Look, Charlie,
I need $29,000
to make it happen.

107
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,497
And you know I can make
it happen, and you know
you want in on this.

108
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:45,897
Hey, who wants
to take a ride with
me to the airport?

109
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,099
Oh, me!
Paul?

110
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,899
Okay.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
A holy war
against the Soviets.

112
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:55,001
<i>A war they say that,
if they get weapons,</i>

113
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:58,802
<i>from us or anyone else
in the free world,
they will win.</i>

114
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,203
<i></i>

115
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,905
Yeah, I'm with
Congressman Charles Wilson
and Crystal Lee.

116
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,605
I wish
he wouldn't do that.
From Texas.

117
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,406
Has there ever been
a show about
Washington?

118
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,907
I don't think there has.
Me, neither.

119
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,607
Thank you. We got the suite
another night. Comped.

120
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,409
Should I go back?
No.

121
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,010
You can't stay
another night?
No. No.

122
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,009
Stay another night.

123
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,410
I can't.
I have a vote.

124
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,711
What, an important one?

125
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,811
Yes.
What is it?

126
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,412
Well, it's a
non-binding resolution

127
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,512
expressing the sense
of the Congress

128
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,714
that the Department
of Defense should continue
to exercise its authority

129
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:31,114
to support
the Boy Scouts
of America.

130
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,316
Are you fucking kidding me?

131
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,516
Come on, Charlie,
call, raise or fold.

132
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:36,817
I want to get an answer
on this thing

133
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:37,818
that Crystal
and I want to do.

134
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,917
First off,
I'd appreciate it

135
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,118
if you didn't throw my name
around quite so much,

136
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,720
'cause, from time to time,
I use it myself, and I need
it in good condition.

137
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,921
Second, I'm
from Lufkin, Texas.

138
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:49,822
I'm the son of an accountant
for a timber company.

139
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:53,722
I take home about
700 bucks a week,
and I pay alimony,

140
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:57,824
so the idea that I got
$29,000 in the bank
is pretty hysterical.

141
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,025
That said,
I love your idea.

142
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,026
Crys, I'll call you
this week.
Okay.

143
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:03,126
All right.

144
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:07,327
Stacey, Kelly,
nice to meet you both.
Are you Nevada residents?

145
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:08,928
Yeah.
Well, don't forget to vote.

146
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,729
Bye. We love you!
We love you!

147
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,930
Oh, it helps not to know me.
Oh! That is for you.

148
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,130
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

149
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,731
Bye!
Bye, Charlie.

150
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,732
I love Las Vegas!

151
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,432
All right, what else?

152
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,833
That Dairy Queen guy,
Larry Liddle,

153
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,334
is sitting
in your office.
Hey.

154
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,934
Yeah, I told him
he could come in.

155
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,834
He wants to talk
to you about a creche.

156
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,835
What, a nativity scene
with baby Jesus?

157
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,136
Yeah, it's on public property,
and the city's making
him move it.

158
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:31,737
Shit. I thought
he was just coming in

159
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,638
to get his picture took,
you know?
Congressman.

160
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:34,939
Yeah?
You're exactly
who I need to speak to.

161
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,038
You have a moment?
Sure.

162
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,939
Tip asked me
to talk to you.
Okay.

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
He wanted me to talk to you
about John Murtha.

164
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,541
Go ahead.
The prosecutor's
gonna go after him.

165
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,041
Well, they ain't
gonna find anything.

166
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,442
John Murtha's as clean
as my mother's kitchen floor.

167
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,843
Yeah, but Tip would
like to put you

168
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,543
on the Ethics Committee
just the same.

169
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,244
You're kidding.
No.

170
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,445
Well, Jesus, Donnelly,
everyone in town knows

171
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,845
I'm on the other side
of that issue.

172
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,046
Ethics?
Yeah!

173
00:06:57,147 --> 00:07:00,047
Well, the Speaker would
like to put you on the
committee anyway.

174
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:03,648
Okay. Well, if anyone asks
what the hell I'm doing
on the Ethics Committee,

175
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,449
we'll just tell them
I like chasing women
and drinking whiskey

176
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,650
and the Speaker felt
we were underrepresented.

177
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,351
One man, one vote.
Exactly.

178
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:11,852
Tip's gonna want
to return the favor.

179
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,852
Tuesday, right?
That is Tuesday, yes.

180
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,453
So if anything comes up
that you'd like me

181
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:16,653
to speak with him
about, please...

182
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:17,754
Yes.

183
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:19,255
Yes!

184
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,456
I'd like to be on
the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

185
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:23,556
Charlie.
I'm sorry?

186
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,657
Turns out Congress appoints
the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

187
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:30,657
It's a great place to take
a date, and I can never
afford the tickets.

188
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,560
Consider it done.
Excellent.

189
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,660
Go vote.

190
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:37,661
Another few minutes.
Let's see what's
on the wires.

191
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,461
Why can't you wait
for newspapers like
everybody else?

192
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,763
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

193
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,363
And it makes me one day
smarter than you,
which I enjoy as well.

194
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,965
I know you do.

195
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,565
You don't think
that's a little crazy?

196
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,765
Pan Am and Eastern
are lowering their fares.

197
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,667
'Cause of Braniff.
What's a little crazy?

198
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,168
Joining the Board
of the Kennedy Center

199
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,167
so you can get free tickets
to the Royal Ballet of...

200
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,368
Hold on.
What?

201
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,169
AP story out of Kabul.

202
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,570
Uzbekistan?

203
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,170
Afghanistan.

204
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:06,471
Russia, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

205
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,372
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

206
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,374
Jim Van Wagenen's
our point man
on black approps

207
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:14,875
for the Defense
Subcommittee?

208
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:15,976
Yeah.

209
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,276
Have him come to my office
as soon as possible.

210
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:19,876
How am I voting on this?
Yes.

211
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:21,077
You sure?
Yes.

212
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:22,578
The Boy Scouts?

213
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:25,278
Jim Van Wagenen.
Get him and show him
that wire story.

214
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,179
Yes, sir.
You are the man
I wanted to talk to.

215
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,380
The Congressman will
be here in a moment.

216
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,181
He's just coming up
from a vote.

217
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,682
I'm sure it's
an important one.

218
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:34,882
No. Not really.

219
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,383
So, Marla, can you
fit this into his schedule
next week?

220
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,184
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

221
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,384
The third...

222
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,685
It is? How are you?

223
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:45,086
Suzanne, can you
help me with this?
Okay.

224
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:46,986
I'll be right back.
I'll have
him do it.

225
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:48,087
Okay, bye-bye.

226
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,488
Miss?
Yes, sir?

227
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:53,888
It seems to me, looking
around, that it's almost
all women working here,

228
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,290
and that they're
all very pretty.

229
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,490
Is that common?

230
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:58,691
Well,

231
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,991
Congressman Wilson,
he has an expression.

232
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:05,793
He says, "You can teach them
to type, but you can't teach
them to grow tits."

233
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,394
Well, that's charming.

234
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,095
Larry!
Congressman!

235
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,995
No, no, no. For $5,000
every two years you get
to call me Charlie.

236
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:16,997
And for 10,000, you can call
me Betty Sue and I'll clean
out your rain gutters.

237
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,098
This is my daughter, Jane.

238
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,399
Well, now I remember Jane.
Two-L at SMU.

239
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,099
Charlie Wilson's office.
Good morning.

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Welcome to the
United States Congress.

241
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
Hey, I'm gonna
talk to your daddy
for a couple of seconds.

242
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,401
Larry, can we
get you a drink?

243
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,702
It's 10:00 in the morning.

244
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,003
Well, fair enough,
I guess.

245
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,303
Grab a seat.

246
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:37,005
Now, this situation
with the creche, I want
to know all about it.

247
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:38,105
Well, sir,

248
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:42,707
Every single year
since the world was young,

249
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:47,308
the firehouse in the
Nacogdoches Township
has displayed a creche.

250
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,810
Now, the ACLU has filed suit
against the township

251
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:54,411
for displaying
a religious symbol
on public property.

252
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,612
It's Christmas time.
It's a creche.

253
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,513
I could understand
if we were in
gosh-darn Scarsdale,

254
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:03,213
but this is east Texas,
and I want to know
who we're offending.

255
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,115
Except two lawyers
from the ACLU.

256
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:08,615
That is a terribly interesting
and complicated question.

257
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,517
Let me make
this suggestion, though.

258
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:13,417
There's a church about
a block and a half

259
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,419
from that firehouse,
First Baptist Church
of Nacogdoches.

260
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,120
They've got
a beautiful rolling lawn
out there in front.

261
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,021
No, no. This
is a Christian
country, Charlie,

262
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,022
founded
on Christian values.
Sure.

263
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,222
We welcome other faiths
to worship as they wish,

264
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,623
but when you can't
put a nativity scene

265
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,824
in front of a firehouse
at Christmas time
in Nacogdoches Township,

266
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,325
something's gone
terribly wrong.

267
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,426
Well, that's not
really true, Larry.

268
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,126
You could move that creche
over to that church

269
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,228
and everything's just fine.

270
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,528
That's not the point!

271
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:42,728
Okay. Why don't
we just start back
at the beginning?

272
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,930
What can I do for you?

273
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,231
You can intervene
in the case against
the creche committee.

274
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,431
Intervene? How?

275
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,031
You appointed the judge.

276
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,432
I don't appoint judges.

277
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,332
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

278
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,433
Uh-huh.

279
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:54,834
I think you and I both know
what that means.

280
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,834
I cannot just call up
a judge and tell him
what to do.

281
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,836
Why?
Well, 'cause
it's against a shitload

282
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:03,137
of really good laws, Gary.

283
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,937
Larry.
Larry.

284
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:10,038
I got to go talk to this guy
out here for a second.
Will you excuse me?

285
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,340
By the way,
I love Jesus Christ

286
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
and his mother Mary
as much as anybody.

287
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,740
About 38 churches you could
move that creche to,
everybody lives.

288
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,942
Give me a call.
Okay.

289
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,243
I love Chivas.

290
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,043
Jane, how are you?

291
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:22,744
You need a cup of coffee?

292
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,145
Something to drink?
Anything like that? Okay.
Mmm-mmm.

293
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:27,045
Jim.
Congressman.

294
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,046
You see Lederer's
AP story out of Kabul?

295
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,547
Yeah.
We're reading this
story every day now.

296
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,647
You see Dan Rather
last night?

297
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,247
Yeah. I did.

298
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:35,548
Tell me something.
What is the Defense
Subcommittee's budget

299
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,749
for covert ops against
the Communists
in Afghanistan?

300
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,050
All in?
All in.

301
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,750
It's 5 million.

302
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,551
Well, they can't
shoot down helicopters
for $5 million, Jim.

303
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:48,953
Though they're trying to.
Which is more than
I can say for us.

304
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,854
Get everybody together
for me, would you?

305
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:52,555
And double it.

306
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,055
Charlie Wilson's office.

307
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:55,856
Okay, I'm sorry, sir?

308
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,257
The covert ops budget.
Double it.

309
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,658
Okay.

310
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,359
This ain't gonna
be much longer, okay?

311
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,760
Here's what
I'm gonna do, Larry.

312
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,862
Charlie Wilson's office.

313
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:17,063
Maybe in about 20 minutes.
He's just going
into a meeting.

314
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,164
Sure.

315
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:21,365
My XO wrote in a report,

316
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:25,865
I was the best officer
he ever served at sea with,

317
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:30,068
and the worst officer
he ever served in port with.

318
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,269
You can look it up.

319
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,869
I must've graduated
from Annapolis

320
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,471
with the second most demerits
of any midshipman

321
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,372
in the history
of the Naval Academy.

322
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,972
Well, who
had the most? I want
to sleep with him.

323
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:43,474
<i></i>

324
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:47,373
It's hotter here in D.C.
Than in Nacogdoches,

325
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,976
so I hope you don't mind,
I took off a few
of my clothes.

326
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:54,277
Well, I'm just gonna have
to live with that, Jane.

327
00:12:54,378 --> 00:13:00,578
<i> Just call me angel
of the morning, angel</i>

328
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,180
<i>Just touch my cheek
before you leave me</i>

329
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,082
Come on over here. I'm gonna
show you the best view
in the District.

330
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,282
You want some of this?

331
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:09,483
No, no, I got this.

332
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:10,884
I like both.

333
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:13,084
Well, it must be
great being me.

334
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,785
I've heard it is.

335
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,986
Iwo Jima Memorial.

336
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:19,586
There's the Lincoln.

337
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,187
Washington. Now follow it
around to the right.

338
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:26,088
The Jefferson Memorial.
The Arlington Bridge.

339
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,090
And there's the Pentagon.

340
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,590
Oh, that's the Pentagon.

341
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:31,791
That's the Pentagon.

342
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:35,792
How about I show you
the second best view
in the District?

343
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,893
Why, Jane, would you like...

344
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,195
Well, that was predictable.

345
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,396
Just give me one second.

346
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:48,497
<i>Hello?
That was an
extraordinary thing</i>

347
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:50,098
<i>you did today.</i>

348
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:51,499
Who is this?

349
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:52,599
<i>It's Joanne.</i>

350
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,199
Joanne!

351
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Why, gosh, how nice
to hear from you.

352
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,101
Could I call you back
in a little bit?

353
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,302
<i>Is Ronald Reagan
in your bedroom
right now?</i>

354
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:03,403
<i>No.
Then I'm considerably
more important</i>

355
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,403
<i>than whoever is.
Is anything wrong?</i>

356
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,204
This is gonna take
just a second or two.

357
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,806
Okay, I'm all yours.

358
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:15,206
What did I do that
was so extraordinary?

359
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,407
<i>"Double it."</i>

360
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,308
'Cause I was told
you didn't have
a girlfriend.

361
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:19,309
What?

362
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,410
<i>You told Jim Van Wagenen
to double it.</i>

363
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,810
Well, shit, Joanne,
I don't know what
you're talking about,

364
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:27,212
and if I did,
it'd be classified,

365
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:29,012
and I'd wonder
where you got
your information

366
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:30,013
on the Subcommittee.

367
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,413
<i>Oh, what do you care, hon?</i>

368
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:35,213
It's a little matter
of national security
and I can't help but think...

369
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,415
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

370
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,015
Hold on.
I am sorry,

371
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,116
but I was told
you didn't have
a girlfriend.

372
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,617
I don't.
This isn't my girlfriend.

373
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:45,218
It's the sixth
wealthiest woman in Texas.

374
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,019
Which is still pretty good.

375
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
Okay, so, hi.

376
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,020
<i>A friend of mine has
made a terrific movie
about the need</i>

377
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:53,221
<i>for American aid
to Afghanistan.</i>

378
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,822
<i>He's made a movie?
Yes.</i>

379
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:58,822
<i>I'm gonna run this movie
Friday night at my house
at a fundraiser.</i>

380
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,124
<i>You know, you've never
been to my house, Charlie.</i>

381
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:04,124
You want me to come
to Houston and see
a movie?

382
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:07,326
<i>There'll be women
and wealthy donors.
See you Friday.</i>

383
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,727
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,130
Hey.

385
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,230
Mmm-mmm.

386
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,330
Hey.
Mmm-mmm.

387
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,933
Thank you, Joanne.

388
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,035
Okay. I know it was difficult
for you to come in here,
hat in hand.

389
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:35,135
That's not the kind
of upbringing, I guess,
is the word I'm looking for.

390
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:38,037
It's not the kind of man
you are. I understand that.

391
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,238
I'm not looking to humiliate
you or exact a price
in any way,

392
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,239
so why don't you
just apologize?

393
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,840
We'll call it water under
the dam, and we'll go
about our business.

394
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Excuse me,
what the fuck?

395
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,842
What?
What the fuck
are you talking about?

396
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,843
Clair George said you
were coming in here
to apologize.

397
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:55,443
No, I'm supposed to come
in here so you could
apologize to me.

398
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,245
According to whom?
Clair George.

399
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:00,345
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize
to you?

400
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:03,446
Also, water goes over
a dam and under a bridge,
you poncy schoolboy.

401
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,847
Clearly there's been
a miscommunication between
Clair George and somebody.

402
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,149
Excuse me.
Yes?

403
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,449
Does this look all right?
It's fine.

404
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,649
Thank you.
I can sand it
down a little.

405
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,950
I, I don't know.
I have no fucking idea
who this guy is.

406
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,751
He is here to fix the glass
that you broke the last time
you were here.

407
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:18,252
Could you just excuse us
for a second there?
Yes.

408
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,353
You tell me to go
fuck myself

409
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,053
and I'm supposed
to apologize?
You break my window,

410
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:22,954
I'm supposed to apologize?
The Helsinki job was mine!

411
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,655
The Helsinki job was not
yours. If it was yours,
you'd be in Helsinki.

412
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,155
Alan Wolfe stood
in this office!
Alan Wolfe

413
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:28,756
is no longer the Director.
Yeah, it was on the books!

414
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,657
Alan Wolfe is no
longer the Director
of European Operations.

415
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,057
He does not make
those appointments. I do.

416
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,858
Promises were made.
Not by me.

417
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,259
I've been with
the company for 24 years.

418
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,259
I was posted
in Greece for 15.

419
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:43,061
Papandreou wins that election
if I don't help the junta
take him prisoner.

420
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:45,062
I've advised and armed
the Hellenic army.

421
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:47,063
I've neutralized
champions of Communism.

422
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:50,464
I've spent the past
three years learning
Finnish!

423
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,465
Which should come in handy
here in Virginia!

424
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,466
And I'm never,
ever, sick at sea.

425
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:57,966
So I want to know
why I'm not gonna be
your Helsinki station chief.

426
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,868
You're coarse.
Excuse me?

427
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,468
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

428
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:03,769
You don't have them.
Is that right?

429
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,870
That is right. And I
don't know why the hell
I didn't fire you

430
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,070
when you broke
my fucking window!

431
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,971
Oh, yes, sure
you do, Cravely.

432
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,172
Look, Gust...
Yeah, you're fucking
Roger's fiancee

433
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:12,572
and you know I know.

434
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:16,373
I'm not... I'm not even
gonna dignify that with
a response.

435
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:18,374
Yeah, yeah, you're
dignifying her in the ass

436
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,375
at the Jefferson Hotel,
room 1210.

437
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,276
But let me ask you.
The 3,000 agents
Turner fired

438
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,576
was that because they lacked
diplomatic skills as well?

439
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,478
You're referring
to Admiral Stansfield Turner?

440
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:28,678
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

441
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,678
Each and every goddamn one
of them first or second
generation Americans.

442
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,180
Is that because they lack
the proper diplomatic skills?

443
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,780
Or did Turner not
think it was a good idea
to have spies

444
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:40,182
who could speak the
same language as the people
they're fucking spying on?

445
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:42,783
Well, I'm sorry,
but you can hardly
blame the Director

446
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:45,784
for questioning the loyalty
to America of people that
are just barely Americans

447
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:47,885
in the first place.
Yeah, well, I'd like
to take a moment

448
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,586
to review the several ways
in which you're a douchebag.

449
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,687
Get the fuck
out of my office!
Yes, sir.

450
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,087
Before I end
your career, asshole.

451
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:54,188
Yes, sir!

452
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,388
Yeah, my friend,
I'm gonna need
you for a second.

453
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,690
God damn it!

454
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:02,491
My loyalty?

455
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,991
For 24 years,
people have been
trying to kill me.

456
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:07,393
People who know how.

457
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:10,492
Now, do you think that's
because my dad was
a Greek soda pop maker

458
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:12,994
or do you think that's
because I'm an American spy?

459
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:15,594
Go fuck yourself,
you fucking child.

460
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,098
How was I?

461
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,199
Thank you.

462
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,700
There's a woman in
Aliquippa, Pennsylvania,
named Nitsa.

463
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,001
And she thinks
she's a witch.

464
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:34,502
Yeah, she offered
to put a curse on
Cravely for me.

465
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,603
Yeah?

466
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,003
And she...

467
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:41,404
She asked me do I want
a professional curse
or a health curse.

468
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,605
"If it's a health curse,
I can do it right away,

469
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,406
"but a professional curse
takes longer."

470
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,508
Well, I'm living proof
she's right about that.

471
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,909
Did you get the brownie?
Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

472
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,310
I got you.

473
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,610
I'm reading transcripts
of phone conversations

474
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:00,311
between French
and German generals

475
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:03,812
arguing over office space
at NATO headquarters

476
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:07,614
and analyzing wiretaps
out of Mercury Bay,
New Zealand.

477
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,315
You know,
historically, a hotbed
of anti-American activity.

478
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:15,116
Yeah, nobody will come
near me. I'm in the weeds.

479
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,618
You know,
a typical case officer

480
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,619
doesn't walk into his
boss's office and tell him
to go fuck himself. Twice.

481
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,421
I just told you,
I paid a witch in
Pennsylvania $80

482
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:29,222
to put a curse
on Henry Cravely for me.

483
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:31,923
Do I sound like
a typical case officer?
No.

484
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:34,724
Well, then,
let's assume I'm not.

485
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,025
Listen. If you're really
not doing anything,

486
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,626
why don't you come upstairs
and work with us?

487
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:39,826
What are you doing?

488
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,327
Killing Russians.

489
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:46,928
<i>Our next slave girl
is a Texas rose named
Ashley Rensler.</i>

490
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,830
<i>Ashley is prelaw at U. T.,
and her three sorority sisters</i>

491
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,931
<i>from Delta Delta Delta
will wash your car
or truck</i>

492
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,132
<i>in special outfits
they have chosen
for the occasion.</i>

493
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:02,734
<i>So, who wants their wheels
cleaned clean as a whistle
by a 19-year-old lawyer</i>

494
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,935
<i>and her three friends

495
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:08,937

11, 11, I got 11.</i>

496
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:10,937
<i>I got 15 right here.
Thank you very much.</i>

497
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,238
Oh, my God,
she is a Minute Woman.

498
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,139
No, she's a Tri-Delt.

499
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,940
No, she is a
Minute Woman, Charlie.

500
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,240
Oh. Joanne.

501
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:23,141
Yeah, she's
a direct descendant of
George Washington's sister.

502
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:26,043
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

503
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:29,144
Former Miss Cotton Bowl.
Had her own local
television talk show.

504
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:32,444
Look. Pakistan's
Honorary Consul
to Houston, Texas.

505
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:33,946
How's that
for a title, huh?

506
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,147
This is
an ultra-right wing group
of anti-Communist fanatics.

507
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,748
They're not
ultra-right wing.

508
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:40,549
What are they?

509
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,349
Well, they're
ultra-right wing.

510
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,850
What are you doing
hanging around
this woman?

511
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,551
Did you hear me say
she was a former
Miss Cotton Bowl?

512
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:49,852
You are unbelievable.

513
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,053
Oh, come on.
You're gonna love her.

514
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:53,053
And, you know, one of
the things she's trying
to do over there

515
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,653
is liberate the women.

516
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,554
And what better
way than through
a slave girl auction?

517
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,855
Charlie.

518
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:04,057
So sorry for keeping
you waiting.

519
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,157
Oh, it's no problem,
Joanne.

520
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,759
This is Bonnie Bach.

521
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,659
So nice to meet you.

522
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:17,161
It's a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Herring. This is
a wonderful party.

523
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:20,963
Why don't you
give us a few moments?

524
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:23,364
Yes, sir.

525
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:28,765
Oh, Bobbie, if you could
ask someone for a Bombay
martini up, very dry?

526
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,867
Oh, I'm not
a slave girl,
actually.

527
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,168
I'm the Congressman's
administrative assistant.

528
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,568
Isn't that wonderful
for you.

529
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,869
Yes.

530
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,770
Two olives, please.
Tell them it's for me,
they'll know.

531
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,170
Certainly.

532
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,772
She doesn't like me.

533
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:44,972
Everybody likes you.

534
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,473
She's a liberal.

535
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,273
Well, I'm a liberal.

536
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,574
Not where it counts.

537
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,375
Have you seen the house?

538
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:55,576
Well, I've seen
the downstairs,
what's upstairs?

539
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:56,976
Fourteen bedrooms.

540
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:58,477
I should have a look.

541
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,578
What did you think
of the movie?

542
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,278
What, that thing
we just saw?

543
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:03,478
The reason
for the party, yes.

544
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,280
Well, I'm not an expert
in the field or anything,

545
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,180
but the production quality
seemed amateurish to me.

546
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,782
Yeah, I'm not
submitting the thing

547
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:13,083
for a Golden Globe
nomination, Charlie.

548
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,383
You know what
I'm talking about.

549
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:18,084
Well, as a member
of the Defense Subcommittee,

550
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:19,485
did you think
I wasn't aware

551
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:21,785
that the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

552
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,787
Yes, I believe
my government is aware,

553
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,387
but I was wondering
if they were thinking
of doing anything about it

554
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,588
other than boycotting
the Olympics, which
I think you'll agree,

555
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,289
was a fairly
impotent response

556
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,490
to the greatest
national security
threat we've faced

557
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:34,991
since the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

558
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:38,191
Well, I don't think making
more movies about it
is gonna do the trick,

559
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,892
if that's what
you're asking.

560
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,192
It's not.

561
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,194
Exactly how much power
do you have as a member
of the Subcommittee?

562
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:46,795
Which one? I'm on two.

563
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:47,995
Foreign Ops.

564
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,196
Eight members and myself
hand out 11 billion
in foreign assistance.

565
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,597
And what about
the Defense Subcommittee?

566
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:54,698
Our budget is hidden.

567
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:56,098
It is also unlimited.

568
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,699
Yeah.

569
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,300
Would you like
to see my room?

570
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:02,501
Yeah.

571
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:07,701
So, unless I'm wrong,
and that would be
unusual for me,

572
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,603
you sit at the intersection
of the State Department,

573
00:23:10,704 --> 00:23:12,704
the Pentagon and the CIA.

574
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:16,105
You meet in a soundproof room
underneath the Capitol,

575
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:19,606
and you preside over
a secret and unlimited
budget

576
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:23,307
for the three agencies
you would need to conduct
a covert war.

577
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,009
Isn't that right?

578
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,310
I also have seats
at the Kennedy Center.

579
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,710
Isn't that how you were able
to double the CIA budget
for black approps

580
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,211
in Afghanistan
just by saying so?

581
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:36,912
Why are you only asking me
questions you already
know the answers to?

582
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,813
Why is Congress
saying one thing
and doing nothing?

583
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,815
Well, tradition mostly.

584
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,517
Come here.

585
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:51,218
Okay.

586
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:04,422
I do not understand
the energy women
have after sex.

587
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:07,324
You're dancing around,
you're baking a pie.

588
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,325
Charlie?
Yes, ma'am?

589
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:12,526
Why is the CIA running
a fake war in Afghanistan?

590
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,627
They're doing
everything they can.

591
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,528
They're doing it badly.

592
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:19,128
The CIA is arming
the mujahideen.

593
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:20,429
Where do you think
they're getting
their weapons?

594
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,830
They're arming them
with 12.7 millimeter
Dishukas

595
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,531
which would be good,

596
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,732
except the Soviets have
specifically armor-plated
their Hind helicopter

597
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,733
to resist
a 12.7 millimeter shell.

598
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,034
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

599
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:37,734
<i>but didn't give them
the look-downlshoot-down
radar.</i>

600
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:38,936
If this were a real war,

601
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,336
State would issue
a white paper outlining
the Communist threat

602
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,637
the way they did
in El Salvador.

603
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:47,539
If this were a real war,
there'd be a National
Bipartisan Commission

604
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,240
on Afghanistan, headed
by Henry Kissinger the way
they did in Central America.

605
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:56,541
If this were a real war,
Congress would authorize
$24 million

606
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,843
for covert operations
the way you did in Nicaragua.

607
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,245
If this were a real war...

608
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:05,345
You may be
the sexiest woman ever.

609
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:07,846
I'm not kidding.
You are Helen of Troy.

610
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:09,147
Are you patronizing me?

611
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:11,647
What do you want me
to do, Joanne?

612
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:13,749
This is what
I want you to do.

613
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,949
I want you to save Afghanistan
for the Afghans.

614
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,451
I want you to deliver
such a crushing defeat

615
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,251
to the Soviets
that Communism crumbles,

616
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,652
and in so doing,
end the Cold War.

617
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:24,853
I'll tell you,
I'd do it, too,

618
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,453
but I got this
Dairy Queen problem
in Nacogdoches.

619
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:31,454
Don't underestimate me,
Charlie. Believe everything
you've heard.

620
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:34,056
What exactly
do you want me to do?

621
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,557
Go to Pakistan
and meet with Zia.

622
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:36,758
Zia?

623
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:39,058
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

624
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,159
He's the President
of Pakistan.

625
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,760
I've already arranged it.

626
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,760
You've arranged a meeting
between me and the
President of Pakistan?

627
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:46,761
Yes.

628
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,062
You're going
to Israel next week

629
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:49,962
to meet with Zvi Rafiah
about the Lavi jets.

630
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:52,963
I want you to tack Pakistan
on the end of your trip.

631
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:54,163
And meet
with the President?

632
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:57,464
Let him convince you
that it's a Christian
imperative

633
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:00,666
to let the Afghans
rid their country
of Communism.

634
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:05,367
Okay. It's not likely
the President of Pakistan
is a Christian,

635
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:08,068
but I'm gonna do this
for you, Joanne,

636
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,869
'cause you saved my ass
once with the pro-lifers

637
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,170
and I owe you my seat
in Congress and because
you look very good naked.

638
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:19,272
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

639
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:21,774
How many Jews do you have
in your district?

640
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:22,874
Seven.

641
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:25,075
But congressmen aren't
elected by voters,

642
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,476
they're elected
by contributors,

643
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,576
and mine are in,
well, New York,
Florida, Hollywood,

644
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:32,077
because I'm one
of Israel's guys
on the Hill.

645
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:33,379
And I don't know
how they're gonna feel

646
00:26:33,478 --> 00:26:35,978
about me taking up
the cause of Muslims.

647
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,380
Well, that's
your problem.

648
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,780
Yes, it is.

649
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
Go fight this war
and win it, Charlie.

650
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:44,481
Everything possible is
on the line, including
your manhood.

651
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:47,382
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

652
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,484
Well, I guess it ain't
gonna be twice tonight.

653
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:55,086
Well, I guess
somebody can't count.

654
00:26:55,186 --> 00:26:57,686
Oh, darling,
I was talking about me.

655
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:08,713
Congressman Charlie Wilson.

656
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:09,814
Mr. Congressman.

657
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,514
Mr. President.

658
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,416
Yeah.

659
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:17,916
Joanne Herring speaks
very highly of you.

660
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:20,517
Oh, well, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

661
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,417
These are two
of my brightest advisors

662
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:25,418
when it comes
to the problem
of the Soviets.

663
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,719
This is Brigadier Rashid.

664
00:28:28,721 --> 00:28:29,821
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

665
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,221
Colonel Mahmood.
How do you do?

666
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:32,822
Pleased to meet you.

667
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:33,822
Please come.

668
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:35,123
Thank you.

669
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:40,324
You must be thirsty.
Can we get you a drink?

670
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:44,225
Oh, actually I'd love
a glass of ice and
any kind of whiskey.

671
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:45,926
Rye, Canadian.

672
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,028
Uh...

673
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,028
I'm sorry, Congressman,
we don't have alcohol

674
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,330
in the Presidential Residence.

675
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,230
Of course, you don't.
I apologize.

676
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,432
Fruit juice?

677
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,334
Bet a lot of people
make that mistake.

678
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:07,835
No.

679
00:29:08,535 --> 00:29:09,535
Okay.

680
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:10,636
Brigadier?

681
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:14,537
So you understand
the situation on
our border?

682
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,438
Yes, sir, I think I do.
And I think it's terrible.

683
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,239
And I know I speak for
all the people in the Texas
Second Congressional District

684
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,841
when I say our thoughts
and our prayers
are with you.

685
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:27,441
All the people
of the Texas Second
Congressional District,

686
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:28,943
you say?
Yes, indeed, sir.

687
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:33,043
Three million Afghan refugees
are living like poorly
treated livestock.

688
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:34,845
Another two million
have fled into Iran.

689
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,345
And two million
more angry men

690
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,446
is just what the doctors
ordered for Iran,
don't you think?

691
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:41,147
People are dying
by the tens of thousands.

692
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:44,247
And the ones that aren't
are crossing into Pakistan
every day.

693
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,749
Would you like
to know how many?

694
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:47,649
One fifth of Afghanistan
now lives

695
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,350
in Pakistan's
North-West Frontier Province.

696
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,351
So, what I have
been wondering is

697
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:55,651
why your State Department
would send someone here

698
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,953
who thinks
he understands
the problem.

699
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:01,453
'Cause I don't think
the prayers of the Texas
Second Congressional District

700
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:02,955
are going to turn
the trick.

701
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:06,055
Well, now, I wasn't sent here
by the State Department,
Mr. President.

702
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:08,057
I was asked to come here
by our friend in Houston.

703
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:10,357
So this is
a courtesy call.

704
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,258
I don't need courtesy.
I need airplanes,
guns and money.

705
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,059
Well, we just doubled
the CIA budget
for covert ops...

706
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:20,562
From 5 million
to 10 million.

707
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:22,662
That's right.
Is that a joke?

708
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:26,063
No.
Is that meant
to be a funny joke?

709
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:27,164
No, sir.

710
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,964
Congressman,
what they're saying is

711
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:32,765
$10 million from the U.S.
To fight the Russian Army

712
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,466
is such a low figure
that it can be mistaken
for a joke.

713
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,267
I caught up to the
sarcasm there, sir.
Let me be clear.

714
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,470
The United States is
eager to assist you.

715
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,570
No, you're not.
You're not.

716
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,371
Absolutely not.
I went to Oxford

717
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:47,672
and I know what
that word means.

718
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:49,972
The U.S. Is not eager
to assist us.

719
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:52,973
Well, now it's
my understanding that we
offered to sell you F-16s.

720
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:53,974
You didn't want them.

721
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,774
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

722
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,075
So to hell with that.

723
00:30:57,175 --> 00:31:00,475
And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

724
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:02,076
when it comes
to fighting the Soviets.

725
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:05,077
To hell with it!
You sell us the planes
but not the radar.

726
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:08,278
You offer Afghans rifles
from the First World War

727
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,980
while Soviet helicopters
are killing everything
they can find,

728
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,681
people, animals,
food supplies.
So to hell with it!

729
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:17,082
Yeah.
You sell
the Israelis the radar,

730
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:19,082
so that's why he says,
"To hell with it."

731
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:21,283
Again, I understood. Yeah.

732
00:31:21,485 --> 00:31:24,985
Also, the arms and funding
should flow through us.

733
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,087
I'm sorry?

734
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,886
That's been part
of the problem.

735
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,487
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

736
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:35,189
We have experience
with warfare of this kind.

737
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:38,189
And your CIA has
an unimpressive
track record.

738
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,391
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

739
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:44,391
They missed 130,000
Soviet soldiers walking
into Afghanistan.

740
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,093
Okay, we blew that call.

741
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:48,694
I would say so.

742
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:58,695
Well, I don't want
to use up any more
of your hospitality,

743
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,598
so I will take
your message back
to my committee chairman,

744
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,500
and we will give it
our fullest attention.

745
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,801
Let me walk you
to the door.

746
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:16,303
I learned about you
before you came here.

747
00:32:16,404 --> 00:32:19,704
I learned that you're a man
of many character flaws.

748
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,005
I am.

749
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,206
But I also learned
that you never
promise anything

750
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,007
you cannot deliver.

751
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,907
No, I don't,
Mr. President.

752
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,408
Then promise me this.

753
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:31,609
Go to Peshawar
and see the refugee camps.

754
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,610
Right now. Today.

755
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,911
Go to Peshawar and see
with your own eyes.

756
00:32:37,012 --> 00:32:39,812
I have a helicopter
waiting to take you.

757
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:42,514
All right, I'll do it.

758
00:32:42,814 --> 00:32:44,314
Thank you,
Mr. Congressman.

759
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:45,715
Mr. President.

760
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,317
All right, you,
come on.

761
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,819
How did it go?

762
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:58,219
Well, there were
three of them.

763
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,420
It was like getting slapped
around by a Pakistani
vaudeville team.

764
00:33:01,421 --> 00:33:02,821
You know
you've pretty much
hit rock bottom

765
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:04,522
when you've been told
you have character flaws
by a man

766
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:07,622
who hanged his predecessor
in a military coup.

767
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:08,723
Can we go home now?

768
00:33:08,724 --> 00:33:11,424
No. No, we have
to make one more stop.

769
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,067
I've seen enough.

770
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:16,169
About 350 people
in three small villages
at Kandahar.

771
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,270
But instead of doing
it all at once,

772
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,772
the Russians would
make the parents watch

773
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,372
as they slit
the throats
of the children.

774
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:34,574
So, the Russians
gathered all the defectors
and piled them like wood

775
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:36,877
in the center
of the village.

776
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:39,778
Then they ran over them
with their tanks.

777
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,280
I saw
something shiny on the ground.
I thought it was a toy.

778
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:52,083
When I reached down
to grab it, it exploded
in my hand.

779
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,384
I should have known.

780
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:59,485
Because last year
my little brother tried
to pick up a piece of candy.

781
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,887
It split him in half.

782
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:07,288
It takes more work to take
care of a wounded child
than a dead one.

783
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:10,189
So when the Russians
cover fields with toy mines,

784
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,490
adults who might help
with the war effort have
to take care of the children.

785
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:16,792
You can see yourself.

786
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:18,893
Like a bug.

787
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,795
They're beautiful.

788
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,896
How many children
do you have?

789
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,599
She had six.

790
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,800
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

791
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:26,116
Hi. I have Congressman Wilson
here to see the station
chief, Harold Holt.

792
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,818
Down the hall.
Second door on the left.

793
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,120
I'll wait outside.

794
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,320
Look, normally,
a congressional delegation,

795
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,821
we'd give them a courtesy
briefing on the situation,
but as you can see,

796
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,222
it's getting pretty late,
we don't have a whole lot
of time anyway, so...

797
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,024
Well, make the time.
Huh?

798
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:46,624
Fuck your time, Harold.
I'm on Defense Appropriations.

799
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:49,626
I'm catching a plane
back to Washington
in just a few minutes.

800
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:52,826
Now, I need a full
classified briefing
right now.

801
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,429
Hundred and twenty thousand
Soviet troops in all.

802
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,430
Hundred and twenty thousand?

803
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,730
40th Army is garrisoned
in the cities

804
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:02,931
and in the airports.

805
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,632
Your seventh and eighth
infantry divisions
are in Kabul.

806
00:38:05,732 --> 00:38:08,532
The 18th in Mazar-e Sharif,
the fourth armored...

807
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:09,534
Anything inside?

808
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:10,734
I'm sorry?

809
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,434
They controlling
anything inside?

810
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:14,135
Soviet advisors
have appropriated

811
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:16,336
the Afghan intel service
and the ministries.

812
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:17,936
Which ministries?

813
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:19,337
All of them.

814
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:23,938
Anyway, the fourth armored
covers Bagram Airbase.

815
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,239
Seventh Armored is...

816
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,140
Why ain't they shooting down
them helicopters?

817
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm sorry?

818
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,141
The helicopters, Harold.

819
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,642
Why ain't we giving them
something to shoot down
them helicopters?

820
00:38:34,743 --> 00:38:38,243
The helicopters
are a problem.

821
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:41,445
You think?

822
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:44,546
Congressman...
They're shooting
at Soviet gunships

823
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:48,347
with Enfield rifles.
That's basically what
Davy Crockett used.

824
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:51,248
The Soviet Hind gunship
is especially armor plated
to resist bullets.

825
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,249
Yeah, I know, I know.
So you tell me what you
need to shoot them down.

826
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:56,351
What do you mean?

827
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:58,151
Tell me what you need.

828
00:38:59,452 --> 00:39:00,552
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

829
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:04,453
You tell me what you need,
and I will go about
getting it for you.

830
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:06,854
Congressman, I appreciate
your generosity,

831
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:11,755
but a sudden influx of money
and modern weaponry
would draw attention.

832
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:15,258
What?
A sudden influx
of money and modern...

833
00:39:15,258 --> 00:39:17,358
Wait, it would
draw attention?

834
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,459
Yeah.

835
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,959
Why, I don't even know
what that means.

836
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,761
This is the Cold War.
Everybody knows about it.

837
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,962
Should I continue
with the briefing?

838
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:29,061
Have you been to these
refugee camps? Have you
heard these stories?

839
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:32,363
Congressman, I am required
to give you a briefing.

840
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:34,464
Should I continue?

841
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:36,266
No. Thank you.

842
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:54,971
You know, I had a neighbor,
growing up, with a name
right out of Dickens.

843
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:58,273
Mr. Charles Hazard.

844
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:02,774
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighborhood dogs

845
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,976
messing up his flower beds.

846
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:07,376
One day, I heard
a bunch of yelling
from across the street,

847
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:08,877
so I ran on over
to Mr. Hazard's,

848
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,678
and there were about
15 grown-ups standing
around my dog, Teddy,

849
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:16,679
who was writhing
on the ground
in obvious agony.

850
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,081
Blood was pouring
out of his mouth.

851
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,482
Mr. Hazard had
ground up a glass bottle

852
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:24,782
and put it in a bowl
of dog food and
fed it to him.

853
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:28,085
What did you do?

854
00:40:28,685 --> 00:40:31,785
Well, I got some gasoline
and burned down
his flower beds.

855
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,287
But that wasn't
satisfying enough.

856
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:39,087
And then I remembered,
Mr. Hazard was
an elected official.

857
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,488
He was the head
of the town council.

858
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,390
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

859
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,890
So come Election Day,
I drove over to
the black section of town.

860
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:52,293
Now, these people
hadn't voted in any of
these elections, so...

861
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:55,294
I was only 13,
but I had a farmer's license

862
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:58,295
and I filled up my car
with black voters

863
00:40:58,396 --> 00:40:59,596
and drove them
to the polling place

864
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:00,997
and then waited,
then drove them on home.

865
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:04,096
But before they got out
of the car to vote

866
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:09,198
I said, "I don't
mean to influence you,
but I think you should know

867
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,900
"Mr. Charles Hazard
has intentionally
killed my dog."

868
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:18,002
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

869
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,703
I drove 96 of them
to the polls.

870
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,905
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

871
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:31,007
And that's the day
I fell in love
with America.

872
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,310
What time do we land?

873
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,010
7:30 a.m. In D.C.

874
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,311
I want the CIA
in my office
at 10:00.

875
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,612
Assistant Deputy Director
or higher.

876
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:48,714
Tell them that if
I don't see someone
at 10:00,

877
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:53,714
I'm gonna start docking
their allowance at a rate
of $1 million a minute.

878
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,216
Yes, sir.

879
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:56,917
And get me another
one of them, would you?

880
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,218
Yes, sir.

881
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
The AKs,
RPG-7 grenade launchers

882
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,120
and 82 millimeter mortars
are coming into Pakistan
by air and sea,

883
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,022
and then trucks take them
to the Afghan border.

884
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:12,022
Then we take them
across on mules,

885
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:13,723
which are running
a little more than
we thought.

886
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,524
The mules?
They're 2,400 a piece,

887
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:17,524
plus we got to get them
checked out.
For what?

888
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,925
Diseases. Foot and mouth.
Plus they have to have
their ears cleaned.

889
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:23,326
The mules are getting
better health care
than the Afghans.

890
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:26,727
Plus, they're
gonna cost a little extra
if we want them pre-trained.

891
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:28,328
To do what?
Walk over a mountain

892
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:29,529
with ammunition
on their back.

893
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:30,929
Aren't they born
with that instinct?

894
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,630
I mean, isn't that
something they want
to do naturally?

895
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:36,931
You think Afghanistan might,
one day, think about building
some fucking roads?

896
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:38,833
Gust.
Yeah?

897
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,833
I got something for you.

898
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,234
I need you
to be specific...

899
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,734
The whole thing
has changed. Get your diary.
I'll show you.

900
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:46,935
Okay.

901
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:50,137
No problem.
Thank you.

902
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:52,837
He should be here
any moment.

903
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:55,538
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

904
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,739
Good morning.
Good morning, Congressman.

905
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,440
Welcome back.
Yeah. Marla.

906
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,940
Welcome back.
Suzanne.

907
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,541
Welcome back.

908
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:05,843
Who are you?

909
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:07,142
This is Gust Avrakotos.

910
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:08,943
He's come up from Langley
to bring you the information

911
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,044
that you wanted.
Bonnie!

912
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:12,545
Yes, sir?

913
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:14,245
I said Assistant Deputy
Director or higher.

914
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:16,146
I know, sir. I called...
No, Assistant Deputies
don't come

915
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:17,347
to the Hill
without a subpoena.

916
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:20,146
I'm the guy you want
to talk to, Congressman.
I'm on the Afghan desk.

917
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:22,148
You're on
the Afghan desk?
Yeah.

918
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,749
Well, I wouldn't be
too proud of that. I just
got back from there.

919
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,150
Oh, I know.
And that's a hell
of a flight, too.

920
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,051
That nine hours flying time
against the jet stream.

921
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,251
Probably had to stop
in Brussels, plus the
time difference.

922
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:32,652
I'd be a little grumpy
myself.

923
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:34,353
I ain't grumpy
because of the plane.

924
00:43:35,453 --> 00:43:38,653
We want to give you this
'cause we know you
like single malt.

925
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:40,155
It's called Talisker,

926
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,255
and it's mentioned in a
Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

927
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,156
<i>The Scotsman's Return
from Abroad.</i>

928
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:46,057
"The king o' drinks,
as I conceive it,

929
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,657
"Talisker, Isla
or Glenlivet!"

930
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:51,158
Who are you again?
Gust Avrakotos.

931
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,060
Have Bonnie come
into this meeting.

932
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,660
Yes, sir.

933
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:58,062
What's the gift for?

934
00:43:58,162 --> 00:44:01,062
It's from the Afghan desk
for doubling the budget
for the mujahideen.

935
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:03,863
Oh. Well, thank you.

936
00:44:04,464 --> 00:44:05,964
It was nothing.

937
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:08,765
Well, it's a nice
bottle of Scotch.

938
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,566
Must've been hard to get.

939
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:12,466
No, doubling
the budget was nothing.

940
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:15,567
I mean, $10 million
for covert ops against the
Russian Army is meaningless.

941
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:18,068
What are you, an infant?
Now, you hang
on just one second.

942
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:19,169
I don't remember your name.

943
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,570
Gust Avrakotos.

944
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,670
Gust Avrakotos.

945
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,670
Yeah.

946
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:24,471
Okay, you mind
if I call you Gus?

947
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:26,972
Yeah, well, my name's Gust
with a "t," but I don't care.

948
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:32,472
Fifteen hours ago, I offered
Harold Holt the keys
to the safe, okay?

949
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:37,575
I stood there in the office
in Islamabad, and I said,
"How much do you need?"

950
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,176
And I was apparently
annoying him.

951
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,977
Well, Harold Holt's
a massive tool, Congressman.
He's a cake-eater.

952
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:43,778
He's a clown.
He's a bad station chief.

953
00:44:43,878 --> 00:44:46,878
And I don't mean to cast
aspersions on a guy, but
he's gonna get us all killed.

954
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,180
Really?
Yeah.

955
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,080
Well, how does he expect
to defeat the Soviets in
Afghanistan without...

956
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,281
He said, "A sudden
influx of money..."
Yeah, an influx of money

957
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,683
and new weaponry
would draw attention.

958
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,282
He's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

959
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:58,384
What the hell
are you talking about?

960
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:01,784
Excuse me.

961
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:04,586
I'm the Congressman's
aide, Bonnie Bach.

962
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:05,887
Gust Avrakotos.

963
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:07,586
Gus, I need the room
for a second.

964
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,387
Sure.
Jailbait!

965
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:15,689
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
Whoa, all right.

966
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:16,991
Just tell me
what's happening.

967
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,290
A Justice Department
task force that was
formed last year

968
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,592
to investigate
reports of sex between
members of the House

969
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,593
and their male interns
has recently widened

970
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:25,393
to include the use
of recreational drugs

971
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:27,394
by senators and congressmen.

972
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:28,795
Do you know a man
named Paul Brown?

973
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:29,995
He doesn't
have to answer that.
Keep going.

974
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:31,096
Oh, shit.

975
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:34,896
Paul Brown, under
investigation by federal
prosecutors for fraud.

976
00:45:35,698 --> 00:45:38,598
He wanted me to invest
in some TV show for Crystal.

977
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:40,999
Well, he's saying
he witnessed you
doing cocaine nine times

978
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,100
in a fantasy suite
in Las Vegas.

979
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,801
Brian Ross at NBC is
breaking the story.

980
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:49,901
All right, guys. I was
in Las Vegas with Crystal
and Paul Brown,

981
00:45:50,003 --> 00:45:52,303
because she wanted me
to talk to him about
this thing.

982
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,004
There was cocaine?

983
00:45:55,105 --> 00:45:57,205
I want you to go
in the other room
and start on a statement.

984
00:45:57,305 --> 00:45:58,805
Let's get Stu on the phone.
Okay, I'll call him.

985
00:45:58,906 --> 00:45:59,906
Okay, Bait,
you just need to start...

986
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,007
It's all right,
everybody.

987
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:02,607
It's gonna be all right.
I want to get back to...

988
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:03,707
Gus!

989
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,609
You having problems?

990
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:08,909
No.

991
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,610
What do you mean,
he's not trying to
defeat the Soviets?

992
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,311
Well, he wants to bleed them.
Payback for Vietnam.

993
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:15,912
Make it so they just have
to keep sending troops in,

994
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,312
keep sending money,
and troops, and money

995
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:19,313
until they just go out
of their fucking minds
the way we did.

996
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:22,013
You mean to tell me
that the U.S. Strategy
in Afghanistan

997
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,115
is to have the Afghans
keep walking into
machine gun fire

998
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,316
till the Russians
run out of bullets?

999
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,516
That's Harold Holt's
strategy.

1000
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:28,416
It's not U.S. Strategy.
What is U.S. Strategy?

1001
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:29,917
Well, strictly speaking,
we don't have one.

1002
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:31,118
But we're working
hard on that.

1003
00:46:31,218 --> 00:46:32,618
Who's we?
Me and three other guys.

1004
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:36,119
Would you excuse me?

1005
00:46:40,922 --> 00:46:41,922
All right,
what do you have?

1006
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:45,322
"Representative Charles Wilson
has learned he is joining
several members of Congress

1007
00:46:45,323 --> 00:46:48,223
"who are under investigation
by a Justice Department
task force that is..."

1008
00:46:48,324 --> 00:46:49,524
Don't say task force.
It makes it sound

1009
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:50,925
like Eliot Ness
is running the thing.
Okay.

1010
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:53,525
Who is running the thing?
Who's the prosecutor?

1011
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:55,326
Rudolph Giuliani,
New York, Southern District.

1012
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:57,027
You know him?
No.

1013
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:59,228
Well, it's been going
on forever. We should
say that, too.

1014
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:02,328
"Representative Charles Wilson
has learned he is joining
several members of Congress

1015
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,730
"who are under investigation
by the Justice Department

1016
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,530
"in what is now
an 18-month long,
wide-ranging examination

1017
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,532
"that has resulted
in no convictions."

1018
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,633
"Congressman Wilson
has not been charged
with any crime,

1019
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,633
"nor has he been questioned
by the authorities.

1020
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:16,434
"He denies any allegation
of illegal or improper
behavior

1021
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,434
"and will fully cooperate
with the ongoing
investigation."

1022
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,635
Okay. Run it by Stu.

1023
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,836
Yes, sir.

1024
00:47:22,537 --> 00:47:23,637
Gus!

1025
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:29,039
You and three other guys?
Yeah.

1026
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:32,939
Well, I'll tell you
what I told Harold Holt.
I can get the money.

1027
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,040
Now, the 10 million is a joke?
Fine. What do you need?

1028
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:37,842
To do what?
To shoot down
the helicopters.

1029
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:39,043
To shoot down
the helicopters.

1030
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:41,643
If we can help them shoot down
the goddamn helicopters,

1031
00:47:41,744 --> 00:47:43,044
everything's gonna
start going our way.

1032
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:46,645
You know, there's
a story about a Zen master
and a little boy.

1033
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,546
All right, and... Yeah.

1034
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:52,848
It's Stu.

1035
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:54,448
You should be on this.

1036
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,449
Stu?

1037
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,850
No. No,
it's gonna be fine.

1038
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:01,851
It was a party in Vegas.

1039
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:04,151
Lot of drugs,
lot of people
I don't know.

1040
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:07,552
I was there with Crystal Lee
and this guy Paul Brown

1041
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:10,753
who wanted me to invest
in a TV show for Crystal.

1042
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,255
I don't know.

1043
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,356
<i>I don't know, it's
gonna be like a Dallas
set in Washington.</i>

1044
00:48:15,456 --> 00:48:17,556
What... Stu,
what does it matter?

1045
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:18,758
Okay.

1046
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,458
Okay.

1047
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:23,358
Will Crystal back up
your story that you
weren't using?

1048
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,660
Just go put out
the statement.

1049
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,360
You know what?

1050
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:31,261
You never should have been
in the same room, Congressman.

1051
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:34,763
Gus!

1052
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:39,564
Yeah.
The Swiss make
an antiaircraft gun

1053
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:41,365
called the Oerlikon.
Listen, Charlie.

1054
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,065
Twenty-millimeter cannon,
high rate of fire.

1055
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,766
I know the Oerlikon.

1056
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:46,767
Don't forget
the limo driver.

1057
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:47,867
What do you mean?

1058
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,768
Well, you took a limo
from the casino to
the airport.

1059
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,470
Maybe it's easy enough
to track down a limo driver,
hand him a subpoena,

1060
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,170
ask him if anything
was going on in
the back seat,

1061
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:57,271
so, you know,
in terms of cleaning
up this...

1062
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:58,872
Were you listening
at the door?

1063
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:00,772
I wasn't listening
at the door.
Were you standing

1064
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:02,973
at the goddamn door
listening to me?
No.

1065
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,474
How could you even...
That's a thick door!

1066
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,375
You stood there
and you listened to me?

1067
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:08,776
I wasn't standing at the door.
Don't be an idiot.

1068
00:49:08,776 --> 00:49:10,076
I bugged the Scotch bottle.

1069
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:11,276
What?

1070
00:49:12,277 --> 00:49:13,377
Yeah, it's got a little
transmitter on it.

1071
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:16,278
I got a little thing
in my ear. Get past it.

1072
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:19,678
I don't believe this. Who the
fuck... Who the fuck are you?

1073
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,480
It's not in my ear right now.
Take it easy.

1074
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,980
I was gonna tell you about it,
but I had to leave the room
for a second

1075
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,082
'cause you were getting
indicted.
I ain't getting indicted.

1076
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:28,583
Is there a camera in here?
No, that's a little paranoid.

1077
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:29,783
That's right.

1078
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,984
Will you take the bug
off my Scotch bottle now?

1079
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:34,385
Sure.

1080
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:40,287
I saw two kids,
had their hands blown off

1081
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:42,388
when they tried to pick
up something shiny.

1082
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:45,489
Sometimes the kids think
those bombs are toys.

1083
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:47,889
For children to pick up.
Yeah.

1084
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:49,991
They're raping the women
and...
Yeah.

1085
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:53,291
...bayoneting the pregnant
ones.
It's as bad as it can be.

1086
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:56,392
But they still want to go out
and fight the Red Army.

1087
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,593
Each and every one of them.
I've never seen anything
like that.

1088
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:00,194
No, me, neither.

1089
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:03,495
Let's be clear. I want to kill
Russians as much as you do.

1090
00:50:03,596 --> 00:50:06,696
Is the Oerlikon the right gun?
Is that what they should have?

1091
00:50:06,697 --> 00:50:08,497
Now, you know what?

1092
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:09,698
You've had a long flight.

1093
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,498
You're under a lot of stress.
You're under arrest.

1094
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,099
I ain't under arrest.

1095
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,799
Do you drink?
Oh, God, yeah.

1096
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,400
Well, should we try
this Scotch,

1097
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:18,201
or is it gonna release
sarin gas when I open it?

1098
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:21,201
Oh, I don't think so,
but open it over there.

1099
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:29,205
How'd a guy like you get
into the Agency?

1100
00:50:29,305 --> 00:50:32,505
What, you mean a street guy?
You ain't James Bond.

1101
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:36,007
And you ain't
Thomas Jefferson,
so let's call it even.

1102
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,308
Deal.

1103
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,609
Since there's no other reason
I should be here,

1104
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:43,709
let's assume it's 'cause
I'm very good at this.

1105
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,711
They need to shoot down
the helicopters, Gus.

1106
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,313
They need at least,
what, 50 Oerlikons.

1107
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:53,313
Yeah, it's gonna cost
a lot more than $10 million.

1108
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:55,314
And I say for the fourth time,
I can raise the money.

1109
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:56,715
Yeah, how?

1110
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:59,916
Is the Oerlikon the gun
I should be recommending?

1111
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:01,517
I'm not sure.

1112
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,118
Who is sure?
A weapons guy named
Mike Vickers.

1113
00:51:04,218 --> 00:51:06,418
I'll call him.
Yeah. Let's call him
right now.

1114
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:14,421
All right, here's a test.

1115
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:16,622
You see the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt

1116
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:18,823
playing against
the four guys at once?

1117
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,824
Yeah.

1118
00:51:20,024 --> 00:51:22,524
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons
expert

1119
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,725
with the CIA?

1120
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,326
That was a trick question,
Charlie.

1121
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:30,927
It's the nerdy-looking kid
in the white shirt.

1122
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,629
All right, no reason this
can't be fun, you know.

1123
00:51:32,628 --> 00:51:35,228
Mike!
Yeah, just a second.

1124
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,430
Need you now, Mike.

1125
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,032
Keep playing.

1126
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,533
Mike Vickers, this is
Congressman Charles Wilson

1127
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:48,634
of the Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee.

1128
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:51,234
How are you, sir?
Fine, thank you.

1129
00:51:52,136 --> 00:51:55,036
How old are you?
I'll be 30 next week.

1130
00:51:55,137 --> 00:51:57,537
This is the CIA's weapons
expert?

1131
00:51:57,638 --> 00:51:59,238
One of them.
But he's the most senior.

1132
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:00,339
Look...
Mike!

1133
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:02,739
Yeah, bishop to queen's
knight 7.

1134
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,440
See? He's playing
without even looking
at the board.

1135
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,641
That's a useful skill

1136
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,740
if Afghanistan's ever invaded
by Boris Spassky.

1137
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:11,142
Did my office not make
it clear to Langley that
I'm in no mood

1138
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:12,242
to be fucked around with?
Charlie...

1139
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:14,443
You answer to me or
you answer to Jim Baker.
Which do you want?

1140
00:52:14,544 --> 00:52:17,444
All right, the guy's a fucking
Green Beret, Charlie.
He trained with the SEALs.

1141
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:19,945
No one's trying to fuck
with you!
Mike?

1142
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:23,046
Yeah, what was your move?
Knight to queen's bishop 5.

1143
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:24,647
All right, queen to king's
rook 3.

1144
00:52:24,748 --> 00:52:27,748
Guy on the right, you don't
want to trade queens with me.

1145
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:28,949
Shit.

1146
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,749
All right, I apologize.

1147
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,851
Okay.
Everybody friends?

1148
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,251
As a former naval officer
myself, Mike, I should've
known better.

1149
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:39,353
As a former naval officer,
I'd have been surprised
if you had.

1150
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:40,453
Now, what the fuck?
Hey.

1151
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:42,453
He said he was sorry.
Hey.

1152
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,954
What can I do for you, sir?

1153
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:46,955
All right, he wants
to make a recommendation
to his Subcommittee.

1154
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,956
Now, the Swiss made Oerlikon
S.T.A. Antiaircraft cannon,
that's what you'd use

1155
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:52,557
to shoot down the Ml-24 Hind
gunship in the mountains,
right?

1156
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:53,758
Well, the Oerlikon's
a good start,

1157
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:56,059
but the Russians will
just start flying higher
altitude missions.

1158
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
So what else do they need?

1159
00:52:57,259 --> 00:53:00,059
Same thing you give us.
AK-47 s, AK-74s, AKMS.

1160
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:02,161
The Soviets didn't
come into Afghanistan
on a Eurail Pass.

1161
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:03,761
They came in T-55 tanks.

1162
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:06,562
The fighters need
RPG-7 anti-tank
grenade launchers,

1163
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:10,963
Katyusha 107 mm rockets,
wire mines, plastic mines,
bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

1164
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:12,465
ammunition for
all the above

1165
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:14,366
and frequency-hopping radios
and burst transmitters

1166
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:17,066
so these guys aren't
so fucking easy to find.

1167
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,067
Well, I've written it all
in a report you can read.

1168
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,467
You'd be the first
one who did.

1169
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:24,969
Send a copy of it to me
by secure courier right away.

1170
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,269
I will. All right.
All right.

1171
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:31,072
There was a report?

1172
00:53:31,072 --> 00:53:32,372
It's not that simple.

1173
00:53:33,073 --> 00:53:35,873
Why not?
Well, for one thing
it's covert.

1174
00:53:35,874 --> 00:53:37,574
When an Afghan freedom fighter
gets captured,

1175
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:39,074
it can't be with
an American-made
weapon on him.

1176
00:53:39,075 --> 00:53:40,975
That's how a cold war turns
into an actual war,

1177
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:42,976
and that's something
you want to keep
a good eye on.

1178
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:45,076
So anything we give them
has to look like

1179
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:48,077
it could have plausibly
been captured from
the Soviets.

1180
00:53:48,078 --> 00:53:49,778
Yeah, that's right.
You know who's good at that?

1181
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:52,179
Israel and Egypt.
That's right.

1182
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,280
You know what Vickers
just described back there

1183
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:57,781
could cost as much
as $40 million.

1184
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:00,682
I can get the appropriation.
But how?

1185
00:54:01,683 --> 00:54:03,683
I want to know how are you
gonna get the approval
of Congress

1186
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,485
when they're saying no
to the Contras for nothing,

1187
00:54:05,585 --> 00:54:08,185
for $5 million, a request
made by the President?

1188
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,386
When a black approp makes it
through this Subcommittee,

1189
00:54:10,386 --> 00:54:12,686
the full body has
to vote on it blind.

1190
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,887
They know the dollar amount,
but they don't know
what it's for.

1191
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:18,989
So, theoretically, your
$10 million can become
40 million

1192
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,090
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

1193
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,991
Because Congress
wouldn't know what
it was voting on.

1194
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:24,191
That's the beauty of it!

1195
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:25,992
All you need are the nine
other Subcommittee members.

1196
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:27,593
All I really need is
the Committee Chairman.

1197
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:29,493
Doc Long.
Doc Long.

1198
00:54:29,794 --> 00:54:32,894
And with Doc's backing,
you'll get the votes of
the other Committee members.

1199
00:54:32,994 --> 00:54:34,094
Yep.
I don't believe you.

1200
00:54:34,195 --> 00:54:35,195
I don't care.

1201
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:36,496
And until the phone rang
this morning, Charlie,

1202
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,896
I didn't know
I'd never heard of you.

1203
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:40,597
Well, ask around.

1204
00:54:40,698 --> 00:54:42,798
I did.
And what'd you find out?

1205
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,899
That your greatest legislative
achievement in six terms

1206
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,399
was getting reelected
five times.

1207
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Anything else?

1208
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,900
That you hold more IOUs
than any member of the House.

1209
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,601
How about that?

1210
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:56,402
I represent the only district
in America that doesn't
want anything.

1211
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:59,503
They want their guns,
they want low taxes,
that's it.

1212
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,305
I can do favors.
I get to vote yes a lot.

1213
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:07,707
Now, me and three other guys
are killing Russians.

1214
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,107
I mean, is it possible

1215
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:12,908
that I've met the only elected
official in town who can help?

1216
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,110
Give me a week
to set things up.

1217
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:20,911
Go pack a bag.
I have a friend,
an arms dealer in Israel.

1218
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:23,413
He's who we need for this,
God help us.

1219
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:25,614
Should be interesting.
Yeah.

1220
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:27,614
All right.

1221
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,416
We need you, Zvi.

1222
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:32,916
You're gonna be our man
inside the Israeli Parliament.

1223
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,717
I'm not in the Israeli
Parliament.

1224
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:36,818
That's what's gonna
make you so effective.

1225
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:39,218
No one has your pull
with the 10th Knesset.

1226
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:41,419
No one has your relationship
with the Speaker.

1227
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,720
And we are gonna...
We're gonna need your arm
around Menachem,

1228
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:47,621
when he finds out that
we're working with
Egypt and the Saudis.

1229
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:50,922
Tell him.
Tell him why we need him.

1230
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:54,024
I'm not saying anything.
Why not?

1231
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:57,025
I don't know who the fuck
these two other guys are.

1232
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:59,126
Well, ain't they bodyguards?
Not ours.

1233
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:00,326
Zvi?

1234
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,128
Now, just to sum this
up in a nutshell.

1235
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,330
You want me
to move Israel

1236
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:15,631
toward a partnership
with Egypt, Pakistan
and Afghanistan.

1237
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:17,332
And Saudi Arabia.

1238
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:22,034
Well, just a couple of
problems I can foresee
off the top of my head.

1239
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:23,135
Look.

1240
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:24,235
Charlie...
I know.

1241
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:28,436
...Pakistan and Afghanistan
don't recognize our right
to exist.

1242
00:56:28,537 --> 00:56:32,337
Calm down.
We just got done fighting
a war with Egypt

1243
00:56:32,438 --> 00:56:35,738
and every person who has
ever tried to kill me
and my family,

1244
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,840
has been trained
in Saudi Arabia.

1245
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,140
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1246
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:42,642
I mean, some of them
were trained by us.

1247
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:44,243
Gus, come on.

1248
00:56:45,343 --> 00:56:48,343
It's his sense of humor.
It's a bit of an
acquired taste.

1249
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:50,445
Now, Zvi, look at me.

1250
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,845
This is the front
of the Cold War.

1251
00:56:53,947 --> 00:56:56,847
It's not in Berlin,
it's not in Cuba,
it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1252
00:56:56,948 --> 00:56:59,548
It's in a pile of rocks
called Afghanistan.

1253
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,149
These are the only people
who are actually shooting
at the Russians.

1254
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:05,049
Now, you and I know we have
to get Soviet-made weapons

1255
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:06,451
into the hands
of the mujahideen.

1256
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:08,251
And you and I know
where the largest stockpile

1257
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:11,252
of Soviet weapons
outside the Soviet Union is.

1258
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:12,853
I can't tell you offhand
how many

1259
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,153
and what kind of weapons
we've confiscated.

1260
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:19,655
I can. These are Keyhole-11
satellite photos.

1261
00:57:20,356 --> 00:57:23,456
They've been degraded
so I can show them to you.

1262
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:25,357
All right, that's
a five-wheeled chassis tank.

1263
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,958
That's not the Mk.1,
that's the T-55.

1264
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:31,059
And it and four others are
about 12 miles from here.

1265
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,360
What do you want tanks
in mountains for?

1266
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:35,861
Oh, we don't. I just
wanted you to know I know
you got them.

1267
00:57:35,962 --> 00:57:39,362
$35.5 million.
Which you'll be able
to appropriate.

1268
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:40,564
Yeah.

1269
00:57:40,663 --> 00:57:42,563
Without the press asking
questions about it.

1270
00:57:42,664 --> 00:57:43,664
You know,
there's good news there,

1271
00:57:43,765 --> 00:57:46,665
because the press is going
to be busy asking about
a weekend in Vegas

1272
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,066
and his pending arrest
on charges of narcotics
possession.

1273
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:52,167
Oh, Gus.
Shit, Charlie.

1274
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,268
It's nothing.
Is this true?

1275
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:56,469
No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

1276
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,170
Thank you.
I was just explaining to him

1277
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,370
that as long as the press
sees sex and drugs behind
the left hand,

1278
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:02,171
you can park a battle carrier
behind the right hand

1279
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:03,472
and no one's gonna
fucking notice.

1280
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:04,672
What the hell happened?

1281
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,672
It's not germane.
It's not germane
to these people

1282
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:10,173
who are fighting and dying,
and being massacred
in their homes.

1283
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:13,274
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them

1284
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:15,176
shoot down these fucking
helicopters?

1285
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:19,978
I love you, Charlie,

1286
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:22,778
but you are a grown man

1287
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,979
who still hasn't learned
to look both ways before
he crosses the fucking street!

1288
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:35,884
Yes, I'm in.

1289
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,285
But I don't like this guy.
I know how you feel.

1290
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,786
What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.

1291
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:48,188
This meeting's gonna
be run professional?
Oh, absolutely.

1292
00:58:48,288 --> 00:58:50,288
We'll be talking
to the Deputy Defense Minister

1293
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:53,689
while his boss gets
a belly dance from a friend
of Charlie's.

1294
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,791
What?
A good friend of mine
back in Texas

1295
00:58:55,891 --> 00:58:57,091
is a well-known
belly dancer.

1296
00:58:57,192 --> 00:59:00,792
It's always been her dream
to perform in Egypt,
so she's our way in.

1297
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:04,693
While she's dancing for
the Defense Minster, we'll
be talking to the Deputy.

1298
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:07,095
Oh, my God.
No, she's supposed to be good.

1299
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:46,009
That's an extraordinary
woman.
Oh, yeah.

1300
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:52,912
That's not any belly dance
I'm familiar with.

1301
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:56,312
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

1302
00:59:56,513 --> 01:00:00,113
This is your girlfriend?
Carol's a friend.
She's an old friend.

1303
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:03,815
I understand her father
didn't allow dancing because
of the religion?

1304
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:06,516
Yeah, that's correct.

1305
01:00:06,618 --> 01:00:08,118
And what religion is that?

1306
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:10,017
You know, she's a Baptist.

1307
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:16,419
As I was saying, the Russians
will learn, I'm quite
afraid the hard way,

1308
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:19,021
to fear God's vengeance
upon those

1309
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:22,821
who oppress his humble
servants who submit
to him in Islam.

1310
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:25,924
Their skulls will hang
from the treetops.

1311
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:29,624
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

1312
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:35,726
What has Gus here concerned is
a SA surface-to-air missiles
you all have.

1313
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:37,528
For some reason, he thinks
they were stored poorly.

1314
01:00:37,528 --> 01:00:40,028
No, no, no, the SA-7 s
were stored properly.

1315
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:43,830
Excuse me. What about
the oppression of my people?

1316
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,531
Oh, Zvi.
I beg your pardon?

1317
01:00:45,632 --> 01:00:47,132
Fellows, we have
to do this now.

1318
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:51,733
I am about to arrange
for $35 million worth of guns

1319
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:53,334
to be put into the hands
of Muslims!

1320
01:00:53,434 --> 01:00:56,734
I meant no disrespect.
Oh, really?

1321
01:00:56,836 --> 01:00:59,436
Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

1322
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:02,436
You have Soviet-licensed
factories that can put
out Kalashnikovs

1323
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,438
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

1324
01:01:04,538 --> 01:01:07,638
That's correct.
What about city warfare
devices?

1325
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,740
What kind?
Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

1326
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:11,141
plastic, tripwire mines?

1327
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:13,341
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

1328
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,443
We can't improve
the price now,

1329
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:20,943
but when we come back
for more, we'll make
it up to you.

1330
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,245
I agree.

1331
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,345
All right.

1332
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:38,349
Hey, you did good back there
ignoring the religious shit.

1333
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:41,251
'Cause these people are
totally fucking unspooled,

1334
01:01:41,252 --> 01:01:44,152
and I'm not just talking
about the Muslims.

1335
01:01:44,653 --> 01:01:47,153
Zvi's all right.
Oh, I know he is.

1336
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:48,654
He is Mossad, by the way.

1337
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:51,855
What I'm talking about is
your friend in Houston.

1338
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:56,156
Now, she's got to stop
throwing fundraisers and
she's got to stop doing press.

1339
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,857
Joanne is raising awareness.

1340
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,059
She's using
a non-secular vocabulary

1341
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:08,862
and framing this
as a religious war.

1342
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:12,263
And America doesn't
fight religious wars.

1343
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,964
Is that right?
Yeah, that's why
I like living there.

1344
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,865
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain.

1345
01:02:18,965 --> 01:02:20,765
<i>We will begin our initial
descent</i>

1346
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:24,167
<i>into Washington
Dulles Airport.
I got to go down
to Houston, so...</i>

1347
01:02:24,267 --> 01:02:26,267
<i>... I would like to thank you
and hope...</i>

1348
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,268
Well, talk to her.
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1349
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:35,271
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

1350
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:37,572
Just for this one purpose,
yes, Mr. President.

1351
01:02:37,673 --> 01:02:42,173
The Israelis have the largest
stockpile of Soviet-made
weapons in friendly hands.

1352
01:02:42,274 --> 01:02:43,674
I know that.

1353
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:47,875
I need to trust that
this arrangement
will remain secret.

1354
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:52,276
Pakistan and Israel would
have to appear to be enemies
in the public eye.

1355
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:54,779
Yeah, I don't think
that's a tough sell.

1356
01:02:54,879 --> 01:02:56,579
You have authority
to do this?

1357
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,780
None whatsoever. In fact,
I'm pretty close to
violating the Logan Act.

1358
01:02:59,781 --> 01:03:01,681
Well, I don't know
what that is.

1359
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:03,182
But, Charlie.
Yes, sir.

1360
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:06,082
If I see one fucking
Star of David on a crate...

1361
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:07,983
You won't. I promise.

1362
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:10,984
Hey.
Excuse me.

1363
01:03:11,085 --> 01:03:13,785
You want me to take a look
at those remarks?

1364
01:03:13,886 --> 01:03:15,886
Why?
Just... Well,
your introduction,

1365
01:03:15,986 --> 01:03:20,286
want me to look it over?
It's an introduction, Charlie.
I'll be fine.

1366
01:03:28,191 --> 01:03:31,791
<i>Today we honor President
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.</i>

1367
01:03:45,497 --> 01:03:49,197
<i>Before we go any further,
I would like you all
to know this,</i>

1368
01:03:49,499 --> 01:03:51,899
<i>President Zia did not
kill Bhutto.</i>

1369
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,801
<i>In the time that
he's been President,</i>

1370
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,901
<i>the fortunes of Pakistan
have changed radically.</i>

1371
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:59,202
<i>I've asked you all here
today...</i>

1372
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:09,605
You disappeared.

1373
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:11,807
Well, they weren't
selling alcohol in there.

1374
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:14,407
It's a traditional
Pakistani gathering.

1375
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:16,208
You think they might be
a lot happier over there

1376
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:19,709
if they could just get women
and booze in the same room
at the same time?

1377
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,510
I think they'd be a whole
lot happier over there

1378
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:23,111
if the Communists got out.

1379
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:25,712
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

1380
01:04:26,213 --> 01:04:29,613
That's not something you
usually hear in introductory
remarks.

1381
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:33,213
He didn't, Charlie.
Bhutto had a trial
and was found guilty.

1382
01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:34,915
Shocking verdict.

1383
01:04:35,716 --> 01:04:38,316
What did you need
to talk to me about?

1384
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:42,918
Joanne, darling,
dial down the religion.

1385
01:04:43,219 --> 01:04:45,619
What?
It could alienate people

1386
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,420
whose support we need.

1387
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,120
It's luncheons like this
that are raising the
money we need.

1388
01:04:50,222 --> 01:04:53,122
This thing is not gonna
get done by ballrooms
full of people

1389
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,422
in the Houstonian Hotel.

1390
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,823
It's gonna get done
by the CIA, Israel,
Egypt and Pakistan,

1391
01:04:57,924 --> 01:04:59,524
and it's gonna get
done quietly.

1392
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,025
Now, you start making
people think

1393
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:03,525
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity.

1394
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:06,826
I was saved by Jesus Christ,
Charlie, and I am not
ashamed of it.

1395
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:10,128
My fervor is not about
religion, it's about
freedom of religion,

1396
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:11,228
which we have, they want,

1397
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:13,529
and the Communists
are slaughtering them for.

1398
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:16,930
And I get it.
Just tamp down the fervor.

1399
01:05:17,932 --> 01:05:20,832
Well, I can't modulate
God's will, sweetie.

1400
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:22,432
You can try.

1401
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:26,934
Now, I got to get back to D.C.
They've set up a briefing
for me at Langley.

1402
01:05:27,035 --> 01:05:29,435
On what?
On getting the guns.

1403
01:05:32,337 --> 01:05:33,837
Afghanistan's barely
a country.

1404
01:05:33,937 --> 01:05:36,237
There's no phones or roads
outside the cities.

1405
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:37,739
It's likely that a villager
would live his life

1406
01:05:37,738 --> 01:05:40,338
without having contact with
another village just three
miles down the road

1407
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,440
unless he was going
to war against them.

1408
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:45,141
Now, my thinking is instead
of 400,000 sloppy guys,

1409
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:48,942
we concentrate on
several elite forces
totaling about 150,000.

1410
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:50,543
Give these guys
real training,

1411
01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:53,543
20 different courses covering
irregular warfare disciplines.

1412
01:05:53,545 --> 01:05:55,145
And do you have anybody
in mind?

1413
01:05:55,145 --> 01:05:58,245
The most successful rebels
today are in the
Panjshir Valley.

1414
01:05:58,347 --> 01:06:00,847
They're called the
United Front of the
Council of the North.

1415
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:02,947
We've earmarked them
for 10 million in weapons

1416
01:06:03,048 --> 01:06:05,648
and 10 to 15 agency advisors
for training.

1417
01:06:05,749 --> 01:06:08,749
Who's their leader?
Ahmed Shah Massoud.

1418
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,350
He's Tajik, so he's not well
liked by the Pashtun.

1419
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:15,551
So the... What,
the Tajiks have a problem
with the Pashtuns?

1420
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:17,853
Well, they say when a Tajik
wants to make love to a woman,

1421
01:06:17,853 --> 01:06:20,653
his first choice is always
a Pashtun man.

1422
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:24,656
It's funnier in
the original Pashto.

1423
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,656
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

1424
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:31,157
All right, don't fuck
us up now.

1425
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:33,159
Awesome pep talk.

1426
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,560
Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia,

1427
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,361
these are all totalitarian
dictatorships.

1428
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:44,962
And they'd like to blow the
only democracy in the region
right into the Mediterranean.

1429
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:48,064
Now, you heard me say
that Israel's gonna
be on board.

1430
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:50,865
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's
out of his mind.

1431
01:06:51,065 --> 01:06:55,165
These people are draconian
thugs, and in an evil
and twisted derby

1432
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:57,568
between the Communists
and the Fundamentalists,

1433
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,268
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

1434
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,669
No, you're wrong about that,
Doc, and you know
you don't mean it.

1435
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:05,570
In Pakistan, a blind girl
gets raped, but there's
a witness.

1436
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:08,171
Now, in Pakistan it takes
four witnesses.

1437
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:10,672
So the rapist walks away
and the girl is in prison.

1438
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,273
Can you tell me why?

1439
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:15,074
Well, fornication.
That's right.

1440
01:07:15,174 --> 01:07:18,174
Mr. Chairman, President Zia
is the only one willing
to shoulder the risk

1441
01:07:18,276 --> 01:07:21,376
of actively training
and funding the mujahideen

1442
01:07:21,477 --> 01:07:22,877
while Egypt
and Saudi Arabia...

1443
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:25,678
Now, the Saudis are matching
any funding from Congress?

1444
01:07:25,678 --> 01:07:28,278
That's right.
So when you say 40 million
to me,

1445
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:29,579
you're really talking
about 80 million.

1446
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,780
Only 40 from us.

1447
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,880
You want to put $80 million
in the hands of these people?

1448
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,081
No, see, Doc, now, if you took
a trip with me to the border,

1449
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:36,882
you'd stop calling them
"these people."

1450
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:40,482
They are farmers and children
mostly, and they are fighting
our enemies for us.

1451
01:07:40,484 --> 01:07:41,984
I know.
And that should be
impossible for America.

1452
01:07:42,084 --> 01:07:43,984
I know.
It should be impossible
for America

1453
01:07:44,085 --> 01:07:47,585
to sit on the bench while
little kids and their
mothers fight our enemies.

1454
01:07:47,686 --> 01:07:50,586
Now, all you have to do
to change that is to
support me

1455
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,088
in the Committee,
Mr. Chairman.

1456
01:07:52,188 --> 01:07:56,488
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but doubling from 5
to 10 million is one thing,

1457
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:59,290
but, you know,
I just can't get behind this.

1458
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,292
Joanne Herring's
residence. Who's speaking?

1459
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:08,193
Miss Herring, Congressman
Wilson for you.

1460
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:12,095
<i>Hello.
Hey.</i>

1461
01:08:12,295 --> 01:08:13,395
Tell me what's happening.

1462
01:08:13,396 --> 01:08:16,596
Well, I need Doc Long,
and he's not getting on board.

1463
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:19,697
Now, he's a church-going guy,
so I thought,

1464
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:21,798
<i>you know, maybe you could...
So now you need God.</i>

1465
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,699
Yeah. Let me give you
his private line.

1466
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,500
I've got it.

1467
01:08:28,301 --> 01:08:29,501
Trish!
Yes, ma'am.

1468
01:08:30,102 --> 01:08:31,602
Boss?
Yeah.

1469
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:34,803
Hey, that's a nice sweater.
Oh, thank you.

1470
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:37,304
<i>The Washington Times wants
to know if you've ever
been in rehab.</i>

1471
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:39,405
Well, what are you gonna
tell them?
That you won't go to rehab

1472
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:40,705
'cause they don't serve
whiskey there.

1473
01:08:40,806 --> 01:08:43,006
Well, that's why you're
the press secretary, boo-boo.

1474
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:46,207
I've got Stu on the line.
Can you jump on?
Yeah.

1475
01:08:46,508 --> 01:08:48,108
Hey, Stu, it's me.

1476
01:08:48,409 --> 01:08:49,709
All right.

1477
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:53,610
No, she's not a stripper, Stu.
She just posed for
the cover...

1478
01:08:53,711 --> 01:08:55,511
Oh, what the hell
difference does it make?

1479
01:08:56,111 --> 01:08:57,511
They're talking
to Crystal today.

1480
01:08:57,612 --> 01:08:58,712
Yeah.

1481
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:01,413
Giuliani subpoenaed
the limo driver.

1482
01:09:01,813 --> 01:09:03,413
Oh, that's what Gus
said he'd do.

1483
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,614
Well, the limo driver said
he didn't see anything.

1484
01:09:05,715 --> 01:09:06,815
He didn't see anything.

1485
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,016
So Giuliani subpoenaed
every limo driver

1486
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:14,316
between Arlington and Silver
Spring to see if any of them
can recall you using cocaine.

1487
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:18,418
Joanne Herring's
on the phone.
Hey, you.

1488
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,019
We're all leaving
in the morning.

1489
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,420
<i>You're kidding?
No.</i>

1490
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:24,321
Well, what did you have
to promise him?

1491
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:26,922
There's a blind girl in jail
'cause she was raped.

1492
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:28,423
<i>Yeah.
You're gonna get her out.</i>

1493
01:09:28,724 --> 01:09:30,824
What, I got to bust somebody
out of jail?

1494
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:33,124
Don't be stupid, Charlie.
You're gonna tell Zia
to pardon her.

1495
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:34,925
That's Doc's condition.

1496
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:38,526
I'll fly in tonight.
Buy me a drink?
Yes, ma'am.

1497
01:09:38,927 --> 01:09:41,127
We're almost there, Charlie.

1498
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,830
<i>I'm going back to Pakistan
tomorrow!
Let's party!</i>

1499
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,232
<i></i>

1500
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,333
Charlie!
Oh, that was... I'm gonna...

1501
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:56,733
You want a refill here,
darling?
Thanks.

1502
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:58,434
Can we get another round?

1503
01:09:58,534 --> 01:09:59,734
Mario!

1504
01:10:00,235 --> 01:10:02,635
Oh, Charlie.

1505
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:09,638
Hey, Joanne.

1506
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,339
Can I call you Joanne?
Yes.

1507
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:17,241
You'll want to dress
considerably more modestly

1508
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:18,741
when we're at the border.

1509
01:10:18,742 --> 01:10:21,942
Well, thank you, but I have
been passionately involved

1510
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:23,943
with the cause of the Afghans
for three years.

1511
01:10:23,944 --> 01:10:25,644
I've been there many times.

1512
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:27,845
Okay, well, then I'll just
go fuck myself.

1513
01:10:27,945 --> 01:10:30,645
I am not easily shocked,
Mr. Avrakotos.

1514
01:10:31,447 --> 01:10:33,947
I knew you two were gonna
hit it off right away.

1515
01:10:34,047 --> 01:10:35,247
Charlie!

1516
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,448
Sorry, Stu's on the phone.
You can take it at the bar.

1517
01:10:38,549 --> 01:10:41,449
Stu. This can't be good.

1518
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:46,051
How'd you hook up
with Charlie?

1519
01:10:46,152 --> 01:10:49,152
Are you also passionately
involved with the cause
of the Afghans?

1520
01:10:49,154 --> 01:10:52,054
No, I just wasn't really
doing anything else.

1521
01:10:52,154 --> 01:10:54,554
I mean, how did you
get into the CIA?

1522
01:10:54,656 --> 01:10:57,456
Oh, I didn't. I'm with
the Department of Agriculture.

1523
01:10:57,456 --> 01:11:00,656
Food and Plant Division.
Specifically apple imports.

1524
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,857
Now, you don't seem like
the apple type.
I know.

1525
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:06,659
What's that mean?

1526
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,060
Where are you from?
What do you care?

1527
01:11:11,162 --> 01:11:13,862
Are you a Catholic?
Greek Orthodox, Mrs. Herring.

1528
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:16,762
That's still Christian.
Imagine my relief.

1529
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:19,464
What's your problem with me?

1530
01:11:19,564 --> 01:11:21,464
You know, I've found,
in my business,

1531
01:11:21,565 --> 01:11:25,065
that when people with time
on their hands get involved
in politics,

1532
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:27,766
I start forgetting
what I'm supposed to be
shooting at.

1533
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:30,068
That would be in the apple
import business.

1534
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:31,468
Yes, ma'am.

1535
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:33,769
I'll have to remember that.
Please do.

1536
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,770
It's over!

1537
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:40,271
It's over! It is over!

1538
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:43,471
That was Stu, and it is over.
Wait, wait, wait.
Crystal didn't name you?

1539
01:11:43,573 --> 01:11:45,873
Well, she witnessed
me doing coke

1540
01:11:45,974 --> 01:11:47,774
in the Cayman Islands.
Oh, shit, Charlie.

1541
01:11:47,874 --> 01:11:51,074
No, it's all right. That's out
of the Justice Department's
jurisdiction,

1542
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:52,676
so it is over.

1543
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,676
I'm going home!

1544
01:11:55,978 --> 01:12:00,878
Gus, Joanne, the most
important trip of our
lives is in the morning,

1545
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,280
so let's get plenty of sleep.
I'm going home.

1546
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,680
Jailbait, slap my hands!
Yeah!

1547
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:07,881
Mario, this is all on me.

1548
01:12:07,982 --> 01:12:09,282
Yes, sir.

1549
01:12:09,882 --> 01:12:12,582
He may be in trouble with
the press, but he stayed
out of jail.

1550
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:14,384
You don't see
God's hand in this?

1551
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:16,284
Well, reasonable people
can disagree,

1552
01:12:16,385 --> 01:12:19,185
but I don't see God anywhere
within miles of this.

1553
01:12:19,287 --> 01:12:20,987
On the other hand,
if you slept with me tonight,

1554
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,587
I bet you I could change
my mind in a hurry.

1555
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:25,488
Oh, you would.
Yeah.

1556
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,890
I'll see you on the plane.

1557
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:38,193
<i></i>

1558
01:12:38,293 --> 01:12:39,393
Sluts.

1559
01:13:04,703 --> 01:13:06,803
Doc's eating this up.
Yeah?

1560
01:13:06,903 --> 01:13:09,403
We're gonna get the money.
Charlie?

1561
01:13:11,006 --> 01:13:12,206
Charlie!

1562
01:13:12,706 --> 01:13:14,506
Guy's a little senile.
Don't be fooled.

1563
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,107
He chairs a Subcommittee?
Mmm-hmm.

1564
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:20,607
Charlie, Joanne, this has been
an absolutely eye-opening
experience.

1565
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,509
I mean, it's absolutely
stunning.

1566
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:25,909
Tell them what we saw,
Mr. Papadropolous. Tell them.

1567
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,111
They only want to go back
there and fight.

1568
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:30,511
And you're their savior,
Mr. Chairman.

1569
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:32,412
Oh, I wouldn't go
that far, no.
Watch this.

1570
01:13:32,513 --> 01:13:33,913
She's gonna lock it right
on up.
Mr. Chairman,

1571
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:37,113
these people have been
waiting for you. They have
been sitting here

1572
01:13:37,215 --> 01:13:40,215
and bleeding and waiting
and praying for you.

1573
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,816
It's only gonna be a man
like you who can save them.

1574
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:46,818
We know, don't we,
about our men,

1575
01:13:47,218 --> 01:13:49,818
what they can do
when they summon
themselves.

1576
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,120
Charlie, I think
they want you to make
some remarks.

1577
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:54,620
No, you should do it,
Mr. Chairman.

1578
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,621
These people have been
waiting a long time for you.

1579
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:59,722
Show Muriel what you can do.
Show your wife.

1580
01:13:59,823 --> 01:14:02,923
I'm a little bit emotional
about what I've seen
here today.

1581
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:04,324
Show her.

1582
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:07,826
You can do it.

1583
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:10,526
Go on.

1584
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,627
All right.

1585
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:19,929
Papadropolous.
Well, it's Greek.
It's in the ballpark.

1586
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,030
<i>
My friends,</i>

1587
01:14:22,131 --> 01:14:25,131
<i>my son served in Vietnam.</i>

1588
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:30,232
<i>He was wounded fighting
in battle against
the Soviet oppressors.</i>

1589
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:32,135
I didn't know that
about his son.

1590
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,535
<i>So, you see,
I'm no stranger,</i>

1591
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:38,736
<i>no stranger at all to
the horrors and atrocities
of the Communists!</i>

1592
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:44,539
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1593
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,140
I talk about God for
one simple reason.

1594
01:14:50,242 --> 01:14:53,242
<i>As God is my witness today...
We need him on our side.</i>

1595
01:14:53,343 --> 01:14:57,343
<i>... these Russian gunships,
every last one of them,</i>

1596
01:14:57,444 --> 01:14:59,544
<i>are gonna be blown right
out of the sky.</i>

1597
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:04,345
<i>We're gonna see that you
have guns and we're gonna
see that you have training!</i>

1598
01:15:07,848 --> 01:15:09,148
Thank you.

1599
01:15:10,949 --> 01:15:12,849
Well, what I think's got
Gus worried

1600
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:17,150
is that sooner or later
God is gonna be on both sides.

1601
01:15:18,052 --> 01:15:21,452
<i>This is good against evil.</i>

1602
01:15:21,554 --> 01:15:24,754
<i>And I want you to know
that America's always
going to be</i>

1603
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,054
<i>on the side of the good.</i>

1604
01:15:27,755 --> 01:15:31,155
<i>And God will always punish
the wicked!</i>

1605
01:15:43,662 --> 01:15:45,162
God is great!

1606
01:15:46,162 --> 01:15:47,662
God is great!

1607
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:34,078
This has been
a year of setback
and frustration.

1608
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,680
<i>And the Soviet Army,
more than at any time
since the war began,</i>

1609
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:39,881
<i>Now has the upper hand.</i>

1610
01:16:39,982 --> 01:16:42,182
<i>The mujahideen are
pinned down.</i>

1611
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:46,283
<i>The Afghan resistance has
been sanctified by
the United States,</i>

1612
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:50,785
<i>but the support has not been
translated into military
hardware.</i>

1613
01:16:50,886 --> 01:16:53,786
<i>The guerrillas still cling
to the Kalashnikov,
but it's not enough.</i>

1614
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:57,987
<i>They're waiting in vain
for bigger modern weapons</i>

1615
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,889
<i>to turn on the Red Army.</i>

1616
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:02,189
<i>The guerrillas survived
the raid.</i>

1617
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:07,291
<i>The Soviets now are conducting
some of the heaviest bombing
of the war.</i>

1618
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:10,792
<i>The Soviets have put more
troops and equipment back in.</i>

1619
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,393
Communist bastards.

1620
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:26,298
Don't send us rice
and bandages,

1621
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,699
give us weapons
so that we can shoot
down their gunships.

1622
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:35,901
It's called the MILAN
anti-tank missile.

1623
01:17:36,003 --> 01:17:38,803
Can the Afghans
win without it?
No.

1624
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:41,304
End of discussion.

1625
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:44,204
I would like
to have the previously
approved sum increased

1626
01:17:44,305 --> 01:17:46,305
by an additional 30 million,

1627
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:50,006
bringing the total
appropriation to 70 million.

1628
01:17:50,107 --> 01:17:53,107
I'd like to introduce
the MILAN anti-tank missile.

1629
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,009
We've got 300 in the field.

1630
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,410
Yeah!
Yep.

1631
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,410
Let's kill some Russians!

1632
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:14,616
Voting to pump up the money
for the freedom fighters
is the only way

1633
01:18:14,617 --> 01:18:16,917
for the northeastern liberal
to prove that he's serious.

1634
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:18,218
How much are you asking for?

1635
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:20,318
I'd want to go from 70 million
to 100 million.

1636
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:23,719
And if you vote for me,
I can deliver the Black
Caucus for the farm subsidy.

1637
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:38,725
<i></i>

1638
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,080
And they asked him,
quite reasonably enough,

1639
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,580
"How did you vote on that?"

1640
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:12,881
And I swear to God,
he looks over
at his staff guy.

1641
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:17,682
He had to check with
an aide for an answer
to that question.

1642
01:21:18,885 --> 01:21:20,985
I don't know how that guy
stays in office.

1643
01:21:53,797 --> 01:21:55,797
It was the Bamian-led group.
They set an ambush here

1644
01:21:55,898 --> 01:21:57,598
at the Fuladi Bridge.
What'd they get?

1645
01:21:57,599 --> 01:22:00,499
Four supply trucks coming out
of Bagram Airbase.

1646
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:03,699
They hit a Soviet motorized
rifle battalion on horseback?

1647
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:06,401
You bet your ass.
Then these guys are
pretty good.

1648
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,610
We can't control this
thing anymore.

1649
01:22:32,712 --> 01:22:35,812
The man stood in my office
in Islamabad, and I told him,

1650
01:22:35,912 --> 01:22:37,512
"A sudden influx of money

1651
01:22:37,513 --> 01:22:41,013
"and weaponry..."
Could you hand me that belt,
please?

1652
01:22:42,015 --> 01:22:43,715
Thank you.
I mean, how is it possible

1653
01:22:43,816 --> 01:22:46,516
that this congressman
of no particular importance

1654
01:22:46,616 --> 01:22:48,116
is doing this by himself?

1655
01:22:48,217 --> 01:22:50,217
I will admit it's not
unimpressive.

1656
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:53,117
Is this the war we want
to be fighting, Henry? Huh?

1657
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:57,919
Harold, whatever he's doing,
believe me, it's working.

1658
01:23:15,927 --> 01:23:21,927
The CIA estimates that
seven out of every 10 times
the muj fires a Stinger,

1659
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,630
a Soviet chopper or a plane
falls out of the sky.

1660
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:29,930
Now, Russian MiGs
go for $20 million,
Stingers go for 60-70,000.

1661
01:23:29,933 --> 01:23:31,433
What do you want to do?

1662
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:33,233
Well, I'd like to double
to 250 million.

1663
01:23:33,334 --> 01:23:36,234
Remind me again,
where did this thing start?

1664
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:37,934
5 million.

1665
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,339
<i>Hello?
Is this Mrs. Joanne
King Herring Davis?</i>

1666
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:54,741
Where's it at, Charlie?

1667
01:23:56,242 --> 01:23:57,742
How's the honeymoon?

1668
01:23:58,243 --> 01:24:01,243
<i>Am I ever gonna see you
naked again?</i>

1669
01:24:02,044 --> 01:24:03,244
Where's it at, Charlie?

1670
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:08,145
500 million.
Matched by the Saudis.

1671
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:10,447
One billion dollars.

1672
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:12,847
<i>That's right.
Billion with a "b."</i>

1673
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,949
Where does this rank relative
to other covert wars?

1674
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,750
There's never been anything
else like it.

1675
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:21,151
<i>Since when?</i>

1676
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:23,851
Ever.

1677
01:24:25,753 --> 01:24:27,453
I miss you, Charlie.

1678
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:29,153
I, Joanne,

1679
01:24:31,155 --> 01:24:32,755
I always miss you.

1680
01:24:37,357 --> 01:24:38,757
<i>I better go.</i>

1681
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,760
<i></i>

1682
01:24:48,862 --> 01:24:50,862
There's nothing
wrong with that!

1683
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:53,662
And out in Polk, there's
the polecat who took
us over the side there.

1684
01:24:53,663 --> 01:24:56,363
You know, that's the truth.
What do you got?

1685
01:24:56,464 --> 01:24:58,364
Is that Gus? You got it.

1686
01:24:58,465 --> 01:24:59,565
Hey, Gus!

1687
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:02,266
<i>Congratulations on your
reelection.
Yeah, thank you.</i>

1688
01:25:02,366 --> 01:25:05,466
<i>Tell me what you know.
All right. Doc Long
is gonna lose.</i>

1689
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:07,668
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw that coming.

1690
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:10,368
Yeah, so who's gonna be
our wallet now?

1691
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,170
<i>John Murtha.
And is that good news?</i>

1692
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,570
<i>Yep.
Why?</i>

1693
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:18,371
I was his vote on
the Ethics Committee.

1694
01:25:20,473 --> 01:25:22,973
You know, you're a very,
very easy man to like,
Congressman.

1695
01:25:23,274 --> 01:25:25,174
Call me tomorrow morning
at high noon.

1696
01:25:25,475 --> 01:25:27,575
I will. Bye-bye.

1697
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,980
We present you with
this Stinger tube.

1698
01:25:46,882 --> 01:25:50,882
There was wild
jubilation inside the
country of Afghanistan

1699
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:54,384
<i>as last weekend it became
the first country in history</i>

1700
01:25:54,385 --> 01:25:56,885
<i>to defeat the mighty
Soviet Union.</i>

1701
01:25:56,987 --> 01:25:58,687
<i></i>

1702
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:02,487
<i>The retreat of Soviet military
power from Afghanistan
is complete.</i>

1703
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:06,089
<i>The last of Russia's regular
army invasion force is out.</i>

1704
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:09,190
<i>Fear and uncertainty
were mixed with joy today</i>

1705
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,990
<i>as the commander
of Soviet troops</i>

1706
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:13,391
<i>followed the last of his men
across the border.</i>

1707
01:26:13,393 --> 01:26:17,093
<i>CBS News Moscow correspondent,
Barry Petersen, begins
our coverage.</i>

1708
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:20,594
It was the last hurrah.
The final Soviet combat troops

1709
01:26:20,594 --> 01:26:22,594
<i>crossing the Friendship Bridge
on the border</i>

1710
01:26:22,696 --> 01:26:25,096
<i>between Afghanistan
and the Soviet Union.</i>

1711
01:26:25,197 --> 01:26:26,697
<i>The Soviet commander,
Lieutenant...</i>

1712
01:26:26,797 --> 01:26:28,897
Look what you did, Charlie.

1713
01:26:29,298 --> 01:26:31,598
Hey, it's... Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey!

1714
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:35,298
It's traditional to make
a gesture towards
the vanquished.

1715
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:38,301
Gus, it's your honor.
Okay.

1716
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:40,901
<i>Reports that some Afghan
units have...</i>

1717
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:45,103
Well, here's to you,
you motherfuckers.

1718
01:26:46,404 --> 01:26:50,904
<i>... determined to show
the world that the era of
Soviet military intervention</i>

1719

<i>in other countries
is now over.</i>

1720
01:26:54,308 --> 01:26:56,708
<i></i>

1721
01:26:56,808 --> 01:27:00,808
Well, I told you.
Told me what?

1722
01:27:00,909 --> 01:27:04,009
All we had to do
was shoot down
the helicopters.

1723
01:27:06,712 --> 01:27:09,512
Listen, not for nothing,
but do you know the story

1724
01:27:09,613 --> 01:27:11,313
about the Zen master
and the little boy?

1725
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:12,914
Oh, is this something
from Nitsa,

1726
01:27:13,014 --> 01:27:15,814
the Greek witch of Aquilippa,
Pennsylvania?

1727
01:27:15,915 --> 01:27:18,315
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

1728
01:27:20,217 --> 01:27:23,517
There was a little boy,
and on his 14th birthday
he gets a horse.

1729
01:27:23,518 --> 01:27:26,518
And everybody in the village
says, "How wonderful!
The boy got a horse."

1730
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:29,219
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1731
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,820
Two years later, the boy falls
off the horse, breaks his leg.

1732
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:33,921
And everybody in the village
says, "How terrible!"

1733
01:27:34,022 --> 01:27:36,622
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1734
01:27:36,923 --> 01:27:38,223
Then a war breaks out,

1735
01:27:38,324 --> 01:27:39,824
and all the young men
have to go off and fight,

1736
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:41,624
except the boy can't
'cause his leg's
all messed up.

1737
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:43,325
And everybody in the village
says, "How wonderful!"

1738
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:46,025
And the Zen master says,
"We'll see."

1739
01:27:46,726 --> 01:27:48,726
So you get it.

1740
01:27:48,827 --> 01:27:51,327
No. No, I don't
'cause I'm stupid.

1741
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:53,928
You're not stupid.
You're just in Congress.

1742
01:27:54,029 --> 01:27:55,729
Send them money.
You can start
with the roads.

1743
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:58,030
Move on to the schools,
factories.
Gus, now, it's a party.

1744
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:59,430
Restock the sheep herds.
Hey.

1745
01:27:59,531 --> 01:28:01,331
Give them jobs,
give them hope.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1746
01:28:01,332 --> 01:28:03,332
Yeah, well, try harder.
I'm fighting
for every dollar.

1747
01:28:03,432 --> 01:28:07,032
Yeah, yeah.
I took you from 5 million
to a billion.

1748
01:28:07,535 --> 01:28:09,035
I broke the ice on the Stinger
and the MILAN.

1749
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,034
I got a Democratic Congress
in lockstep behind
a Republican President.

1750
01:28:12,136 --> 01:28:13,336
Well, that's not good enough

1751
01:28:13,437 --> 01:28:15,737
'cause I'm gonna hand you
a code word classified
NIE right now,

1752
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:17,637
and it's gonna tell you
that the crazies have
started rolling

1753
01:28:17,738 --> 01:28:20,838
into Kandahar like it's
a fucking bathtub drain.

1754
01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:24,539
Jesus, Gus, you could depress
a bride on her wedding day.

1755
01:28:24,641 --> 01:28:25,641
Hey.

1756
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:31,442
Listen to what
I'm telling you.

1757
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:52,549
You did a hell of a job for
the son of a soda pop maker.

1758
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:56,751
"We'll see,"
said the Zen master.

1759
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:14,258
$1 million for school
reconstruction?

1760
01:29:14,359 --> 01:29:15,659
Oh, shit, Charlie.

1761
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,460
Listen.
He's like the congressman
from Kabul.

1762
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:22,260
Did you hear me say it was
a million, not a billion,
for school construction?

1763
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:24,261
Yeah, we heard you.
Everybody heard you, buddy.

1764
01:29:24,262 --> 01:29:25,962
They heard you in Dover,
Delaware.

1765
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:27,563
Well, I sure hope I'm not
annoying you, Bob,

1766
01:29:27,564 --> 01:29:29,464
'cause that's the last thing
I want to do.
Look...

1767
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:32,464
I was in the Roosevelt Room
with the President last week.

1768
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:33,666
You know what he said?

1769
01:29:33,765 --> 01:29:35,965
He said, "Afghanistan?
Is that still going on?"

1770
01:29:35,967 --> 01:29:37,367
Well, it is.

1771
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:39,067
Half the population
of that country

1772
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:40,467
is under the age of 14.
Charlie.

1773
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:44,068
Half the population is
under the age of 14.

1774
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:46,469
Now, think how fucking
dangerous that is.

1775
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:49,270
They're gonna come home
and find their families
are dead,

1776
01:29:49,372 --> 01:29:50,872
their villages have
been napalmed.

1777
01:29:50,972 --> 01:29:53,672
And we helped kill the guys
who did it.
Yeah, but they don't
know that, Bob,

1778
01:29:53,773 --> 01:29:55,773
<i>'cause they don't
get home delivery
of The New York Times.</i>

1779
01:29:55,774 --> 01:29:58,974
And even if they did,
it was covert, remember?

1780
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:03,575
This is what we always do.
We always go in with
our ideals

1781
01:30:03,677 --> 01:30:06,477
and we change the world
and then we leave.

1782
01:30:06,878 --> 01:30:08,378
We always leave.

1783
01:30:08,878 --> 01:30:11,678
But that ball, though,
it keeps on bouncing.

1784
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:14,080
What?
The ball keeps on bouncing.

1785
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,680
Yeah, we're
a little busy right now

1786
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:17,681
reorganizing Eastern Europe,
don't you think?

1787
01:30:17,682 --> 01:30:19,482
We've spent billions.

1788
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:23,382
Let's spend a million
on H.R.118 and rebuild
a school.

1789
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:26,984
Charlie, nobody gives a shit
about a school in Pakistan.

1790
01:30:27,586 --> 01:30:28,986
Afghanistan.

1791
01:30:50,394 --> 01:30:55,494
So, for the first time,
a civilian is being given
our highest recognition,

1792
01:30:55,996 --> 01:30:58,096
<i>that of Honored Colleague.</i>

1793
01:30:58,297 --> 01:31:00,897
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the Clandestine Services,</i>

1794
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:03,098
<i>Congressman Charles Wilson.</i>

1795
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,500
Bravo, Charlie.
