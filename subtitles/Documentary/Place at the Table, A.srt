when he dumped me out of the blue.
Then I saw.

302
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,520
So I dropped out
as maid of honor

303

and I RSVP'd "No."

this is about Francie,
it's her day,

306

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,395
SINGER: All right.
Our newlyweds will be joining us

320
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,436
for their first dance soon.

321
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,635
Okay, what's going on, man?

322
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,074
Meanwhile,
enjoy the open bar.

323
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,519
Come on,
what does that mean?

324
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,749
What does that mean?

325
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,398
It means you leave me
a voicemail

326
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,193
telling me to tell Francie
not to open your RSVP card.

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,416
Then you leave me a voicemail
telling me that you're coming

328
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,477
and then another one saying
"Disregard the last one."

329
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,936
So that's what I mean,
what are you doing here?

330
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,400
You listened to
all those voicemails?

331

Hey, guys, right here.

Come on, El,
please don't go all crazy.

334
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
"All crazy"?
Now what does that mean?

335
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,433
It means you get mad.

336
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,829
You do something big
and you can't take it back

337
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,273
and it's too late,
and then...

338
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,880
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
Crazy. I do that?

339
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,439
I do that?

340
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,313
I'm not your mom,
so, I don't do that.

341
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,274
(STAMMERING)
I think it's funny, mostly.

342
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,309
But not today.

343
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,596
Nikki will murder me...
All right, all right.

344
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,190
Nikki can calm down.
What is the deal with Nikki?

345
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Really?

346
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,976
Wow. "What's the deal
with Nikki?" That's funny.

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,833
Why would you care about Nikki if
you're just here for my sister?

348
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,635
You're right.

349
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,948
Yeah.
You're right.

350
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,016
It's none of my business
if you cheated on me with her.

351
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,951
What?
Why should it even bother me?

352
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,071
Come on! I didn't
cheat on you with her.

353
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,918
It started
after we broke up

354
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,479
and you dropped out
as maid of honor.

355
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,833
How does a guy who...

356
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,276
After two years, you break
up with me over text?

357
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,114
"Good luck with your
future endeavors"?

358
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
(SHUSHING)
Were you firing me?

359
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,594
What the f...

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,749
You're an asshole.

361
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,438
Oh, my God,
you're such an asshole.

362
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,829
You're a ridiculous asshole.

363
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,357
Why don't you just go home?

364
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,397
Yeah?
Yeah.

365
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,910
Before you ruin
all this for Francie.

366
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,616
I don't have a ferry ticket
till tomorrow, anyway.

368
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,235
Think she'll be back?

369
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
I vote yes.

370
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,874
Hey! Let's chat,

371
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,593
you and me.

372
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,278
No, I'd like my
elbow back, Nicole.

373
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,395
Fine.

374
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,629
Just don't make a scene.

375
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,029
Why does everyone
keep saying I do that?

BINA: Hey, Jerry Kepp.
Uh-huh.

377

BINA: Just a hypothetical.

378
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,991
If someone offered you
20 bucks to go up

379
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,469
to our room and read your
book in the tub, would you?

380
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,669
Say yes.

381
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,070
No. You know how I feel
about a hotel bathtub.

382
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,869
People do unconscionable
things in hotel bathtubs.

383
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,355
Okay, I'm sorry.

384
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,720
Bina, stand up. Bina, please,
stand up right now, please.

385

Why?

386
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,670
I will give you
20 unhypothetical dollars

387
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,159
if you stand up right now.

388
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,559
All right, then.

389
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,714
Okay?

What a shame.

Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

396
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,594
So much.

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,594
How long have you
worked here?

398

399
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,631
really work here.

400
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah. What's up?

401
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Look at that.

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,038
That is why
I'm here today.

must be overjoyed.

they were fighting.

Teddy broke up
with you.

408
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,513
I know how hard
that can be, okay?

409

A long time ago,
he broke up with me

410
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,632
to go out with you,
so I get it.

But you have to stop now.

I fit into this family.
You never did.

I was Francie's first choice
for maid of honor.

I was Teddy's first choice
for a girlfriend.

Sometimes, first sticks.
Sometimes, it doesn't.

He listened to every
voicemail I sent,

417
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,913
so what does that tell you?

Tells me you don't know
when to stop calling.

he wasn't coming,

and then all of a sudden
he changed his mind

and he won't say why.

to go to a wedding

to answering

at my Facebook?

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Okay.

481
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,392
Table one is Francie,
Doug and everyone

482
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,696
who actually matters
including Teddy Millner,

483
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,312
the best man-child
and Nikki Carmichael,

484
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,576
the second-choice
maid of honor.

485
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,656
Table two,
Francie's hideous dad...

486
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,736
Roger?
No, he's a lovely bloke.

487
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,216
Roger and his trophy wife,
and Doug's parents

488
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,296
who are married but miserable.

489
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,856
Table three, Francie's
disaster of a mother,

490
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,216
her actual sorority sisters who
are all divorced, mostly twice,

491
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,680
sometimes more.
What's happening now?

492
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,936
Four, Doug's
kooky college friends.

493
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Five, grandparents,
no comment.

494
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,616
Six, Doug's dad's
military buddies.

495
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,914
Seven, decent cousins.

496
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,336
Eight, indecent cousins
including Infamous Kate,

497
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,496
the Millner family
nymphomaniac.

498
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Where is eight now?

499
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,656
Nine, Francie's
scintillating work.

500
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,816
10, Doug's even
more scintillating work.

501
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,114
11, kids' table, no comment.

502
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,496
12 and 13
are two tables of singles,

503
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,096
one supposedly cool,
the other supposedly not.

504
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,616
14, Doug's dad's
diner world connections.

505

The hell are
we doing back here?

506
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,336
15 are the wedding hires
including the reverend,

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,536
the hairdresser,
the hairdresser's colorist.

508
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,438
And then there's three more
tables until you get back here.

509
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,096
Do you know what Francie's
mother calls this table?

510
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
JO: Enough.

511
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,496
What Carol Millner
calls Table 19?

512
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,376
The table that should have
known to RSVP regrets...

513
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,336
...but not before sending
something nice off the registry.

514
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Enough.

515
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,576
The table that could
disappear in the middle

516
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,776
of the wedding and no one
would even notice.

517
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,835
Enough!

518
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,016
I did the table assignments
with Francie

519
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,416
before I was replaced
as maid of honor

520
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,637
because her brother broke up with
me over text after two years.

521
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,312
That's the kind of
table this is.

522
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,349
I told Francie Millner a never-ending
story when she was five.

523
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,917
I taught her
a dozen rock-n-roll songs.

524
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,993
I gave her, her favorite
toy in the world.

525
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,789
A golden bird
that she so loved,

526
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,990
I bet she still has it now.

527
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,755
Does that sound like a person
they would put at a table

528
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,354
of people
they don't care about?

529
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
It sounds like someone who
was invited to a wedding

530
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,216
because Francie's
mother found out

531
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,629
she was paying $200 a plate
for the groom's nanny

532
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,756
and wanted
to settle the score.

Okay, I think this
conversation is over, right?

583

Because it started with
you asking for a dance

to that was no.

to say about love.

799
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,796
Then he took a dump
on the table.

800
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,474
When Francie
first met Doug,

801
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,196
she just always knew
that he'd never let her down.

802
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,948
But I thought

803
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,354
people almost
always let you down,

804
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,951
so where did that
come from?

805
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,430
Maybe she realized that

806
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,075
whenever he did
let her down,

807
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,995
maybe she'd just be always
ready to forgive him.

808
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,957
WOMAN: Whoo!
(GUESTS CHEERING)

809
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,433
Come on up here, Nikki.

810
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,830
Save me, please.
(CHEERING)

811
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,956
I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.

812
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,393
Maid of honor toast time!

(VOMITING)

815
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Oh...

816
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,669
Let's go.

817
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
BINA: What?

818
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,233
She's none of
our business.

819
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,232
Who knows what that girl
will do to herself?

820
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,629
We don't, because we don't
know anything about her.

821
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,416
JO: She's temperamental.
She hasn't had a drink

822
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,635
and now she's puked up
mini hotdogs.

823
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,873
Do none of you care that that
girl is obviously pregnant?

824
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,313
BINA: What?
Huh?

825
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,437
You children are
such a disappointment.

826
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,638
Go away, please.

827
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,359
You're right.
Teddy Millner was always rotten.

828
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,549
You don't know me.

829
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,757
No, he was selfish,
rude, mumbling.

830
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,114
Always mumbling.

831

In love with whatever toy
his mother got him

832
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,552
until she got him
a new one

833
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,278
and then he just
moved right on.

834
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,713
Please go away. Please.

835
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,870
I got his sister Francie
a bird that I found

836
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,872
at a Chinese gift store
in New York City.

837
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,916
Well, Teddy got jealous.

838
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,951
So the next time
I was in New York,

839
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,951
I went out of my way,

840
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,712
skipped a blind date

841
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,637
my aunt tried
to set me up on...

842
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,358
Please get out.
...skipped a date,

843
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,069
to find Teddy the same
bird his sister cherished.

844
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,594
Well, he played with it
for one day!

845
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,910
I never saw the bird again.

846
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,752
My whole life
might have been

847
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,479
something else
if I'd gone on that date.

848
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,198
But what's done is done.

849
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,953
No. Wait.
I know what happened.

850
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,477
He ended it
with a text message

851
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,596
when you told him
you were pregnant.

852
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Oh...

853
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,154
Jesus!

854
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,629
Never doubt
a nanny's intuition.

855
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,039
It's true?
Yes.

856
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,536
Can everybody just
get out of here, please?

857
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
So what do we do?

858
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,696
What do you mean,
"What do we do?"

859
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,551
To teach that asshole a lesson.
Oh, Lord.

860
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,120
No, I don't want to do anything
that will jeopardize my freedom

861
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,395
to run my
successful business.

862
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,232
That's right.
Let's just please go back

863
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,816
to the table before
they think we've left.

864
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,751
What do you care what
anyone here thinks, Bina?

865
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,308
Stop. That was
an overreaction, okay?

866
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,675
I had too many of
the mini hotdogs and...

867
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,314
Can we just
forget about it?

868
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,469
That won't be easy.

869
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,437
Teddy Millner
is leaving you

870
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,478
to raise a child alone.
If you even go...

871
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,598
Oh, my God.

872
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,830
If you even go through
with the pregnancy.

873
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,990
Okay, no. This is
no one's business, okay?

874
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,274
We're going back
to the table.

875
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,078
Let's get out of
the ladies' bathroom.

876
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,376
Francie's still my friend,
and I'm not gonna mess up her day

877
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,856
by doing something
to her dumb brother.

878
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,359
What if Francie
never needs to know?

879
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,113
Jerry, stop.
She said she's done with it.

880
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,197
Well, no.

881
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,776
No. For once, I'm not gonna do
the thing I immediately regret.

882
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,376
Renzo, if I gave you
a couple hundred bucks,

883
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,736
could you get a hooker
to wait in Teddy's room?

884
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,096
Oh, I was asking the hotel that very
same question about my own room.

885
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,456
I don't want to get
involved with hookers.

886
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
They don't provide them.

887
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,616
You guys probably already know this,
but that's not a question

888
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,936
you're supposed to ask
a fancy place like this

889
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
unless you're
a successful businessman.

890
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,629
Which I am.

891
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,676
Are you okay?
You looked like you got sick.

892
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,976
I'm fine. Please get lost.
Excuse me.

893
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,513
Hello. Jerry Kepp.

894
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,431
Diner associate
on the Grotsky side.

895
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Hello.

896
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,040
Did you or did you not
dump this girl

897
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,672
after getting her pregnant?
Oh, my God.

898
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,194
I'm sorry, what's going
on now? I'm just...

899
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,271
I never did like you,
not even as a child.

900
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,317
Teddy Millner, did you dump
this girl immediately

901
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,675
after she told you
she was pregnant?

902
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Okay.

903
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,096
You didn't tell them
what you said.

904
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,350
Wait, what did you say?
What did I say?

905
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,193
She said that we'd be
ridiculous parents.

906
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,879
No, I... Not like that.

907
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,075
TEDDY: Yes, you did.

908
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,594
You said I'd be
a ridiculous father.

909
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,557
You asked me
if I wanted to keep it.

910
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,074
Then I asked you if you
would want to keep it

911
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,230
and you didn't say
anything to that.

912
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,629
So then I said
we were ridiculous.

913
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,188
It was after
you called me ridiculous

914
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,074
because why would you
want to keep our kid

915
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,794
if you thought
that I was just a...

916
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,518
That I was just a joke?

917
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,438
It was before.

918
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,590
And you were looking
for a way out, man!

919
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,715
I get that now.

920
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,560
Everyone we know says
we were wrong together.

921
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,392
Your mother wouldn't
stop saying that

922
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,153
I was not the kind of girl
who ended up with you.

923
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,153
And when it was time for you to
stand up and say that she's wrong

924
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,913
and they're all wrong and
they're idiots and stand by me,

925
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,037
then you ask me
if I want to keep it.

926
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,671
That's your first question.

927
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,269
What was I supposed
to say, El?

928
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,670
I constantly disappoint you.

929
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,037
Then you tell me
that you think our kid

930
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,839
will grow up thinking
that I'm just a joke.

931
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,675
That I was never
good enough for you.

932
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,039
And you finally found
a way to tell me.

933
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,190
And I was so scared
of losing you that

934
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,396
when you told me
you were pregnant,

935
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,040
I asked if you
wanted to keep the kid.

936
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,236
I'm ridiculous
in a million ways.

937
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,038
I am. I know that.

938
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,194
But I can't spend
my whole life

939
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,032
disappointing you

940
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,429
as much as
I disappoint myself.

941
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,634
Shit.

942
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,034
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,839
Hey, stop.

944
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,155
Teddy! Stop! Teddy!

945
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,468
TEDDY: Leave me alone.

946
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,596
No, Teddy!
No, he doesn't get...

Oh, my God.

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,990
No, we can fix this.
We can fix this. No, Teddy.

01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,976
I told you a million times,
okay? I didn't forget anybody.

1586
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,911
Sorry. Thank you.

1587
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,109
You're welcome.

1588
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,839
Okay, so this
is the last batch of...

1589
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,999
Teddy, where's the baby?

1590
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,748
Baby. Oh, man! (STAMMERING)

1591
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,111
Come on, man.
I know, I'm sorry.

1592
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,998
It's just, you know,
if you forget the baby...

1593
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,576
I'm not sure
I believe you when you say

1594
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,636
you didn't forget
any of our friends.

1595
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,995
Hi!

1596
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,438
Here he is.
Aw!

1597
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,096
The world's best dad
when you don't forget

1598
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,792
our baby
in the empty apartment.

1599
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,911
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.
You're welcome.
