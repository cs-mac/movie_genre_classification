1
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:05,516
He calls me "Vanilla Piss".
Ventriloquist, man, ventriloquist.

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,000
- That's not a bad word.
- But it sounds bad. I don't like it.

3
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,919
A ventriloquist is someone who talks
without moving his mouth.

4
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:17,155
- Why are you calling me that?
- Yes, Camilo, why?

5
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,875
Because he's
a good messenger and he's...

6
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:22,550
...always popping
up with information, and...

7
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:26,711
...he reminds me of a ventriloquist
puppet that moves like this.

8
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,840
Albertico, it's not a bad word.

9
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,635
It's not an insult, man.
I say it with affection.

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,712
- He's a very good messenger.
- Really?

11
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:37,510
No, it's true. He's doing things
really well, he's always there.

12
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,910
Yes, he is.

13
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:40,560
You wanna play ball, Che?

14
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:45,198
Today is a perfect day to
abandon the guerrilla movement.

15
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:50,072
Another chance like this
may not come along for weeks.

16
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:53,753
Let's see.

17
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,359
Anyone who'd like to leave
this column, step forward.

18
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,274
Stand up there.

19
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:13,989
Come on,
the quitters and the horses' asses!

20
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,919
Stay there.

21
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:26,080
I'm not leaving because I'm scared.
I have a pain and...

22
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:28,192
You are a moron. Shut up.

23
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,472
- My mother is sick.
- You are a moron!

24
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,429
You'll have to give back everything
that belongs to the column.

25
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,792
You're a bunch of cowards.

26
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,311
You have
thirty minutes to get out of here.

27
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:48,474
If we find you, you're deserters.
Israel, Roberto, take them out.

28
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,874
Dickhead,
aren't you leaving with them?

29
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,278
Another faggot.

30
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,353
Anyone else?

31
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,391
So, did you grow balls?

32
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,077
We can still stand a little bit more.

33
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,472
You already behaved
with dignity...

34
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:18,270
...but you have no chance of
adapting to this warfare.

35
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,917
Okay, I'll make an exception.

36
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,873
I'll let you take your things
with you, I'll give you a guide...

37
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,836
...and 10 pesos to each of you.

38
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,519
Comandante.

39
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,637
I think you should
forgive me in advance...

40
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,036
...as I know you will not
like what I'm going to say.

41
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,633
If we joined the troops,
it wasn't to go back humiliated.

42
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,912
We prefer, and I speak for both...

43
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,594
...to die on this mountain rather than
return home as failures.

44
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,200
We'll make the maximum effort
even if it costs our lives.

45
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,472
This is the last straw.

46
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,390
While the strong
grow weaker and leave...

47
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:03,237
...these snot-nosed kids
get more courageous.

48
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,313
Is there any logic here?

49
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,873
The important ones aren't the ones
who leave, but the ones who stay...

50
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,440
...and the ones
who will join us in the future.

51
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,234
Listen to me.

52
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:27,279
Comandantes Raúl and Almeida
will come with me.

53
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:30,235
They will open the second and
third front with their columns.

54
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:32,514
Camilo...

55
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,311
...will replace Sardiñas
as your new captain.

56
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,796
Damn.

57
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,152
Look how generous the revolution is.

58
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,601
<i>Individualism, the isolated action
of a person in a social environment...</i>

59
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,314
<i>...must disappear from Cuba.</i>

60
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:19,030
<i>It's very easy
to claim that in capitalism...</i>

61
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,799
<i>...the individual
has the option to satisfy...</i>

62
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,676
<i>...or to express true human nature.</i>

63
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,958
<i>A child has one toy and wants two...</i>

64
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,036
<i>...that child gets
two toys and wants four.</i>

65
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,314
<i>This is human nature. Isn't it?</i>

66
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,390
<i>But when a whole society
behaves in that same way...</i>

67
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:42,952
<i>...or when it becomes a monopoly
oppressing the less fortunate...</i>

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,197
<i>...is that human nature?</i>

69
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:48,390
<i>This is exactly
when you have to do something.</i>

70
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,271
<i>Ye, of course,
we are individuals...</i>

71
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,873
<i>...who have accepted the
challenge and the responsibility...</i>

72
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,756
<i>...to lead in the name of society
as a whole.</i>

73
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:18,075
Long live free Cuba!

74
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,149
Will they have much time to respond?

75
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,236
Each one will have ten minutes.

76
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:31,470
- From the podium?
- No, from the floor.

77
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,795
- And my rebuttal?
- Ten minutes.

78
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:40,197
- Also from the floor?
- No, from the podium.

79
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,312
My government has nothing to do...

80
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,951
...with the fact that every day...

81
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:52,157
...in Cuban circles, to bolster
the illusions of the Cuban people...

82
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,393
...they announce
the formation of invading brigades...

83
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,277
...armed with revolvers...

84
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:02,951
...and small-calibre weapons
to confront an army that...

85
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,110
...according to
the declarations of their leaders...

86
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:13,318
...has at their disposal,
the most modern nuclear arms.

87
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:53,276
Absolutely false are...

88
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,830
...the accusations...

89
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,240
...that acts of genocide are being
committed in Venezuela.

90
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,470
Moreover,
it is simply absurd and intolerable...

91
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,958
...that a Cuban representative...

92
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:09,910
...dares to make judgements
about Venezuelan sovereignty...

93
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:14,040
...the unique and exclusive patrimony
of the Venezuelan people...

94
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,710
...a truly free people...

95
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,277
...which has
a democratic government...

96
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:24,396
...with elections whose legitimacy
are known to the entire world.

97
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:27,360
The tragedy
of the Cuban Revolution...

98
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,477
...lies in not having known how to
institutionalise this great movement...

99
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,521
...into an administration
with legal rights in the Americas.

100
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,521
The greatest flaw of their leaders...

101
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,754
...is that they suffer from excessive
vanity which blinds them...

102
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,520
...and prevents them
from observing past examples...

103
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,353
...which are typical of America...

104
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,471
...like the Mexican revolution
in 1910.

105
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:58,595
I, who lived
many years of my youth in Cuba...

106
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,400
...and who perhaps
feels more than Che Guevara...

107
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,512
...that there has
been enough suffering...

108
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,389
...and pain for the Cuban people.

109
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:12,317
In my brief reply to your capricious
intervention into Panamanian issues...

110
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:14,989
...I'd like to finish
by saying to you...

111
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:18,156
..."don't defend me, compadre."

112
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:22,269
JANUARY 1, 1958

113
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,196
Vilo!

114
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:01,835
Take the sick to the shelter!

115
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,754
To the shelter!
Take them to the shelter.

116
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,629
Don't run. Don't run.

117
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,392
Hurry up!

118
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:24,320
Come on!

119
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:25,272
Let's go in!

120
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,150
One, two, three.

121
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:02,316
Polo. Take the prisoners
to your house and keep them there.

122
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,520
Polo. Make sure no one mistreats
them, verbally or physically.

123
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,633
- Understood, Roberto?
- Sure.

124
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,514
Come on, walk!

125
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,360
Che!

126
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,315
They killed Ciro,
they shot him in the head.

127
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,759
We couldn't recover his body.

128
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,198
May I talk to you for a second, sir?

129
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,352
They were very well organized.

130
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,510
- More than we expected?
- Much more.

131
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:25,238
They have a school, hospital,
printing press, a power plant.

132
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,996
They must have been here months.

133
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,793
What do you want me to do
with this?

134
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:36,039
Torch it.

135
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,592
I need you to go to Minas del Frío...

136
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,757
...and create a training camp.

137
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,759
What for?

138
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:51,678
I want you to be personally
in charge of the new recruits.

139
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,671
What about my column?

140
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:59,669
Ramiro can take your place for now.

141
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,354
You know
we're days away from an attack.

142
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,399
- I don't understand.
- This is more important.

143
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,758
It makes sense, teach.

144
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:19,034
Who can do that better than you?

145
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,636
Tell me. No one, man.

146
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,431
Look, when this is over...

147
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,999
...Cuba and the revolution
will need you even more.

148
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,836
<i>Even if I had a different opinion...</i>

149
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,349
<i>...even if I felt I had been demoted...</i>

150
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:57,197
<i>...I knew Fidel had his reasons,
you can be sure of that...</i>

151
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,755
<i>Yes, that's why
Fidel backed the General Strike...</i>

152
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,552
<i>But he always made it really clear...</i>

153
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:11,878
<i>...that we were the only ones
capable of defeating the enemy.</i>

154
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,836
<i>After the failure
of the General Strike of April 9th...</i>

155
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,759
<i>...there was no more doubt.</i>

156
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:35,559
<i>The 26th of July Movement was the
only group that could defeat Batista.</i>

157
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,992
<i>That's what a leader does. He
convinces people to share his vision.</i>

158
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,717
<i>Tell her she's proved
one thing to me for sure...</i>

159
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:49,917
<i>...that I'd rather face a soldier
than a journalist.</i>

160
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,830
They see us rebels as agitators...

161
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:58,318
...people who want to gain prestige
by complicating Batista's life.

162
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,560
But we don't see ourselves like that.

163
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:04,353
We see ourselves as a small army
that will become a bigger army...

164
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,670
Fidel has to be the Commander
in Chief of the entire rebellion.

165
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:13,958
But we have to propose it with tact.

166
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:19,237
Our relationship with the Communist
Party still makes people nervous.

167
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:25,790
We raised funds by naming Fidel
as leader of our revolution.

168
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:32,399
Outside of Cuba, he's the only
recognizable figure we've got.

169
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,516
No one is saying that in the plains
they screwed up.

170
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,197
But what is clear
in Sierra Maestra...

171
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:43,030
...is that defeating Batista doesn't
assure the end of the dictatorship.

172
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:46,553
We also have to overthrow
Batista's army...

173
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,195
...in order to prevent another coup.

174
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,951
Being under
the command of the Soviet Union...

175
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,517
...isn't any better than being under
the command of the United States.

176
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,796
Latour, you're still thinking
like a colonized person does.

177
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,755
Cuba won't be
under anyone's command.

178
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:06,156
Cuba is for the Cuban people.

179
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,516
I'll do everything I can
with the Stalinists from the PSP...

180
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,951
...but I don't think
it will be worth it.

181
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,231
And we understand it, Faustino.

182
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,114
Precisely,
we always want to include...

183
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,953
"Stalinists"?

184
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:28,393
From now on, the coordination
of the plains militias...

185
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,876
...will serve the needs of
the guerrillas in Sierra Maestra.

186
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:38,633
Fidel Castro will become Commander
in Chief of all the armed forces.

187
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,437
Long live the Revolution!

188
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:48,556
MAY 3, 1958

189
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,996
I want to congratulate you, Fidel...

190
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,792
...because today you entered the path
of the greatest men of the Americas.

191
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,036
A path that...

192
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,636
...will prove to the world...

193
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:13,276
...it's possible to get to power
with an armed struggle...

194
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,553
...supported by the people.

195
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,599
It's not only me, Ernesto.

196
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,873
It's all of us.

197
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:26,557
This wouldn't be possible
if I were on my own.

198
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,075
I want you to organize a new front.

199
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,919
Once we start this offensive...

200
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,510
...I want to take the war down from
Sierra Maestra into the plains.

201
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,040
You'll have to unite
all the rebel factions.

202
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:48,830
We have to take control of Las Villas
Province, dividing the island in two.

203
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:54,039
Camilo's going to head in the same
direction, leading his own column.

204
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,797
There will be no victory in Havana...

205
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,631
...without victory in Las Villas.

206
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:07,470
Getting all the groups to work
together will be difficult, Ernesto.

207
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,591
So, I hope you have
sharpened your political skills.

208
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:16,399
And one other thing.

209
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,717
I know you are very reckless...

210
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,118
...but you can't always
put yourself on the front line.

211
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,471
You are too important to us.

212
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,558
It's an order.

213
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,831
I want to respond
to the Nicaraguan delegate...

214
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:42,518
...even though I did not understand
his argument about accent.

215
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,511
I believe he referred to Cuba...

216
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:50,634
...Argentina and somewhat
to Russia of the Soviet Union.

217
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,195
In any event,

218
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,040
I hope the Nicaraguan delegate

219
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,233
found no North American accent
in my speech,

220
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,077
because that
would be truly dangerous.

221
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,073
But one thing is for sure,
we don't commit assassinations...

222
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,831
...like the ones being committed
right at this moment...

223
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:12,390
...by the political police of
Venezuela who are called DIGEPOL...

224
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,474
...if I am not misinformed.

225
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,839
This police force has committed
a series of barbarous acts...

226
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:21,000
...executions, which is to say:
assassinate.

227
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,313
The Panamanian delegate...

228
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,555
...who has been kind
enough to call me "Che"...

229
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,678
...as I am called
by the Cuban people...

230
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,470
...began speaking
about the Mexican Revolution.

231
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,875
While Cuba spoke

232
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:36,039
about the North American
massacre in Panama...

233
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,754
...the Panamanian delegation...

234
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,358
...continued speaking in this vein,
without referring at all...

235
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,510
...to that American
massacre for which...

236
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:48,916
...the Panamanian government

237
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,760
broke off relations
to the United States.

238
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:56,958
On to Mr. Stevenson.
Regrettably, he is not present here.

239
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:02,753
Mr. Stevenson again claims
there is no violation of the law...

240
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,954
...that neither airplanes nor boats
leave from here and, of course...

241
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:10,793
...that pirate attacks just happen.
They just come out of nowhere.

242
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:14,796
Due to the demands of imperialism,

243
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,951
our Prime Minister
declared five points...

244
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,550
...to secure peace in the Caribbean.

245
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,794
And these are...

246
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:25,037
First:

247
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:30,271
A halt to the economic blockade and
all forms of commercial pressure...

248
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:35,510
...imposed by the United States all
over the world against our country.

249
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:36,877
Second:

250
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,595
Halt all subversive activities,
such as...

251
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,395
...the launch and distribution
of arms and explosives

252
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:43,954
by air and water...

253
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,511
...organization
of mercenary invasions...

254
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,712
...infiltration of spies and saboteurs...

255
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:54,153
...and all actions carried out from
the territory of the United States...

256
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,558
...or accomplice countries.

257
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:58,431
Third:

258
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:02,516
Halt all pirate attacks
carried out from bases located...

259
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:04,797
...in the United States
and Puerto Rico.

260
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,437
Fourth:

261
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,997
Halt all airspace
and territorial water violations...

262
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:16,319
...by U.S. aircraft and warships.

263
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,231
Fifth:

264
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:20,750
Withdrawal from the
Guantánamo naval base

265
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:24,437
...and return of Cuban territory
occupied by the U.S.

266
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:34,357
This great mass of humanity has said
"Enough!" and has stepped forward.

267
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:40,354
This march of giants will not stop
until true independence is won...

268
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,833
...for which so many died in vain.

269
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,879
All of this, my fellow delegates...

270
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,718
...is the new stance of
the American continent...

271
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:55,074
...a stance captured by the cry...

272
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:58,114
...that is shouted
every day by our people...

273
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,712
...as an expression of our
irrefutable decision to fight...

274
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,111
...paralysing the strikes
of armed intruders...

275
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:08,997
...an outcry that counts the support
of all working classes of the world...

276
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:13,154
...and especially the socialist camp
headed by the Soviet Union.

277
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:16,717
This cry is "Homeland or death!"

278
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,080
Che!

279
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:43,231
That's Las Villas,
behind the clouds.

280
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,991
OCTOBER 15, 1958

281
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,911
Camilo arrived a few weeks ago and
we put ourselves under his command.

282
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,193
- Very good.
- Oh, I see you received our supplies.

283
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:02,871
Yes, thanks. Of all the groups
operating in the area...

284
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,470
...the Communist Party was
the only one to send help.

285
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,194
I'm not surprised, Comandante.

286
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,239
Most of these groups
are too busy fighting each other.

287
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:16,077
Months ago, Menoyo broke from the
Directory, creating a Second Front.

288
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:19,236
Since then, each one has carved out
its own territory.

289
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,439
There's been open hostility
between the two factions.

290
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,950
Where does the 26th of
July Movement stand in all of this?

291
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,594
Recently,
Menoyo met with Víctor Bordón.

292
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,640
I think both groups...

293
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,072
...are on the brink
of an armed confrontation.

294
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,753
We're ready to cooperate
with the 26th of July Movement...

295
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,350
...in all military manoeuvres.

296
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:45,351
We even agree with
agrarian reform...

297
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:49,440
...as long as it's done reasonably...

298
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,473
...and brings in money.

299
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:56,313
Landowners should be pressured...

300
00:22:57,561 --> 00:23:00,712
...to sell their idle land
to the peasants.

301
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,637
But it should be sold at cost.

302
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:06,591
Will you be the one fixing the price?

303
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,509
How can a peasant
with no money buy land?

304
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,879
But, what do you want?
Just give it to them?

305
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:16,751
So they can destroy it
like they did in Mexico?

306
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,634
The owner of the land
is the one who works it.

307
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:21,791
Comandante,

308
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,637
you have permission to institute
agrarian reform in the region...

309
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:29,558
...but the Second Front will continue
to charge the land taxes.

310
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:35,152
Menoyo, the region belongs to us all.
What we have to do here is fight.

311
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:39,196
The only thing
the Directory won't do...

312
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:43,070
...is any kind of deal
with Menoyo's Second Front.

313
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:47,117
We'll never do business
with that bunch of bandits.

314
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:49,960
We need to attack
all the army garrisons in the area.

315
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:53,233
But you can't attack Güinía de
Miranda because that zone is ours.

316
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,912
We have more experience
and more weapons than you do.

317
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:00,877
Do you think the Americans are just
going to sit and watch this happen?

318
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:03,397
No, man, listen.

319
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:10,235
We shouldn't be
doing things so openly.

320
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:15,313
So, you're one of those who think
we can make a revolution...

321
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,757
...behind the backs of the Americans?

322
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:21,712
No, man.
A real revolution cannot be hidden.

323
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,278
I can do more
with the four hundred rifles I have...

324
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,075
...than you can
with your little bazooka...

325
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,150
...and all the balls
your troops may have.

326
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:39,040
Look, Peña, the day I have
to take arms against my comrades...

327
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,316
...will be the day I stop fighting.

328
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:48,118
If you don't take Güinía de Miranda
in five days, we'll do it ourselves.

329
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,920
I am Comandante Ernesto Guevara.

330
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:57,356
He is Comandante Ramiro Valdés.

331
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:01,154
And he is Captain Victor Bordón.

332
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,838
I just want to say three things.

333
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,155
First:

334
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:13,193
From now on, I am the only one...

335
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,999
...in charge of
the region of Las Villas.

336
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:20,233
Second:

337
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,593
We will enforce strict discipline.

338
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,600
And third:

339
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,230
The fighting is going to intensify.

340
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:37,070
Whoever is not ready to sacrifice
himself for his homeland...

341
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,479
...can leave his gun on the ground...

342
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:42,114
...and abandon the column...

343
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,035
...immediately.

344
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,836
Fire.

345
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,320
Give it to me, damn it!

346
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,640
Homeland or death!

347
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:11,749
You're ready?

348
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:21,670
Thank you.

349
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:33,834
Tell Oltuski the money
will be put to good use.

350
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,799
Will do.

351
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,954
Excuse me.

352
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:43,591
The police are looking for me
in Santa Clara and want to arrest me.

353
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:46,037
I need to stay here.
I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:50,678
Well, you can stay
and work in the infirmary...

355
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:53,590
...because we don't
allow people to just hang around.

356
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,434
I want you to know that
for the last two years...

357
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,433
...I've been working in the
clandestine movement.

358
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:03,311
I've been taking weapons, bombs, and
fugitives all across the province.

359
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:06,276
I think that gives me the right
to become a guerrilla

360
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,076
Okay.

361
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,676
We've started taxing...

362
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,754
...some of the largest landowners.

363
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,793
I need someone to collect the money.

364
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,309
You can start with that
and then we'll see.

365
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,440
Thanks.

366
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,075
Ramiro.

367
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,999
The girl here will collect the taxes.

368
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:26,953
Okay.

369
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,879
<i>We were finally
working with the other groups.</i>

370
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:44,433
<i>It was like a wave.</i>

371
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:49,233
<i>When we arrived in the towns,
people received us with open arms.</i>

372
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:52,272
<i>And many of them even joined us.</i>

373
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:00,030
<i>True, but in reality, that battle...</i>

374
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:02,632
<i>...had been building steam...</i>

375
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,832
<i>...for nearly 100 years.</i>

376
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:09,879
<i>When people hate their government,
it's not too hard to take a town.</i>

377
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,914
One machine gun, 180 rifles...

378
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,277
...and 9,000 rounds of ammunition.

379
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,713
Víctor, we need you to blow
the Cabaiguán bridge.

380
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:33,917
The Cabaiguán bridge? Now?

381
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,799
Yes. Now.

382
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,396
How did it go?

383
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,993
I couldn't collect the money.

384
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:45,080
In Placetas, the police
are looking for me, too.

385
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,595
Rogelio!

386
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:48,752
<i>Take the compañeras back to camp.</i>

387
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:51,640
Wait a minute.
With all due respect...

388
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:55,831
...I know these towns like the back
of my hand. Let me be your guide.

389
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,233
I already have a guide.

390
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,637
Don't worry.
I know you're going to stay with us.

391
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:16,715
Don't be like that. Calm down, girl.

392
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:19,274
Don't worry.

393
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,593
Do you know Cabaiguán?

394
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,478
And tell Millián
to have his people ready.

395
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,474
We'll attack the garrison.

396
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:48,989
Perfect.

397
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:59,676
Che.

398
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,918
We have to give you a tetanus shot.

399
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,555
No, it might trigger
an asthma attack.

400
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:08,998
Give me some aspirin.

401
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,629
Comandante, this is the Virgin
of Caridad del Cobre...

402
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:21,116
...the patron saint of Cuba to help
your arrival in Havana.

403
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,836
I hope it helps us
arrive in Placetas.

404
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,119
Goodbye!

405
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,752
- How are you? Does it hurt?
- A little, but that's unavoidable.

406
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:35,113
Here, for your arm.

407
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,029
Thanks.

408
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,800
Long live the revolution!

409
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,110
Shit, Argentine.
You broke your paw?

410
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:03,790
What happened to you?

411
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,549
- I just spoke to Fidel.
- And?

412
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,277
Santiago has almost surrendered.

413
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,631
Santa Clara is the only thing
standing between us and Havana.

414
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:14,878
Batista's throwing everything
he's got to Santa Clara.

415
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,196
That's why...

416
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:19,639
...when you take Remedios
and I take Yaguajay...

417
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:22,116
...we can then take
Santa Clara together.

418
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,075
Give me a light.

419
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,391
I know what I'm going
to do when we win this thing.

420
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:36,399
I'll put you in a cage...

421
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,910
...tour the country
and charge admission.

422
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,913
We'll be rich, man!

423
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,230
What made you join the Movement?

424
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:55,153
Well, I was in college when Fidel
attacked the Moncada barracks.

425
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,474
When I read his speech defence
plea, "History Will Absolve Me"...

426
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,556
...I knew he was the only one
who could take down Batista.

427
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:05,079
And that he would do it fighting,
and I liked that.

428
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:08,759
- Does your family support you?
- Of course.

429
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,391
My cousin was killed.

430
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,949
The brutality of the army
intensified after the general strike.

431
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,796
I think they got scared...

432
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,435
...when they saw
so many people against them.

433
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,797
You don't look like a Communist.

434
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:32,754
And what do Communists
look like?

435
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,280
Well, not like you.

436
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,957
We come in all colours.

437
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:45,472
Do you expect to stay in Cuba
after the success of the Revolution?

438
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,596
My wife and my daughter
are in Mexico.

439
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:50,872
I have to keep them in mind.

440
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:53,554
Of course.

441
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:59,195
I'm Lieutenant Pérez Valencia.

442
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,553
The rebel army...

443
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,831
...is not what you have imagined.

444
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,601
Hand over your weapons
and no one will be injured.

445
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:09,839
Stay on the air, over.

446
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:12,432
Santa Clara
hasn't sent reinforcements.

447
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,273
It's a lost cause for these people.

448
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,993
<i>Attention, Che, attention.
Che, attention, Che.</i>

449
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:20,511
Listen, could you resolve
the problem and follow...

450
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:24,430
...the instructions, the instructions
you gave me with the man I sent...

451
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:27,314
<i>...so tell me if you understand,
understand, understand me.</i>

452
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:28,590
<i>Over, Che.</i>

453
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,156
Camilo, I hear you perfectly...

454
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:35,276
...your record is broken,
you have to change it. Over.

455
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:39,120
How long will you be in Yaguajay?
Over.

456
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,875
<i>Three days, maybe a week.
Over.</i>

457
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:44,516
The more time you stay there...

458
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,713
...the harder it will be here, Camilo.
Over.

459
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:52,270
<i>Don't dare to enter the city
without me, do you hear?</i>

460
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:56,273
Camilo, it's fair to
share the glory sometimes. Over.

461
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,991
Sharing the glory is fine,
but with an Argentine...

462
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:02,311
...don't do that to me.

463
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,313
Over and out, Che.

464
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,993
It's good to have you in Santa Clara,
Colonel Casillas.

465
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:26,150
The city's forces
are at your disposal.

466
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,999
Can those forces
get me some coffee?

467
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:33,274
The best beans in the world, Colonel.

468
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,394
Sit down.

469
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,316
<i>Santa Clara was all they had left.</i>

470
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:38,439
<i>...the only thing linking Havana
to the country as a whole.</i>

471
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:41,437
<i>...though we hadn't slept for days...</i>

472
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:44,678
<i>...and the army
outnumbered us nine to one...</i>

473
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:48,637
<i>...at that point, safely waiting
for Camilo seemed to us,</i>

474
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,320
<i>more dangerous.</i>

475
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,760
<i>People of Santa Clara...</i>

476
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,319
<i>...this is Comandante Guevara
speaking.</i>

477
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,915
<i>The enemy wants us to live in fear...</i>

478
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,873
<i>...but it is they who should be afraid.</i>

479
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:07,078
<i>The situation of the military regime
is getting worse every day...</i>

480
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:10,996
<i>...because their soldiers
don't want to fight.</i>

481
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:15,437
<i>Santa Clara...</i>

482
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:19,154
<i>...if there has ever been
a time to fight</i>

483
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:23,718
<i>...for our freedom,
that time is now.</i>

484
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,439
That moment has come.

485
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,956
I want air strikes...

486
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,831
...all around the neighbourhoods.

487
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,878
Torch those bastards!

488
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,159
He's dead.

489
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,240
Cover him with that sheet.

490
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,034
I need more help.

491
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,754
- Aleida.
- The situation is critical.

492
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:35,714
Talk to Camajuani
and ask for more doctors.

493
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:27,236
Yes?

494
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:30,874
Comandante, it's Rogelio
calling from the station.

495
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:36,157
Speak to me, Rogelio.

496
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,400
Comandante,
we took the train station.

497
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,239
Is it safe?

498
00:39:43,521 --> 00:39:44,556
Good.

499
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:48,913
Go with 15 men to the train tracks
between Toscano and San Pedro...

500
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,199
...and wait there.

501
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,080
Alright.

502
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,360
The tank is screwing us...

503
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:53,755
The machine gun
doesn't let us get closer.

504
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:55,030
For Guile and Ramiro.

505
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:57,391
- What's the highest position?
- The church at the end of the street.

506
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,115
Then you have to take the church,
you must take the church.

507
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,276
Of course, Comandante.

508
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:05,150
Go.

509
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:18,075
Hit it hard.

510
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,394
How many houses
do we have to cross?

511
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,317
Five.

512
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:32,321
Little Cowboy, it's too many.

513
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,474
Hit it hard. Fuck.
We have to break it down now!

514
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:48,634
Get down, Little Cowboy,
you're going to get hit.

515
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,035
Stay here.

516
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:55,999
Aleida!

517
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:15,951
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The SIM is on the hotel rooftop.

518
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,273
They hit Little Cowboy.

519
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:24,198
Tamayo. What happened?

520
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,759
They got Little Cowboy,
Comandante.

521
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:29,916
What happened to him?

522
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,073
We claimed a rooftop
to get a good position...

523
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:36,753
...and then, he got shot in the head.
They killed him.

524
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:48,273
Take him to the medical station.

525
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,720
Tamayo.

526
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,430
You are now in charge
of the suicide platoon.

527
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:02,076
Keep breaking the walls
until you reach the church.

528
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:04,200
They need to pay for this.

529
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:16,234
The rebels
have surrounded the city

530
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,597
and our tanks
can't cross the barricades.

531
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:21,634
Shit.

532
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,551
Get Havana on the phone.

533
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:31,352
Tell them to airlift
men from Cienfuegos.

534
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:36,516
We're going to secure this city
neighbourhood by neighbourhood...

535
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,793
...and street by street.

536
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:41,117
Send a battalion.

537
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:55,110
Where are you going?

538
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:58,518
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired of this.

539
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,033
Let me go.

540
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,916
Anyone else want to leave?

541
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:16,637
Cease fire!

542
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,437
Cease fire!

543
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,318
Tell your men
to put down their arms.

544
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,516
I'm not going to negotiate
with a subordinate.

545
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:45,193
You forgot to leave your gun.

546
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,199
- Give me that gun.
- No, no. Take your belt off.

547
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:54,354
I said I wouldn't negotiate
with a subordinate.

548
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:57,674
That's okay.
This isn't a negotiation.

549
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:00,434
Comandante.

550
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:03,515
I give you my word of honour that
if you let us return to Havana...

551
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:05,552
...we won't fire another shot.

552
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,992
I believe your word of honour.

553
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,916
But I can't let those bullets kill
more Cubans. Here or anywhere else.

554
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:16,597
You have 15 minutes
to convince your men to surrender.

555
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:21,233
If not, you will be
responsible for any bloodshed.

556
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,475
Shit!

557
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:35,717
Send this box to Camilo in Yaguajay.

558
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:37,754
Aleida, come here.

559
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:11,838
Call them on the telephone.

560
00:49:13,441 --> 00:49:17,559
We agree to a ceasefire to get
our dead and wounded.

561
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:27,360
- I advise you to surrender.
- Over my dead body.

562
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:31,789
What's wrong with you?
Where are you going?

563
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:40,558
Your Colonel wants you
to fight to the death.

564
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:44,470
We don't want more Cubans to die.

565
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:47,959
Give up your weapons...

566
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,998
...and you will live.

567
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:57,030
Turn in your weapons!

568
00:49:58,601 --> 00:49:59,670
Now!

569
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,674
Well.

570
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:22,352
The Colonel and I...

571
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:26,071
...are going on a special mission
to check our positions.

572
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:31,238
Keep up the resistance
until I return, is that clear?

573
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:33,079
Whatever you say, Colonel.

574
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,711
Shoot anyone who tries to leave.

575
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:53,350
Who is this?

576
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:56,314
That's Sánchez, the police captain.

577
00:50:57,281 --> 00:50:59,841
We found torture instruments
in the station.

578
00:51:06,361 --> 00:51:09,558
You know,
I have an idea to take the hotel.

579
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:12,149
Tell me.

580
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:14,040
Leave it to me.

581
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:22,079
Don't shoot,
don't shoot, we surrender!

582
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,274
Turn in your weapons!

583
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,993
Come on, hurry up!

584
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:55,911
Camilo took Yaguajay and he
and his troops are heading this way.

585
00:52:57,361 --> 00:52:59,556
We just heard the news
on the short-wave.

586
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,150
It looks like Batista
abandoned the country.

587
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,038
Yes, sir. Right now.

588
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:15,597
It's General Cantillo calling
from Havana.

589
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:18,433
Okay, leave.

590
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:21,310
Yes, General?

591
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:25,799
<i>I'm negotiating directly with
the U.S. ambassador.</i>

592
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:31,079
<i>I'm in command of the army now,
acting on behalf of Fidel Castro.</i>

593
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:35,110
<i>I authorize you to negotiate
a truce, but not to surrender.</i>

594
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:38,116
<i>You can't surrender
under any circumstances.</i>

595
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,678
As you say, General.

596
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:46,436
Captain!

597
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,833
I need to talk to Guevara.

598
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:54,713
I've spoken to Fidel Castro. There's
been no deal with General Cantillo.

599
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:58,918
This is a revolution, not a coup.

600
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:02,358
It's either unconditional surrender
or we'll take the garrison...

601
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,074
...by force.

602
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:06,910
And you'll be responsible
for the bloodshed.

603
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:11,559
Be aware of the possibility that
the U.S. government will intervene...

604
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,553
...militarily in Cuba.

605
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:16,992
If that happens,
it would be an even bigger crime...

606
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:20,720
...as you will be supporting
a foreign invasion.

607
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,591
In that case, your only
remaining option would be...

608
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:26,554
...for you to shoot yourself
for committing treason.

609
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,999
Mr. Guevara, I need to talk
with my superiors about that.

610
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:36,359
It's nineteen minutes past ten.

611
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:41,911
At eleven, I'll give the order
to attack using all our forces.

612
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:58,513
Sir, may I return home
to my family?

613
00:54:58,721 --> 00:54:59,312
No.

614
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,273
But we won the revolution already!

615
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:04,439
We just won the war,
the revolution begins now.

616
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:13,799
Get all your things,
we're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

617
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:15,760
Aleida, you, too.

618
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,119
I'll need a guide.

619
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,638
- But I don't know Havana very well.
- Neither do I.

620
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,679
This man
wants to say hello to you.

621
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,236
Thanks for all
you've done for Cuba.

622
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:31,592
Not me - all of them.
All of them.

623
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:38,959
Get ready.
We're leaving for Havana tomorrow.

624
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:50,874
He told me he was heading
to Havana to participate

625
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,355
in a military junta...

626
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:55,195
...which was going to resolve
the problems of the Cuban people.

627
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:59,157
I told him murderers like him weren't
going to resolve anything anymore.

628
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,670
When I told him I was bringing
him to you, he pissed in his pants.

629
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:06,237
He begged me
to take him to another chief.

630
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,754
What do you want
me to do with this guy?

631
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:12,511
Keep him as a prisoner of war.
He will be judged by a tribunal.

632
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:16,235
Comandante, place him under
special watch.

633
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:17,715
Sure.

634
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,478
- Son of a bitch!
- Bandit!

635
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:25,029
I can't see anything,
then I turn around...

636
00:56:25,321 --> 00:56:29,473
...and I see Roberto in the jeep,
holding the grenade...

637
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,359
...with the pin still in it.

638
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:32,516
You're kidding.

639
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:35,440
So he's looking at me, smiling,
like I'm stupid.

640
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:38,794
But, when he came out of the jeep
I swear to you...

641
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,753
...he stood up,
acting like a tough guy...

642
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:42,189
...still holding the grenade
in his hand...

643
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,318
...just like this, boy.

644
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:47,678
He could barely walk because
his knees were shaking so hard...

645
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:49,200
...and suddenly...

646
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:52,120
...his eyes went up and then...

647
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:57,157
...he fainted with the grenade
in his hand with the pin still in it.

648
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,159
Good one!

649
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:08,600
Who has a light?

650
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:10,275
Not me.

651
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,279
Hey, this was mine!

652
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,271
- Gentlemen.
- So, then?

653
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:26,274
I'm going to the Capital.
Thanks for everything.

654
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:28,631
- See you in Havana.
- Of course.

655
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,679
Ernesto.

656
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:40,230
Okay.

657
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:42,996
- Take care.
- Yes, Che.

658
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:45,033
Don't worry, my man.

659
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:46,119
So then?

660
00:58:46,641 --> 00:58:48,279
Are you coming with us?

661
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:52,280
Yes. Under one condition.

662
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:53,596
Which?

663
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:55,553
When we're done in Cuba...

664
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:58,560
...you let me bring
the revolution to all Latin America.

665
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,880
You, too, are a little crazy.

666
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:10,716
It's a thing that I haven't seen
anybody doing, look.

667
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,715
The rice is the most
important thing, if you take...

668
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:19,440
Comandante,
do you need my services tonight?

669
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,311
Son, you're killing me!

670
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:26,753
Did I make you angry
with what I said the other night?

671
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:30,001
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I was thinking.

672
00:59:32,761 --> 00:59:36,834
No, son, you are loved,
as they say in Cuba.

673
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,675
- Goodnight, Comandante.
- Do what you need to do.

674
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,400
<i>A symbol of what?</i>

675
00:59:49,441 --> 00:59:52,956
<i>I can tell you one thing.
We were very aware...</i>

676
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:57,154
<i>...that we represented the hopes
of the unredeemed Americas.</i>

677
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,874
<i>And all eyes,</i>

678
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:04,151
<i>the oppressors...
as much as the oppressed</i>

679
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:06,713
<i>...were on us.</i>

680
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:14,353
<i>I was thirty.</i>

681
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:22,559
See you in Havana!

682
01:00:23,401 --> 01:00:24,629
It's Rogelio.

683
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:25,916
Tell him to stop.

684
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:27,510
Rogelio.

685
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:29,393
- What?
- Rogelio.

686
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:30,829
Yes, tell him to stop.

687
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,840
What are you doing with that car?

688
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:38,120
I'm driving it to Havana.

689
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,959
Who gave you authorization?

690
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:43,552
I took it. It belonged
to one of the snipers, man.

691
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:45,999
Don't "man" me, Rogelio.

692
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:49,511
Even if it was Batista's,
this car isn't yours.

693
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:54,279
Go back to Santa Clara
immediately and give it back.

694
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:59,876
And then you will go to Havana
by bus, by jeep or on foot!

695
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:03,519
I'd rather walk than drive
to Havana in a stolen car. Let's go!

696
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:09,515
JANUARY 2, 1959
186 MILES FROM HAVANA

697
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:28,400
Unbelievable.
