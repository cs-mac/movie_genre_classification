Hey, y'all.
Gonna be a scorcher today.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,930
Phew!

15
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,695
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

16
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,785
Grandma?

17
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,827
It's all right, Red.
We're gonna get out of this.

18
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,285
- Garth?
- Yes, Mother.

19
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,495
Did you get a good look at anybody?
Recognize anyone?

20
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,835
No, Mother.

21
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,802
Shh.
I think someone's coming.

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,804
Check their restraints.

23
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,822
You wanna tell us
what the hell we're doin' here?

24
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,846
Shut up.

25
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,158
You're tellin' me to shut up?

26
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,062
I don't think you know whose weeds
you're pissing in, buddy.

27
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,537
- I said shut up.
- I heard you.

28
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,561
I chose to ignore you.

29
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,397
Who are you working for, huh?

30
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,491
Did Jerry Falwell put you up to this, huh?
The Baptists, that it?

31
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,588
- Mother, please.
- I think we're good.

32
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,202
All right, let's go.

33
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,241
Cocksuckers,
you're not gonna get away with this!

34
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,077
Don't you know who I am?

35
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,497
God damn it.

36
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,389
So, Mr. Collier,
you say the cars are gone now.

37
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,573
Shouldn't they just be in them?

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,177
The door was open,
breakfast on the table,

39
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,586
- and they'd never leave without the dogs.
- Mmm-hmm.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,940
And you say that this lady lives here
with her son and his daughter?

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,653
Yes. Uh, no.
The granddaughter's from her other son.

42
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
It's an interesting living arrangement.

43
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,533
Wait a minute.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,156
Madalyn Murray O'Hair.
That's who we're talking about here?

45
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,371
Are you sure that this isn't just another
one of her publicity stunts?

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,173
Aren't you even gonna take
any fingerprints, sir?

47
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,011
Mr. Collier, this is Texas.

48
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,255
Not against the law to go missing here.

49
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,532
Garth, I loosened it.
I loosened it.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,451
Come here. Give me your hands.
Give me your hands.

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,870
- What are you...
- Give me your hands.

52
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,524
Just get it untied. That's...

53
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,164
- I... I can't.
- You can do it.

54
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,375
- Oh, my God. It's really...
- That's it. That's it.

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,710
What kind of knot is that?

56
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,404
Come on.
You can do it.

57
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,315
Well, get closer to me, then.

58
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,084
Oh, all right.

59
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,454
- Jesus!
- Come on.

60
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,952
Oh. Almost.
I almost got...

61
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,294
- Come on.
- No, I... No, it's not...

62
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,806
- It's useless. It's not gonna happen.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

63
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,460
I knew I should have sent you
to fucking Boy Scouts.

64
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,310
I don't know what you think
you're gonna do anyway.

65
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,344
They both have guns.

66
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,629
If we could get these hoods off,

67
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,382
we might have a better idea
of what we're dealing with.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,011
- Come on. Try again.
- No.

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,821
- Come on, Garthy...
- No, stop it.

70
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,715
Don't you disobey your mother!

71
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,574
Or what, you're gonna
take me over your knee?

72
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,827
- Yes, I just might...
- Stop it, both of you!

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,650
God damn it, I have to pee.

74
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,982
Hey, people!

75
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,658
If you don't let me out of here,
I'm gonna piss all over your floor!

76
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,037
Lady, you're gonna
need to calm down.

77
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,251
Calm down?
You want me to calm down, shit for brains?

78
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,561
In case you hadn't noticed,
we've got bags over our heads,

79
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,545
we're all tied up and I gotta pee!

80
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,969
You do what we say and everyone
gets out of here safe and sound.

81
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,470
Oh, now that sounds
like the big man in charge.

82
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,012
Is that the big man in charge?

83
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,056
Get this goddamn thing off of my head
and show me who you are.

84
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,480
You think you got
the balls to take me on?

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,599
Jesus Christ.

86
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,523
What?
What's going on?

87
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,206
Garth, what's going on?

88
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,154
- Oh, my God.
- Robin.

89
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,235
Oh, my God,
is that who I think it is?

90
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,698
Fuck.

91
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,831
Hello, Madalyn.

92
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,049
- <i>This is Bill Murray.</i>
- Bill, it's Roy. Roy Collier.

93
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,172
What do you want?

94
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>It's your mom... and Robin and Garth.</i>

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,390
<i>They've disappeared.</i>

96
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,595
I just saw them in Dallas.

97
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,721
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

98
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,977
<i>The police said that in order for somebody
to officially be considered missing,</i>

99
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,941
<i>they need somebody in the family
to file a report.</i>

100
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,363
Why would I do that?

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,360
Besides, they're probably off
on some crazy trip again.

102
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,703
<i>- No, this is different, Bill.</i>
- Roy...

103
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,859
you know they're not in my life anymore.

104
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,408
And, frankly,
I'd like to keep it that way.

105
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,542
Okay?

106
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,828
<i>Bill...</i>

107
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,931
Ferguson...

108
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,394
I need those 600 words
on the Alamo anniversary by 5:00.

109
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,522
Relax, man. It's the same story I wrote
last year and the year before that.

110
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,914
Well, can't help it
if nothing ever happens in San Antonio.

111
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,478
No, plenty happens in San Antonio.
I just don't get to write about it.

112
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,816
Where you going?

113
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,315
Shit.

114
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,742
- Jack Ferguson.
<i>- This is the reporter?</i>

115
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,076
On a good day.

116
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,501
<i>You know Madalyn Murray O'Hair?
She's disappeared.</i>

117
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,831
Madalyn Murray O'Hair?

118
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,825
<i>The damn cops won't do anything.</i>

119
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,337
<i>Only thing I could think to do
was call a reporter.</i>

120
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,710
- Who's this?
<i>- Name's Roy. But I gotta go.</i>

121
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,297
<i>If you wanna know more,
come by 1682 Greystone Drive tonight.</i>

122
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,014
- What...
<i>- I'll be there.</i>

123
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,465
Hello?

124
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,132
Madalyn?

125
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,719
Bless this food to our use...

126
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,378
and us to thy service.

127
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,797
- Amen.
- Amen.

128
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,215
Now, I don't suppose
you found a job today?

129
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,466
I had an interview.

130
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,885
But I didn't get a law degree
to be a damn receptionist.

131
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,358
You'd be lucky
to be someone's receptionist.

132
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,109
If I were you, I'd start praying.

133
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,731
How do you put up with him, Mother?

134
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,277
The question is, how do I tolerate you?

135
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,116
Living here for free.

136
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,078
- Bringing a bastard into my house.
- Pup!

137
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,787
Don't you ever call my son that.

138
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,250
Sweetie, why don't you just take
your dinner and go on to our room? Hmm?

139
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,884
I am sorry, Billy Boy.

140
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,710
I was just trying to make a point
about your momma, huh?

141
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,218
I've got a point I'd like to make.

142
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,345
What else is new?

143
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,471
No, this is important.

144
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,928
Got an announcement.

145
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,603
Getting another grandchild.

146
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,478
That's right. Your precious daughter's
got herself knocked up again.

147
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,026
- Oh, honey, no.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,989
And the guy's kicked me to the curb again,
saying it's not his,

149
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,661
when I know for a fact
it absolutely is his.

150
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,950
You're an embarrassment.

151
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,911
That's right.
That's right.

152
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,124
Walk away.

153
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,539
Just like they did.

154
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,842
I'm sorry, Mother.

155
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:15,675
- You wanna tell me what happened?
- I don't know. Condom broke?

156
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,313
You sure you wanna keep it?

157
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,885
I mean, I can take care of Pup,
and you know how he loves little Bill,

158
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,308
and hopefully he'll come around.

159
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,517
He's right.

160
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,531
I got a law degree and no job,
and a kid and no husband.

161
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,661
The only thing I do have is judgment.
I get plenty of that.

162
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,529
Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes,
that's all.

163
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,327
You know, I see these housewives
in their identical homes

164
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,752
with their identical lives, and...

165
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,125
They disgust me, but sometimes I...

166
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,797
I wish I could be like that,
wish I could live like that.

167
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,472
But I can't.

168
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,220
I don't know what to tell you.

169
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,512
Mom, just lie to me.

170
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,555
- Tell me everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh...

171
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,899
Well, I could be a secretary.

172
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,982
Telephone operator.

173
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,186
You could sell Avon like Ms. Wright.

174
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,241
We're just too damn smart for these hicks.

175
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,785
- We will fight!
- What's going on?

176
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,248
I'll bet they're going
to the White Tower restaurant.

177
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,382
Why?

178
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,666
Well, Billy Boy...

179
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,262
not all people are treated the same
in this world.

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,050
Because they're non...

181
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,224
- Noncon...
- Nonconformist?

182
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,143
- Yeah.
- Well, you could say that, I guess.

183
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:44,142
White Tower won't serve Negroes...
so they're protesting.

184
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,307
And if they protest, will that make
the White Tower serve them?

185
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,239
No, the owners of that place
are damn racists.

186
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,949
Makes me so mad.

187
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,948
I bet they call themselves
Christians, too.

188
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,176
Grandpa says you might find a job
if you were more Christian.

189
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,030
Ah, your grandpa's full of crap.

190
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,947
Grandpa says you're the one full of crap.

191
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,036
Excuse me?

192
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,474
Well, you're always going on
about what's wrong with people,

193
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,668
but you don't do anything about it.

194
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,500
You just complain.

195
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,115
<i>Close to 100 demonstrators</i>

196
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,101
<i>stepped out to protest
the whites-only policy</i>

197
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,314
<i>of the White Tower restaurant
in downtown Baltimore.</i>

198
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,476
<i>The activists were met
with some resistance</i>

199
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,645
<i>from supporters of segregation.</i>

200
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,534
<i>I think that, uh, as much
as we regret it, integration is here,</i>

201
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:42,584
<i>and I would like to be able to do
as much as I can to prevent it coming.</i>

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,250
<i>But one white woman
and her son actually showed up</i>

203
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,210
<i>to march with the Negroes.</i>

204
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,840
<i>The owners of the White Tower restaurant
should be ashamed of themselves.</i>

205
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,628
<i>This is Baltimore, not Nazi Germany.</i>

206
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,173
<i>And what about you,
young man? Why are you here?</i>

207
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,258
<i>I'm here
because I don't like racists,</i>

208
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,433
<i>and because I'm a nonconformist
like my mom.</i>

209
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,142
That's my boy.

210
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,271
What were you thinking?

211
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,109
I was trying to teach
your grandson a lesson.

212
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,272
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

213
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,313
What about the neighbors?

214
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,477
What do you care
what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?

215
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,566
You really are one selfish SOB.

216
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,703
Just 'cause you read
the goddamn Bible every night,

217
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,991
you think you're
so high and mighty and moral,

218
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,825
when there are people out there

219
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,201
who are actually,
really, truly suffering...

220
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,517
- You know, I've got some cold cuts...
- Mother, it's all...

221
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,251
You have no right
to lecture me about morality.

222
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:37,086
You can take your morals
and shove them up your ass.

223
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,223
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul, Madalyn.

224
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,141
Ooh, the Lord.
I'm quaking in my boots.

225
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,809
Where was the Lord
when I got knocked up, huh?

226
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,679
Where is the Lord now?

227
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,861
What, Mother?

228
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,032
<i>I believe we need
a spiritual revolution in America.</i>

229
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,035
<i>We need a revolt against materialism,</i>

230
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,198
<i>a revolt against crime,</i>

231
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,417
<i>a revolt against the emphasis on sex,</i>

232
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,879
<i>a revolt against the sins...</i>

233
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,049
It's like I keep telling you,
it's just case after case down there.

234
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,189
Such a shame.

235
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,763
And then I've got
this Negro girl with a baby,

236
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,551
who got thrown out of her home,
and there is no place to put her.

237
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,755
I mean, no place whatsoever.

238
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,905
- We have looked...
- Mom.

239
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,059
Just a sec, Bill.

240
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,929
No idea why I went into social work.

241
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,887
I thought I could help people.

242
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,608
But I can't.
There's too much red tape...

243
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,207
- Mom!
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

244
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,691
I said, "Just a sec."

245
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,610
Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?

246
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,948
<i>You can find everything
that you've been searching for in Christ.</i>

247
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,122
And I'd better not come home and find
my son watching that claptrap with you.

248
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,413
I don't want him getting any ideas.

249
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,917
I'm gonna get in trouble again.

250
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,088
Well, it's not my fault
you missed the bus.

251
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,965
Okay. All right, I'll talk to the teacher
if I have to, okay?

252
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,898
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

253
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,979
- We are not making a habit of this.
- I know.

254
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,542
- You've gotta start getting up earlier.
- I know.

255
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,226
What the hell is that?

256
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,997
Oh, don't tell me
that's the Lord's Prayer.

257
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,409
- Yeah.
- What are you...

258
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,658
- You gotta be kidding me.
- They make us say it every day.

259
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,541
- They make you read the Bible, too?
- Uh-huh.

260
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,971
I told the teacher I don't believe
in prayer and asked to be excused.

261
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,035
And what did she say?

262
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,961
She said we all
have to bow our heads and pray.

263
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,038
Oh...

264
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,754
and the power and the glory.

265
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,915
- Amen.
- What the hell's going on in here?

266
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,134
Excuse me?

267
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,473
If I wanted my son
to learn the Lord's Prayer,

268
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,510
I would've sent him
to goddamn Catholic school.

269
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,473
- Mrs. Murray...
- Ms. Murray.

270
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,564
Ms. Murray...

271
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,138
this is our morning devotion.

272
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,104
Well, I would like my son excused
from the morning devotion.

273
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,187
- You don't want him to...
- Mmm-mmm.

274
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,322
I've never heard of anything
like this in my life.

275
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,940
Well, Mrs.... uh, Lutz, is it?

276
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,315
My son, like myself, is an atheist.

277
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,576
- Isn't that right, Bill?
- Uh-huh.

278
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,868
I cannot excuse your son
from the morning devotion.

279
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,123
It is required by the board,
and it is the law.

280
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,536
The law?

281
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,214
Have you heard about the Constitution,
by any chance?

282
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,133
Kids, I hope
she's not teaching you history,

283
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,672
because, apparently,
she flunked that class.

284
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,046
In the Constitution, there is something
called the First Amendment.

285
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,394
And that protects
the freedom of speech and religion.

286
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,012
Are there any Jews in the class?

287
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,140
Do your parents know
that you are being forced to recite

288
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,097
- this archaic drivel?
- Ms. Murray!

289
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,267
- I'm just trying to make a point.
- Obviously.

290
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,896
The school board cannot force my son
to pray, or anyone else for that matter.

291
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,856
So... sue them.

292
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:58,288
First of all, can I just say,
it is wonderful to see you all again.

293
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,627
Garth.

294
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,461
Lose a few pounds?
You're looking good.

295
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,259
Robin... did you miss me?

296
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,890
- For fuck's sake, David, get to the point.
- Hey, I'm with you.

297
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,390
I wanna keep this reunion
as brief as possible.

298
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,273
So here's the deal.

299
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,389
- Tomorrow...
- Wait, tomorrow?

300
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,727
- What about the dogs?
- Don't worry, sweetie.

301
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,272
Tomorrow...

302
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,783
you're gonna write us a little check,
and then we will be happy

303
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,859
to get you the hell out of this place.

304
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,114
A check?

305
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,116
I'm gonna make this easy on you, Madalyn.

306
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,488
What we want is just a drop in the bucket.

307
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,616
And what is that?

308
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,930
A million dollars.

309
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,374
For fuck's sake...

310
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,456
- It's not a fucking joke, lady.
- Uh, listen...

311
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,384
I don't know what this guy's told you,

312
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,841
but my organization
is a nonprofit organization.

313
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,514
- There's no money...
- In theory,

314
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,102
American Atheists is a nonprofit, but...

315
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,179
but we both know that there are
a few offshore accounts

316
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,095
that will not bear that out.

317
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,225
New Zealand, for example.

318
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,906
What is this shit?

319
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,448
Hello?

320
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,245
Hello?

321
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,499
Jesus.

322
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,465
Mr. Ferguson, Roy Collier.
I work for Madalyn.

323
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,601
Where did you get my name?

324
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,178
You covered our protests of the courthouse
nativity scene last Christmas.

325
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,430
Thought you could use
a real story for once.

326
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,727
And all three of them, they lived here?

327
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,312
They were inseparable.

328
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,192
Nobody thought that was kind of weird?

329
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,954
Trust me, there's a lot of weird shit
going on in this family.

330
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,446
- Mr. Ferguson...
- Call me Jack.

331
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,820
Jack.

332
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,867
I think something
really bad's happened here,

333
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,751
but nobody seems to believe me.

334
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,538
- Not even the people at American Atheists?
- No, she's done this before.

335
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,844
Disappeared for a few weeks,
popped up in Mexico.

336
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,708
They think this may be
another one of her fundraising ploys.

337
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,296
I'd be inclined to believe 'em.

338
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,761
No, she would have left me instructions.

339
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,972
And she never would've left
the dogs behind.

340
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,472
Okay, look, Roy.
This isn't really my area of expertise.

341
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,765
Then why did you come?

342
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,059
Well, I thought
there might be a story here.

343
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,811
Jackpot.

344
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,114
Passports.

345
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,871
Still doesn't prove
that they're not just out of town.

346
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,083
Okay, let's say you're right.
Let's say they were kidnapped.

347
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,825
- Or worse.
- What about Robin's father?

348
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,917
- Bill Jr.?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,211
He hasn't spoken to his family in years.

350
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,705
His ass won't even
file a missing person's report.

351
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,651
Well, then he should be
at the top of your list.

352
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,795
No. No.

353
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:59,184
Bill and his mom may have had some issues,
but he would never do anything like this.

354
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,103
Well, then, who would?

355
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,477
Are you kidding?

356
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,060
Do you know how many death threats
this woman would receive in a day?

357
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,438
No.

358
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,817
Sure.

359
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,826
No. Right.
Uh, no, I know.

360
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,028
Well, I...

361
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,330
Oh. Yeah. No, I... I do know Mr. Epstein
from the Austin branch, right?

362
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,714
Garth, come on.

363
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,671
Good morning.

364
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,291
Okay.
Uh-huh.

365
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,257
Yup. Right, we'll talk then.
Bye-bye. Mmm-hmm.

366
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,013
So...

367
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,432
I can only get $600,000.

368
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,684
That's what's in our personal account.

369
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,807
What?

370
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,942
Where is the rest of it?

371
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,770
It's in dummy trusts.

372
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,692
It's in dummy what now?

373
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,113
They have to wire it here, the 600 grand,
from New Zealand next week.

374
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,196
Next week?

375
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,410
And I have to sign for it in person.

376
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,491
Hey...

377
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,327
Are you lying?

378
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,749
Gary, calm down.

379
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,211
I'm calm.
He's a big boy.

380
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,591
You didn't plan this very well,
did you, David?

381
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,589
I am in no mood for a jerk-off contest.

382
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,592
Do I need to remind you
who's holding the guns here?

383
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:24,016
Everybody just needs to settle in...
and try and get along.

384
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,768
Looks like we're gonna be
roommates for a few days.

385
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,397
You don't think
the police are gonna be looking for me?

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,860
No, Madalyn, I don't think
anyone's gonna be looking for you.

387
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,987
William Murray Jr.

388
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,196
Mr. Murray, Jack Ferguson,
<i>San Antonio Daily Journal.</i>

389
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,668
I don't give quotes on my mother,
Mr. Ferguson.

390
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,879
<i>- I assume that's what you're after.</i>
- Uh, sort of.

391
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,129
I'm looking into
your family's disappearance.

392
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,301
<i>Roy Collier call you?</i>

393
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,705
Let me give you some advice, Mr. Ferguson.

394
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,799
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

395
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,986
<i>You don't wanna look like a fool
when they suddenly show up.</i>

396
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,445
Roy seems to think this is different.

397
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,559
Well, I guess it's possible
they finally left the country for good.

398
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,519
<i>They've been putting money
from American Atheists</i>

399
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,920
<i>into offshore accounts for years.</i>

400
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,307
Embezzlement?

401
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,555
<i>My mother prefers to call it
"creative accounting."</i>

402
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Ferguson...</i>

403
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,324
Uh, one question.

404
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,530
The dogs...

405
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,530
Roy said that they took them everywhere.

406
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,674
Sure, she treats those things
better than her own family.

407
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,198
<i>Well, that's why he's so worried.
They left them behind.</i>

408
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,575
Goodbye, Mr. Ferguson.

409
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,842
<i>Communist guerrillas,
hiding out in the brush.</i>

410
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,151
<i>Skirmishes such as this
have been plaguing the country...</i>

411
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,610
Madalyn, I just don't get this.

412
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,394
I still can't understand why those
children can't say one little prayer.

413
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,182
They can pray all they want to.

414
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,016
- School can't force 'em to.
- Okay, Maddy.

415
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,563
But can't somebody else fight this?

416
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,265
Why does it always have to be you?

417
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,976
Why not me?

418
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,896
This is important.

419
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,735
I'm just so worried about Pup.

420
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,200
His health isn't what it used to be.

421
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,660
Well, he better start a-goddamn prayin',

422
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,791
'cause we're gonna take this all the way
to the Supreme Court if we have to.

423
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,513
Your mother's a whore!

424
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,182
Get the hell off of me!

425
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,036
Oh, Billy.

426
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,625
Go to hell, commies!
No one wants you.

427
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,920
- You go to hell!
- Go, go, go!

428
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,045
Madalyn!

429
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,187
Come on.

430
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,440
Why didn't you tell me?

431
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,568
The kids at school?

432
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,414
- Mmm.
- I can handle it.

433
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,159
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah, they ambushed me.

434
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,868
Still got a few good elbows
in there, though.

435
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,210
What about the teachers?

436
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,462
They're ignoring me.

437
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,214
They won't call on me anymore.

438
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,255
I don't know, Billy Boy.
Maybe we oughta drop this.

439
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,515
I don't wanna have to worry about you.

440
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,308
Your name is on this lawsuit.

441
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,312
This fight, it's gotta be your choice.

442
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,151
Mom...

443
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,475
we're in this together.

444
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,109
Nonconformists, remember?

445
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,662
Nonconformists.

446
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,293
Sweetie, we pull this off,
we're gonna be goddamn revolutionaries.

00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,482
<i>were unapologetic.</i>

467
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,598
<i>I don't understand
why people are so upset.</i>

468
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,145
<i>This is about religious freedom.</i>

469
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,481
<i>You can still keep the faith, people.</i>

470
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,026
<i>Just keep it to yourselves.</i>

471
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,410
Ooh, this is a good one.

472
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,538
"The next thing you know,

473
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,962
Madalyn Murray will force the country
to eliminate 'one nation under God'

474
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,924
from the Pledge of Allegiance."

475
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,957
It's actually not a bad idea.

476
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,089
We should be clipping coupons,
not articles.

477
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,176
Oh, pfft.

478
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,060
I cannot believe
that the Family Aid Society fired you.

479
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,018
Well, I was a disgrace
to the city of Baltimore. Remember?

480
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,689
Besides, I couldn't get
crap done there, anyway.

481
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,888
Here comes the hate mail.

482
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,147
Mother, it's not all bad.

483
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,686
Thanks, sweetie.

484
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,112
Mmm.

485
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,316
What...

486
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,825
"Here's shit in your eye."

487
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,124
Well, they got wit.
I'll give 'em that, at least.

488
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,666
- Here, let me get it.
- No.

489
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,788
It's a good photo.
I'm gonna keep it.

490
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,168
Ah, see.

491
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
Now there's someone who appreciates me.
Hmm?

492
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,097
The Lord will provide.

493
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,904
That'll buy us some groceries.

494
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,112
Ooh, good fella.
Get me another one.

495
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,843
<i>Madalyn Murray, the woman
who expelled prayer from schools,</i>

496
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,096
<i>is stirring things up again.</i>

497
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,679
<i>She held a rally
at the University of Baltimore</i>

498
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,885
<i>to promote her new organization,
American Atheists.</i>

499
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,596
<i>I'm not trying
to convert anyone here.</i>

500
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,557
<i>And at no time have I said</i>

501
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:51,188
<i>that people should be stripped
of their right to believe in God.</i>

502
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,107
<i>But as an atheist,</i>

503
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,865
<i>I believe a good deed should be done
instead of a prayer said,</i>

504
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,238
<i>a hospital built instead of a church.</i>

505
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:04,536
<i>We want disease conquered,
poverty vanished and war eliminated.</i>

506
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,137
- Another check.
- Ooh.

507
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,186
<i>Mad Madalyn is at it again,</i>

508
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,533
<i>this time filing suit
with the Baltimore public school system</i>

509
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,739
<i>to remove the words "under God"
from the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>

510
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,201
<i>Well, we sure as hell
aren't gonna win this one.</i>

511
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,082
<i>But it's a fight worth having.</i>

512
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,918
Shit!

513
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,251
"Page Si..." Page six?

514
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,752
The police haven't even opened
an investigation yet.

515
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,894
And there are plenty of people

516
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,771
who'd just as soon never see
that woman in Texas again.

517
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,335
Well, can I at least have a follow-up?

518
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,512
Right now, I need a story
on the transit board's bus route overhaul.

519
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,053
Thanks, buddy.

520
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,186
This is all they had.

521
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,319
I think you look pretty hot.

522
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Hey, Gary, ever occur to you

523
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:06,745
that your sole purpose in life might be
to serve as an argument for birth control?

524
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,788
You know what? Just...
Just ignore her.

525
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,292
There you are.

526
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:14,424
A little overcooked,
just like you like them.

527
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,213
You remembered.

528
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:19,507
I figured the least we could do
if we're all stuck here together

529
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,631
is be civil.

530
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,297
I wouldn't spit in your ass
if your guts were on fire.

531
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,807
- That civil enough for you?
- Oh, come on.

532
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,479
I'm having a good time.
Who else is having a good time?

533
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,809
- Uh, yeah, sure. I guess.
- Garth.

534
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,774
I mean, he got us video games.

535
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,784
He's right. I brought your medicine,
I got you a change of clothes.

536
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:41,488
I... I'd say for kidnappers,
we are damn near hospitable.

537
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,952
This is much better than prison, trust me.

538
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,242
Gary was in prison.
How come I didn't see that coming?

539
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,584
You know, you just can't seem
to shut the fuck up.

540
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,544
I bet you saw more cock in the slammer
than a urinal at the Astrodome.

541
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,187
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, go ahead and shoot me.

542
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,131
I'm an awfully big body to hide.

543
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,973
- Gary, put the gun away.
- Open up, Grandma!

544
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,718
- Keep talking.
- Gary...

545
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,100
- No, be funny, fucking Grandma. Do it!
- Please!

546
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,508
Gary, please.

547
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,355
Not so tough now, huh?
You're gonna owe me.

548
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,898
- Oh, fuck you.
- Come on. Come on.

549
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,537
Dave, we need to talk.

550
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,082
- Mother.
- What?

551
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,706
- Mother.
- What?

552
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,843
Do you ever stop to think

553
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,939
that if they kill one of us,
they have to kill us all?

554
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,173
This is bullshit, Garth.
And I'm not letting them get away with it.

555
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,348
I know, but if we get the police involved,
you know that the IRS is gonna follow.

556
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,309
And what they want, it's nothing.

557
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,100
So let's just play their game for now,

558
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,952
and we'll figure out a way
to nail them later.

559
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,686
Yeah.
Yeah, he's right, Grandma.

560
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,900
Yeah, he's right.

561
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,150
This one time.
Stop gloating.

562
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,821
That's not good.

563
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,039
It's fine.

564
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,471
They think they're in New Zealand.

565
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,035
You said two days, tops.

566
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,462
And that woman,
she's wound so goddamn tight.

567
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,253
How the fuck we supposed to keep 'em here?

568
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,665
Madalyn's a cripple.
She's not going anywhere.

569
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,433
Robin would never leave her.

570
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,546
And Garth?

571
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,256
Yeah, Garth can't piss
without his mom holding his dick.

572
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,136
Four days.

573
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,903
We get the money.
We get out of town.

574
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,531
Here.

575
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,528
Get rid of the cars.

576
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,951
Just to be safe.

577
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,998
David...

578
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,332
When this thing comes through,

579
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,166
you're not really serious
about letting them go, right?

580
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,595
He wants you to drop the story?

581
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,600
Well, he doesn't think
there's much more to tell.

582
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,702
Everybody seems to believe
they took off for New Zealand.

583
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,096
I told you, they'd never leave

584
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,287
- without the dogs.
- "Without the dogs"?

585
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,401
Yeah, you may have mentioned that before.

586
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:21,521
You know...

587
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,988
I don't get it, Roy.

588
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,448
What?

589
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,881
Well, her own son doesn't seem to care
that they're missing.

590
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,985
Everybody else at American Atheists
are pretending like nothing's happened.

591
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,290
What makes you different?

592
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:40,497
You have any idea what it's like
to grow up black and gay in Texas?

593
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,254
Um, no.

594
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,995
Neither did Madalyn.

595
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,047
But it didn't matter.

596
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,631
When my parents kicked me out...

597
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,425
she was there to take me in.

598
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,020
All right, look.

599
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,937
I have a PI, owes me a favor, uh...

600
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,110
Not promising anything,
but I'll see if he can't dig something up.

601
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,228
Thanks.

602
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,170
Jesus, David.

603
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,342
Just as vain as ever, huh?

604
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,052
You sure you're not a homo?

605
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,263
You are the last person
who should be lecturing me about vanity.

606
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,934
I'll lecture you about whatever
I goddamn well please.

607
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,935
I don't know how you expect
to pull this off, David.

608
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,936
I am willing to bet
that after we get our money...

609
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,283
you won't be calling the police.

610
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,318
You wouldn't want to expose
those hidden accounts of yours.

611
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,946
In the meantime, why don't you
take these next few days here

612
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,543
as your own dark night of the soul?

613
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,910
Time for a little self-reflection.

614
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,957
If anyone's in need of self-reflection,
David, that'd be you.

615
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,630
I bet Bill Jr. would beg to differ.

616
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,404
Our guest tonight
is Madalyn Murray O'Hair,

617
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,980
the American Atheist
who removed the Bible from public schools.

618
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,027
She's at the university
for a speaking engagement.

619
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,032
O'Hair, that's new for you, isn't it?

620
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,664
Oh, yeah, I guess we all knew
it'd take a real man to tame this shrew.

621
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:43,164
And that's what I found in Richard O'Hair,
a man. A real man.

622
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,708
I have got a granddaughter now, Robin.

623
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
She's about everything I could hope for.

624
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,564
Uh, we've opened our lines to callers.

625
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,218
Right now we have Charles from Sacramento.
Go ahead, Charles.

626
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,318
- <i>Yeah, I wanna ask Mrs. Murray...</i>
- Uh, Murray O'Hair.

627
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,602
<i>How can you look at yourself
in the mirror every day?</i>

628
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,928
<i>Only a godless bitch like you
would go to court to stop prayer.</i>

629
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,451
<i>Thanks to you, this country's
on its way to hell in a handbasket.</i>

630
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,315
<i>Somebody should cut your tongue out,
tie you up</i>

631
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,955
<i>and throw your lifeless corpse off the...</i>

632
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,399
Thank you, Charles.

633
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,231
Don't these people
have anything more to worry about?

634
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:17,237
I mean, people are dying every day in
this unholy war we're waging in Vietnam.

635
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:22,293
And, apparently, this guy's more concerned
with masturbating to my corpse.

636
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,830
Next up, we have Barbara from Mill Valley.

637
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,205
<i>Ms. O'Hair,
if you don't believe in God,</i>

638
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,092
<i>how do you explain where we came from?</i>

639
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:35,257
Lady, have I gotta explain
the damn birds and the bees for ya?

640
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,931
It's called sex.

641
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,470
And you can bet
the Virgin Mary was all for it.

642
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,595
Virgin birth, my ass.

643
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,109
Jesus loves you, Madalyn.

644
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,316
Aw, and so does Santa Claus.

645
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,963
Can you believe it?
Jesus shot at me.

646
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,788
- Goddamn Jesus Christ.
- Uh, Mother.

647
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,094
Oh. Oh, all right. Well, I'm sorry
I used that language again, Susan.

648
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,459
I'll try to clean it up a little bit.

649
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,836
Mother, uh...

650
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,429
Mother...

651
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,233
- Susan and I have been talking.
- Bill, no.

652
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,058
Well, I haven't even said
what I'm gonna ask yet.

653
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,475
You wanna abandon me.

654
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,567
Please.

655
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,526
Bill, look at me.
Some freak put me in the hospital.

656
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,241
You're fine.

657
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,451
They're treating me for nerve damage.

658
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,706
I'm sorry. You're right.
I... I understand.

659
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,173
Probably very frightening for you,

660
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,644
and we shouldn't have dragged Robin
and Susan through all this.

661
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,668
When we get down to LA, I'm gonna
get you a really nice hotel suite.

662
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,525
- They can stay there...
- No, Mother... Mother!

663
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,089
I have a wife and a child now.

664
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,452
I'm not sure this is the life
that I want for them.

665
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,481
- Right, that's your decision.
- All right.

666
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,730
Mmm-hmm. I just don't know if I can
keep up what I'm doing without you.

667
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,065
Oh.

668
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,240
- Well, you got Richard now.
- All he's good for is fucking.

669
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,992
Mom.

670
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,450
Remember that protest at White Tower?

671
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,997
You couldn't have been more than ten.

672
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,497
And that day you said to me,

673
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,165
"If something makes you really mad,

674
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,384
you've gotta go out there
and do something about it."

675
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,100
All my life...

676
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:48,639
I just wanted one person somewhere,
sometime, to understand me.

677
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,363
And that person turned out to be you.
Hmm?

678
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,567
We're in this together.

679
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,534

703

<i>And every single one of them,
including you,</i>

771
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,214
<i>is always interested in money.</i>

772
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,591
<i>You show me once</i>

773
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,054
<i>where Jesus Christ
passed out a collection plate.</i>

774
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,096
<i>Now, Madalyn, I... I see you here...</i>

775
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,771
<i>and I hear you talking.</i>

776
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,599
<i>And you're lost.</i>

777
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,976
<i>You need Jesus.
Real bad. Real bad!</i>

778
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,614
<i>I am so happy that I am lost.</i>

779
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,152
<i>All this religious nonsense...</i>

780
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,605
<i>Because where you're going,
there's gonna be a lake of fire.</i>

781
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:21,777
<i>There's gonna be a weepin' and a wailin'
and a gnashing of teeth.</i>

782
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,537
<i>You gotta be kiddin' me!</i>

783
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,001
<i>What the hell do you care where I go,
what I believe?</i>

784
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,712
<i>I don't care what you believe in.</i>

785
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,812
<i>I wanna bring you to God.
I want to save your soul.</i>

786
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,916
<i>I don't wanna be brought to God.
I don't want to be saved.</i>

787
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,295
<i>And I don't want Jesus,
thank you very much.</i>

788
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,304
<i>All right, we'll be back in a moment.</i>

789
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,646
You know... you and I
could make money doing this.

790
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,192
I do okay, thanks.

791
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,985
Oh, sure.
We... we both do okay.

792
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,449
But together,
we could do a hell of a lot better.

793
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,526
You just give that
a little thought, Madalyn.

794
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,999
<i>They claim it's a first
in the history of religion.</i>

795
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,505
<i>Flamboyant New Orleans evangelist
Reverend Bill Harrington</i>

796
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,969
<i>has arrived in Chicago
for a series of head-to-head debates</i>

797
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,389
<i>with the infamous atheist,
Madalyn Murray O'Hair.</i>

798
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:28,059
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
there is a devil among us.</i>

799
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,812
<i>Let us all pray.</i>

800
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:34,064
Pray to save the soul
of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.

801
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,568
Save me?
Save me?

802
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,451
Oh, Jesus couldn't save himself.

803
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:40,989
The New Testament?

804
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,621
Oh, a load of bull
written by a bunch of faggots.

805
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,620
Oh, come on. Y'all know that.

806
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,793
Jesus was as queer as a three-dollar bill.

807
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,502
You dirty heathen!

808
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,382
Mmm-hmm?
Let me see what that looks like.

809
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,591
Yeah. Oh, that's not bad.

810
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,722
You were on fire
out there tonight, darlin'.

811
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,430
Every time you tear into this Bible,
I save another 50 souls.

812
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,182
Yeah, I know you like that bit.

813
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,143
I do. Why don't you let me see
how the numbers are here?

814
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,400
Oh, not bad.
We'll do better in Kansas City.

815
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,819
I'll burn the goddamn book in Kansas City.

816
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,188
Oh, Praise the Lord!

817
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,105
Thank you, Garth.

818
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,074
I'll keep praying for your soul, Madalyn.

819
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,034
I'll keep cursing yours.

820
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,084
You think we won anyone over?

821
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,697
Oh, I don't know, honey.

822
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,670
Did you hear from your father?

823
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:39,336
Oh, he'll be back when he's shitfaced
and needs his ass wiped.

824
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,968
He just needed a little break.
We'll see him again soon enough.

825
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,596
Hey, when all this is over,
how about we take a little trip, huh?

826
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,535
<i>I spent the last 20 years
trying to escape</i>

827
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,559
<i>the overpowering shadow of my mother.</i>

828
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,573
While she was fighting the world...
I was fighting for my life.

829
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,084
I didn't realize
how bad it had gotten till...

830
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,080
I got out of Austin and...

831
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,998
started locking myself
in the bathroom every night

832
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,292
with a bottle of whiskey
and a bucket of ice.

833
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,217
And then one night, I...

834
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,757
I had this sudden rush of sorrow.

835
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,345
Because I understood.

836
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:42,114
I understood the, uh... the hatred

837
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,952
and the... the self-pity
that she was feeling.

838
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,330
Because that's what I was feeling.

839
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,038
But I come here, and I...

840
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,005
I see others,

841
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,048
much worse situations than me, and...

842
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:10,256
you overcome, and you accept them.

843
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,717
And that, uh...

844
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,188
That's what I'm gonna do.

845
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,574
Our Father...

846
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,243
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

847
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,533
Thy kingdom come,

848
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,947
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

849
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:41,343
Give us this day our daily bread,
forgive us our trespasses,

850
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,208
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

851
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:49,554
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

852
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:55,482
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory...

853
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,268
forever and ever...

854
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,231
Amen.

855
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,521
Amen.

856
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,236
Frank, I need another day
on the Riverwalk article.

857
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,964
I just got a new lead on the O'Hair story.

858
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:09,988
- Frank, listen.
- Jack...

859
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,622
Robin Murray's Porsche
just turned up abandoned at the airport

860
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,450
and Garth's car sold to some guy
out by Canyon Lake. I mean, come on.

861
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,173
Follow it up.

862
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,289
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

863
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,456
Frank! I love you!

864
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,804
All right.

865
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,973
Nope.
I didn't buy it from him.

866
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,183
- You sure?
- Positive.

867
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,314
It was a short guy.
He was younger, had dark hair.

868
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,442
All right.
If I sent a sketch artist to your house,

869
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,200
would you be willing to sit down with him?

870
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,731
- Sure.
- Thanks, Mr. Sparrow.

871
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,034
I don't get it.

872
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,071
What kind of religious nut
goes off and sells a stolen car?

873
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,366
Well, maybe this isn't the work
of a religious nut.

874
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,659
What do you mean?

875
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,451
Well, Madalyn was stashing
loads of cash, right?

876
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,669
Mmm.

877
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,998
Makes for the greatest motive of all.

878
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:04,998
Greed.

879
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,641
This is just like the old days.

880
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,759
You used to let me win.

881
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,518
You were the boss.
I had to.

882
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,096
Does that mean
I'm supposed to let you win now?

883
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,518
You do have the gun.

884
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,702
And we all know what that means.
Compensating for a very small cock.

885
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,488
Right, Red?

886
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,507
That's what you always say, Grandma.

887
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,951
Oh, come on, Madalyn.
You can do better than that.

888
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,334
I don't waste my best lines
on small-time crooks.

889
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,366
You're just as much of a crook as I am,

890
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,088
rippin' people off
in the name of your cause.

891
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,419
That is bullcrap!

892
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,929
I have devoted my life
to protecting the First Amendment.

893
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,052
The things I've had to endure.

894
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,022
Made a little money along the way.
I deserve it.

895
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,270
You are so full of yourself,

896
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,351
you can't see
the fucking forest for the trees.

897
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,861
While you're out fighting the world,

898
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,991
you're making real enemies
right under your nose.

899
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:16,119
You get a load of that, Red?
David Waters is lecturing me.

900
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,117
Your own son would tell you
the exact same thing.

901
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,373
And...

902
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,504
gin.

903
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,008
<i>I led a life wasted
without faith in the Lord.</i>

904
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,274
<i>And I hope I can right
some of the wrongs I caused.</i>

905
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,059
<i>I see my mother as a sinner now.</i>

906
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:50,614
<i>She demanded things of God,
and when he refused her requests, well...</i>

907
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,481
<i>she began to battle with him openly.</i>

908
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:57,946
<i>Now all she cares about is...
getting wealthy by hating God.</i>

909
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,093
<i>Do you love your mother?</i>

910
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,829
<i>Oh, I love my mother.
I forgive my mother.</i>

911
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,209
<i>But I'm not proud
of what she did to this country.</i>

912
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,650
<i>Do you pray for her?</i>

913
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,168
<i>I wish I could pray for her.</i>

914
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,251
Turn it off.

915
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,415
<i>But I'm afraid
it wouldn't do any good.</i>

916
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,799
Sold out to the highest bidder,
the goddamn church.

917
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,471
Mother.

918
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,635
I've been called
every dirty name in the book.

919
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,478
There's not a day goes by
without a death threat.

920
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,608
None of it hurt, but this...
This...

921
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,331
Garth, am I really that bad of a mother?

922
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,664
No.

923
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,963
Mother, I will always be here.

924
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,672
- We'll both always be here.
- Oh...

925
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,901
Mr. Waters.

926
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,952
Thank you, Roy.

927
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,821
Ms. O'Hair, it is a pleasure.

928
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,737
Oh, well, have a seat.

929
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
I saw you on <i>Carson</i> last week.

930
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:31,037
I love the way
you shut Billy Graham up.

931
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,625
Oh, thank you.
It was a little easier than it looked.

932
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,881
Now you're just being modest.

933
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,133
That preacher's more full of shit
than a Christmas turkey, that's for sure.

934
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,636
Oh, hell, he's more full of shit
than a goddamn humpback whale!

935
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:52,731
So... you're here about the, uh,
office management position?

936
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,983
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, you sure you, uh, wanna join us?

937
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,026
Right now, we're holding
this place together

938
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,570
with bailing wire and chewing gum.

939
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,243
I have held together more with less.

940
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:06,292
My son, Bill, he used to, uh,
run the place.

941
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,748
But, uh... he screwed me over.

942
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:16,551
Oh, now those goddamn zombie
twelve-steppers got a hold of him and...

943
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,417
Do you, uh, drink, Mr. Waters?

944
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,178
I do have a few of the usual vices.

945
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,261
Oh, good.

946
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,391
'Cause I do not go in
for that teetotalin' crap.

947
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,067
There we go.

948
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,319
Here's to.

949
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:47,659
It has been mentioned that you, uh...
spent some time in the Illinois State Pen.

950
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:53,116
Just a few petty crimes...
when I was younger.

951
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,923
Well...

952
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:04,628
if Hail Marys really could absolve us...
we'd all be goddamn murderers.

953
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:13,732
Now the first thing she wants you to do
is help get the books in order.

954
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,020
We usually get the statements from
Bank of Austin on the third of the month.

955
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,016
This is where we keep the ledger.

956
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:22,738
You'll have the only key, besides me.

957
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:27,074
You'll register all processed checks here.

958
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,157
Wait, these are all donations?

959
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,243
That's right.

960
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,750
There's a check here for $20,000.
Another for 12.

961
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,172
I know.

962
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,461
In God we trust.
Right?

963
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,588
Ooh! Mmm.

964
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,101
Good luck.

965
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,653
Mmm, what's going on?

966
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,406
The money made it out of New Zealand.

967
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,660
It won't be long now.

968
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,376
It's about time.

969
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,666
The van's out back.

970
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,384
Garth...

971
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,637
you try anything... anything,
Madalyn and Robin are dead.

972
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,061
No, I got it.

973
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,180
Let's go.

974
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,393
Bye, Mother.

975
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,897
- You be careful, Garth.
- Okay.

976
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,864
You know those bills are gonna be marked.

977
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,568
They're getting a cashier's check.

978
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:56,868
Then we're using that to buy gold coins.
Something that can't be traced.

979
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,915
- Here you go, Grandma.
- Thank you, darlin'.

980
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,931
Well, it looks like
you might have me here.

981
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
'Night.

982
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:23,901
Wait a minute.

983
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,898
Gin.

984
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,622
You'll win next time.

985
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,802
Yeah.

986
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,906
Sure, I'll win one of these days.

987
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,495
You've done a real good job here, David.

988
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,923
But, uh...

989
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,128
I want you to know I did some, uh...

990
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,590
digging...

991
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,971
into your record.

992
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,806
True you were picked up for hustling?

993
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,902
I told you I am trying
to put all that behind me.

994
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,032
I don't give a shit
what you do with your pecker.

995
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,742
But, David...

996
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,453
you killed a man.

997
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,621
Now, tell me about him.

998
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,051
Just between us.

999
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,088
Hmm?

1000
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,718
I didn't have a picture-perfect childhood,
Madalyn.

1001
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,434
My mother was a prostitute.

1002
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:42,193
And she was in and out of prison
so much that I'd do

1003
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,019
whatever I had to do to survive.

1004
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,782
I hooked up with this gang.
I started stealing here and there, and...

1005
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,281
this guy we were with got caught
after this liquor store job we did.

1006
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,658
He turned on me.

1007
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:04,037
I may not believe in God,
but I do believe in karma.

1008
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,044
All that crap about past lives?

1009
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,212
Yeah, well...

1010
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,218
maybe not karma.

1011
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,682
Retaliation.

1012
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,096
I was gonna teach this guy a lesson.

1013
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,978
But when I started with that tire iron...

1014
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,188
I don't know, I just...

1015
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,204
I lost control.

1016
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,907
I got 30 years,
but I only did half.

1017
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,326
Got out for good behavior.

1018
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,418
And I swore
I would never lose control again.

1019
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,337
Thank you.

1020
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:55,683
Mmm-hmm.

1021
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,891
Thank you for telling me
the fucking truth.

1022
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,114
Yeah, you live long enough
and you lose faith in people.

1023
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,438
Not that I ever had much faith in anyone.

1024
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,645
But...

1025
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,949
you have impressed me, David.

1026
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,868
Starting to wish Bill Jr.
Could've turned out more like you.

1027
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,713
He really hurt you, huh?

1028
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,671
He betrayed me.

1029
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,711
That's what men do.
Betray me.

1030
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:42,262
But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.

1031
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,642
Nobody can really hurt me.

1032
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,857
Now that I trust you,
I wanna show you something.

1033
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,488
I'm giving you a promotion, David.

1034
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:08,327
So far, you've been keeping track
of most of our donations

1035
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,915
in the official ledger book.

1036
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,381
I say most of them because...

1037
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:18,594
this is our unofficial ledger.

1038
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,391
I'll keep your secrets, you keep mine.

1039
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:55,836
Where are the rest?

1040
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,260
In the trunk.

1041
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,972
Well, at least $400,000 of it is.

1042
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:06,472
Four hundred?
Gary, what the hell?

1043
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,136
The fucking guy didn't have enough.

1044
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,150
We get the rest next week.

1045
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,824
Shit.

1046
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:20,403
Shit.

1047
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,988
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

1048
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,666
Is that really necessary?

1049
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,128
Oh, don't tell me it's another hiccup.

1050
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,145
We have to wait
for another shipment of coins.

1051
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,169
What?

1052
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,054
They'll be here next Tuesday.

1053
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,930
Oh, for...
This is getting ridiculous.

1054
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,099
Shut up. You're not in charge here.

1055
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,269
All right, I got it. I got it.
You're the big boss.

1056
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,439
But God damn it, David,
if you aren't fucking up this job

1057
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,913
like everything else you've ever done.

1058
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,357
Mother!

1059
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,269
Oh, pfft.
Ahh!

1060
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,567
If I shot you in the head right now,
do you think anyone would care?

1061
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,782
The state of Texas would probably
give me a fucking medal.

1062
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,827
Look at this.

1063
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:19,496
$625,000 is missing
from the New Zealand account.

1064
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,592
Withdrawn right after they disappeared.

1065
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,725
I say we take the coins we've got
and get out of town.

1066
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,238
They've got nothing.

1067
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,370
If anything, this is just further proof
that they took the money and ran.

1068
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,618
Oh, fuck.

1069
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:51,867
We've got two more days
before the second shipment comes through.

1070
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,673
And we have come too far
to let a second-page story get in our way.

1071
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:07,012
Well, thank you for finally
coming in here, Bill. Appreciate it.

1072
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,683
When you told me about the dogs,
I knew something wasn't right.

1073
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,677
So, why'd it take you so long
to file a report?

1074
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,232
It's complicated.

1075
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:21,066
My mother turned my own daughter
against me...

1076
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,859
What did the cops say?

1077
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,118
They told me they would get back to me
if anything turned up.

1078
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,951
Wish I could say I was surprised.

1079
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:38,713
So I sent a sketch artist down to work
with the guy who bought Garth's car.

1080
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,461
Should have something soon.
I would love for you to take a look.

1081
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,586
Of course.

1082
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,631
Oh, this money that's gone missing,

1083
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,797
do you have any idea
who could've had access to that?

1084
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,096
- Accountants? Lawyers?
- Mmm.

1085
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,140
All her finances were done in-house
at American Atheists.

1086
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,694
You know...
if somebody did something to them...

1087
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,690
it's probably someone from that place.

1088
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,190
My mother pissed off a lot of people.

1089
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,946
Especially those she was closest to.

1090
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:17,708
Uh, excuse me, uh...

1091
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,879
I just want to say American Atheists
has had a wonderful year, and...

1092
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,589
that would not be so without all of you.

1093
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:26,419
So, thank you,
and a very happy winter solstice.

1094
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,796
Strike up the carols!

1095
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:35,555
Mother loves Christmas.
She really, really does.

1096
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,810
Oh, and you in your sweater.
So darling.

1097
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,872
- Will you get me a refill, Garthy?
- Of course.

1098
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,106
- I'll go check on those cookies.
- Okay.

1099
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:50,319
The membership numbers are down,
but the money is not.

1100
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:53,914
The way Madalyn gets these rich,
dying atheists

1101
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,042
to leave her their entire estates...

1102
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,789
It's a hell of a way to make a living.

1103
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,418
She's not gonna live forever.

1104
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,791
And I don't know what she did to Bill,

1105
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:08,208
but if I was him, I would have suffered
through until she kicked the bucket,

1106
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,417
and then I would've taken
the whole thing for myself.

1107
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:14,139
I mean, Garth's not gonna
take over. Can you imagine?

1108
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,531
"Hello, people,

1109
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,475
we need to start fighting
for the freedom of religion."

1110
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,018
Not funny, David.

1111
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,895
See anybody laughing?

1112
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,606
No more for him, huh?

1113
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:37,494
Madalyn, sorry.

1114
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:40,037
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

1115
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,581
Right now,
all I want out of you is breathing.

1116
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,956
Very little of that.

1117
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,922
Come on.
I just had a little bit too much to drink.

1118
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,553
Oh, I am assuming
it was the drink talking,

1119
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,341
otherwise I would fire your ass.

1120
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,215
What?
You wanna get rid of me?

1121
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,433
Go ahead.

1122
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,691
But I know a lot of secrets
about the American Atheists.

1123
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,608
Secrets that might interest
the IRS in particular.

1124
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,226
Are you threatening me?

1125
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,526
Go, tell the IRS whatever you want.

1126
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,202
Scream it from the mountaintops.

1127
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,531
You think they're gonna believe
a fucking felon?

1128
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:21,117
Get out of here.
You're ruining my holiday party.

1129
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,009
You really can be pathetic, you know.

1130
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:44,441
You just wanna be the momma I never had,
give us both a second chance.

1131
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:47,018
Well, let me tell you something
about my momma.

1132
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:50,731
I beat the shit out of her.

1133
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,647
I beat her to a bloody pulp.

1134
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,316
You think your son Bill hurt you?

1135
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,994
Nah.

1136
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,783
Not like I hurt her.

1137
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:05,788
Garth!

1138
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:09,174
David Waters is a convicted felon.

1139
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,962
He's a murderer.

1140
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,165
And his mother was a goddamn whore.

1141
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,797
And she's not the only one
that sucked cocks for money.

1142
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:19,595
Isn't that right, David?
Isn't that right? You sucked cock...

1143
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,889
Don't fuck with me, Madalyn.
Don't fuck with me.

1144
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,524
Are you okay?

1145
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,850
Son of a bitch.

1146
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,953
<i>Hello, football fans...</i>

1147
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:56,258
We got beer, vodka, cigs.

1148
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,470
Finally.

1149
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,595
Hope you didn't forget
about me, Danny.

1150
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:04,854
No, I did not.

1151
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,099
Oh, hey.

1152
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,606
Sorry it ain't a martini.

1153
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:18,445
Oh, it's the good stuff.

1154
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,238
Yeah.

1155
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,745
My Billy Boy...

1156
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,333
he used to mix a mean Manhattan.

1157
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,132
Here's to new friends.

1158
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,390
You're all right, Danny Fry.

1159
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,431
Mmm.

1160
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,975
You know, I'm real sorry
we're putting you through all this.

1161
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,565
It's not you.
It's David.

1162
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,696
I'd watch your ass around him
if I were you.

1163
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,279
You know, I trusted him.

1164
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,704
Look where it got me.

1165
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:11,116
I'm, uh... heading to Florida next week

1166
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,463
for my daughter's fifth birthday.

1167
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,547
I'm using my take
to set up her college fund.

1168
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,049
Yeah. She's awful sweet.

1169
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,137
And lucky to have you for a father.

1170
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,272
Thanks.

1171
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:31,938
In the end...

1172
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,187
family is all we got.

1173
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,341
Hello.

1174
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,682
All right, sounds good.

1175
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,931
Jack just called.

1176
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,387
He has the sketch of the guy
who sold Garth's car.

1177
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,072
Who the fuck is that?

1178
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,430
Get out!

1179
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,037
<i>This is Bob Fry.
Leave a message.</i>

1180
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,214
Hey, Bob, it's, uh...
it's Danny.

1181
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:18,248
Um... You know, I was actually just headed
back to Florida just now, but, um...

1182
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,820
I've got a couple things
I gotta tie up still here in Texas.

1183
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,300
So, uh...

1184
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,545
But I'm gonna be sending you a letter.

1185
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:31,184
And if you could just hang onto it for me,
that would be great.

1186
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,184
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

1187
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,412
Garth?

1188
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,747
Yes, Mother?

1189
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,750
I know you don't like me very much.

1190
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,416
That's not true, Mother.

1191
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,889
Well, you call me names behind my back.

1192
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,178
You mean like "fat cunt"?

1193
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:13,262
You call me "fat cunt"?

1194
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,467
Yeah.

1195
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,021
Well, you've called me worse.

1196
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,265
I suppose.

1197
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,030
It doesn't mean anything, you know that.

1198
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,857
What about you, Red?

1199
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:33,080
You hate me for taking you
away from your father?

1200
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,829
You didn't take me away from him.

1201
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,963
I was too hard on him.

1202
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,126
I'm too hard on all of you.

1203
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,758
You're only hard on us
because you believe we can be great.

1204
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,220
I love you two.

1205
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,273
Uh-huh.

1206
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,936
Everything I've ever done, I...
I've done for you kids.

1207
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:07,862
Bill, too.

1208
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,163
What do you say?

1209
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,739
When we get out of this,

1210
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:22,127
we take a drive down to Dallas
and visit your father, hmm?

1211
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,127
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1212
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,511
And if the bastard refuses to see us,

1213
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,758
well, I'll just bang down
the goddamn door.

1214
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,013
Now, that I'd like to see.

1215
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,887
I'm gonna miss you, Red.

1216
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,472
Don't call me that.

1217
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:44,847
No.

1218
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,145
No! No!

1219
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,327
<i>She called herself
the most hated woman in America.</i>

1220
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:07,291
<i>Tonight, the incredible case
of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.</i>

1221
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,956
<i>In 1963, Madalyn Murray O'Hair</i>

1222
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,003
<i>found the cause
that would make her famous.</i>

1223
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:14,666
<i>And some say, rich.</i>

1224
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:18,425
<i>She filed a lawsuit against
the Baltimore public school board.</i>

1225
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:20,839
<i>The case would go
all the way to the Supreme Court</i>

1226
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,348
<i>in a landmark ruling
that banned prayer in schools.</i>

1227
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:25,271
<i>Over the next three decades,</i>

1228
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,849
<i>no one person has been thought
a bigger threat to religion.</i>

1229
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:33,226
<i>In 1995, Madalyn was 77 years old,
in failing health,</i>

1230
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:36,106
<i>and likely would've spent
her remaining years in relative obscurity.</i>

1231
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,277
<i>Except that, before she could die,</i>

1232
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,532
<i>the nation's most famous atheist
suddenly vanished.</i>

1233
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,719
<i>Well, the thing that strikes you
is there was no panic</i>

1234
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,753
<i>when the Murray O'Hairs disappeared.</i>

1235
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,999
<i>There was no real effort to find them.
Uh...</i>

1236
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:51,541
<i>Yet there was over $600,000 missing,</i>

1237
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,285
<i>Robin's car was abandoned,</i>

1238
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,797
<i>and another was sold
by a mysterious stranger.</i>

1239
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,723
<i>Mark Sparrow answered
the ad in the newspaper</i>

1240
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,510
<i>and thought he'd found a steal of a deal</i>

1241
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:05,144
<i>since the car was priced
$5,000 below Blue Book value.</i>

1242
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,433
<i>But although
Garth Murray's signature appears</i>

1243
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,686
<i>- on the title of transfer documents...</i>
- Danny?

1244
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:13,728
<i>Sparrow is certain that the man
who sold him the car was not Garth Murray.</i>

1245
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:18,073
Right before Danny disappeared,
I got a call.

1246
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,951
He told me he was sending a letter.

1247
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,494
There weren't many details.

1248
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,910
But he said he and a guy named Gary Karr
were in on a kidnapping scheme,

1249
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,076
brought in by somebody
called David Waters.

1250
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:33,004
David Waters?

1251
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,463
Danny said these people they took...

1252
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,634
were expecting to come out of it alive.

1253
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,802
But he wasn't so sure.

1254
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,263
And you told all this to the police?

1255
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:44,474
Sure.

1256
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,433
Yeah, but they didn't seem too keen
on looking for a missing ex-con.

1257
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:50,596
I called Waters up looking for Danny.

1258
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:53,229
He made up some excuse.

1259
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,936
And then he threatened to kill my family.

1260
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,951
Are you prepared to go on the record?

1261
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,159
Yeah.

1262
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,182
<i>Mr. Waters,
I'm not one for plea agreements,</i>

1263
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,562
<i>but I don't really have a say
in the matter.</i>

1264
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,519
<i>You've discussed this with your lawyer?</i>

1265
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,061
Go ahead.

1266
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,778
Gary was like a mad dog.

1267
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,449
<i>Sooner or later he was gonna bite.</i>

1268
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,790
David.

1269
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,345
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1270
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:09,429
Oh...

1271
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:11,348
Oh...

1272
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,182
God damn it, Karr.
What the fuck did you do?

1273
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,021
Jesus! David?

1274
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,821
What are we gonna do now?

1275
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,028
Calm down.

1276
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,939
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

1277
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,657
We gotta get her body into the bedroom
so they don't see her.

1278
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,657
Oh, no.

1279
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,115
No! David, no!

1280
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,123
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1281
01:20:39,377 --> 01:20:41,627
Danny, do something!

1282
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,169
Mother!

1283
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:49,796
No!

1284
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,896
- No!
- Don't look! Don't look!

1285
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,613
Oh, God!

1286
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,304
Do it.

1287
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,452
Here.

1288
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,371
Do it.

1289
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,009
Do it.

1290
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:02,768
Gary, I can't.

1291
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:29,419
<i>He couldn't be trusted
to keep his mouth shut, so...</i>

1292
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,455
I had Gary take him out, too.

1293
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,062
What happened to the money?

1294
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,779
We kept the gold in a storage locker.

1295
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,155
And when we went to collect...

1296
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:59,581
it was gone.

1297
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:02,874
We'd been robbed.

1298
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,997
Fucking five-dollar lock.

1299
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,505
I never intended to kill her.

1300
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:22,102
<i>But I can't say
that I'm sorry that she's dead.</i>

1301
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,805
<i>We're live here at Camp Wood,</i>

1302
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,977
<i>where confessed murderer David Waters
is leading police</i>

1303
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,237
<i>to the spot where he buried
the bodies of Madalyn Murray O'Hair,</i>

1304
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,200
<i>her son and granddaughter,
on that gruesome night in 1995.</i>

1305
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,402
<i>There were rumors that
they had fled to New Zealand...</i>

1306
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,751
Well, at least she didn't go unnoticed.

1307
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,579
<i>Police finally narrowed in on Waters
and his partner in crime, Gary Karr...</i>

1308
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,416
She would've appreciated that.

1309
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,841
<i>Also charged with the murder
of a third kidnapper.</i>

1310
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,529
Please, no prayers.
She wouldn't have wanted that.

1311
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:36,507
<i>Does it worry you that, uh, when you die,
that there's not going to be nirvana</i>

1312
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,429
<i>or whatever you care to call it?</i>

1313
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,218
<i>When I die,
I don't want some religious nut</i>

1314
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:45,563
<i>shoving a rosary up my ass
or communion wafer down my throat.</i>

1315
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,101
<i>But I wouldn't mind
a small corner of the outdoors</i>

1316
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:52,645
<i>where the sun can filter through the trees
and lay a gentle hand on my face.</i>

1317
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,401
<i>Three words on my tombstone.</i>

1318
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,953
<i>"Woman."
I've loved being a woman.</i>

1319
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:01,318
<i>"Grandmother."
I've loved being a grandmother.</i>

1320
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,576
<i>And "mother."
I have loved being a mother.</i>

1321
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,785
<i>That's what I'd like to be
remembered for most.</i>

1322
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,831
<i>That's what I'd like it to say
on my tombstone, but...</i>

1323
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:12,884
<i>being who I am,</i>

1324
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,130
<i>I'm not expecting I'll be having
a goddamn tombstone.</i>
