1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
On a full moon night

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
On the roof of the Forbidden City

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,240
A sword from the west

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,040
Flying fairy

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,120
You Fa Moon-lau and me, Luk Siu Fung

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,040
would be so glad to watch
the duel of 2 great swordsmen

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Yes. Sai Mun Tsui-suet &
Yip Koo-shing's swords

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,080
haven't been shown yet
but we can smell it

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,120
This sword is made by finest steel

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
its length is 3 feet 3 inches
weight 6 catties and 4 taels

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,560
This sword is very sharp

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,560
Its length is 3 feet 7 inches
weight 7 catties & 13 taels

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,040
Sai Mun Tsui-suet, do you have
confidence to face my stance?

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,240
Mr. Yip, I'm ready

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,040
Fly...

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,520
Flying...

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,480
Fa...

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
Fairy!

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,400
Who are you?

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,120
How dare you fight on the roof top of
the Emperor's house? Tell me your names

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm Yip Koo-shing
Master of the White Cloud Castle

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,160
Yip Koo-ching?

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,280
And... I'm a cool swordsman
Sai Mun Tsui-suet

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,120
And me, Fa Moon-lau, the Blind Superman

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,240
And me, a lovely hero with
4 eye-brows. Luk Siu-fung!

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,280
What? Luk Siu-fung?

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,120
Lovely hero?

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,600
You know you're bothering
2 great swordsmen to have their duel?

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,720
Who are you?

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,360
Secret Agent Ling Ling Fat

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm responsible to protect
His Majesty and his properties

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Listen, you old folks!

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,800
You are charged of breach of close

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
You're charged of illegal gathering, too

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,600
And haven't behaved
yourselves in public area

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Hey, don't call us old folks!

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Great swordsmen may not
always be handsome

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,680
Handsome heroes are just
the expectations of ordinary people

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes. Heroes will have bald head too

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,520
But not as ugly as you are!

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
Please give us a chance!

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,440
This is a precious secret
scroll of Kung-fu

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,240
Take it. Uncuff us at once

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,240
You want to exchange your freedom
with such poor book? Stop dreaming

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,880
Haven't you heard of my name?

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,240
Of course not!
You're not that famous. Get lost

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,480
Young man
better give us face. I'm Sai...

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,360
I don't care
I won't give you face, anyway

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,280
Bastard! You'd respect the blind

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,160
Since you're blind, don't climb up!

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,960
Or, you'll fall to death, old man

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,920
You've gone too far!
Once I attack with my Wonder Fingers...

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,320
Wonder Finger? I have one too. Got it?
Better learn it

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,200
All of you, on the floor
put your hands on your heads

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I think you'll be put to jail
not less than 10 years

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I won't let you go this time

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
What a shame!

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
Pals, let's forget this ignorant guy

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,880
Let's choose another day for the fight

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,880
So powerful!

61
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,440
Members of the Secret Agent

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Ling Ling Kung

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
Ling Ling Hei

64
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Ling Ling Fat

65
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Ling Ling Choi

66
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
We'll be your
Majesty's loyal servants forever

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
We'll be your
Majesty's loyal servants forever

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
Iron Clothe!

69
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,960
It breaks Yes...

70
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
Great!

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,920
Unbreakable Armor

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Five Shapes Fists

73
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,440
Dragon

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Snake

75
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Tiger

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,440
Panther

77
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,520
Crane

78
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Bravo!

79
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,200
What's up?

80
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,880
These 2 stones are
found in the very North

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,160
There are 2 sides, with amazing power

82
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,560
If positive side face the positive side
they'll reject each other

83
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,800
They can't stick together

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
If the positive side faces the
negative side, they'll stick together

85
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
Very amazing!

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a great discovery

87
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,200
I'd like to devote it to you

88
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,760
What's the use of it?

89
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Girls, you need not sway
the fan so hardly from now on

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,440
That two aren't attractive
how about this?

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,400
Put these 2 leaves together

92
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,200
and move it with great speed

93
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,760
So strong wind will be created

94
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,560
If the weather is hot
this new product would be wonderful!

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Is Your Majesty interested in being
a sole agent of my product?

96
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Your Majesty, I've not given my
subordinates good guidance

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'd be blamed!

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ling Ling Fat, behave yourself

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
I've got a way to
defeat your Iron Clothe

100
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Fat-yan

101
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm coming

102
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,400
I've discovered that

103
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,560
if I put carbon
Nitre and sulphur in a small space

104
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,200
say, inside one's mouth

105
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,880
And, one tiny steel ball is put in

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When an explosion is happened inside

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
solid becomes gas form
and the expansion creates great power

108
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,760
So the steel ball will be pushed out

109
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
The power is so great that
it can break stone and metal

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Iron clothe will become a mess

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
What did you say?

112
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,560
Great! Come here

113
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
Fat-yan, are you ready?

114
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,440
The only demerit of this weapon is...

115
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
high temperature will be caused

116
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,400
So Fat-yan's mouth must be
under series of special training

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,400
say, eat hot dumplings
as training step no. One

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Or, drink very hot soup

119
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Now, Fat-yan's mouth can
stand temperature of 100°C

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I tell you, he can eat hot
shark-fin soup faster than anyone else

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
so, he can eat much more than us

122
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,560
But...

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,400
Kids should not learn this

124
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,560
Make it or not?

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,880
It's almost successful

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
I feel that my mouth has had gone

127
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
No, it becomes bigger only

128
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,880
How big is it?

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Very big, don't worry

130
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,000
It's almost done!

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Give me some time to amend it
I think I can...

132
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
Shut up!

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,840
Please don't get angry

134
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,400
Fat, what are you doing?

135
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
Doing minor things

136
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm asking you, what are you doing?

137
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,280
Just some inventions

138
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,120
Say! What're you doing?

139
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
What the hell are you doing?
The Majesty is asking you

140
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
What're you doing? Say!

141
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
I just want to make new inventions

142
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Come up!
I want you to come up and tell me

143
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Hurry up...

144
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm coming soon

145
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,640
If your post wasn't from heritage

146
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
I would have fired you!

147
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
Now, get lost!

148
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,760
I let you cover yourself
by acting as a doctor

149
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
But he chose to be a gynecologist!

150
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
What a shame!

151
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
You seldom practice Kung-fu

152
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know what you're doing at all

153
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
He didn't come for a meeting last night

154
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
Where were you last night?

155
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
I caught thieves on the roof top

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,320
What thieves?

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,680
I caught Yip Koo-shing
Sai Mun Tsui-suet and Luk Siu-fung

158
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,000
Although they escaped

159
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,760
I got a secret scroll of Kung-fu instead

160
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
What's that?

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
A stance named Flying Fairy

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
Have you practiced?

163
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
Yes, I did a bit

164
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,920
Show me now

165
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,400
This is called Flying Fairy

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
He is fooling you, Your Majesty

167
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Get up! Now! Quick! Stand right here!

168
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm coming... Hurry up...

169
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,920
Don't pretend. Come up...

170
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,480
Coming

171
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,280
Come up! Coming!

172
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,880
Get out now!

173
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I tell you

174
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,440
I don't want to see you again

175
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,520
and hear from you either!

176
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,960
Secret agent...

177
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Great!

178
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,320
Great!

179
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
Doctor, I...

180
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,240
Let me give you some medicine?

181
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,920
Wait, let me tell you my symptoms first

182
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,000
You have to take medicine anyway, right?

183
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,040
Take the medicine

184
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Pay now

185
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
Show her to the door

186
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,680
Doctor, I've come a long way here

187
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Please listen to me first

188
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,040
Come on, please!

189
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,560
I'll let you say anything you like...

190
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080
on your way home

191
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
Next

192
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,640
Doctor, I'm sick

193
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,000
Let me give you some medicine

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
My hands and legs are cold
I feel dizzy too

195
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,800
Sometimes when I stand up after a squat
I'll feel dizzy

196
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
Well, no medicine is needed

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Go home and prepare for your funeral

198
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,600
Are you kidding me? Isn't it...

199
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,280
because of woman's period?

200
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,600
Or hormone changed after delivery?

201
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
What make you think so?

202
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,960
Well, you can tell it
from the color of tongue

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,520
Well, how to cure you then?

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,560
It's simple

205
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,000
Use 1/2 tael of Tin Nam Sing
0.15 tael of Lily

206
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,520
0.2 tael of To Chow Sing, 0.08 tael
of Si Kwan Chi, one teal of Ha Fu Tsoi

207
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,680
Plus winter flower, cook with light fire

208
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,640
Here they are
boil with eight bowls of water

209
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
Drink it, then you'll recover soon

210
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,200
Thank you, doctor

211
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Show doctor to the door

212
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,720
Ne...

213
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,920
Next?

214
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Doctor, my heart aches!

215
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,280
Let me give you some medicine

216
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,480
My nasty husband has a concubine

217
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,480
He always beats me up!

218
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,480
I've suffered enough! Although
a rude man brings extra excitement

219
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,040
I couldn't stand any more!

220
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,480
Doctor, are you rude?

221
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,520
It depends

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,200
Sometimes, I can be rude

223
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Alright, my husband fools around
I want to have a secret affair too

224
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,960
Come on!

225
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
Let me see how rude are you!

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Honey!

227
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,080
What's the matter, honey?

228
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,800
This lady...

229
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
she wants my help

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,400
You know, I am a kind-hearted doctor

231
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,880
She comes a long way here
just give her a hand

232
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Miss, are you tired?

233
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,400
Do you want some noodle?

234
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
I am fine!

235
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,720
Honey, am I a good husband?

236
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
I have arrived, that's why you behaved!

237
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,680
If I am not present
will you accept the temptation?

238
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,360
I swear!

239
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,200
I will!

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,040
You bastard!

241
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,200
Once again
will you take the temptation! Tell me

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,200
Yes

243
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Great

244
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
I am not afraid of it! You nuts!

245
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,080
I will not play with you if you bite!

246
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Alright

247
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,720
I surrender! I surrender!

248
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,680
Hands off!

249
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,680
No! Or you will jump over!

250
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I won't! I surrender!

251
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
My hand breaks! Honey
hands off me please

252
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,320
I don't believe in you

253
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,920
It really breaks!

254
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
Sorry, hubby

255
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,000
You woman!

256
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,800
You are really good at Kung-fu

257
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,760
Master is so pleased!

258
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,280
I won't feel unhappy

259
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,040
What?

260
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Do you know what's in my mind?

261
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I have present for you

262
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Remember you cut the onion few days ago

263
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
you chopped and chopped...

264
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
At last, you cut your finger

265
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Now, I will give you this hand

266
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,960
So, you can use your
own hand to catch this hand

267
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
And use this hand to hold the onion

268
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,480
Even you cut your hand
it'll be a fake hand

269
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Your own hand won't be hurt!

270
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
How can you make it?

271
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,360
Thank you, hubby!

272
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,080
Sweetie!

273
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,880
Honey!

274
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Sweetie!

275
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Honey!

276
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,480
You said, it's tough to clean the floor

277
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,320
Yes

278
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Take this pair of shoes

279
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
After wearing it
your legs will help you a lot

280
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
See, your legs will
become groom & dust pan

281
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,960
And you can clean the floor
while you are walking

282
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,080
Open your mouth

283
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,080
Put all the rubbish inside your mouth

284
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,560
No!

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,360
Wait

286
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,560
How do you feel?

287
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Hubby, I think you are a great inventor

288
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,560
What else?

289
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
And...

290
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I love you very much!

291
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,560
So...

292
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,000
Let's sleep

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,840
But I want to try this!

294
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
No, try this

295
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
It's rat!

296
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This time, I'll use
rat's movement to release power

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,840
And it will push the wheel
to increase the power

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
then, it's powerful enough to move this!

299
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,760
It can support weight over 200 catties

300
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,600
How about the steam machine
we used last time?

301
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,440
It's good, but when it is dried
it will stop at once

302
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,160
Isn't this better?

303
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
You are right

304
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,760
But, something is missing

305
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,360
And this is the greatest breakthrough
I've ever made

306
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Now, we can choose different grade
of speed for different needs

307
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Look!

308
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,160
Honey, am I wonderful?

309
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
You are so cheap!

310
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,760
Sure!

311
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,160
Honey, what does that Rear mean?

312
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,760
That's backward!

313
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Let me try

314
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,760
No!

315
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,160
Does it work?

316
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,960
Sure, I cook with
this super turning shovel

317
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Not even a drop of oil can dirty me

318
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,960
Sure, but I mean the air system machine!

319
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
That machine?

320
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
Show me once

321
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,760
It works, this is effective

322
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,760
And you can take this as practice

323
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,960
Yeah, it's good to health

324
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,760
Hubby

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Honey

326
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,160
Hubby

327
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,760
Honey

328
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,560
Hubby

329
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,160
I'll let you play

330
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Great

331
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
The one who is like a ghost has arrived

332
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,160
What's wrong with you?

333
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Doctor...

334
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Just between you and me!

335
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
It's enough for you to disguise as woman

336
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
It's not necessary
for you to talk like a woman!

337
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Being a member of the
Forbidden City Cops

338
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,160
I should try my very best
to cover my identity

339
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Better be careful

340
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,960
Doctor...

341
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,960
Am I pregnant?

342
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,760
Yes, eat this for abortion

343
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,160
What else do you want to say?

344
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,960
Fat-yan said...

345
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Don't talk like a woman

346
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Fat-yan said...

347
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,960
Lie down, don't let me see your face

348
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,160
There is an important mission for you
go back to the Headquarters

349
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,960
Better say earlier!

350
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
Fat, be smart

351
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,360
This important mission is counted on you

352
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
We have had banquets
in the headquarters in these nights

353
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
if you can't clean
all the dishes tonight

354
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
you will be put to jail

355
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Here comes His Majesty

356
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,560
I've got a message that
inside the territory of Gum Kingdom

357
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,360
Something mysterious happened last month
that is

358
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,160
Oh, really?

359
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
A creature called Flying Fairy
fell down from heaven

360
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,560
Thus, they called a meeting for
all famous doctors in our country

361
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,960
In order to dissect the Flying Fairy

362
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,560
Dissect Flying Fairy?

363
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Under the great leadership
of Your Majesty

364
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,960
how come such ridiculous thing happens?

365
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,160
I am sure this is
the trick of the cheaters

366
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,960
Do you still want to go?

367
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
Only the fool will be cheated!

368
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,960
I do want to take a look

369
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,280
You know it is ridiculous
but Your Majesty still want to face it

370
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,400
you are so brave, so courageous!

371
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,000
Only under the leadership of
such brave and smart emperor

372
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,400
our country will be
prosperous and stable

373
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
Long life to Your Majesty

374
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,400
The people of Gum Kingdom are
always cunning, it may be a trap

375
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,480
If you go, it may be dangerous

376
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Forget it

377
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,640
If you don't finish washing these dishes
you'll be more dangerous

378
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,560
But I have duty to remind Your Majesty

379
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
Long life to Your Majesty

380
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
Bravo

381
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,280
Kung Hei Choi, you will protect me

382
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,280
we will set out tomorrow

383
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,920
Yes

384
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,760
Long life Your Majesty

385
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Fat, cut the crap

386
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,880
His Majesty doesn't want to hear your voice

387
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
If you say anything nonsense
your head will be chopped off

388
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,040
Wash the dishes. Don't speak up...

389
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Thank God, you are saved!

390
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,800
You wash my dishes

391
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,560
There must be conspiracy!

392
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,720
China is stable and prosperous

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
The beautiful women
are specially beautiful

394
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,960
The handsome men are specially handsome

395
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,960
I do hope that our flag of Gum Sect

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
will be found on their soil

397
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,000
The Chinese soldiers are poor in health

398
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
The dissection of Flying Fairy
is to gather the Chinese doctors

399
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,000
then, we will launch an attack
to the Chinese troops

400
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,080
Since they have no doctors

401
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,960
our troops can march from the
North to South with ease

402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,040
It'll be a piece of cake
for us to conquer China

403
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
You bastard, you look like a dummy

404
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,560
especially when you smile!

405
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,440
I don't know why
you are so dummy looking!

406
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Stop it!

407
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,480
I am like a dummy whenever I see you

408
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,720
When I see daddy
I seem to be more foolish!

409
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,480
Don't you like my look?

410
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
Your dad ruined his face

411
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,560
because of practicing No Face's Stance!

412
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,440
A 2

413
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,680
I four

414
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Got it?

415
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,760
Bingo

416
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,520
D 4 and 7

417
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,720
H 25

418
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,800
Got it?

419
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,800
Two Six

420
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
Try Two Five again

421
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Two Five

422
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go back to 26

423
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,040
2 & 6

424
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,680
Got it?

425
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Yes

426
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,480
Where do you feel itchy?

427
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,480
C 13468 plus D 1

428
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,000
And, A 2, E 4

429
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
Got it?

430
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,960
You are so stupid!
You won't make it like this!

431
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,200
I am stupid, that's why you look smart

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Please don't say I am smart

433
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,200
But your inventions are really wonderful

434
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,640
Who said so?

435
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
I said it

436
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,480
What's your name?

437
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,480
Lau

438
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Who are you?

439
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
I am your wife

440
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,520
Shit!

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,040
Come on, don't scold me

442
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,920
You scolded me first

443
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,480
You are the only one who praises me
but what's the use of it?

444
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
I don't care!

445
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I think you are really great

446
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,200
You are great, that's why I praise you!

447
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,160
Don't you understand my words?

448
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,640
What do you want to say?

449
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Don't you know it?

450
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
I have had a difficult job

451
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
But you will never know it

452
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,560
I don't know how hard your job is

453
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,880
But I believe that
you are doing something good

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,720
Just scold whoever offended you

455
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,240
But never blame me as scapegoat

456
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,640
Since you are familiar with me

457
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,480
That's why I should be blamed?

458
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,920
I tell you!

459
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,640
Yes

460
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
So, you...

461
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,160
You can blame me instead?

462
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
Yeah!

463
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
So what? Why not leave home?

464
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
How do you know I am
hiding under the table?

465
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,720
You always hide under the table

466
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,520
That's why I know you must be
hiding under the table

467
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Please use your brain to think!

468
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,920
Think a new place to hide!

469
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
So, I will have new excitement

470
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,880
But if I don't hide under the table
I am afraid you can't find me

471
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I can't stand it any more

472
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
Please don't! I beg you!

473
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Honey, please don't do it again

474
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,800
I am a woman only
but you always scold me

475
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
I am afraid I can't tolerate it any more

476
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,720
If you can't tolerate it, just leave me

477
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
I'm going to bath

478
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,560
I ask you to leave me alone!

479
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
Are you hungry?

480
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
I'll do you some noodle

481
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,880
Sorry, it's my fault

482
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
I lose my mind

483
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,000
Forget it

484
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,200
But why do you lose your temper?

485
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
There is an important medical
meeting held in Gum Kingdom

486
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
But I am not qualified to join it

487
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
Who said so?

488
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I said, you are qualified

489
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
I don't mind others disqualifying me

490
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
According to what you said

491
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,320
I can go now!

492
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
Stop!

493
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,640
What's the matter?

494
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,880
Some woodmen appear in such remote place

495
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
be careful of trick!

496
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,080
Who are you?

497
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,760
We're woodmen

498
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't block my way

499
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,720
I am the Emperor

500
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,720
Get lost!

501
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,080
Don't disclose our identities on the way

502
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,920
I don't want others to
know I am the Emperor

503
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,280
Got it?

504
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,320
Yes, Your Majesty

505
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,280
Let's go

506
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
Let's go

507
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,040
The leading guy is having
long and soft breath

508
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
He must be a Kung-fu
master who is good at Air Stance

509
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,200
The one with whip is having stable steps

510
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,040
He must be a great Kung-fu fighter

511
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,320
And the one, with strong arms

512
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,040
He must be a great Kung-fu fighter too

513
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,480
I think they must be the
famous Forbidden City Cops

514
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Iron Clothe, Unbreakable Armor
and Five Shapes Fists

515
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,480
Three Forbidden City Cops are all here

516
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,280
the one inside the sedan chair
must be the emperor

517
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,800
We do want to arrest some stupid doctors

518
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,560
God knows, here comes a king!

519
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,000
How lucky are we to
have such good chance!

520
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,480
So what?

521
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,280
Protect me

522
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,720
It's great

523
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,440
So disgusting!

524
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
The participants can go
into the hall now

525
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,080
Honey, the meeting is going to start

526
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,720
Let's go

527
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,480
I can't miss this chance!

528
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
First, cut the belly

529
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,160
Tear its skin

530
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Pull the intestines out

531
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Then, its shit spitted out...

532
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,040
So exciting!

533
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,560
Honey, there are new clothes for sale

534
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I am going to buy some

535
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,560
How to meet you later?

536
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,880
After the meeting
just go there to look for me

537
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,880
Alright

538
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
Don't wander off

539
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,240
Invitation card?

540
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
Invitation card?

541
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,480
This kind of invitation card

542
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,000
Please let me go, I am a doctor too

543
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,080
Are you a doctor?

544
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,480
Yes, I am a famous doctor

545
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,040
Alright, go in

546
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,720
Thank you, buddy

547
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,040
He doesn't know he is dying!

548
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,960
What?

549
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,720
Doctor... Doctor...

550
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,000
Doctor...

551
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I've discovered that

552
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,320
I can make a medicine with
polycodonis and honey

553
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,920
This liquor is best for chain smokers

554
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,320
It cures sore throat

555
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
You will get rich!

556
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,520
I've discovered a new kind of plant

557
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,920
After eating it, you will laugh and cry

558
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
the natives call this grass

559
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
You will get rich too

560
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,520
You can tell it's drug which harm people

561
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,920
Better keep it yourself

562
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,520
Don't take too much!

563
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,320
You are right

564
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Do you have any now?

565
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,320
Give me some

566
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Later...

567
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
This doctor... I haven't seen you before

568
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Your hat is so interesting!

569
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Where do you work?

570
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,320
I am a gynecologist in the capital

571
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
To treat women?

572
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,920
You are rich!

573
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,920
Ladies and gentlemen

574
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
How are you

575
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Welcome here to watch
the dissection of the Flying Fairy

576
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,320
This is a very precious chance

577
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,920
Now, this is solely shown to you

578
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
Where is His Majesty?

579
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,320
In order to let you see clearly

580
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,520
In five consecutive nights
we will repeat, repeat and repeat...

581
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,320
to show you the process
of the dissection

582
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,520
To let you see it clearly

583
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,520
No need...

584
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,920
And, we have invited the farmers
who discovered it to this meeting

585
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,920
Let me now interview...

586
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,320
someone who witnessed
the discovery of the fairy first

587
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
that's a dog

588
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,320
Its eye is so big

589
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,920
Will it be clearer?

590
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Where is its wing? How can it fly then?

591
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
It's really weird!

592
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Kidding! It is small
or less the same as me

593
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Right, as ugly as you

594
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
What are you doing?

595
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,120
I am checking its sex

596
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,520
It must be a girl

597
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
It is a girl

598
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,520
I know she is pregnant

599
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120

600
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120

601
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,720
Don't mess up!

602
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,520
Any gynecologist here?

603
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
He is

604
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,520
Move, move now

605
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,120
Why not... Give her some medicine?

606
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Do you know dissection?

607
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I know

608
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,520
Take this cutter and start working

609
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
I won't give it a damn

610
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
But, may I use this?

611
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,520
Don't move

612
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you know how to dissect?

613
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,520
Cut from the throat
let the blood drain out first

614
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I know it already

615
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Come on

616
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,120
In fact, I am not a doctor

617
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
I am a butcher

618
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
You coward, you needn't find excuse

619
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Let me do it

620
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,040
Have you fixed yet?

621
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Good question, I've just fixed it

622
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,640
Wait

623
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,640
What's up?

624
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
His Majesty!

625
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,640
I know it's you!

626
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
Who chopped me?

627
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,640
Someone chopped you?

628
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
That's him!

629
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
But that is his sword

630
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
You bastard!

631
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I want to chop you twice

632
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,040
What's wrong?

633
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Why do you hold the sword?

634
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Stay calm

635
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Yes! There is conspiracy!

636
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,640
Conspiracy?

637
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Your Majesty

638
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,640
I, Ling Ling Fat will protect you

639
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
My sword is sucked away, so powerful

640
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Come on, one for each one

641
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Your Majesty, you first

642
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,040
Wait

643
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Don't despise us

644
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,640
We earn our living by holding swords too
Yes!

645
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,040
Don't get angry, drink some water first

646
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
All dead!

647
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
What kind of monster is it?

648
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Try my Lo Chiu's Sword Stance

649
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I wanna kill you! Give me

650
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
This is my sword!

651
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Let's attack from both sides OK

652
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
So great!

653
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Stop!

654
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,040
Are you kidding?

655
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640
Why do you always beat me?

656
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
Boss

657
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Your feet betrayed you

658
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
Don't you think I am a fool?

659
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Hurry...

660
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Watch me!

661
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I know, same sex will reject each other

662
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Fat, how are you?

663
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,640
This magnet is really great

664
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,640
Shit!

665
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,040
Different sex attracts each other

666
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
Are you kidding?

667
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah!

668
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,920
Fat, you're really something

669
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Thank you. Your Majesty
we'd better leave

670
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,920
OK, let's go!

671
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,920
Leave now

672
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Honey

673
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,920
Your wife has come too?

674
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,120
Introduce her to me

675
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,920
Go back first, here is so dangerous

676
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
Why there is one living?

677
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,800
Is there any
accident happened to my son?

678
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,360
Where is my wife!

679
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,240
Search! Many people are
lying on the floor!

680
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,800
Cut the crap, kill him

681
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,120
No matter where you're hiding
you have to be killed

682
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,560
Kill him

683
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,640
What the hell is it?

684
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,600
Kidding?

685
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,120
Hubby

686
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,720
Hubby

687
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,520
Same costume! Why?

688
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,600
Honey

689
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,160
Hubby

690
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Where have you been?

691
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,120
I met a friend who
lives in the next village

692
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,880
There is a crazy sale in next village
so I went for shopping with her

693
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,600
What are you doing here?

694
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,520
I am... looking for you

695
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,680
Is there a fire?

696
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,520
We have had barbecue here

697
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,920
Barbecue?

698
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,120
Yes, roast chicken wings

699
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,120
Why do they lie on the floor?

700
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,880
They are full, it's nice to have a rest

701
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,320
What's wrong with you?

702
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,800
You ate with violence, didn't you?

703
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,920
What the hell is it?

704
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,160
All people fought for one chicken wing!

705
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I fought with all my might
that's the result

706
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,680
Don't you think I am nuts?

707
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,040
He...

708
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,040
Honey

709
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,880
You...

710
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,680
Where do you get this?

711
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,000
This?

712
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,800
If you like it, just take it

713
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,800
I don't mean it

714
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,160
and I don't want to take your advantage

715
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,880
If I want it
I will ask my husband to buy me one

716
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,400
He is damn rich

717
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,160
I want to tell you that
this doesn't match you

718
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,000
The color is no good

719
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,600
You have a big belly
this kind of clothes doesn't fit you

720
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,720
We may have a look in the shops
of the nearby village

721
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,160
Let's go, let's have a look

722
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,400
My wife

723
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,800
She has fashion sense

724
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes, she is nice

725
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,000
Brother Fat

726
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Come on...

727
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,640
Come on...

728
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,640
Hubby, you have laughed
since you are back

729
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,400
What make you feel so happy?

730
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,720
This morning
I saw a fat woman fall into water ditch

731
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,240
A fat woman fell into water ditch?
What is so funny?

732
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,000
Fat woman!

733
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,000
Water ditch!

734
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,880
Honey

735
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,040
In all these years...

736
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,280
Listen to me

737
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,160
Go ahead

738
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,680
We have had poor living

739
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,000
Don't you mind it?

740
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,160
It depends on you

741
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,600
If you don't mind
eating the food I cooked

742
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,120
I don't mind too

743
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,680
In all these years

744
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,880
other than great inventions

745
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,600
I haven't sent anything
say diamond to you

746
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,640
Why don't you complain against me?

747
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,720
Sure. I have complaints

748
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
That super groom

749
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,120
I have to clean the floor with two legs

750
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,640
My hands are free

751
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,240
So, I have to clean
the window with one hand

752
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,080
another hand to wash clothes

753
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,680
It's so troublesome!

754
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,120
You've discovered that!

755
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,120
Yeah...

756
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,680
And your air system

757
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,600
What's wrong?

758
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,680
I don't want to waste time to complain
it drives me crazy

759
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,680
Sure it will

760
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,680
What diamond have you hidden?

761
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,520
Take it out now

762
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,680
Honey

763
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,160
How are you?

764
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,480
Did you rob?

765
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,120
No, I didn't

766
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,600
I cured a man who is damn rich

767
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,040
He paid much money as medical fee

768
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,720
That's why I bought it to you

769
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,680
Honey!

770
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,120
Don't come over. Leave me alone

771
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,200
Are you alright?

772
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,120
I'm too happy, I can't control myself

773
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,800
So pretty

774
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,080
I love you, honey

775
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,160
I love you too

776
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,000
Forever

777
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,160
Fat, I heard that in the
biggest prostitute in town

778
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,160
there is a new girl called
Gum Tso who came from Gum Kingdom

779
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,320
Her name is so beautiful! It fancies me!

780
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,800
Go and check her background

781
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,160
If she is OK, take her to me

782
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,760
Are you kidding, Your Majesty?

783
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,280
How can you let me
carry such nice mission?

784
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,640
You are the fellow I trust most
you know?

785
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,960
And, everyone knows
you are a good husband

786
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,640
You won't take my woman

787
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,360
So, you are the appropriate person
to take this job

788
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,040
May I be frank

789
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,400
Your Majesty
you have many concubines already

790
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,680
Why do you still want an affair?

791
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,800
You... The beauties have arrived!

792
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,640
Now, you understand?

793
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Sure!

794
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,560
Your Majesty, please tolerate

795
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,280
I...

796
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,760
I will fix it as soon as possible

797
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,160
Bastards, who do you think you are!

798
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,040
We're high-class night club
You think we're prostitute?

799
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,120
Members only!

800
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,080
Take enough money if you
want to join our club

801
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,440
Damn it, I've fooled around for years

802
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,760
I haven't experienced
such embarrassing moment

803
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,880
Let's ask someone to ruin this place

804
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,680
Shut up

805
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:22,000
Damn it!

806
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,080
I am the procuress

807
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,080
Granny, do you wanna
sell your daughter to us?

808
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,080
Let me take a look at her first

809
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,640
She is beautiful

810
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Look

811
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,360
So?

812
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,200
I wanna beat someone up

813
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,040
Can I slap her heavily?

814
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,720
Don't be so mean
you have to give others face anyway

815
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,880
You wanna beat me
I do wanna hit you hardly with rod too

816
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,760
Damn it
how can you talk to me in this way?

817
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,840
The girls here are all
as pretty as angels

818
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,880
Especially the girls from Gum Kingdom

819
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,280
You won't believe it

820
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,080
big eyes, tall nose, little mouth

821
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,280
Ask them to come out for a comparison

822
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,760
She is much more beautiful than you!

823
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,080
Get lost now!

824
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,560
Or, I will slap you! I mean it

825
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,680
She is coming out

826
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,000
The beauty from
Gum Kingdom is coming out

827
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,720
Miss

828
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,520
May I?

829
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,920
What's up?

830
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,520
You stand here without making a noise!

831
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,480
Don't you know dancing
or don't you know talking?

832
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,560
I don't know you

833
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,400
I am Gum Tso

834
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,760
Fat, so many women around!

835
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,800
Fat...

836
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,240
Honey!

837
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,520
Hubby, you're back!

838
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Hubby
I've made a clothe for my birthday party

839
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,040
Isn't it pretty

840
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,040
It's good looking!

841
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,800
I invite many relatives and
friends to have dinner with us!

842
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,920
Remember to come home earlier!

843
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,720
Remember?

844
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,600
Hubby
I can smell fragrance from your body

845
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,160
Wonderful nose you have!
I bought you cosmetics!

846
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,920
Why do you buy me cosmetics?

847
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,160
For your birthday!

848
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,040
Good boy!

849
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,520
Have a bath first!

850
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,600
Alright, let's bath together!

851
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,680
I have bathed. Go bathing now

852
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,640
Better bath again You go alone

853
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,720
I am the procuress
welcome to be our new member

854
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,120
Seeing you...

855
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,760
I have something, very, very...

856
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,880
Strange feeling that...

857
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,400
Say, you feel like slapping me

858
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,600
Right...

859
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,240
Right...

860
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:52,920
Correct

861
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
Correct

862
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,480
Is Miss Gum Tso here?

863
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,760
Sure!

864
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,880
I want to see her at once

865
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,280
Do you want to see her?

866
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,400
They are wishing to see Miss Gum Tso too

867
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,360
Line up, don't you think a handsome
& smart guy need not line up?

868
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,600
How can you tell I am smart?

869
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,400
I can tell you are sincere

870
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,000
and kind-hearted, too!

871
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,200
It's lucky to have a friend like you

872
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,760
Shit! You can tell it too

873
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,920
I have to treat you dinner!

874
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,480
Sure you have to

875
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,880
Line up!

876
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,880
Bastard!

877
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,520
Miss Gum Tso, I've waited you for ages!

878
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,360
Stay calm...

879
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,120
Miss Gum Tso wishes to treat you a drink

880
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,120
Take a glass over there

881
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,000
I want one

882
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,920
Miss Gum Tso, a toast to you

883
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,520
It's nasty. What's this?

884
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,480
Good wine!

885
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,600
What a nice wine
it makes one lose his mind!

886
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,840
This must be an old wine
of over 100 years old

887
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,880
I believe that this is
tribute from foreign country

888
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,360
Isn't it so precious?

889
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,720
Are you exaggerating, Pal?

890
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,360
You are totally wrong!

891
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,000
You drink it without tasting it

892
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,280
Even it isn't wine

893
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,200
you can never tell its taste!

894
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,480
Wine is like woman
you have to try it by some means.

895
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,320
Can anyone lend me his tongue?

896
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,240
Any longer one?

897
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,240
Right

898
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,880
The taste buds are on the
surface of our tongues

899
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,360
Not under

900
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,880
The sweet taste buds are in front

901
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,400
The bitter taste buds
are near the throat

902
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,960
Don't make it too deep

903
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,720
Alright, I'll place it in front

904
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,840
The sour taste bud is
on both sides of the tongue

905
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,320
So, when we taste good wine

906
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,400
roll the tongue

907
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,520
you need more practice

908
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,760
So, you can stop the wine
meeting the sour taste bud

909
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,360
And let the wine floats between
bitter and sweet taste buds

910
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Sweet first, and then bitter...

911
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,120
Just like...

912
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,320
the sense of first love

913
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,800
Congratulation, Gum Tso would like
to meet you in the sitting room

914
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,200
Miss Gum Tso... Don't be anxious

915
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,800
Why don't you...

916
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,480
You seem to have sore throat

917
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,920
Are you missing your wife?

918
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,880
How do you know that?

919
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,760
Chinese people usually
have early marriage

920
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,000
You seem to be mature and trustable

921
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,400
I guess, you must have married for years

922
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,120
You are flattering me

923
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,840
You don't seem to be Chinese

924
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,400
I come from Gum Kingdom

925
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,880
Do you have racial discrimination?

926
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,040
No way, don't be silly

927
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,360
Miss, you seem...

928
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,600
You are fat, and you are thin

929
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,960
You are bored

930
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,000
Give me a surprise

931
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,400
Do you want any surprise?

932
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,520
Do you have any?

933
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,360
Don't despise me

934
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,280
Take it out

935
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,280
Do you want me to take it out?

936
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,000
Come on

937
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,800
This is for you

938
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,840
So pretty! Thank you

939
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,360
You are really different!

940
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,840
Usually, when the girls
see such precious pearl

941
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,120
either they will scream

942
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,640
or, some will die because
of too much excitement

943
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,920
You don't value material life at all
you are really...

944
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,760
Really different!

945
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,000
Mister, do you have time to stay?

946
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,640
To have a long talk?

947
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,400
My wife has prepared dinner
I don't think it's good for me to stay

948
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,240
Why do you come then?

949
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,520
Even cats will be
motivated by such atmosphere!

950
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,480
Do you know what the cat is talking?

951
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,280
That cat said

952
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,760
Don't bother me, mom will scold me

953
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,440
Why do you hurt yourself?

954
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,560
It brings excitement!

955
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,680
So amazing!

956
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,640
There are many amazing things
you haven't tried that before

957
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,200
If you stay

958
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,440
I will try my very best

959
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,200
to make your all eyes

960
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:42,920
I can't do that

961
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,080
I am married, I love my wife

962
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,520
Although I wish to do it
I have to control myself

963
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,760
Well, I won't give it a damn!

964
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,240
Come on...

965
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,760
A good husband is hard to
find in the world

966
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,800
Since you are thinking of your wife

967
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,160
I won't push you

968
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,080
Send Mister to the door

969
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,760
Yes

970
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,000
Wait... Please leave

971
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,680
No, I've just made up my mind...

972
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,760
Please go back

973
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,320
So bad! I have halfly undressed!

974
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,280
Give me a chance!

975
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,600
Forget it, Mister

976
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,080
Miss Gum Tso

977
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,920
Cheers...

978
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,080
Sweet wine...

979
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,040
Hubby, what's wrong with you?

980
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,440
I haven't been that smart

981
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,320
There isn't any rice in your bowl

982
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,160
Hubby, I've discovered that
the cosmetic you sent me that night

983
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,280
doesn't smell like those
found from your body

984
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,880
Didn't I tell you?

985
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,080
That's made by a thing called Magic Musk

986
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,760
The smell will change according
to different timings

987
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,880
At night, it stinks

988
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,640
No, it doesn't stink

989
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,320
It stinks

990
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,320
On that day
you sent me a very big pearl

991
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,320
I do want to show off tonight

992
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,280
But I couldn't find it out at all

993
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,800
Do you know where is it?

994
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
This is life

995
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,720
If you want to find something anxiously

996
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,240
you can never find it

997
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,640
If you are smart, you need not find it

998
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,480
cause it will show up later

999
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,480
Father-in-law, have the chicken ass

1000
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,320
I remember

1001
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,040
Why did you go to the
prostitute house on that day?

1002
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,920
Prostitute house?

1003
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,680
Yes, prostitute house

1004
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,640
What did you say?

1005
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,120
I saw him visiting hookers

1006
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,840
Listen to me

1007
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,800
Wait

1008
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,600
Don't lie to me

1009
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,120
I can tell it's true or not easily

1010
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,480
Hooker is woman, she will get sick

1011
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,520
As a gynecologist
I went there for treatment

1012
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,680
It's nothing weird

1013
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,120
Daughter, is his heart beating fast?

1014
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,360
No

1015
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,360
That's good

1016
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,880
Sorry, hubby

1017
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,960
You are too bad for you
don't trust me at all

1018
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,160
It's fragrant! Can you smell it?

1019
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,920
Miss, who are you looking for?

1020
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,720
I come here to buy herb

1021
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,720
Do you have any chiretta
(means home coming in Chinese)?

1022
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,720
Are you in urgent need? Come later

1023
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,640
I love a man very much

1024
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,720
He hasn't come to me for many days

1025
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,600
I come to buy chiretta which
means home coming in Chinese

1026
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,720
for I really want him to
come back this night

1027
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,920
Miss, I suggest you to buy Tu-wo
(means living alone)

1028
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,720
Living alone, don't bother others

1029
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,920
You have a kind of special smell
I smelt once!

1030
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,120
Yes, this perfume is called Hooking Soul

1031
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
Only I have this kind of
special perfume in town

1032
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,720
It is an amazing perfume
to seduce man, right?

1033
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,120
But I can't hook the man I love

1034
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,120
No matter how hard I torture myself

1035
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,920
he just brushes me off and comes here
to have dinner with his wife

1036
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
So, I come here to see his wife

1037
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,800
Today is my daughter's birthday

1038
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,440
Don't mess up here

1039
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,560
You have seen what you want now

1040
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,560
So pretty

1041
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,760
Prettier than you

1042
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:51,760
Send her to the door

1043
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,560
Madam

1044
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,760
Today is your birthday!

1045
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,560
I haven't any present

1046
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,400
But, why not
take this little thing as my present?

1047
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,400
Are you kidding?

1048
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,760
Right, when you don't want to find it
it will show up itself

1049
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,480
Are you kidding? You sent it to her?

1050
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,480
This is your present to me
how I can send it to others?

1051
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,360
What is your relationship? Tell me

1052
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,480
By the way, it seems to be clear!

1053
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,880
You bastard!

1054
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,480
How can you treat my daughter like this?
Are you a man?

1055
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,360
Granny, don't be angry

1056
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,480
Give me back the pearl

1057
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,480
Madam, don't be excited!

1058
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,480
You bitch, I wanna kill you!

1059
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:53,880
Don't move Don't move

1060
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,480
If you hurt her, I will kill you

1061
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,360
If you hurt me, I will kill him

1062
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,880
None of my business, lady!

1063
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,480
Stop her now

1064
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,480
Bitch!

1065
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,880
Drop the horse down

1066
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
What did you say, honey?

1067
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,480
Drop the horse

1068
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,760
You scared my friend

1069
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
You lied

1070
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,480
You said you would love me forever

1071
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,480
You lied too

1072
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,480
You said you were born
in the year of rabbit

1073
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,360
but you were born in the year
of tiger, you are older than me

1074
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,760
You lied, you lied!

1075
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,480
Drop the horse

1076
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
Don't throw me while
I am not paying attention

1077
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,760
I can tell your trick

1078
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,760
Drop it, now!

1079
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,480
Are you alright?

1080
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,360
I am fine

1081
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,480
Sorry to ruin your party

1082
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,480
All because I wish to see you very much

1083
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,480
I am too bad, I am leaving

1084
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,480
I will go with you

1085
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,480
It's nonsense for me to
stay in such nonsense family

1086
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,480
Go

1087
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,480
Hubby

1088
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,480
Are you hungry?
Let me cook noodle for you

1089
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,480
Wait

1090
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,480
What a shame!

1091
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,880
Don't get angry
let's go back to my place

1092
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,360
I will do that with you

1093
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:37,880
That?

1094
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,480
That's what you want

1095
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,880
You are inhumane!

1096
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,760
Oh my God!

1097
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,760
We have become a couple at last

1098
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,480
On this stormy night
we will enjoy ourselves!

1099
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,760
You look cheap

1100
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,480
You haven't seen my cheaper look

1101
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,760
Alright, listen to me

1102
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,880
I have had hard feeling

1103
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,360
Your wife felt so sad

1104
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,480
For you, I can sacrifice
my wife as well as my life

1105
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,880
Don't say anything nonsense

1106
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,360
I don't want to cheat you

1107
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,760
I am a Forbidden City Cop
my duty is to protect His Majesty

1108
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,480
I came here for
His Majesty is fond of you

1109
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,760
He wants me to check your background

1110
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,360
You don't check me
you just want to screw me

1111
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,760
You are betraying His Majesty

1112
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,760
But I can't help loving you

1113
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,760
Forget about him!

1114
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,760
Ling Ling Fat!

1115
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,360
Luckily you have come on time

1116
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,880
Did you hear everything?

1117
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,480
You!

1118
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,880
If she didn't write to His Majesty

1119
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,480
we wouldn't have known that
you betrayed His Majesty

1120
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,480
You...

1121
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,760
In order to trap him

1122
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,880
I don't mind risking my virginity

1123
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,880
Your Majesty, if you come a bit late

1124
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,360
I don't know what will happen!

1125
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,880
You...

1126
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,880
Ling Ling Fat, your family will have
capital punishment, you know?

1127
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,360
Your Majesty, I...

1128
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:43,880
Catch him

1129
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,360
Your Majesty, why do you cuff me?

1130
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,480
Your trap is really great!

1131
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,480
You want me to break my family

1132
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,760
Then you make His Majesty kill me

1133
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,360
You will kidnap him
to blackmail the government

1134
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,880
Then your troop will move from
the North to take over our country

1135
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,480
It seem to be a piece of cake

1136
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:16,880
Damn!

1137
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,480
But, you remember the pearl

1138
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,880
which fancies all women in the world?

1139
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,480
When you received that pearl, you didn't
feel excited, that's why I know

1140
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,880
you are not a woman

1141
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,880
Who is my foe?

1142
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,760
And who will undergo such
fantastic plastic surgery?

1143
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Only a faceless old folk will do it

1144
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,360
King of no face, you bastard!

1145
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,760
I hate others to cheat me
by pretending as woman!

1146
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,480
Especially disguising as such
pretty woman to seduce me!

1147
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,360
Luckily Fat is so smart!

1148
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,480
He disclosed your secret

1149
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,360
Your Majesty

1150
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Don't trust him!

1151
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,480
He wanted to screw me
so he brushed his wife off

1152
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,480
and he even beat
his wife up in front of me

1153
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
He isn't a man at all

1154
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,880
In order to trap you

1155
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,880
my family performed
a show in front of you

1156
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,880
Dear audience

1157
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,880
The best actress

1158
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,240
In the play

1159
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,240
she acted very well that

1160
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,160
no matter judging from her eyes

1161
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,240
or movement

1162
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,240
she could express how a sad wife feels

1163
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,240
Especially when she threw the horse

1164
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,680
it shows a strong protest originated
from post modernism

1165
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,440
Let us see how she threw the horse again

1166
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,240
Watch! Watch!

1167
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,240
Mrs. Fat, congratulation...

1168
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,240
Thank you

1169
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,240
First of all, I have to thank my parents

1170
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,440
Since they have been supporting me

1171
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,160
And I have to thank my husband

1172
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,240
He gave me chance to act

1173
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,440
We had rehearsed many many times

1174
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,240
So, this award is yours too

1175
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,440
Hubby, thank you

1176
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,160
Alright, let's present the
final award of this night

1177
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,440
I believe that, you can guess it. Right

1178
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,240
The best actor is...

1179
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,440
Ah Fat's father-in-law

1180
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,680
Wonderful!

1181
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,680
This award should go to me

1182
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,160
I did see him visiting
the prostitute house!

1183
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,440
Please wait. I am sorry

1184
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,440
I am the leading man!

1185
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,680
You can tell I have done a great job

1186
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
Why do you present the award to him?

1187
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,440
Your acting is quite good
but not mature

1188
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,160
Say, when your wife
heard your heart beat

1189
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,680
your expression was a bit exaggerated

1190
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,680
That's the point of view
of ordinary audiences!

1191
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,440
You won't be that ignorant?

1192
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,160
No, when I heard your heart beat

1193
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,680
I couldn't feel any response from you

1194
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,680
I felt that, you couldn't
concentrate in acting

1195
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,240
You didn't act well indeed

1196
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,440
You...

1197
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,240
Be fair

1198
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,440
Just one word

1199
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,440
You don't know acting

1200
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,240
Shut up! Gum Tso's sex
is still a doubtful question

1201
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,440
How can you present awards here?

1202
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,440
It's a mess

1203
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,680
Your Majesty, I...

1204
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,120
I am a person who is
willing to die for you

1205
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,000
Let me use my body

1206
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,400
to check whether Gum Tso
is a woman or not

1207
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,160
Be careful!

1208
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,240
Ling Ling Fat
you killed my wife and my son

1209
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,680
Even I can't kill your family

1210
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,160
I want to kill you too

1211
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,240
Neither of you can go

1212
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,240
Protect His Majesty

1213
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,240
Fat-yan, take the Box of Treasure to me

1214
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,240
Catch it

1215
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,680
Why did you ask me to throw it to you?

1216
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,160
Game over!

1217
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,680
I am sorry

1218
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,160
It doesn't hurt!

1219
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,440
But the one next to you is in bad luck

1220
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,440
That's No-face Stance

1221
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,440
It can transfer energy

1222
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,240
Pal, are you alright?

1223
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,680
I am scared

1224
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,160
But I am fine

1225
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,440
I feel comfortable

1226
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,680
It's not painful at all

1227
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:29,680
So, I won't give it a damn

1228
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
Let me do it

1229
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,160
Pal, didn't you say comfortable?

1230
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,240
It's really comfortable

1231
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,240
Forget it

1232
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,440
You'd better beat that guy

1233
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,240
I have to think something else

1234
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,240
Forget it, please hit me

1235
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,680
It's not predictable

1236
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:16,240
No color, no face, long life to stay!

1237
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,440
I am the supreme of the world!

1238
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,160
Who is it?

1239
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,240
My dear sister

1240
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,240
We all rely on you!

1241
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
Soul Changing Stance

1242
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,680
I feel dizzy, I can't stand it anymore

1243
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,680
It's cheap! Who do you want to scare?

1244
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,120
Don't you think such chain
can lock me up?

1245
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,320
It's not for locking you
it's used to connect the lightning-rod

1246
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,520
You said, we will enjoy ourselves
on a stormy night

1247
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,120
I'll let you try
a wonderful thunder storm

1248
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
Yeah

1249
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,080
Yeah

1250
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:34,920
Yeah

1251
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,280
Yeah...

1252
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,080
Don't move!

1253
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,440
Fly...

1254
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,440
Flying...

1255
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Fa...

1256
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,080
Fairy

1257
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,880
The thunder hit Fat

1258
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,440
So it transform his cells

1259
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,880
During the process
he gained extra power

1260
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,880
So, he can release
the power of Flying Fairy

1261
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,280
At that moment, it seems that
there was a flying fairy in the sky

1262
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,440
Isn't it illusion caused by air crash

1263
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,880
or am I drunk?

1264
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,080
Of course you are drunk

1265
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,280
So, you have drunk much more than me

1266
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,880
I am drunk everyday

1267
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,280
It's strange
why hasn't Fat come to work today?

1268
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,080
Brother Fat, where are you?

1269
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,440
We can't live without you

1270
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,440
Brother Fat, come back!

1271
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,080
Hubby, it's so great!

1272
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,280
Your new invention can
let us fly freely in the sky

1273
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
Let us name it...

1274
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,080
Helicopter, isn't it nice?

1275
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,080
No, this isn't a good name

1276
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,080
Why not name it...

1277
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,280
Air air air air air O Plane?

1278
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,280
You are so smart, honey

1279
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,880
If not, how can I be your honey?

1280
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,280
Hubby, let's fly again

1281
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,280
So romantic! Yes

1282
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,440
I want to have a baby with you

1283
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,440
Really? Really

1284
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,280
Alright, let's go home and make love

1285
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,440
No way, I can't wait

1286
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,880
Let's do it here!

1287
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,280
You can't be serious Come on!

1288
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,640
