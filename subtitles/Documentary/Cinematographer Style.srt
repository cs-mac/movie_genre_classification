Good morning, sir.
Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.

4
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,097
Let me just grab a pager for you here,

5
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,649
and we'll get you to sit
with a banking professional

7

8
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,818
Oh, it's going to light up and vibrate.

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,700
The red lights spin around in a circle.
You won't be able to miss it.

10
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,135

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,054

We're ready for you now.

14
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,737
I'm seeing an overdrawn balance
in your daily checking.

15
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,414
Seems like your direct deposits
haven't been

16
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,889
received in a few months. From...

17

Yeah, I've been phoning them for weeks.

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,579
I couldn't get a straight answer.

20
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,651
And how about
this, uh, foreclosure notice?

21
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,210
Ah. The yellow one.
So you must be in default.

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,577
My mortgage payment tripled. Overnight.

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,936
You were on our teaser rate promo,
which expired back in January.

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,091
That's why it's called a teaser rate.

25
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,535
Right? It doesn't last. Make sense?

26
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,651
And the new rate is quite a bit higher,

27
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,210
so the monthly mortgage payment
jumped up.

28
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,692
Now, we are required to disclose
that possibility at the time of the refi.

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,131
- You did.
- I did what?

30
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,896

40

that the odds on the rate
going past the prime rate

41
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,412
were extraordinary.

42
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,099
But possible.

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,730
But you sold me "extraordinary."

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,939
- But the "possible" was disclosed.
- Listen, Chuck.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,739
My granddaughter and my daughter,
they live with me.

46

She is a nurse's aide, you know,
low pay and all that.

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,449
She wanted her kid to go to a better
school, so they moved in with me.

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,418
- Lots of people doing that.
- Yeah. So you see,

You didn't steal anything.

624
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,460
Because your storm trooper here
was chasing me.

625
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,020
No, they were chasing your friends.

626
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,370
He was chasing me.
When somebody chases me, I run.

627
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
That's the way it works.

628
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,132
Look, you guys are old.

629
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,770
And I'm gonna be there in 40,
or 50 years, I get it.

And we double them on Tuesday,
but I'm sure you already know that.

633
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,938
So don't steal. It's wrong.

634
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,894
But if you do steal,
don't steal from Value Town.

635
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,571
Yeah, couple of great friends I got.

636
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,651
You just made me an accomplice
to a robbery.

637
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,572
We never asked you to do anything.

638
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,573
I drive you there. I drive you back.
That makes me a getaway driver.

Oh, don't flatter yourself.

and she drove a horse and buggy.

That's a good one.
Just for that you can walk home.

Don't touch my car. Don't get in the car.
