Hi! We're ready.

One, two, three.

14
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:17,138
I haven't seen you for many years,
since 1968.

15
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:23,645
I have decided that I will
do no more jazz festivals.

16
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:26,899
That decision has not changed.

17
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:30,532
I will sing for you,

18
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:34,955
or we will do and share with you
a few moments,

00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:40,243
after which I shall graduate
to a higher class, I hope,

20
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,663
and I hope you will come with me.

21
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,967
We will start from the beginning,

[interviewer] What's "free" to you, Nina?

28
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,546
-What's "free" to me?
-Yeah.

29
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:01,998
Same thing it is to you.
You tell me.

30
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:04,130
[interviewer] No, no, you tell me.

31
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:05,927
[both laughing]
[interviewer] I don't know.

32
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:10,892
It's just a feeling.

33
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,225
It's just a feeling.

34
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,390
It's like, "How do you tell somebody
how it feels to be in love?"

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,440
How are you going to tell anybody
who has not been in love

36
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:20,944
how it feels to be in love?

37
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,197
You cannot do it to save your life.

38
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,659
You can describe things
but you can't tell them,

39
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:29,152
but you know it
when it happens.

40
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,824
That's what I mean by "free."

41
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:34,493
I've had a couple of times onstage
when I really felt free,

42
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,664
and that's something else.

00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,517
People seem to think that
when she went out on stage,

63
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,439
that was when she became Nina Simone.

[Lisa] When she was performing,
she was brilliant, she was loved.

74
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,027
She was also a revolutionary.

75
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:01,156
She found a purpose for the stage,

76
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:07,175
a place from which she could
use her voice to speak out for her people.

[interviewer] Good evening.
Our guest tonight is Nina Simone.

90
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:15,993
Probably the foremost blues singer,
jazz singer, singer of all songs

91
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,537
in the United States today.

92
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,210
Nina, are you happy with
the kind of work you are doing?

93
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,420
[Nina] What makes me the happiest,

94
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:26,802
is when I'm performing
and there are people out there

95
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,181
who feel with me
and I know I touched them.

96
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,259
But to be completely honest,

97
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:35,394
the whole thing
seems so much like a dream.

98
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,893
I never thought I was gonna
stay in show business.

99
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,937
When I first got into show business,

100
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,021
I wasn't a blues singer
and I wasn't even a jazz singer.

101
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,187
I was a classical pianist.

102
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,527
I studied to become

103
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,911
the first black classical pianist
in America,

104
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,320
and that's all that was on my mind.

105
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,739
That's what I was prepared to be.

106
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,870
I was born Eunice Waymon,
which is my real name, by the way,

107
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,499
in a town called
Tryon, North Carolina.

108
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:08,808
I started to play the piano
when I was three or four.

109
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,975
My mother was a preacher

110
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:15,144
and she took me with her
on her revivals,

111
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,855
and I started to play the piano in church.

that I've ever had.

119
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,085
The music was so intense,

120
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:47,755
you just sort of went out of yourself.

121
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,094
I felt it tremendously.

122
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,639
I was leading it.

123
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:57,189
When I was seven, the choir of our church
gave a program at the local theater,

124
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,611
and I was on that program...

125
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,111
And I played some song,
I don't remember what it was,

126
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:07,194
and these two women, two white women,
in the audience heard me.

127
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,742
One of them was the woman
that my mother worked for,

128
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:13,496
and the other one was a music teacher,
Mrs. Mazzanovich,

129
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,460
and they decided right then and there
to give me lessons.

130
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,342
And so, for five years after that,

131
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,010
I studied piano, classical piano,
with this teacher.

132
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:32,106
I crossed the railroad tracks
every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.

133
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,734
And, you know,
railroad tracks in the South

134
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,020
are supposed to be dividing
the blacks from the whites.

135
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,275
Well, it really did.

136
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,151
I was so scared.

137
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:42,825
Mrs. Mazzanovich frightened me.

138
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:47,824
It was her being white,
in the sense that I had never seen.

139
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,780
She was alien to me.

140
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,620
Her white hair, the combs in it,
her pleasantness...

141
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,088
I loved that.

142
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,289
And she started me on Bach.

143
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,170
And this Bach, I liked him.

144
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,053
Mrs. Mazzanovich had it in her mind

145
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,141
that I was gonna be one of
the world's greatest concert pianists.

146
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:15,778
So it was all
very disciplined classical music.

147
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:19,947
Bach, Beethoven, Debussy,
Brahms, you name it.

148
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:24,738
Then Mrs. Mazzanovich got a fund together,
"Eunice Waymon Fund,"

149
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,825
and I gave lots of recitals,

150
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,910
and they would take up collection

151
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:31,455
to further my education
after I had left her.

152
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:36,004
[Lisa] Mommy took to all of the training
like a fish to water,

153
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,798
but it was a double-edged sword.

154
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,471
She had a very lonely life

155
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,970
because she was practicing
seven, eight hours a day.

156
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,933
[Nina]
When I first started to take lessons,

157
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,643
I became terribly aware

158
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:50,345
of how isolated I was
from the other children,

159
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:53,147
and how isolated I was

160
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,072
from the white community
and the negro community.

161
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:59,862
I felt it, all the time,
even when the kids used to play with me.

162
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:03,327
They always wanted me
just to play the piano for them to dance.

163
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:06,249
I wasn't asked too much
to do anything else.

164
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:09,499
That was very hard.

165
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,961
Part of that isolation, of course,
was the thing about color.

166
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,090
I was a black girl, and I knew about it,
and I lived in it.

167
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,226
I lived in the South for 17 years.

168
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,601
[Lisa] My mom rarely referred
to Jim Crow and segregation

169
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:29,772
and a lot of the racial issues that
were going on at that stage in her life.

170
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:32,855
But she did tell me about times
when she was told her nose was too big,

171
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:35,151
her lips were too full
and her skin was too dark.

172
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,569
And after she was told that,
they probably told her,

173
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:42,327
"There's only certain things
you'll be good for in your life."

174
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,531
[Nina] What I knew, I knew.

175
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,991
But we weren't allowed to mention
anything racial in our house.

176
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:50,833
I wasn't consciously dealing with race.

177
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,220
That wasn't consciously
on my mind at all...

178
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,798
until years later.

179
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,054
After I graduated from high school,

180
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:06,571
the money that had been saved
from the Eunice Waymon Fund

181
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:11,816
sent me to New York to Juilliard
for a year and a half.

182
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:18,865
And then I applied for a scholarship to
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

183
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,291
I was playing Czerny and Liszt
and Rachmaninoff and Bach.

184
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:28,042
I knew I was good enough,
but they turned me down,

185
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:33,797
and it took me about six months
to realize it was because I was black.

186
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:40,013
I never really got over
that jolt of racism at the time.

187
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,393
Then the money ran out

188
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:47,689
and the reality hit me
that I had to go to work.

189
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:52,824
My parents had moved the whole family
to Philadelphia to be near me,

190
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:56,074
and my family is very poor,
so I had to work.

191
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,817
What else was there for me to do?

192
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,120
So, I got myself a job
in Atlantic City for a summer.

193
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,716
It was a very crummy bar

194
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,670
and I used to go in in evening gowns.
I didn't know any better.

195
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,217
And I played everything
that I could think of.

196
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:15,721
Pop songs, classical,
spirituals, all kinds of things.

197
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:18,144
It was very strange.

198
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,474
And I had never sung before,

199
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,270
and the owner came in the second night

200
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:25,814
and told me if I wanted to keep the job,
I had to sing.

201
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:32,824
So, $90 was more money
than I had ever heard of in my life,

202
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:36,157
so I said, "Well, I'll sing,"
and ever since then, I've been singing.

203
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:43,085
[Roger Nupie] Eunice Waymon was playing
in the bars to support her family

204
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:47,838
and to have money to continue
her classical piano training.

205
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,583
But since she didn't want
her mother to know that

206
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:53,056
she was playing
"the devil's music" in bars,

207
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,767
she changed her name.

208
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:58,138
Eunice Waymon became Nina Simone.

209
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,522
She named herself "Niña,"
meaning "little one,"

210
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:05,066
and she had a boyfriend
who called her "Niña,"

211
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,910
and "Simone" came from
the French actress Simone Signoret.

212
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,533
[Nina] I didn't want
my mother to find out.

213
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,367
I knew she would hate it.

214
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:19,333
So I, kind of, kept it from her
for a long, long time.

215
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,036
[interviewer] Was it lonely
for a young girl

216
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,786

217
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,838
[Nina] Extremely. Extremely lonely.

[Nina] Couldn't help it.

She was different.

She mixed in folk music with jazz.

How did you meet your husband?

351
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:56,766
[Nina] He came to see me at a nightclub
and a mutual friend introduced us.

352
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:01,449
Nina came to the table and sat,
and I was eating a hamburger plate,

353
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:04,741
and there were fries,
and she dipped into them.

354
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:07,125
And she wanted to know if it was okay.
I said, "All right."

355
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:12,424
We got cute and then she gave me
that card with a note on it.

356
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,961
Then I went over to see her at her place

361
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:42,709
and not just another guy
out for a date or something else?

362
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:45,664
[Nina laughs]
That's a hard question.

363
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:49,295
He told me that he had
wanted to meet me for a long time.

364
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:52,005
And he had come for me.
I fell in love with him.

365
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:56,927
Then later, he scared me to death.
He was so, you know...

00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,303
[Al] I just remember meeting Andy.

375
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:39,302
Here was a tough, New York,
you know, vice squad cop,

376
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:44,099
that when he stepped out
of his car uptown, people ran.

377
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:50,446
And he had... he had a way
of just saying one word...

378
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,195
[in deep voice]
"Hey."

379
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:55,528
...and that could put
a lot of fear in people.

380
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:59,784
But Andy and Nina married in 1961.

381
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,369
He retired from the police force
and became her manager,

382
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:04,456
and he did well for her.

383
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:08,041
They bought a beautiful house
in Mount Vernon, New York.

384
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:12,969
[Nina] We had a 13-room house,

nine months later.

The first three hours after Lisa was born
were the most peaceful in my life,

393
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:57,224
and I was in love with the world.

394
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:58,307
And Andrew was there.

395
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:00,481
He was sitting right there, and he said--

396
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,730
I said, "How's the baby?"
He says, "How's the mother?"

397
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:04,943
And I loved him for that.

398
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,693
I loved being a mother.

00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:08,605
I was a good mother.

400
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,454
I was a goddamn good mother.

401
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:14,486
[Lisa] I remember our house
in Mount Vernon

402
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,776
like the back of my hand.

403
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,079
It was like a fairy tale.

404
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:19,832
I remember seeing
the paisley on the walls.

405
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:22,884
The walls were kind of like a...
[sighs]

406
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,340
They were hued in gold,
but it really wasn't gold.

407
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,091
It was more like a muted gold

408
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:28,713
but it felt like it was velvet.

409
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,759
So I'd always run my hands, like,
over the walls, because it was textured.

410
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:36,267
And my mom,
she had her cold storage

411
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,520
where she kept
her fur coats and her costumes.

412
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:42,234
So I was always in there.

413
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,615
[Andy] These were the good, sweet days.

414
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:48,282
We were building and growing together.

[song continues]

416
00:27:55,871 --> 00:28:00,911
[Andy] I had an overall plan
to develop and create her as an artist.

417
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:04,922
I had set up an office
at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.

418
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:07,216
I had a publicist.

419
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:12,221
I had a guy who was a record-promotion man
that I got from Atlantic Records.

420
00:28:12,306 --> 00:28:16,227
I had another fellow who did
the college radio station promotion,

421
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:19,481
and a photographer.

422
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,974
Dad was the original Puff Daddy.

423
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:25,656
I mean, he really had a vision,
and he was a very astute businessman.

424
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,907
[Andy] And of course, she was burning
to get on to Carnegie Hall.

425
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,120
She had trained as a classical pianist
with the one thought in mind

426
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:37,285
of being the first
black female classical pianist

427
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,165
to appear in Carnegie Hall.

428
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:41,382
That was her prime objective.

429
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,756
However, none of
the New York City promoters

430
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:49,314
would undertake this project.

431
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,428
So, I took my own money
to promote the appearance.

432
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:59,516
She was ecstatic. I mean,
she was out of her mind with joy.

433
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:03,776
[interviewer] You apparently wrote
a letter to your parents saying,

434
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:06,153
"This is where you wanted me to play,

435
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,571

437
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:11,828
but you were still disappointed?

438
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,082
[Nina] Well, I loved the audience,

439
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:18,085
but I wasn't playing classical music,
and I wanted to be,

440
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:19,169

as a popular artist

476
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:28,648
that you'd like to do any classical?

477
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,200
[Nina] Yes, but I don't have time
to think about it too much.

was always traveling.

I had 13 nannies in seven years.

1006
01:02:39,741 --> 01:02:43,241
[Nina] If I'd had my way,
I'd have been a killer.

1007
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:46,078
I would have had guns,
and I would have gone to the South

1008
01:02:46,164 --> 01:02:49,635
and gave them violence for violence,
shotgun for shotgun,

1009
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:51,251
but my husband told me...

1010
01:02:51,337 --> 01:02:53,797
I didn't know anything about guns,
and he refused to teach me,

1011
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:56,431
and the only thing I had was music,
so I obeyed him.

1012
01:02:56,509 --> 01:02:59,890
But if I'd had my way,
I wouldn't be sitting here today.

1013
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:01,932
I'd be probably dead.

1014
01:03:02,015 --> 01:03:04,395
Are you really, really, really ready?

1015
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:06,017
[crowd] Yeah!

1016
01:03:06,103 --> 01:03:08,564
[Andy]
She's putting down the white people...

1017
01:03:08,648 --> 01:03:11,818
[mimics dog] I mean,
you know, like a barking dog,

1018
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:14,741
but she still wanted
all the good things.

1019
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:21,372
Whenever she'd see, like, Aretha Franklin
and Gladys Knight and all of these people

1020
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:26,914
on the prime television shows,
she, of course, was very upset because

1021
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:31,422
she wasn't able to get on to these shows
because of her reputation.

1022
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:36,557
It got so that there wasn't that much work
and the expenses were high.

1023
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:40,018
It was cutting the legs out
from all the work that I had done.

1024
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:41,809
-See you later.
-[crowd cheering]

1025
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:43,563
I'll see you later.

1026
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:44,645
[Lisa] I remember my dad

1027
01:03:44,729 --> 01:03:47,650
complaining about the fact that
she never stopped speaking out,

1028
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:49,773
but that's who she was.

1029
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,070
It was okay when you were onstage.

1030
01:03:51,153 --> 01:03:52,523
It's okay 'cause you let it all hang out,

1031
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:54,823
and then when the show ends
and the lights go out,

1032
01:03:54,907 --> 01:03:56,827
"Okay, let's put the monkey
back in the cage,

1033
01:03:56,909 --> 01:03:59,710
and eat your banana and,
you know, just behave yourself."

1034
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:03,331
It was like she was
penalized and punished

1035
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:05,876
for being herself.

1036
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:11,301
That's a very painful, lonely place to be.

1037
01:04:11,383 --> 01:04:12,393
[tape rolling]

1038
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:13,847
[interviewer] Good evening.

1039
01:04:13,928 --> 01:04:18,059
Tonight my guest in the studio with me
needs almost no introduction.

1040
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:19,641
She is Miss Nina Simone.

1041
01:04:19,726 --> 01:04:23,056
Nina, when it comes to the artists today,
we find that more of the artists

1042
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:27,606
are attempting to alert America
to the need for change.

1043
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:29,244
Is this really the artist's role?

1044
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:34,952
[Nina] Well, I think it's something
that, um, I have chosen to do

1045
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:38,665
and I have felt
compelled to do it.

1046
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:40,957
So it is my role...

1047
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:44,631
but sometimes, I wish it wasn't.

1048
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,632
I think that the artists

1049
01:04:46,714 --> 01:04:50,265
who don't get involved
in preaching messages

1050
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:52,593
probably are happier,

1051
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:57,759
but you see, I have to live with Nina,
and that is very difficult.

I'm gonna get it from both ends.

Nobody's going to understand

1064
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,919
I'm very aware of that.

1065
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,710
Now, I would like some freedom,

[Al] By the late '60s,
I realized that Nina was fighting

1073
01:06:33,915 --> 01:06:37,295
demons that could appear
at any moment and you wouldn't know it.

1074
01:06:37,376 --> 01:06:40,427
She could get violent,
she could get really physical,

1075
01:06:40,505 --> 01:06:43,385
and the change in her
would be dramatic...

1076
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,677
boom, like a switch.

1077
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:49,591
And I... I, after a while,
realized that I was...

1078
01:06:49,682 --> 01:06:53,563
I wasn't with my sister,
I was with "that one..."

1079
01:06:53,644 --> 01:06:57,314

1082
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:21,296
about these fits of depression and anger.

1083
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:24,134
We even went
to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital,

1084
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,980
I think, signed her in
for four or five days.

1085
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:32,227
They conducted every test
known to... medicine at the time

1086
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:35,822

[Andy] And her downward spiral,
it just got worse and worse.

1091
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:20,742
We did a tour with Bill Cosby,

1092
01:08:20,824 --> 01:08:24,375
and the last night,
she became erratic.

1093
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:27,123
She had a can of shoe polish.

1094
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:29,546
She was putting it in her hair.

1095
01:08:29,624 --> 01:08:32,545
And she began talking gibberish,

1096
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:36,388
and she was totally out of it, incoherent.

1097
01:08:36,466 --> 01:08:39,466
It appeared she was having
a nervous breakdown.

1098
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:41,672
And when it came time to go on,

1099
01:08:41,762 --> 01:08:47,683
I had to escort her
by holding her arm onto the stage

1100
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:50,279
and sat her down at the piano,

1101
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:53,947
and I immediately stood in the wings
on the opposite side

1102
01:08:54,027 --> 01:08:56,317
where we could see one another.

1103
01:08:56,404 --> 01:09:00,694
She's watching me pantomime
and she performed.

1104
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:05,710
Basically, she had no control
over her emotions,

1105
01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:10,089
and underneath it all,
sex dominated her.

1106
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:12,840
There were times, once or twice a week,

1107
01:09:12,923 --> 01:09:19,013
when there was a sex attack
when she goes into a maniacal rage.

1108
01:09:19,096 --> 01:09:23,227
There had to be sex.
I mean, this is driving her.

1109
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:27,649
[Nina] My attitude towards sex
was that we should have it all the time.

How did Andy act towards you?

1111
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:33,741

sexually, and he never was able to.

1112
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,820
[interviewer] Right.

1113
01:09:34,906 --> 01:09:38,026
[Nina] He didn't know how to touch me
and he never had enough time.

1114
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:42,497
He'd come to see me late at night
and be there two hours and leave.

[Andy] I knew that she was
dating other people.

We agreed that we could both
have our own outside partners...

1117
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:58,549
but we would work together for the sake
of the business and the child.

participation and activism
during the '60s...

1121
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:18,665

People sacrificed sanity,

Nina Simone was a free spirit

1124
01:10:27,296 --> 01:10:31,216
in an era that didn't really
appreciate a woman's genius.

to a household and a family?

for what white people had done.

I got a divorce from Andy

1211
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,730

When I got to Africa,
I am happy, I'm beyond happy.

1213

Liberia is a place that was founded
by the American slaves,

I also am keenly aware

1222
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:11,577
that I've entered a world
that I dreamed of all my life

1223
01:17:11,657 --> 01:17:14,747
and that it is a perfect world.

1224
01:17:14,826 --> 01:17:17,116
And I remember thinking
of the United States

1225
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:21,414
as something that
I had had in a dream

1226

and I had worked myself out of it

01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:37,345
'cause I had toiled so long
in that place, in that prison...

and there is no going back.

1233
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:46,817
There, it was vast and open,

1234
01:17:46,903 --> 01:17:49,283
and everything was natural.

1235
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:50,374
Everything!

1236
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:55,000
I have seen lightning in Africa
not flash, but hover,

1237
01:17:55,079 --> 01:18:00,249
and what it does is it electrifies you
into complete speechlessness.

1238
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:04,595
I have seen it!
I have seen God.

1239
01:18:11,473 --> 01:18:15,313
[Lisa] In my seventh grade year,
Mom moved me to Liberia,

1240
01:18:15,392 --> 01:18:17,352
but she was always traveling,

1241
01:18:17,437 --> 01:18:20,097
and I never knew half the time
if I wasn't going,

1242
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:22,770
that she was leaving
or when she was coming back.

1243
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:27,700
So I lived with a family for a year
and I went to school there,

1244
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:28,821
and I lived with them

1245
01:18:28,907 --> 01:18:32,788
until Mom came and decided
to buy a house on the beach,

1246
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:36,041
and I went from living with them
to living with her,

1247
01:18:36,124 --> 01:18:38,294
and she just...

1248
01:18:41,129 --> 01:18:43,460
I could never do anything right.

1249
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:50,130
She went from being my comfort
to the monster in my life.

1250
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:53,223
Now she was the person
that was doing the beating,

1251
01:18:53,309 --> 01:18:55,939
and she was beating me.

1252
01:18:56,605 --> 01:19:00,445
One time, we were in public somewhere,
I did something, and she just...

1253
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:04,027
she went off on me
in front of everybody,

1254
01:19:04,113 --> 01:19:05,903
and I didn't show any emotion

1255
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,950
because when Mom...
when Mom would see you cry,

1256
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:10,285
she knew she could
push your buttons.

1257
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:11,620
That's what she wanted,

1258
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,995
and I would not
give her that satisfaction.

1259
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,672
When she would hit me,
I would look her dead in her face...

1260
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:23,507
and she'd be like,
"You better cry. You better cry."

1261
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,223
I wouldn't do it.

1262
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,973
Times got really bad,

1263
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:33,058
to the point where
I thought about committing suicide.

1264
01:19:33,145 --> 01:19:35,895
So, when I was 14,
I flew to New York,

1265
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:39,531
and I wound up living with my dad
and I never went back.

1266
01:19:42,906 --> 01:19:45,526
[Andy] After we broke up,
a lot of things happened.

1267
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:49,077
She didn't file taxes.
She didn't take care of business.

1268
01:19:49,162 --> 01:19:50,872
She lost the house in Mount Vernon.

1269
01:19:50,956 --> 01:19:53,247
Everything went crazy.

1270
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:59,090
[Roger] She lived a nomadic life,
having no manager, having no husband...

1271
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:03,804
but she always said living in Africa
was the happiest time in her life.

1272
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:08,147
She could just be there, enjoy herself.
She didn't have to sing at all.

1273
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:11,775
[Lisa] She wasn't playing piano
and she wasn't performing.

1274
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:15,275
She said she hated the piano.
She hated it.

1275
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:18,618
Think about it. She's playing since
she was four years old.

1276
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:20,618
[Roger] On the other hand,

1277
01:20:20,697 --> 01:20:24,618
she was very well aware
that in Africa, no money came in.

1278
01:20:24,702 --> 01:20:26,662
So she had to pick up her career again.

1279
01:20:28,122 --> 01:20:31,332
She didn't want to return
to what she called,

1280
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:33,587
"The United Snakes of America."

1281
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:38,470
So she moved to Switzerland,
which was the complete opposite of Africa,

1282
01:20:38,549 --> 01:20:41,679
and the first thing she did
was the Montreux concert.

1283
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:45,229

You don't know what I mean.

1291
01:21:33,694 --> 01:21:36,615
And there are many people
in show business who said,

1292
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:39,158
"Oh, she-- You know,
she used to be a star.

1293

1294
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:45,373

which means nothing to me at all.

[Nina] In Switzerland,
there I had no money.

1337
01:25:39,589 --> 01:25:41,549
I never got anything from Andy.

1338
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:44,962
He just cut himself off from me
and I was left high and dry.

1339
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:50,184
So I left Switzerland and I went to Paris,
thinking that I could resume my career.

1340
01:25:50,267 --> 01:25:51,897
I did it alone

1341
01:25:51,978 --> 01:25:55,528
and I landed in the wrong place.

1342
01:25:55,606 --> 01:26:00,237
I was working every night
in a small cafe for about $300 a night.

1343
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:02,619
[stammering]

1344
01:26:03,448 --> 01:26:04,778
[speaking French]

1345
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:12,422
No, we just do "Vous Etes Seuls."

1346
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,670
It goes like this!

1347
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:19,172
[singing "Vous Êtes Seul,
Mais Je Désire Être Avec Vous"]

1348
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:22,638
[Nina] I was desperate
and no one believed that I was there.

1349
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,309
I was too big to be there.
No one came to see me.

1350
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:29,101
And I had fallen from grace.

1351
01:26:30,145 --> 01:26:36,325
I'm sorry that I didn't become
the world's first black classic pianist.

1352
01:26:36,401 --> 01:26:38,992
I think I would have been happier.

1353
01:26:39,071 --> 01:26:42,201
I'm not very happy now.

1354
01:26:42,283 --> 01:26:45,583
I wouldn't change being part
of the civil rights movement.

1355
01:26:45,661 --> 01:26:47,081
I wouldn't change that.

1356
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:50,124
But some of the songs that I sang
have hurt my career.

1357
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:55,628
All of the controversial songs
the industry decided to punish me for...

1358
01:26:55,713 --> 01:26:58,593
and they put a boycott
on all of my records,

1359
01:26:58,675 --> 01:27:01,056
and it's, uh...

1360
01:27:02,513 --> 01:27:05,353
hard for me to incorporate
those songs anymore

1361
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:07,143
because they are
not relevant to the times.

1362
01:27:07,226 --> 01:27:11,107
In terms of the civil rights movement,
how far have we come?

1363
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:12,640
There aren't any civil rights!

1364
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:14,987
What do you mean?

1365
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:18,789
There is no reason to sing those songs.
Nothing is happening.

1366
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:21,784
There's no civil rights movement.
Everybody's gone.

1367
01:27:23,286 --> 01:27:28,246
[Gerrit de Bruin] I met Nina in 1967
and I've been her friend all her life.

1368
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:31,714
She called me in 1982
and she was here in Paris,

1369
01:27:31,795 --> 01:27:35,135
living in a very small apartment,
hardly with any money.

1370
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:39,557
She did concerts of four hours long
at Trois Mailletz, that nightclub,

1371
01:27:39,637 --> 01:27:41,977
and she got
a few hundred dollars a night.

1372
01:27:42,682 --> 01:27:44,692
And that was the worst period.

1373
01:27:44,767 --> 01:27:49,107
I visited her in that little apartment
and it was so dirty,

1374
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:53,400
so I cleaned it all up and,
"Nina, you can't live like this,"

1375
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:55,566
but at that moment,
she was still uncontrollable.

1376
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,779
This thing in the Grand Hotel
in Paris happened.

1377
01:27:58,866 --> 01:28:01,157
Somebody looked her
in the eyes a bit too long,

1378
01:28:01,245 --> 01:28:07,415
and she was already a bit nervous
and she kind of... made a movement

1379
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:09,541
and I thought, "She's going to hit him."

1380
01:28:09,628 --> 01:28:11,089
Immediately, my arms around her,

1381
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:15,472
and I dragged her out in a taxi
and I said to the taxi driver, "Drive!"

1382
01:28:16,802 --> 01:28:21,773
[Al] When I saw her in Paris, she was like
a street urchin dressed in rags.

1383
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:26,600
I couldn't believe what was happening
and I was really, really sad.

1384
01:28:27,273 --> 01:28:30,234
Gerrit and I, we knew
something was very wrong,

1385
01:28:30,318 --> 01:28:32,648
and we were trying to figure out,

1386
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:35,367
and like, "What is it?
What is it, really?"

1387
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:41,540
So Gerrit found her a condo
in Nijmegen in Holland,

1388
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:46,332
and Gerrit had a friend, a doctor,
that he brought to Nina's place,

1389
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:49,329
and the doctor examined her
and asked her questions,

1390
01:28:49,422 --> 01:28:52,423
and he prescribed a medication

1391
01:28:52,509 --> 01:28:56,059
which was kind of new... new spectrum,
called Trilafon.

1392
01:28:57,096 --> 01:29:01,017
[Lisa] It wasn't till I was in my 20s
and I went to visit her in Nijmegen,

1393
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:05,101
that's when I learned the term
"manic-depressive" and "bipolar"

1394
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:06,200
and I remember asking,

1395
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:08,064
"Well, what is that?
What do you mean by that?"

1396
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:09,851
And her mood swings

1397
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,525
and a lot of the things
I dealt with earlier in life

1398
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:14,154
when, you know,
one minute she'd be happy

1399
01:29:14,241 --> 01:29:16,831
and then the next minute...

1400
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:21,041
I'd be dealing with someone
that wasn't in the room five minutes ago.

1401
01:29:21,123 --> 01:29:23,953
It started to make sense.

1402
01:29:24,043 --> 01:29:27,003
[Gerrit] She got so deep
in the shit in the end

1403
01:29:27,088 --> 01:29:31,088
that she realized
it's either dying or give in.

1404
01:29:31,177 --> 01:29:33,927
And she gave in
because we said, "Nina...

1405
01:29:34,012 --> 01:29:38,232
we'll get you a house,
we'll get you your musicians,

1406
01:29:38,309 --> 01:29:41,269
we'll make the things
all right around you,

1407
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:43,765
we'll book your concerts...

1408
01:29:43,857 --> 01:29:46,487
but you have to do as we say.

1409
01:29:47,486 --> 01:29:50,236
You have to take your medicine.
You have to work.

1410
01:29:50,322 --> 01:29:54,123
God has given you the possibility
to be able to do what you do, so do it!

1411
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:57,451
The only thing we want to hear
is either 'yes' or 'no.'"

1412
01:29:57,538 --> 01:30:01,168
And she said,
with tears in her eyes, "Yes."

1413
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:03,288
[Lisa] When I saw her,

1414
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:07,209
I was very concerned because
she had a... a nervous tic.

1415
01:30:07,299 --> 01:30:10,259
You know,
she'd be talking or sitting and this--

1416
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:12,265
Her mouth would always be twitching,

1417
01:30:12,347 --> 01:30:15,727
and when she would walk,
it was more of a shuffle.

1418
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:18,058
And I'm like,
"What's going on here?"

1419
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:20,354
You know, "Why--

1420
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:22,649
What's going on?
What am I missing?"

1421
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,483
And they had her on medication.

1422
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:28,748
[Al] She started taking the Trilafon
and the doctor said,

1423
01:30:28,822 --> 01:30:32,743
"Through the years, it's going
to have an effect on her motor skills.

1424
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:38,297
Her voice is going to start to slur
and her piano abilities will decline.

1425
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,755
You can deal with that

1426
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:45,545
or you can deal with her probably
damaging herself or someone else."

1427
01:30:46,926 --> 01:30:49,386
But the Trilafon really helped.

1428
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,270
I mean, there were times in Holland,

1429
01:30:51,347 --> 01:30:54,478
sitting on her terrace
in these lounge chairs

1430
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,940
and just holding hands...

1431
01:30:56,019 --> 01:30:59,109
I mean, she was like--
She was my sister.

1432
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:03,780
...and not talking at all for hours,
just enjoying the day.

1433
01:31:05,947 --> 01:31:09,287
[Lisa] And I suppose that medication
enabled her to perform

1434
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:12,657
and fulfill the business dealings
that were taking place

1435
01:31:12,746 --> 01:31:15,286
so that her career
could get back on track,

1436
01:31:15,374 --> 01:31:17,334
but there were times
when I questioned that,

1437
01:31:17,418 --> 01:31:18,588
you know,
"But what about her heart?"

1438
01:31:18,669 --> 01:31:22,759
Because at the end of the day,
you guys got wives and husbands and lives,

1439
01:31:22,841 --> 01:31:24,511
but she's alone.

1440
01:31:26,511 --> 01:31:29,721
[Nina] My personal life is a shambles.

1441
01:31:29,806 --> 01:31:34,887
I've had a few love affairs
and I would love to be married,

1442
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:39,399
but everything has had
to be sacrificed for the music.

1443
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:46,490
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1444
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:54,623
[Gerrit] We had to do, first in Holland,
eight concerts,

1445
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:57,499
and the word spread
that Nina's doing the job well.

1446
01:31:57,587 --> 01:32:01,097
Then she was on the road again
and it was... poof.

1447
01:32:01,173 --> 01:32:02,423
The business was going.

1448
01:32:04,595 --> 01:32:05,635
[Roger] She came onstage

1449
01:32:05,721 --> 01:32:09,391
and you had this overwhelming,
emotional feeling

1450
01:32:09,475 --> 01:32:13,525
coming from the audience
just because she was there.

1451
01:32:15,023 --> 01:32:18,023
Now listen to me.

1452
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:19,529
I love you very much.

1453
01:32:19,611 --> 01:32:23,231
I think you know that
and I know that you love me.

1454
01:32:23,322 --> 01:32:24,743
-I know that.
-[audience member whoops]

1455
01:32:24,825 --> 01:32:27,495
[cheers and applause]

1456
01:32:27,578 --> 01:32:28,668
[Roger] And we never knew too well

1457
01:32:28,746 --> 01:32:31,206
what was going to happen
and how the mood would be.

1458
01:32:31,874 --> 01:32:35,465
So this place is very hot
and it's very crowded

1459
01:32:35,546 --> 01:32:37,256
and it's very ugly.

1460
01:32:37,338 --> 01:32:38,798
[audience laughing]

1461
01:32:40,884 --> 01:32:43,514
[Roger] But she opened
her heart and soul

1462
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:44,926
at that moment.

1463
01:32:45,014 --> 01:32:48,134
That's this special kind of connection
she had with an audience.

1464
01:32:48,976 --> 01:32:51,856
This song is popular
all over France.

1465
01:32:52,605 --> 01:32:54,646
It's from our first album...

1466
01:32:54,733 --> 01:32:57,533
the very first album
we made in this world,

1467
01:32:57,611 --> 01:33:00,361
which is at least 25 years old.

1468
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:02,578
I only wish I was as wise...

1469
01:33:02,658 --> 01:33:06,249
could have been as wise then
as I have become now.

1470
01:33:07,622 --> 01:33:08,962
I have suffered.

1471
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:13,711
But there's a Bösendorfer here,
so we'll see what happens.

1472
01:33:13,795 --> 01:33:15,546
"My Baby Just Cares For Me."

1473
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,813
She was helped by
"My Baby Just Cares For Me,"

1474
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:28,891
that song that became a hit
because of the Chanel advertisement.

1475
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:32,019
[Nina] And when "My Baby
Just Cares For Me" came along, I said,

1476
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:35,568
"I have to take this opportunity now
to go all over the world

1477
01:33:35,653 --> 01:33:37,823
because this is my last chance."

1478
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:41,915
And so I worked very hard
to take advantage of my second coming

1479
01:33:41,993 --> 01:33:44,873
because it was my last time
as far as I was concerned.

[Lisa] And she was happiest doing music.
I think that was her salvation.

1490
01:34:26,876 --> 01:34:29,296
That's the one thing that
she didn't have to think about.

1491
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:32,548
When she sat at the piano,
her fingers could fly.

She was a genius.
She was brilliant,

1496
01:34:41,892 --> 01:34:47,193
and that brilliance shone through
no matter what she was going through.

1497
01:34:47,273 --> 01:34:50,993
Even into her old age,
she was brilliant.

[Gerrit] She was genius.
She could do whatever she liked.

1501
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:03,003
And when she didn't
have her medicine,

1502
01:35:03,082 --> 01:35:06,463
she, musically,
could get even further out.

In one of those little concerts,
and it's recorded,

1506
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:20,604
she starts playing one song
and she sings another.

1507
01:35:20,685 --> 01:35:23,355
And this recording,
I made Miles Davis...

1508
01:35:23,437 --> 01:35:26,818
while we were on tour, we were
on the same jazz tour as Miles Davis,

1509
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,400
and I made him listen to it,

1510
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:31,785
and he said, "Gerrit...
let me listen to it again!

1511
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:34,034
How is she doing this?"

1512

1514
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:46,580
[Shabazz] As I got older, I started
to look at her and I thought to myself,

1515
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:49,672
"Wow, she's from another time!"

1516
01:35:49,759 --> 01:35:54,269
But she was not at odds with the times.
The times was at odds with her.

1517
01:35:54,930 --> 01:36:01,781
I think when a person moves
to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow,

1518
01:36:02,731 --> 01:36:07,071
if we were living in an environment
that allowed us to be exactly who we are,

1519
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:09,233
you're always in congress with yourself.

1520
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:10,951
The challenge is,

1521
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:14,202
"How do we fit in in the world
that we're around, but we--

1522
01:36:14,285 --> 01:36:17,165
Are we allowed to be
exactly who we are?

1523
01:36:17,246 --> 01:36:21,997
Was Nina Simone allowed
to be exactly who she was?"

1524
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:26,221
As fragile as she was strong,

1525
01:36:26,298 --> 01:36:29,969
as vulnerable as she was dynamic,

1526
01:36:30,053 --> 01:36:32,813
she was African royalty.

1527
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:36,639
How does royalty
stomp around in the mud

1528
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:38,847
and still walk with grace?

1529
01:36:39,646 --> 01:36:44,276
Most people are afraid
to be as honest as she lived.
