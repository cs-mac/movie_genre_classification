-It's okay, Terra, we understand.

We're here for you.

Yeah. I know you didn't mean to hurt me.
I took it too far.

548
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,044
What's wrong with you people?

549
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:10,504
I know what you're going to say.
Terra needs more training.

550
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,211
No, it's something else.

551
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:14,710
She knows.

552
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:20,848
Since we talked,
I have sensed something off about Terra.

553
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,748
She needs to be watched, Grayson.

554
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:26,115
She needs understanding, not surveillance.

555
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:29,588
Terra has her rough edges.
But Kori thinks she's worth it.

556
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:31,190
And I agree.

the vibrations of someone following me.

Even if they are on a roof.

560
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:11,460

not to fit in with the group.

we all need to be extra vigilant

No.

I can tell Princess Sparkle Thong
knows all about eating from a dumpster.

Kori is a refugee
being stalked by her homicidal sister.

00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:06,199
Jaime has a family that loves him.

829

And, because of the bug, odds are
he's never seeing them face-to-face again.

You planned this right from the start.

how do you become a Titan exactly?

01:17:57,713 --> 01:18:00,478
I mean, is there an audition?
Do you look at videos?

I want in.

BEAST BOY: <i>Well, Kev, I guess
the most important thing to being a Titan</i>

1153
01:18:06,588 --> 01:18:08,784

1154
01:18:12,193 --> 01:18:15,493
<i>Some of us don't have our own,
so we support the ones that do.</i>

1155
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:41,413
Of course, an outgoing personality
doesn't hurt, but, you know,

1156
01:18:41,587 --> 01:18:42,713
you gotta have a power.

1157
01:18:42,888 --> 01:18:44,652
-Something cool.
-Something cool?

1158
01:18:44,823 --> 01:18:48,088

that's beyond cool.

Whoa, man, he just turned into
a seal, folks, I swear.

1174
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:38,363
But really, Gar, is she gonna,
like, replace Terra?

01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:40,332
Terra?

1176
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:43,540
Yeah, you know,
there are lots of stories about her.
