He's right through there.</font>

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,446

the mucus, and he's fine.</font>

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,443
<font color="#ffff00">But he must use
the oxygen more,</font>

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,206
<font color="#ffff00">and he has to call us

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,842
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, he knows.
- Wants to do it his own way, huh?</font>

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,201
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,204
<font color="#ffff00">- You can take him home.
- All right. Thanks.</font>

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,170
<font color="#ffff00">As you can see, Mr. Cassidy,</font>

I have extended coverage.</font>

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,330

Wyatt Corp terminated it.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. I'll figure something out.</font>

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,441

I'll take care of it.</font>

103

What are we missing?</font>

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,966
<font color="#ffff00">We don't want to be
connected anymore.</font>

108
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,128

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,487
<font color="#ffff00">So, what if...</font>

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,364

a 60-inch screen?</font>

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,208
<font color="#ffff00">Well, then it wouldn't be mobile.</font>

112

Where's the disconnect?</font>

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,281
<font color="#ffff00">Well, sir, I believe the disconnect is
between you and the consumers.</font>

120
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,087
<font color="#ffff00">You didn't hire us to sit around

121
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,408
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me, why did I hire you?</font>

122
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
<font color="#ffff00">Because we know
what a younger generation wants.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">A phone that doesn't just look new
a phone that is new,</font>

125
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,690

126
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,446
<font color="#ffff00">You know, you're right.
I have lost touch with your generation.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I was pioneering
digital cellular technology</font>

133
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,204
<font color="#ffff00">while my colleagues were still pissing
around with electronic pulses.</font>

134
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,646
<font color="#ffff00">I had vision.</font>

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,521
<font color="#ffff00">But you have all the technological
advantage imaginable</font>

136
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,967
<font color="#ffff00">and what do you bring me?</font>

137
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,885
<font color="#ffff00">Social networking on a television.</font>

138
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,487
<font color="#ffff00">Next! Bring in Richard McAllister.</font>

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,011
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, guys.</font>

140
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,606
<font color="#ffff00">You just left us standing there
looking like idiots.</font>

141
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,842
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, what were you thinking?</font>

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
<font color="#ffff00"><i>We all backed the idea.</i></font>

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,202
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Our idea wasn't the problem.
I railroaded him. You saw his face.</i></font>

144
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,603
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That's what happens when your team
leader goes rogue and argues with God.</i></font>

145
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,369
<font color="#ffff00">Well, uh... I guess now
that we're not working together</font>

146
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,488
<font color="#ffff00">we can start sleeping
together, right?</font>

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,682
<font color="#ffff00">I seriously hope
you're not talking to me.</font>

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,763
<font color="#ffff00">We'll find new jobs, right?</font>

149
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,684
<font color="#ffff00">We weren't laid off,
Chels. We were fired.</font>

150
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,491
<font color="#ffff00">How are you going to explain
that on your resume?</font>

151
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,681
<font color="#ffff00">You know what? The least I can do
is buy you guys a few drinks.</font>

152
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,524
<font color="#ffff00">Our discretionary account? Really?</font>

153
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,968
<font color="#ffff00">Adam, no. If Wyatt ever found out
that we spent any more money...</font>

154
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,400
<font color="#ffff00">What are they going to do? Fire us?</font>

155
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,121
<font color="#ffff00">The money was ours to spend
as we see fit. We're going to Rise.</font>

156
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,362
<font color="#ffff00">- We can't get in there.
- Yes, we can.</font>

157
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,649
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes, we can.
- Try and stop the guy.</font>

158
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,724
<font color="#ffff00">We're going to Rise,
baby! Oh, yeah!</font>

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,201
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, you realize this is
going to be so awesome.</font>

160
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,160
<font color="#ffff00">- We're going to pop ten bottles.
- Think so?</font>

161
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,408
<font color="#ffff00">I hate this doorman.</font>

162
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,691
<font color="#ffff00">Adam Cassidy.
Told you I'd be back.</font>

163
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,370
<font color="#ffff00">Your table's right this way, sir.</font>

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,409
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah!</font>

165
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,370
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah!
- Oh!</font>

166
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,170
<font color="#ffff00">- Shots!
- Shots!</font>

167
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,845
<font color="#ffff00">- Shots!
- Oh my God.</font>

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,650
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh!</font>

169
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,051
<font color="#ffff00">If you guys don't get lucky tonight,
it's never going to happen.</font>

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,043
<font color="#ffff00">I'm fielding offers. You want in?</font>

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,321
<font color="#ffff00">See me after.</font>

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,480
<font color="#ffff00">- Cheers, guys!
- Whoo!</font>

173
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,650
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah!</font>

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,121
<font color="#ffff00">Adam, maybe
we should close out the tab.</font>

175
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,601
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, don't worry about it, man,
don't worry about it.</font>

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,330
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, can we get
another bottle of Ciroc?</font>

177
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,726
<font color="#ffff00">- Twirl me!
- No, no, no.</font>

178
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,607
<font color="#ffff00">Come on!</font>

179
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,371
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, buddy, where you going?</font>

180
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,528
<font color="#ffff00">Could be love.</font>

181
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,521
<font color="#ffff00">Wake up.</font>

182
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,728
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, wake up.</font>

183
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,287
<font color="#ffff00">- Hmm?
- I have to go.</font>

184
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,885
<font color="#ffff00">So do you.</font>

185
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,886
<font color="#ffff00">No breakfast?</font>

186
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,646
<font color="#ffff00">Did I, uh, do something wrong?</font>

187
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,566
<font color="#ffff00">If you had done something wrong,
you wouldn't be here, would you?</font>

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,963
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

189
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,282
<font color="#ffff00">So, uh, we...</font>

190
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,681
<font color="#ffff00">...are leaving.</font>

191
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,326
<font color="#ffff00">Wait a second,
I don't even know your name.</font>

192
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,406
<font color="#ffff00">Are you taking the fire escape?</font>

193
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,362
<font color="#ffff00">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

194
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,764
<font color="#ffff00">Hey. Black,
or cream and sugar?</font>

195
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,366
<font color="#ffff00">- You stalking me now?
- I just want to know your name.</font>

196
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,882
<font color="#ffff00">Why? So you can poke me,
friend me, ask for my number?</font>

197
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,327
<font color="#ffff00">Or you could
just give me your number.</font>

198
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,766
<font color="#ffff00">You're not
relationship material.</font>

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,445
<font color="#ffff00">Relationship?
You're looking for a relationship?</font>

200
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,284
<font color="#ffff00">I love relationships.
I'm great at relationships.</font>

201
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,404
<font color="#ffff00">No. Actually, I'm just trying
to get rid of you nicely.</font>

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,884
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't we have sex?</font>

203
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,564
<font color="#ffff00">I have a thing for bridge-and-tunnel
guys when I drink.</font>

204
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,927
<font color="#ffff00">Did you just call me
bridge-and-tunnel?</font>

205
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,325
<font color="#ffff00">You took me out
for cheese fries.</font>

206
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,801
<font color="#ffff00">Cheese fries!</font>

207
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,166
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. Then what?</font>

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,641
<font color="#ffff00">Then you had the night of your life.</font>

209
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,251
<font color="#ffff00">Your words, not mine.</font>

210
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,926
<font color="#ffff00">Oh... Black.</font>

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,971
<font color="#ffff00">Adam Cassidy?
My name is Miles Meachum.</font>

212
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,083
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Wyatt would like to speak with you.</font>

213
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,250
<font color="#ffff00">How did you know where I was?</font>

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,207
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I don't even live around here.</font>

215
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,050
<font color="#ffff00">Ah! Mr. Cassidy.</font>

216
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,084
<font color="#ffff00">The man who claims he knows
my business better than I do.</font>

217
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,765
<font color="#ffff00">Here, take a seat.</font>

218
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,130
<font color="#ffff00">- Drop of vino?
- Uh... No.</font>

219
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,205
<font color="#ffff00">It seems you were the beneficiary
of an accounting error we made.</font>

220
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,199
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know
what you're talking about.</font>

221
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,009
<font color="#ffff00">The Ethion discretionary fund.</font>

222
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,886
<font color="#ffff00">Where's my money?</font>

223
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,122
<font color="#ffff00">We used it on market research.</font>

224
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,726
<font color="#ffff00">At Club Rise?</font>

225
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,370
<font color="#ffff00">Sixteen grand?</font>

226
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,683
<font color="#ffff00">It must be a very detailed report.</font>

227
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,881
<font color="#ffff00">You think you can rip me off
and get away with it?</font>

228
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,411
<font color="#ffff00">Credit card fraud?</font>

229
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,642
<font color="#ffff00">No, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna pay you back.</font>

230
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,043
<font color="#ffff00">No you won't. It wasn't a loan.</font>

231
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,931
<font color="#ffff00">Now there's two ways
we can play this.</font>

232
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,481
<font color="#ffff00">Are you a horse or a dog?</font>

233
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,769
<font color="#ffff00">A horse is motivated by fear.
He's running from the whip.</font>

234
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,922
<font color="#ffff00">The whip here being felony fraud.</font>

235
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,686
<font color="#ffff00">- He's a dog.
- A dog is motivated by hunger.</font>

236
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,922
<font color="#ffff00">He's chasing the rabbit,
his next meal.</font>

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,765
<font color="#ffff00">You were raised
in a low-income home in Brooklyn.</font>

238
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,127
<font color="#ffff00">Your mother died
when you were seven.</font>

239
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,726
<font color="#ffff00">Your W-2 says you
now support your father.</font>

240
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,927
<font color="#ffff00">So?</font>

241
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,048
<font color="#ffff00">So, it means you came
across that bridge every day</font>

242
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,605
<font color="#ffff00">hungry to succeed.</font>

243
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,922
<font color="#ffff00">- Everyone wants to succeed.
- Yeah, but not like us.</font>

244
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,289
<font color="#ffff00">Your father spent 32 years
as a security guard.</font>

245
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,807
<font color="#ffff00">- Where's the ambition in that?
- What's this about?</font>

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,162
<font color="#ffff00">You want more out of life!</font>

247
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,211
<font color="#ffff00">I grew up like you.
I mean, different streets.</font>

248
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,807
<font color="#ffff00">Same dream,
but nobody gave it to me. No one.</font>

249
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,203
<font color="#ffff00">And what if I told you
I could make you rich?</font>

250
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,169
<font color="#ffff00">And give your friends their jobs back?</font>

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,082
<font color="#ffff00">That was a smart pitch
you gave yesterday.</font>

252
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,410
<font color="#ffff00">I started out at Eikon.</font>

253
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,327
<font color="#ffff00">Jock Goddard was my mentor.</font>

254
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,209
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know him?</font>

255
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,169
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, of course I know him.</font>

256
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,527
<font color="#ffff00">I did my graduate thesis
on semi-conductor memory.</font>

257
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,002
<font color="#ffff00">Goddard's basically the reason
cell phones aren't the size of bricks.</font>

258
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,127
<font color="#ffff00">He founded Eikon.</font>

259
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,169
<font color="#ffff00">And built it
into the largest publicly traded</font>

260
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,890
<font color="#ffff00">technology company in the world.</font>

261
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,690
<font color="#ffff00">And ever since I left,
he has spent</font>

262
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,008
<font color="#ffff00">every waking moment
trying to destroy me.</font>

263
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,960
<font color="#ffff00">Eikon has a new smartphone coming
that's said to be a game-changer.</font>

264
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,770
<font color="#ffff00">They're calling it Occura.</font>

265
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,446
<font color="#ffff00">You are going to work for Eikon.</font>

266
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- Get us in the door, you get 500K.</font>

267
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,851
<font color="#ffff00">Get us what we need, you'll see
another million in stock options.</font>

268
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,001
<font color="#ffff00">Money like that</font>

269
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,003
<font color="#ffff00">would allow you to take care
of your father and a whole lot more.</font>

270
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,242
<font color="#ffff00">Eikon's not just going to hire me.</font>

271
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,920
<font color="#ffff00">They will when
we're done with you.</font>

272
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,689
<font color="#ffff00">This is illegal.
It's stealing trade secrets.</font>

273
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,889
<font color="#ffff00">This is the opportunity
you have been waiting for.</font>

274
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,401
<font color="#ffff00">Now, you could have done a lot of things
with that credit card last night.</font>

275
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,929
<font color="#ffff00">Your father's health insurance premium,
graduate school loans,</font>

276
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,165
<font color="#ffff00">but you decided to take your mates
out on the town, living it large.</font>

277
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,164
<font color="#ffff00">Because you want to know
how the other half lives.</font>

278
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,210
<font color="#ffff00">We are the other half!</font>

279
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,762
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I'm offering you.</font>

280
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,041
<font color="#ffff00">If I say no?</font>

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,046
<font color="#ffff00">You and your friends will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.</font>

282
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,524
<font color="#ffff00">And you don't want to sit around
and watch me make tea, do you?</font>

283
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,328
<font color="#ffff00">What are you, the TV police?</font>

284
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,126
<font color="#ffff00">- You were asleep.
- My eyes were closed.</font>

285
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,089
<font color="#ffff00">Where you going?</font>

286
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,528
<font color="#ffff00">- I caught a break at the company.
- A break, what kind of break?</font>

287
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,604
<font color="#ffff00">A kind of break that pays our rent
and keeps your pretty nurse around.</font>

288
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,489
<font color="#ffff00">It's a training thing,
so I'll be gone all weekend.</font>

289
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,599
<font color="#ffff00">It's Friday night. I thought we were
going to Benzio's for pizza and beer.</font>

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,649
<font color="#ffff00">I got to work, Dad. That's how you
climb the ladder in this business.</font>

291
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,768
<font color="#ffff00">You work harder than the guy below you.</font>

292
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,280
<font color="#ffff00">Otherwise you get stuck
doing the same job your whole life.</font>

293
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,448
<font color="#ffff00">Look...</font>

294
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,802
<font color="#ffff00">Here's some money.
You can order in, OK?</font>

295
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,247
<font color="#ffff00">No, no. Thanks.</font>

296
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,886
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

297
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,484
<font color="#ffff00">What exactly do you do
for the company, Judith?</font>

298
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,166
<font color="#ffff00">I have a PhD
in behavioral psychology.</font>

299
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,164
<font color="#ffff00">I can take one look at you and tell you
why you haven't succeeded.</font>

300
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,163
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?</font>

301
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,845
<font color="#ffff00">I can give you the tools to ascend</font>

302
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,321
<font color="#ffff00">to the highest ranks
of corporate America.</font>

303
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,289
<font color="#ffff00">But you have to lose the attitude.</font>

304
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
<font color="#ffff00">This way.</font>

305
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,046
<font color="#ffff00">I'll show you to your room.</font>

306
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,609
<font color="#ffff00">When we meet someone, an immediate
cognitive process takes place.</font>

307
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,843
<font color="#ffff00">We construct our first ideas on them
based on their appearance.</font>

308
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,210
<font color="#ffff00">So, if you want to be accepted,
you have to look the part.</font>

309
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,004
<font color="#ffff00">You have to fit in to get in.</font>

310
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,288
<font color="#ffff00">What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?</font>

311
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
<font color="#ffff00">Jack's a brilliant businessman.</font>

312
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,004
<font color="#ffff00">He was always able to imbue his products
with a magic of big ideas,</font>

313
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,770
<font color="#ffff00">but Wyatt was the brains.</font>

314
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,207
<font color="#ffff00">Without his designs,
none of it would have been possible.</font>

315
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,283
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.</font>

316
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,411
<font color="#ffff00">For Goddard, yes. Wyatt gave him
the best years of his life.</font>

317
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,284
<font color="#ffff00">Jock lost his son Dylan
to a drug overdose.</font>

318
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,046
<font color="#ffff00">So, if you talk
about losing your mother...</font>

319
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,806
<font color="#ffff00">No, I won't.</font>

320
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,726
<font color="#ffff00">Then, appeal to his void.
Say you had no father figure.</font>

321
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,291
<font color="#ffff00">I have a father.</font>

322
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,448
<font color="#ffff00">You don't aspire to be like him.</font>

323
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,445
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Which brings us to trust.</i></font>

324
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,404
<font color="#ffff00"><i>If you can convince him
that you're just like him,</i></font>

325
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,370
<font color="#ffff00"><i>that you share the same beliefs as him,</i></font>

326
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,931
<font color="#ffff00"><i>it will engender trust.</i></font>

327
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,246
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And trust is
the holy grail of espionage.</i></font>

328
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,370
<font color="#ffff00">She makes it sound so easy.</font>

329
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,763
<font color="#ffff00">But this is a man who recognized me
for who I was years before I did.</font>

330
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,164
<font color="#ffff00">He kept me close because that's
what you do with an enemy.</font>

331
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,688
<font color="#ffff00">When I got restless, he promised me
partnership. It was genius.</font>

332
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,367
<font color="#ffff00">I saw the finish line
and I gave him every good idea I ha...</font>

333
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,366
<font color="#ffff00">- Who's this?
- He's the new tailor.</font>

334
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,488
<font color="#ffff00">I'm George Gardelo, sir.</font>

335
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,726
<font color="#ffff00">Would you excuse us, George?</font>

336
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,484
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes. Of course.
- Just for a second.</font>

337
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,209
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on?</font>

338
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,965
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That's how it happens.</i></font>

339
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,966
<font color="#ffff00">A little guy with a needle and thread
brings down an empire.</font>

340
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,363
<font color="#ffff00">You really believe that?</font>

341
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,922
<font color="#ffff00">Look, it doesn't matter. If you let
no one in, you get burned by no one.</font>

342
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,408
<font color="#ffff00">You know what Picasso said?</font>

343
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,566
<font color="#ffff00">"A good artist copies.
A great artist steals."</font>

344
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,404
<font color="#ffff00">There's nothing original left
in the world, Adam.</font>

345
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,688
<font color="#ffff00">We're all stealing
from someone.</font>

346
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,491
<font color="#ffff00">You might want
to remember that.</font>

347
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,202
<font color="#ffff00">If I lose one
percent market share,</font>

348
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,091
<font color="#ffff00">one percent, and I'm ruined.</font>

349
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,401
<font color="#ffff00">There is the Dutch deal,</font>

350
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,211
<font color="#ffff00">but they're offering half
of what Eikon's willing to pay you.</font>

351
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,044
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, I don't care.</font>

352
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,886
<font color="#ffff00">I would rather counter
the Dutch for a fraction</font>

353
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,769
<font color="#ffff00">than sell to Goddard.</font>

354
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,321
<font color="#ffff00">Anything's better than Eikon.</font>

355
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,771
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

356
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,726
<font color="#ffff00">Hello?</font>

357
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,444
<font color="#ffff00">When are you going to find
my friends jobs?</font>

358
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,206
<font color="#ffff00">As soon as you get me what I need.</font>

359
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,610
<font color="#ffff00">You only have one shot at this.</font>

360
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,442
<font color="#ffff00">Mate.</font>

361

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,331
<font color="#ffff00">Adam?</font>

364
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,323
<font color="#ffff00">- Tom.
- Tom Lungren.</font>

365
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,131
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to meet you.
Let me introduce Emma Jennings,</font>

366
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,288
<font color="#ffff00">head of our marketing department.</font>

367
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,362
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to meet you, Emma.</font>

368
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,851
<font color="#ffff00">Please, sit down.</font>

369
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,487
<font color="#ffff00">Well, let me start off
by saying that we're</font>

370
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,610
<font color="#ffff00">huge fans of the work you did
on Ethion 3.0.</font>

371
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,529
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you know,
it hasn't been released yet, so.</font>

372
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,365
<font color="#ffff00">Is that because power management
doesn't deliver?</font>

373
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,363
<font color="#ffff00">No, the power management is fine.</font>

374
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,090
<font color="#ffff00">That's not what we've heard.</font>

375
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,685
<font color="#ffff00">We're tweaking
the networking module to make</font>

376
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,205
<font color="#ffff00">download speed
the fastest on the market.</font>

377
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,681
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God. I hope that's not why
we agreed to meet with him.</font>

378
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,490
<font color="#ffff00">Can you talk specs?</font>

379
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,564
<font color="#ffff00">The Orion was an LTE Advanced
with max speeds of 44.2 mbps.</font>

380
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,563
<font color="#ffff00">Our new platform is
a WAVE OS 7.5...</font>

381
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,371
<font color="#ffff00">Which probably won't solve
the biggest issues you had with 7.0.</font>

382
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,524
<font color="#ffff00">- It outsold your model two to one.
- Yeah, the marketing was genius.</font>

383
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,648
<font color="#ffff00">I spearheaded that campaign.</font>

384
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,451
<font color="#ffff00">Then you know
you're good at hiding flaws.</font>

385
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,565
<font color="#ffff00">Have you two met?</font>

386
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,245
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

387
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,210
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

388
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,681
<font color="#ffff00">I think we got off on the wrong foot.</font>

389
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,919
<font color="#ffff00">Always do your homework.
That's what you said, isn't it?</font>

390
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,365
<font color="#ffff00">Next time
follow your own advice.</font>

391
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,166
<font color="#ffff00">- It wasn't Tom Lungren?
- It wasn't just Tom Lungren.</font>

392
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
<font color="#ffff00">I told you he might bring
someone else.</font>

393
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,206
<font color="#ffff00">Someone that I knew?</font>

394
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,603
<font color="#ffff00">What happened?</font>

395
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,606
<font color="#ffff00">I saved the day. Connected.
Pulled an offer, a big-ass offer.</font>

396
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,809
<font color="#ffff00">Let's take
you to your new apartment.</font>

397
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,611
<font color="#ffff00">- What apartment?
- You'll see.</font>

398
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,008
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa.</font>

399
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,730
<font color="#ffff00">Thought you'd like it.</font>

400
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,643
<font color="#ffff00">This is mine?</font>

401
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,167
<font color="#ffff00">Of course.</font>

402
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,244
<font color="#ffff00">Eikon's newest executive
needs to look the part.</font>

403
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,962
<font color="#ffff00">It's nice to see you again, Adam.</font>

404
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,210
<font color="#ffff00">Per our agreement, we've deposited
$500,000 into an escrow account.</font>

405
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,648
<font color="#ffff00">We're hearing Goddard could
debut Aurora in the next two months,</font>

406
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,644
<font color="#ffff00">so I've downloaded background files
on all your co-workers.</font>

407
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,844
<font color="#ffff00">First, Emma Jennings.</font>

408
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,809
<font color="#ffff00">Father, George Jennings, was</font>

409
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,611
<font color="#ffff00">Chief of Surgery
at New York Presbyterian.</font>

410
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,489
<font color="#ffff00">She grew up with four brothers,</font>

411
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,127
<font color="#ffff00">was always on the outside
of the boys club, looking in.</font>

412
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,204
<font color="#ffff00">Desperately wants to succeed
in a man's world,</font>

413
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,721
<font color="#ffff00">so she's always the most prepared
person in the room.</font>

414
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,042
<font color="#ffff00">Would have been useful
a couple of hours ago.</font>

415
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,249
<font color="#ffff00">Don't waste your time.
She has certain standards.</font>

416
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,605
<font color="#ffff00">Judith, maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.</font>

417
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,809
<font color="#ffff00">Now don't always say
what you think, darling.</font>

418
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,403
<font color="#ffff00">Because from here on out,
you are all the way under.</font>

419
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,450
<font color="#ffff00">We'll be communicating
through this phone only.</font>

420
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,681
<font color="#ffff00">You will respond to my calls,
no matter the time, day or night.</font>

421
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,002
<font color="#ffff00">You got it.</font>

422
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,444
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning, sir.</font>

423
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,887
<font color="#ffff00">I want a copy of his
body scan sent to my office.</font>

424
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,087
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, sir.</font>

425
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,085
<font color="#ffff00">- Adam.
- Mr. Lungren.</font>

426
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,005
<font color="#ffff00">I told you. You gotta stop calling me
that, you're gonna make me feel old.</font>

427
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,447
<font color="#ffff00">- Welcome to Eikon.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.</font>

428
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,171
<font color="#ffff00">- We're damn glad to have you.
- OK, good.</font>

429
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,766
<font color="#ffff00">The lower floors are Legal, HR,</font>

430
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,804
<font color="#ffff00">middle floors are all the other
departments, including marketing.</font>

431
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,804
<font color="#ffff00">The 38th floor is R&D,
top security projects.</font>

432
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,201
<font color="#ffff00">And we're here on the 40th.</font>

433
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,160
<font color="#ffff00">There's just a few tricks to being
in this building and getting around.</font>

434
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,610
<font color="#ffff00">Your thumbprint on a keycard app
generates a bar code</font>

435
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,924
<font color="#ffff00">that gets you anywhere
your clearance is allowed.</font>

436
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,809
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

437
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,850
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So any words of wisdom
on Goddard?</i></font>

438
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,923
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Be brilliant and be genuine.</i></font>

439
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,448
<font color="#ffff00">He can spot a fraud a mile away.
Here's your office.</font>

440
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,162
<font color="#ffff00">So, Type X was meant
for social networking,</font>

441
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,482
<font color="#ffff00">but it turns out that people don't
always want their friends</font>

442
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,210
<font color="#ffff00">to know where they are so precisely.</font>

443
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,727
<font color="#ffff00">Right. What's the system tech?</font>

444
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,601
<font color="#ffff00">It's 3DPS, which is like GPS
plus precise triangulation.</font>

445
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,966
<font color="#ffff00">I'm familiar with it.</font>

446
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,527
<font color="#ffff00">Problem is, it's twice as heavy
with three times the battery drain.</font>

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,361
<font color="#ffff00">So, you're handing me a dead fish.</font>

448
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,166
<font color="#ffff00">You've got 72 hours
before you present to Goddard.</font>

449
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,328
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

450
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,646
<font color="#ffff00">It's a real-time tracking device
that needs a new purpose.</font>

451
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,167
<font color="#ffff00">It's all about the presentation.
You have to impress him.</font>

452
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,926
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I understand what I have to do.</font>

453
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,009
<font color="#ffff00">I'll schedule a brainstorming session
with our best R&D guys.</font>

454
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,088
<font color="#ffff00">Why do you do this work, Judith?</font>

455
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,805
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, is it out of loyalty,
or is it just money?</font>

456
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,010
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you have enough
to think about?</font>

457
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,844
<font color="#ffff00">Rowena,
I need you to put together</font>

458
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,604
<font color="#ffff00">an R&D focus group.</font>

459
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,528
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care, wake them up.</font>

460
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,889
<font color="#ffff00">Call me when everything's
in place. Bye.</font>

461
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,007
<font color="#ffff00">Soldiers.</font>

462
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,211
<font color="#ffff00">Soldiers need to know
where each other are at all times.</font>

463
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,125
<font color="#ffff00">- They have GPS.
- Yeah.</font>

464
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,567
<font color="#ffff00">GPS is great for navigation,
but it doesn't work indoors.</font>

465
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,563
<font color="#ffff00">Can't tell if you're
on the first floor or the ninth,</font>

466
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,210
<font color="#ffff00">so it's useless in urban warfare.</font>

467
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,681
<font color="#ffff00">But with 3DPS,</font>

468
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,601
<font color="#ffff00">if I can Trojan-horse tracking data
in an e-mail to each of them...</font>

469
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,287
<font color="#ffff00">...I could make this thing work.</font>

470
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,049
<font color="#ffff00">- Who are you calling?
- My own R&D focus group.</font>

471
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,564
<font color="#ffff00">Yo, Kev, it's me. I need your help.</font>

472
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,091
<font color="#ffff00">I got recruited by one of those...</font>

473
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,320
<font color="#ffff00">...headhunters.</font>

474
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,042
<font color="#ffff00">Long story short,
I work for Eikon now.</font>

475
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,926
<font color="#ffff00">I heard they weren't hiring.</font>

476
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,964
<font color="#ffff00">I got lucky, I guess.</font>

477
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,804
<font color="#ffff00">I guess.</font>

478
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,367
<font color="#ffff00">Well, hey, I've been working
on what we talked about,</font>

479
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,842
<font color="#ffff00">and the military thing is
definitely possible.</font>

480
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,403
<font color="#ffff00">I just tweaked
the Eikon software a little.</font>

481
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,402
<font color="#ffff00">I'm calling it the Boomerang.</font>

482
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,489
<font color="#ffff00">Just check this out.</font>

483
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,681
<font color="#ffff00">I sent your 3DPS data e-mail to you,
me and Allison.</font>

484
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,764
<font color="#ffff00">So now our phones track each other
working in unison.</font>

485
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,208
<font color="#ffff00">And you were right, the 3DPS,
that's what makes the difference.</font>

486
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,129
<font color="#ffff00">That was a good call, by the way.</font>

487
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,008
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, that's awesome.
You crushed this. Good job.</font>

488
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, but that ain't all.</font>

489
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,124
<font color="#ffff00">Pick up Allison.</font>

490
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,005
<font color="#ffff00"><i>- What can I get you?</i>
<i>- Another OJ.</i></font>

491
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,127
<font color="#ffff00"><i>One more OJ.</i></font>

492
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,009
<font color="#ffff00">How the hell did you do that?</font>

493
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Who orders orange juice in a bar?</i></font>

494
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,247
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Someone who wants to keep
his edge.</i></font>

495
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,323
<font color="#ffff00"><i>- What's your name?
- Allison.</i></font>

496
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,931
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know that guy?</font>

497
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,640
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, OJ!</font>

498
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,290
<font color="#ffff00">We're sleeping together, me and her.</font>

499
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,168
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to meet you, Allison.</font>

500
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,960
<font color="#ffff00">All I do is sit around here,
watching her get hit on all the time.</font>

501
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,286
<font color="#ffff00">It's exhausting!</font>

502
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,363
<font color="#ffff00">I need a job.</font>

503
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,447
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning, Caroline.
Excuse me.</font>

504
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,887
<font color="#ffff00">- Jock Goddard.
- Adam Cassidy.</font>

505
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,089
<font color="#ffff00">Of course you are. Everything all right?
Settling in OK?</font>

506
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,083
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah. Thank you.
- How's your office?</font>

507
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,210
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. Thank you.
- Good. Let's get started.</font>

508
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,085
<font color="#ffff00">Well, sir, I'm afraid
you've wasted a lot of money</font>

509
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,210
<font color="#ffff00">developing Type X
as a social networking device.</font>

510
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,250
<font color="#ffff00">But the military applications
of this device are undeniable.</font>

511
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,124
<font color="#ffff00">I sent you all an e-mail this morning</font>

512
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,682
<font color="#ffff00">in which I encoded 3DPS-like data
to identify you.</font>

513
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,242
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone I sent an e-mail to is
in this room. Except for one.</font>

514
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,122
<font color="#ffff00">Death by friendly fire remains
a sad reality of war.</font>

515
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,568
<font color="#ffff00">3DPS is more precise than GPS
and works on a Z-axis.</font>

516
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,485
<font color="#ffff00">While the product was deemed
too heavy for civilians,</font>

517
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,849
<font color="#ffff00">an added 12 ounces is
nothing to a soldier.</font>

518
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,685
<font color="#ffff00">So this is all so you can see
what floor our phones are on?</font>

519
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,247
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. 'Cause in the heat of battle
that can be the difference</font>

520
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,165
<font color="#ffff00">between killing the enemy or...</font>

521
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,530
<font color="#ffff00">...killing your own.</font>

522
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,090
<font color="#ffff00">Type X just saved her life.</font>

523
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,601
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning.</font>

524
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,524
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning, sorry.</font>

525
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,242
<font color="#ffff00">Morning.</font>

526
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,971
<font color="#ffff00">How long have you had with this?</font>

527
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,446
<font color="#ffff00">Seventy-two hours, sir.</font>

528
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,122
<font color="#ffff00">Let's put together a team for Adam.</font>

529
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,170
<font color="#ffff00">Design, engineering. Let's see
if we can get some DOD funding.</font>

530
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,483
<font color="#ffff00">Issues? No? Good.</font>

531
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,290
<font color="#ffff00">Good.</font>

532
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,288
<font color="#ffff00">Nice work.</font>

533
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,288
<font color="#ffff00">I thought that went pretty well.</font>

534
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,171
<font color="#ffff00">Beginner's luck.</font>

535
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,723
<font color="#ffff00">- You are hard to please.
- Not that you'd remember.</font>

536
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,167
<font color="#ffff00">Let me take you
to dinner this weekend.</font>

537
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,249
<font color="#ffff00">I have to be
in the Hamptons this weekend.</font>

538
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,641
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, good. I'll come with you.</font>

539
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,091
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't an invitation.</font>

540
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,205
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Hi, Adam. I'm calling
from Jock Goddard's office.</i></font>

541
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,806
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Jock is having a few people over
to his house in the Hamptons</i></font>

542
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,361
<font color="#ffff00"><i>on Saturday
and he'd like you to join him.</i></font>

543
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,208
<font color="#ffff00">So now we go
for military funding.</font>

544
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,284
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, that's great.
Congratulations, man.</font>

545
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,367
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, so, I got a favor to ask.</font>

546
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,562
<font color="#ffff00">I got an interview at Eikon next week.</font>

547
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,408
<font color="#ffff00">And I know I'm gonna be
another resume in a stack</font>

548
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,722
<font color="#ffff00">if I don't build some traction.</font>

549
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,368
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

550
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,809
<font color="#ffff00">So, I feel awkward
even asking you this, but...</font>

551
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,644
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, of course.</font>

552
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,729
<font color="#ffff00">All right,
I'll speak to HR on Monday.</font>

553
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,370
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

554
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,200
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

555
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,321
<font color="#ffff00">Nicest guy.</font>

556
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,087
<font color="#ffff00">Right through the red light
and hit the back of the car.</font>

557
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,328
<font color="#ffff00">- Very apologetic.
- Somebody looks lost.</font>

558
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,402
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, hey!</font>

559
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,289
<font color="#ffff00">- Hi.
- Hey.</font>

560
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,329
<font color="#ffff00">- There he is.
- I'm glad you could make it.</font>

561
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,324
<font color="#ffff00">- Thanks for having me, Mr. Goddard.
- Jock.</font>

562
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,130
<font color="#ffff00">- You know Tom, of course.
- Hey.</font>

563
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,285
<font color="#ffff00">Jock tells me my stock's gone up
in value since your Type X pitch.</font>

564
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,489
<font color="#ffff00">First time up at bat and you bang it
off the scoreboard? Way to go.</font>

565
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,086
<font color="#ffff00">And this is Emma.
She's spearheading the marketing</font>

566
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,720
<font color="#ffff00">on our new smartphone, Occura.</font>

567
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,325
<font color="#ffff00">Nice suit.</font>

568
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,565
<font color="#ffff00">Watch our for her. She's one
of those Ivy Leaguers. Princeton.</font>

569
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,324
<font color="#ffff00">Yale, actually.</font>

570
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,329
<font color="#ffff00">Where her brothers went.</font>

571
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,126
<font color="#ffff00">How did you know
I went to Yale?</font>

572
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,891
<font color="#ffff00">It was on Facebook
or something.</font>

573
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,008
<font color="#ffff00">Ah.</font>

574
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,328
<font color="#ffff00">So much for privacy.</font>

575
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,371
<font color="#ffff00">Privacy.
Absolute myth, no such thing.</font>

576
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,602
<font color="#ffff00">- Tom, you want a drink?
- Yeah, absolutely.</font>

577
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,051
<font color="#ffff00">A glass of wine, sir?</font>

578
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,089
<font color="#ffff00">- White wine.
- Mineral water, cold.</font>

579
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,124
<font color="#ffff00">See you later.</font>

580
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,246
<font color="#ffff00">Kind of like a Bordeaux,
more dry.</font>

581
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,966
<font color="#ffff00">If you're looking
for the bathroom, you missed it.</font>

582
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,087
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, sorry, I, uh...</font>

583
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,448
<font color="#ffff00">I saw the radio. Does it work?</font>

584
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,207
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, they work.
They all work. I built them.</font>

585
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,887
<font color="#ffff00">That's how I spent
my teens. Ham radio.</font>

586
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,610
<font color="#ffff00">Where'd you grow up?</font>

587
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,889
<font color="#ffff00">Town of Hamilton, 3500 people.</font>

588
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,202
<font color="#ffff00">Where is that?</font>

589
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,165
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't matter.</font>

590
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,483
<font color="#ffff00">You remind me of Wyatt.
I'm surprised he let you go.</font>

591
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,483
<font color="#ffff00">He wasn't too happy about it.</font>

592
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,962
<font color="#ffff00">I knew he'd be
my competition someday.</font>

593
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,088
<font color="#ffff00">I knew it before he did.</font>

594
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,924
<font color="#ffff00">Why'd you take him
under your wing?</font>

595
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,481
<font color="#ffff00">It's not about him.
It's about putting products out there</font>

596
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,768
<font color="#ffff00">to make people's lives better.</font>

597
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,968
<font color="#ffff00">Competition fuels innovation.</font>

598
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,487
<font color="#ffff00">Without it,
Eikon wouldn't be where it is today.</font>

599
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,489
<font color="#ffff00">And where is that?</font>

600
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,650
<font color="#ffff00">On the eve of a revolution.</font>

601
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,889
<font color="#ffff00">Is that your son?</font>

602
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,640
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, that's Dylan.</font>

603
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,682
<font color="#ffff00">You have a bit of success,
you begin to think</font>

604
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,209
<font color="#ffff00">that you've got some control
over things, but...</font>

605
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,528
<font color="#ffff00">...shit happens to everybody.</font>

606
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,251
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

607
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,647
<font color="#ffff00">I lost my mother when I was seven.</font>

608
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,648
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember her?</font>

609
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,924
<font color="#ffff00">Not much.</font>

610
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,560
<font color="#ffff00">I feel like I lose her
a little more every day.</font>

611
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,245
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

612
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,569
<font color="#ffff00">Couple nights after Dilly died,</font>

613
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,690
<font color="#ffff00">I woke up in the middle of the night
in a panic.</font>

614
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,166
<font color="#ffff00">Rummaged through the whole house,
his whole room...</font>

615
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,688
<font color="#ffff00">...looking for anything.</font>

616
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,690
<font color="#ffff00">Kid's drawings, schoolwork...</font>

617
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,929
<font color="#ffff00">...old pair of tennis shoes.</font>

618
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,051
<font color="#ffff00">Anything that would keep him alive.</font>

619
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,765
<font color="#ffff00">The front hall, under the stairs.</font>

620
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,325
<font color="#ffff00">Sir?</font>

621
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,767
<font color="#ffff00">The bathroom.</font>

622
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,165
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

623
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,049
<font color="#ffff00">You know,
the suit's not all that bad.</font>

624
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,601
<font color="#ffff00">You don't have to hide way out here.</font>

625
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,883
<font color="#ffff00">I was, uh, playing hard to get.</font>

626
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,691
<font color="#ffff00">But you're already gotten.</font>

627
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,927
<font color="#ffff00">So tell me,</font>

628
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,684
<font color="#ffff00">how is it that you know
so much about me</font>

629
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,764
<font color="#ffff00">and I know nothing about you?</font>

630
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,609
<font color="#ffff00">It's this, uh, little row home
my grandmother owned.</font>

631
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,808
<font color="#ffff00">Five of us sharing one bathroom.</font>

632
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,531
<font color="#ffff00">My dad was a security guard.</font>

633
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,650

but still smokes.</font>

634
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,610
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm pretty sure he's putting it
to the nurse I'm paying for.</font>

635
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,367
<font color="#ffff00">When I think of losing him...</font>

636
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,124
<font color="#ffff00">Aah...</font>

637
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,645
<font color="#ffff00">What about you?</font>

638
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,847
<font color="#ffff00">I come from a family where...</font>

639
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,844
<font color="#ffff00">...the expectation is so high
that I can't really ever succeed.</font>

640
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,248
<font color="#ffff00">It's fine,
it's just that I keep trying.</font>

641
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,010
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

642
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,810
<font color="#ffff00">I'm trying to sleep
my way to the top.</font>

643
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,802
<font color="#ffff00">Are we covered?</font>

644
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,443
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. Take me home?</font>

645
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,568
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

646
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,805
<font color="#ffff00">Dad?</font>

647

649
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,206
<font color="#ffff00">You might want to remove the battery
from your cellular device.</font>

650
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,321
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

651
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,086
<font color="#ffff00">You think 'cause you're not on a call,
they can't hear you?</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Agent Gamble.</font>

from Wyatt to Eikon like you.</font>

658
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,091
<font color="#ffff00">Two months later,
her steering column exploded.</font>

659
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,203
<font color="#ffff00">And Richard McAllister...</font>

660
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,010
<font color="#ffff00">...whose Ethion work you drafted off of.</font>

661
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,964
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't draft off his work.</font>

662
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,119
<font color="#ffff00">A month ago,
you were circling the drain at Wyatt.</font>

663
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,841
<font color="#ffff00">Now you're some hotshot exec
over at Eikon? Don't bullshit me.</font>

664
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,968
<font color="#ffff00">OK, I think it's time for you to go.</font>

665
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,288
<font color="#ffff00">You think Wyatt's gonna fill
your pockets and let you walk?</font>

666
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,159
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know what
you're talking about, OK?</font>

667
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,561
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Adam.</font>

668
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,722
<font color="#ffff00">How long do you think
you can keep this up?</font>

669
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,610
<font color="#ffff00">All it takes is one mistake,
one slip up.</font>

670
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,126
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, I can't help you.</font>

671
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,003
<font color="#ffff00">Just don't wait till it's too late.</font>

672
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,404
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna tell me
what's going on?</font>

673
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,285
<font color="#ffff00">You wouldn't understand.</font>

674
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,807
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I was probably too busy</font>

675
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,691
<font color="#ffff00">putting three meals
in front of you every day</font>

676
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,650
<font color="#ffff00">and giving you all the love
that parents had.</font>

677
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,122
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Adam.
We had a perfect life.</font>

678
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,085
<font color="#ffff00">You know, if your insurance covered
even half of what morn needed...</font>

679
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,601
<font color="#ffff00">Don't try to revise death.
What did you want me to do?</font>

680
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,728
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted you to fight.</font>

681
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,121
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted us to have enough
to at least give her a chance.</font>

682
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,049
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta give that up.</font>

683
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,250
<font color="#ffff00">These companies steal so much,
there's nothing left to earn.</font>

684
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,880
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, what you're doing
doesn't make it right.</font>

685
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,088
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

686
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,447
<font color="#ffff00">No one can make it right.</font>

687
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,763
<font color="#ffff00">So, why shouldn't
I get my share? Huh?</font>

688
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,922
<font color="#ffff00">The FBI just walked out of our house.</font>

689
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,367
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want to end up like you.</font>

690
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,809
<font color="#ffff00">So that's what he's up to.</font>

691
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,204
<font color="#ffff00">That's what you wanted.</font>

692
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,328
<font color="#ffff00">I'm done now. This isn't who I am.</font>

693
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
<font color="#ffff00">This is exactly who you are.
Did you frisk him?</font>

694
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,123
<font color="#ffff00">You hiding something?</font>

695
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,924
<font color="#ffff00">Knock it off!</font>

696
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,691
<font color="#ffff00">You've been a little temperamental
lately, haven't you?</font>

697
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,251
<font color="#ffff00">Are you falling for that girl?</font>

698
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,643
<font color="#ffff00">- He's falling for Jock.
- All right, all right!</font>

699
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,245
<font color="#ffff00">What'd he talk about?</font>

700
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,802
<font color="#ffff00">He talked about progress,
enriching people's lives.</font>

701
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,122
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, he talk about his son?</font>

702
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,203
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. A little.</font>

703
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,928
<font color="#ffff00">It seem rehearsed?</font>

704
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,161
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

705
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,403
<font color="#ffff00">It did the first time he told it.</font>

706
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,881
<font color="#ffff00">That was when the world fell in love
with Jock Goddard,</font>

707
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,168
<font color="#ffff00">the grieving father.</font>

708
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,571
<font color="#ffff00">That story of his little dead boy
saved Eikon.</font>

709
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,609
<font color="#ffff00">I got what you asked for, OK?</font>

710
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,205
<font color="#ffff00">We had a deal.
I just want my money.</font>

711
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,328
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, he wants his money.</font>

712
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,404
<font color="#ffff00">We'll keep your money for you.
You'll be doing five to ten upstate.</font>

713
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,324
<font color="#ffff00">I got the specs. That was the deal.</font>

714
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,608
<font color="#ffff00">Pictures are no good to me.</font>

715
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,770
<font color="#ffff00">I need to know what it does, I need
to hold it in my hand and see it run!</font>

716
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,207
<font color="#ffff00">Do you understand me?
Put it in my fucking hand!</font>

717
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,362
<font color="#ffff00">Or what? I end up like Richard?</font>

718
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,611
<font color="#ffff00">Jock builds one prototype.</font>

719
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,242
<font color="#ffff00">It's assembled in the vault,
piece by piece, until beta trials.</font>

720
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,482
<font color="#ffff00">It stays in the vault
on the 38th floor.</font>

721
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,246
<font color="#ffff00">Without files, without source code,
you can't do...</font>

722
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,880
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't need his files.</font>

723
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,649
<font color="#ffff00">I just need to see his vision.</font>

724
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,283
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm out.</font>

725
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,245
<font color="#ffff00">You're out?
You are only out, my son,</font>

726
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,244
<font color="#ffff00">when I say you're out!</font>

727
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,448
<font color="#ffff00">I own you right now.</font>

728
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,281
<font color="#ffff00">You see?
I can get to anyone.</font>

729
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,170
<font color="#ffff00">Don't make this harder
than it has to be.</font>

730
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,649
<font color="#ffff00">It's just business, Adam.
Everybody steals, everybody lies.</font>

731
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,007
<font color="#ffff00">There's no right or wrong.</font>

732
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,964
<font color="#ffff00">There's just winning or losing.</font>

733
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,087
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Now the first order of business
is lifting Emma's fingerprints.</i></font>

734
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,571
<font color="#ffff00">So my parents
are having this thing</font>

735
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,525
<font color="#ffff00">for my brother's engagement
this weekend.</font>

736
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,087
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna go with me?</font>

737
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,484
<font color="#ffff00">To meet your parents?</font>

738
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,449
<font color="#ffff00">It's just dinner and drinks.</font>

739
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,329
<font color="#ffff00">You, uh...</font>

740
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,962
<font color="#ffff00">You sure I'm relationship material?</font>

741
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,649
<font color="#ffff00">You know what? It's...
It's actually gonna be really boring.</font>

742
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,451
<font color="#ffff00">- Probably better if you don't.
- Hey.</font>

743
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,168
<font color="#ffff00">Of course I will.</font>

744
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,288
<font color="#ffff00">Even if it is boring?</font>

745
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,801
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, even if it's boring.</font>

746
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,965
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, what happened to you?</font>

747
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,288
<font color="#ffff00">Kev! What are you doing here?</font>

748
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,363
<font color="#ffff00">What do you think
I'm doing here?</font>

749
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,329
<font color="#ffff00">Your interview. Right.</font>

750
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,005
<font color="#ffff00">Uh...</font>

751
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,123
<font color="#ffff00">- How'd it go? I spoke to HR.
- No, you didn't.</font>

752
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,485
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, man. I, uh...</font>

753
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,363
<font color="#ffff00">I've been under a ton of pressure.
I completely forgot...</font>

754
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,729
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I understand, man. Your new
apartment, new car, new girlfriend.</font>

755
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,400
<font color="#ffff00">You have no idea
what I'm dealing with.</font>

756
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,530
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't.
And I don't think I ever will.</font>

757
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,887
<font color="#ffff00">- Thanks.
- Come on, Kev. I'm sorry, man.</font>

758
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,201
<font color="#ffff00">Kev!</font>

759
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,243
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Goddard wants to see you.</font>

760
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,525
<font color="#ffff00">Uh-huh.
Yeah, I understand that.</font>

761
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,643
<font color="#ffff00">Wyatt has to consider our offer.
He has no choice.</font>

762
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,451
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, he's tap dancing
on the Titanic.</font>

763
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,080
<font color="#ffff00">Come on in.</font>

764
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,526
<font color="#ffff00">Look, somebody just walked in.</font>

765
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,409
<font color="#ffff00">I've got something
I've got to deal with.</font>

766
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,449
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Thanks.</font>

767
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,005
<font color="#ffff00">Don't forget, you have
a lunch reservation at the club.</font>

768
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,450
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. Let's take a drive.
I'll buy you lunch.</font>

769
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,406
<font color="#ffff00">Got some interesting news
this morning concerning you.</font>

770
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,571
<font color="#ffff00">Thought I'd make sure it was true
before I talk to you about it.</font>

771
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,127
<font color="#ffff00">- Is everything all right?
- You tell me.</font>

772
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,928
<font color="#ffff00">The DOD has given us
preliminary funding for Type X.</font>

773
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,444
<font color="#ffff00">- We'll leave it here, Mr. Goddard.
- Thanks, Bud.</font>

774
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,444
<font color="#ffff00">- Well, what do you think?
- It's powerful.</font>

775
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,001
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, it is.</font>

776
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,447
<font color="#ffff00">Consider it a loaner
for saving Type X.</font>

777
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,444
<font color="#ffff00">- Jock, I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.</font>

778
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,008
<font color="#ffff00">Power is the juice,
get used to drinking it.</font>

779
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,009
<font color="#ffff00">I heard you talking
about Occura.</font>

780
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,605
<font color="#ffff00">There's a lot of buzz about it.</font>

781
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,730
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, Occura's been,
uh, gestating</font>

782
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,805
<font color="#ffff00">for... quite a few years.</font>

783
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,486
<font color="#ffff00">We only recently were able to put</font>

784
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,166
<font color="#ffff00">all of the elements together
to make it happen.</font>

785
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,890
<font color="#ffff00">- I'll have coffee.
- I'll have a water.</font>

786
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,121
<font color="#ffff00">Very good.</font>

787
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,489
<font color="#ffff00">Imagine walking around
with nothing but your cell phone.</font>

788
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,961
<font color="#ffff00">No wallet, no keys.</font>

789
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,929
<font color="#ffff00">Like a digital wallet.</font>

790
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,367
<font color="#ffff00">It'll be your driver's license,
it'll be your credit card,</font>

791
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,487
<font color="#ffff00">it'll be more than that.</font>

792
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,645
<font color="#ffff00">Super slim. Foldable, with a battery
that recharges itself</font>

793
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,491
<font color="#ffff00">from any ambient electrical source.</font>

794
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,650
<font color="#ffff00">It'll know where you've been,
who you've been with.</font>

795
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,691
<font color="#ffff00">It'll track your priorities,
expenditures,</font>

796
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,844
<font color="#ffff00">your health, calendar.</font>

797
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,925
<font color="#ffff00">It will know who you are.
And it's all ours.</font>

798
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,481
<font color="#ffff00">You think people really want
all that personal information</font>

799
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,801
<font color="#ffff00">under one roof?</font>

800
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,009
<font color="#ffff00">It's not the roof that matters, Adam.</font>

801
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,444
<font color="#ffff00">It's the warm fuzzy feeling
of the home under it.</font>

802
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,127
<font color="#ffff00">People are so distracted these days,
they don't know who they are.</font>

803
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
<font color="#ffff00">But we will.</font>

804
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,650
<font color="#ffff00">We'll know them better
than they know themselves.</font>

805
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,528
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my goodness.</font>

806
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,607
<font color="#ffff00">Jock.</font>

807
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,250
<font color="#ffff00">Nick.</font>

808
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,010
<font color="#ffff00">How long has it been?</font>

809
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,923
<font color="#ffff00">Not long enough.</font>

810
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,686
<font color="#ffff00">You look like
you're holding up all right.</font>

811
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,083
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I'm doing fine.
What brings you here?</font>

812
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,681
<font color="#ffff00">Lunch. Lunch brings me here.</font>

813
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,563
<font color="#ffff00">- You remember Judith.
- Oh, of course.</font>

814
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,643
<font color="#ffff00">- How are you, Judith?
- Good.</font>

815
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,565
<font color="#ffff00">You remember Adam Cassidy.
He designed your Ethion.</font>

816
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, he did.</font>

817
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,683
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, again, Adam.</font>

818
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,569
<font color="#ffff00">He reminds me of you.</font>

819
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,206
<font color="#ffff00">Way back when,
before you walked out on us.</font>

820
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,725
<font color="#ffff00">Let's not muddle the facts.</font>

821
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,644
<font color="#ffff00">You asked me to walk
and locked the door behind me.</font>

822
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,531
<font color="#ffff00">Besides, I was smarter than Adam here.</font>

823
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,682
<font color="#ffff00">And I didn't spend all my time
kissing your ass.</font>

824
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,609
<font color="#ffff00">How is Ethion? We've heard
remarkably little about it.</font>

825
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,923
<font color="#ffff00">Mm. Ethion's fine.
How's Occura?</font>

826
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,003
<font color="#ffff00">Right on schedule.</font>

827
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,851
<font color="#ffff00">And it's something you're
never going to be able to duplicate.</font>

828
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
<font color="#ffff00">Is that so?</font>

829
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,209
<font color="#ffff00">Remember when we used
to share ideas, Nick?</font>

830
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,600
<font color="#ffff00">I try not to.</font>

831
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,606
<font color="#ffff00">When we put our heads together,
there was no problem we couldn't solve.</font>

832
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,404
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing we couldn't make.</font>

833
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,608
<font color="#ffff00">There was no problem I couldn't solve.</font>

834
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,643
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing I couldn't make.</font>

835
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,448
<font color="#ffff00">I miss your friendship.</font>

836
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,405
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't we sit down together sometime.</font>

837
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,967
<font color="#ffff00">Always so full of shit.
You sit here like...</font>

838
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,566
<font color="#ffff00">...like some big shot
with boy wonder here,</font>

839
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,644
<font color="#ffff00">blowing smoke up your ass
like it's still relevant.</font>

840
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,280
<font color="#ffff00">The truth is, I'm gonna bury you,</font>

841
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,967
<font color="#ffff00">and your boy here
is gonna be working for me again.</font>

842
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,006
<font color="#ffff00">Because working for you,
means he'll be working for me.</font>

843
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,125
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let your lunch get cold, Nick.</font>

844
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,922
<font color="#ffff00">Nice seeing you, Judith.</font>

845
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,207
<font color="#ffff00">He's running
search after search on Goddard.</font>

846
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,243
<font color="#ffff00">What is he looking for?</font>

847
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,811
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

848
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,605
<font color="#ffff00">I think this
boy's gone soft on us.</font>

849
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,846
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Were you going to ignore my call?</i></font>

850
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,322
<font color="#ffff00">You should have told me
Wyatt was gonna be there.</font>

851
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,721
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Why do you keep pacing so much?
You look nervous.</i></font>

852
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,609
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You have something you want to tell me?</i></font>

853
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,651
<font color="#ffff00">Where are you?</font>

854
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,919
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Now let me explain to you
how this is going to work.</i></font>

855
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,729
<font color="#ffff00">We hit one of your friends first.</font>

856
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,729
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Or maybe the girl.</i></font>

857
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,002
<font color="#ffff00">If you even touch her...</font>

858
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,891
<font color="#ffff00">Then get us what we need.</font>

859
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,731
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You have two days
to break into Eikon.</i></font>

860
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,969
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is your last warning.</i></font>

861
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,207
<font color="#ffff00">Help! Help me! Somebody help me!</font>

862
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,005
<font color="#ffff00">He said I had two days.
That was the night before last.</font>

863
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,926
<font color="#ffff00">These people are everywhere.
Put cameras in your house.</font>

864
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,564
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. I just...</font>

865
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,003
<font color="#ffff00">I messed up, Dad.</font>

866
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,047
<font color="#ffff00">I thought I knew what I was doing.</font>

867
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,321
<font color="#ffff00">You have to figure a way out.</font>

868
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,441
<font color="#ffff00">Adam.</font>

869
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,087
<font color="#ffff00">Adam.</font>

870
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,891
<font color="#ffff00">- Adam!
- This is serious, OK?</font>

871
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,444
<font color="#ffff00">You got to figure a way out.</font>

872
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,290
<font color="#ffff00">It's not that easy.</font>

873
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,081
<font color="#ffff00">OK? I put a lot of people
I care about in danger.</font>

874
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,081
<font color="#ffff00">Adam, I think
the FBI is the only option.</font>

875
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,928
<font color="#ffff00">I could go to jail.</font>

876
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,490
<font color="#ffff00">Or they could kill you.</font>

877
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,568
<font color="#ffff00"><i>There was a black car and it
just came out of nowhere and it hit him.</i></font>

878
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728
<font color="#ffff00">Slow down. Is he all right?
Where are you?</font>

879
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,521
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've been trying to reach you all day.
Kev's at the hospital, but he's OK.</i></font>

880
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,330
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I think they're discharging us now.</i></font>

881
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,608
<font color="#ffff00">OK, were there witnesses?
Did anyone get the plates?</font>

882
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,770
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't think so. I don't know, it just
all happened so fast. I got to go.</i></font>

883
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,922
<font color="#ffff00">- OK, call me back.
<i>- I will.</i></font>

884
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,401
<font color="#ffff00">Hey!</font>

885
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,969
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! What's the matter with you?!</font>

886
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,248
<font color="#ffff00">Go, go, go, Go!</font>

887
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,525
<font color="#ffff00">On your knees.</font>

888
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,081
<font color="#ffff00">- I'll do it, I'll do it!
- Get on your knees!</font>

889
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,962
<font color="#ffff00">You're going in tonight, and you'll need
Emma's phone to do it.</font>

890
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,285
<font color="#ffff00">Get moving.</font>

891
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,287
<font color="#ffff00">Can I come in?</font>

892
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,405
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't been honest with you.</font>

893
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,131
<font color="#ffff00">What do you mean?</font>

894
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,041
<font color="#ffff00">There's things I want to tell you
that I haven't told you.</font>

895
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,845
<font color="#ffff00">What is it?</font>

896
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,406
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Cassidy.</font>

897
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,722
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah?
- Working late tonight?</font>

898
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,044
<font color="#ffff00">Burning that midnight oil.</font>

899
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,121

let's check that server.</font>

01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,610
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Cassidy.</font>

922
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,445
<font color="#ffff00">Got caught with your hand
in the cookie jar, didn't you?</font>

923
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,610
<font color="#ffff00">I... Jock, I can explain this.</font>

924
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,531
<font color="#ffff00">Where you gonna start?</font>

925
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,291
<font color="#ffff00">I was beginning to think
it would never happen.</font>

926
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,890
<font color="#ffff00">Wyatt would rather watch
his company crumble than sell it to me.</font>

927
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,811
<font color="#ffff00">Then you came along
with your blind ambition.</font>

928
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,480
<font color="#ffff00">We recorded it all, every conversation,</font>

929
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,921
<font color="#ffff00">every text between you and Wyatt.</font>

930
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,681
<font color="#ffff00">You tell Nick he'll be selling me
majority shares in his company</font>

931
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,730
<font color="#ffff00">or evidence of your collusion goes
to the FBI.</font>

932
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,162
<font color="#ffff00">You manipulated me.</font>

933
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

934
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,524
<font color="#ffff00">You'll be at the Sutton Club tomorrow
at noon. You, Nick, and me.</font>

935
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,728
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody else.
No lawyers, no handlers. Nobody.</font>

936
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,245
<font color="#ffff00">Let him out!</font>

937
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,329
<font color="#ffff00">Big mistake.</font>

938
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,644
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

939
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,083
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing here?
You can't be here.</font>

940
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,600
<font color="#ffff00">You used me.</font>

941
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,445
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. OK? I'm so sorry.</font>

942
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,320
<font color="#ffff00">You got to go,
you're not safe here.</font>

943
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,761
<font color="#ffff00">Everything you...
everything you said,</font>

944
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,164
<font color="#ffff00">every... everything you did...
was a lie.</font>

945
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,402
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's not true.
Not everything.</font>

946
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,042
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted to be someone else.</font>

947
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,121
<font color="#ffff00">Now you are.</font>

948
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,564
<font color="#ffff00">Now you are.</font>

949
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,802
<font color="#ffff00">You know...</font>

950
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,764
<font color="#ffff00">I fell for you because
you weren't like everyone else.</font>

951
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,443
<font color="#ffff00">Emma, I'm gonna make this right.</font>

952
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,962
<font color="#ffff00">You don't know what that is.</font>

953
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,890
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you sure messed that up.</font>

954
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,644
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, look, I'm trying, OK?</font>

955
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,327
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, well, now you're done trying.
Let's go for a ride.</font>

956
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,243
<font color="#ffff00">Look, you don't get it, OK?
It was all a setup!</font>

957
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,970
<font color="#ffff00">- Get in the car!
- It was all a setup!</font>

958
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,485
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, man.</font>

959
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,321
<font color="#ffff00">What are you sorry for?</font>

960
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,323
<font color="#ffff00">You didn't run me over, did you?</font>

961
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,124
<font color="#ffff00">I'm the reason for all of this.</font>

962
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,729
<font color="#ffff00">The real question is...</font>

963
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,242
<font color="#ffff00">...what are we gonna do about it?</font>

964
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,322
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to use what they taught me...</font>

965

966
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,807
<font color="#ffff00">So, what's the news
on the Dutch deal?</font>

967
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,281
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't know.
- Good, we won't need them anyway.</font>

968
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,088
<font color="#ffff00">Don't remember inviting you.</font>

969
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,091
<font color="#ffff00">My going-away party got
this whole thing rolling.</font>

970
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,964
<font color="#ffff00">I thought it was only fair
that I show up for yours.</font>

971
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,729
<font color="#ffff00">What are you talking about?</font>

972
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,087
<font color="#ffff00">Goddard orchestrated this whole thing...</font>

973
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,968
<font color="#ffff00">...to entrap you
into committing a crime.</font>

974

975
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,366
<font color="#ffff00">You did.</font>

976
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,083
<font color="#ffff00">This is the death of your empire, Nick.</font>

977
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,971
<font color="#ffff00">And you were funded
with money I never touched,</font>

978

<font color="#ffff00">by corporations I had never heard of.
He has nothing.</font>

982
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,050
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on?
What's going on?</font>

983
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,808
<font color="#ffff00">- We had good intel on this!
- Where did you get that intel, Nick?</font>

984
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,770
<font color="#ffff00">This is absurd.</font>

985
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,850
<font color="#ffff00">You can't just...</font>

986

<font color="#ffff00">One more to go.</font>

992

<font color="#ffff00">Get out your phones. Sit down.
Put the batteries on the table.</font>

997
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,242
<font color="#ffff00">It says you've got another phone.</font>

998
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,727
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, no, no.
- What happened?</font>

999
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,325
<font color="#ffff00">I lost the signal.
Both phones, they're gone.</font>

1000
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,641
<font color="#ffff00">Can you get it back?</font>

1001
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,687
<font color="#ffff00">- You'll pay for this.
- Yeah, I'll pay.</font>

of Wyatt Corporation's stock you own,</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I get it or the Feds do.</font>

an empty vessel.</font>

1008
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,479

01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,007
<font color="#ffff00">and told you it was champagne

You arrogant bastard!</font>

1017
