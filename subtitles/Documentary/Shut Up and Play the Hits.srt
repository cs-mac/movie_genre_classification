1
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:03,842
A CD compilation

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:05,844
Of every good '60s cut

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:09,404
And another...
a box set from the '70s

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:12,383
And I hear you're
buying a sequencer

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,578
And an arpeggiator
That's the best move

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,087
And throwing your computer
out the window

7
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:19,090
Why Because you'd like
to make something real

8
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:21,683
What would you like to make?
Like to make a Yaz record

9
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,926
I hear that you
and your friends

10
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:30,025
I hear that you and your friends

11
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,502
I hear that you and your friends
have sold your guitars

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,562
You bought turntables

13
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:39,369
I hear that you and your friends
have sold your turntables
and you bought guitars

14
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,439
I hear that
everyone that you know

15
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,680
Is more relevant

16
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:52,190
Than my favorite fuckers I know

17
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:54,158
Have you seen my records

18
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,990

20
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,698
Did you ever hear
of these records I know

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,001
Sexual Harassment

22
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:10,872

Gil Scott-Heron

31
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,695
You can't hide

32
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,257
Your love away from me

33
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,735
You can't hide

34
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,328
Hey?

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,931
Your love away from me

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,705
But shame on you

37
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,245
Oh, I love the unity, man.

38
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,786
Unity!
Unity!

39
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:57,015
The knuckle that Juan has.

40
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,252
Are we on?

41
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:08,294
Am I here?
Over here, spotlight.

42
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,959
Hi, everybody.

43
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:12,766
Well, well, well.

44
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,136
Madison Square Garden.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,331
Guess who I'm here with.

46
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,241
This is James Murphy...

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,801
his older brother Tom.

48
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,871
Everybody say, "Hi, Tom."

49
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:24,848
Hi, Tom!

50
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,579
Tom, how do you think
your little brother is doing tonight?

51
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:29,678
I'm not gonna be critical.

52
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:31,950
I think he's doing pretty well.

53
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:34,117
How about you?

54
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:35,990
That was...

55
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:39,361
That's pretty good.
I think that was a pretty good response.

56
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:41,457
So you're enjoying the show
so far, everybody?

57
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,161
Good.

58
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:46,500
I think what we should do now
is thank LCD Soundsystem...

59
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,540
for making all this amazing music for us.

60
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:52,634
So, on the count of three, let's all say,
"Thank you, LCD Soundsystem."

61
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,838
One, two, three.

62
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:58,008
Thank you, LCD Soundsystem!

63
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,212
And now back to you, gentlemen.
It's all yours.

64
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,778
Thanks, guys.
Have a good night.

65
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,258
Something really quickly.

66
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:22,000
You might think this is a big show
and we're putting on a big show.

67
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:26,010
Um, there's a lot of people
who just volunteered to do this with us,

68
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,138
like, flew themselves here
and performed with us...

69
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,184
and who live here
and just put their time in.

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,210
And I want you to know
that there's a lot of people...

71
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,188
who just dedicated themselves
to doing this,

72
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:42,421
to put this weird thing on
in this totally...

73
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:45,589
in a boxing arena, basically.

74
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,929
We had a tour a couple years ago...

75
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:54,539
with our friends, with a band...

76
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,172
who is, I mean,

77
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:02,339
technically from Canada,
but there's two Americans.

78
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,575
North and south.

79
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:06,413
There's two Americans.
North... Southern...

80
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:09,010
Well, you guys are like...
You guys are like Bush.

81
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,454
You know, you've got the Maine... Texas...

82
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,389
There's Central America too, technically.

83
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,256
Yeah, you've got both.

84
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:18,185
So we did a...

85
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:24,530
We did a tour, and weirdly,
there was a song that thematically worked...

86
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,769
as well as musically worked
to have people play with us.

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,604
Shut up and play the hits!

88
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,068
Ladies and gentlemen,

89
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:36,137
for our live record called
<i>Shut Up and Play the Hits...</i>

90
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:37,739
Whoo!

91
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:44,086
Nah, I'm not going to...
Fuck you guys. Know what I mean?

92
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:49,859
And we have two...
Aw, man, this is like a history trip.

93
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,593
Two horny horns,

94
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:56,964
one kind of flatulent drummer...

95
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:00,295
and three troubled souls.

96
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,266
Three troubled...
Four troubled souls.

97
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,414
Huh, huh, huh

98
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,044
It's Australia, 2008!

99
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,884
Huh, huh, huh, huh

100
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:23,359
Huh, huh, huh

101
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:29,263
Huh, huh, huh, huh

102
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,859
Oh, I don't know, I don't know

103
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,927
Oh, where to begin

104
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:35,405
We are North American

105
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:39,103
And for those, for those
who think that we're from England

106
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:40,668
We're not

107
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,975
We've been on planes and on trains
till we think we might die

108
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,610
Far from North America

109
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:51,087
Well, your buildings are old
and you might have lots of mimes

110
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,855
I hate the feeling
when you're lookin' at me this way?

111
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,489
'Cause we're North American

112
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,592
But if we act all shy
it'll make it go away?

113
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,534
Makes it okay?

114
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:10,200
Oh, I don't know, I don't know
oh, where to begin

115
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,335
'Cause we're North American

116
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,541
But in the end
make the same mistakes all over again

117
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:19,209
Come on, North Americans

118
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:25,580
Fuck, yeah, North American scum

119
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:29,049
Yeah

120
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,358
We are North American

121
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,465
Shout, shout, shout it

122
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:47,138
And all the kids, all the kids
they want to make the scene

123
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,578
Here in North America

124
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:53,379
And all your kids
get to read it in your magazines

125
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,010
We don't have those

126
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:58,113
So where's the love, where's the love
where's the love

127
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,454
Where's the love
Where's the love tonight

128
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,522
But there's no love, man

129
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,154
There's no love when the kids are uptight

130
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,994
Uh, uh, so

131
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:11,764
So throw a party till the cops come in
and bust it up

132
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,896
Check outta of?
North America

133
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:19,205
- Oh, you were planning it
I didn't mean to interrupt
- Sorry?

134
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:23,678
I did it once
and my parents got pretty upset

135
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:26,443
Freaked out in North America

136
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:30,420
And then I said the more I do it
the better it gets

137
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,480
Check out North America

138
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,529
We are North American scum

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,463
We're from North America

140
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,436
We are North American scum

141
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,611
Check out
We are North American

142
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,326
New York's the greatest
if you've got someone to pay for it

143
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,561
North America

144
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,263
And it's the furthest you can live
from the government

145
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:25,499
Some proud American Christians
might disagree

146
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:27,977
- Hah!
- North America

147
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,413
New York's the only place
we're keepin' them off the street

148
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:32,643
Oh!

149
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:37,754
We can't have parties
where they go all night

150
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,155
Shut down in
North America

151
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,852
Or like Berlin
where they go another night

152
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:43,918
All right!

153
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,987
Uh, uh

154
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:49,591
You see, I love this place
that I have grown to know

155
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,296
- Come on
- North America

156
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,363
And, yeah, I know you wouldn't
touch it with a 10-foot pole

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,467
- Come on
- North America

158
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,238
We are North American scum

159
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,652
We're from North America

160
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,359
We are North American scum

161
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:24,334
We are North American

162
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:26,735
Take me back to the States, man

163
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,365
North American scum

164
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:33,035
Where we can rock

165
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,773
To North America

166
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,715
Where the deejays are so much fun

167
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:41,776
Spinnin' North American scum

168
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,914
And don't blame the Canadians

169
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,322
Let's go, North America

170
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:59,197
<i>So you strike me as somebody
who is acutely aware of your age,</i>

171
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:03,800
<i>that your age seems to play a role
in a lot of the things you think about.</i>

172
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,901
<i>Not just the years themselves,</i>

173
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:08,310
<i>but the amount of experience
and stuff like that.</i>

174
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,678
<i>And, you know, if you were a writer,
you would still be young.</i>

175
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,614
<i>That's why I've always wanted
to get into that.</i>

176
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:15,983
<i>And if you were an actor,
you'd be kind of right in the sweet spot.
Yeah.</i>

177
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:20,149
<i>But when you're a musician,
a rock musician...</i>

178
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:23,023
<i>or an athlete or, like, a mathematician...</i>

179
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:27,532
<i>the assumption seems to be
you have to succeed early.</i>

180
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:30,227
<i>So how much is your motive
for quitting the band...</i>

181
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:34,534
<i>solely a product of,
you feel too old to be doing it,
and it feels weird?</i>

182
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:41,079
<i>I was 38 years old and I said,
"I'm going to make a record."</i>

183
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,604
<i>Um, you know,
"Going to make another record."</i>

184
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,413
<i>And then I blinked and I was 41.</i>

185
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:50,853
<i>And I don't have any kids,
and I want to have kids
and I want to have a life.</i>

186
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:52,413
<i>And I feel like
that's, like, a genuine thing.</i>

187
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,085
<i>It's, like, I can't...
I blink twice more and I'm 50.</i>

188
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,594
<i>Every time I go on tour,
I get new gray.</i>

189
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:00,291
<i>When I don't go on tour...
I didn't go on tour for two years...</i>

190
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,697
<i>I got no extra gray.</i>

191
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,861
<i>I didn't age at all in two years.</i>

192
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,165
<i>I saw pictures.</i>

193
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,967
<i>When I got home
from Sound of Silver tour...</i>

194
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,668
<i>and when I got ready to go on tour,
and it's the same.</i>

195
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,975
<i>And then a month or two into tour,
you know, a big patch on my neck.</i>

196
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,848
<i>And I'm like,
"Well, that's the visible, funny sign."</i>

197
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:23,115
<i>Like, I'm getting gray hairs
on my face.</i>

198
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,179
<i>But what the fuck's
going on inside?</i>

199
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:31,924
<i>What's going on in my liver
or in my lower intestine, or...</i>

200
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:35,763
<i>You know, I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.</i>

201
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,202
How you feelin'?

202
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,330
I'm fucked.
Fucking hell.

203
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,800
What...

204
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,743
I am absolutely fucked.

205
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,445
Smells a bit like gas.

206
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,848
It does. Actually, it's this...

207
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,978
It's this new addition and it's, like...

208
00:11:56,053 --> 00:12:00,616
It's spewing gas,
but not enough to kill you.
Is that bad?

209
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:02,785
I feel like somebody
put my head on the desk...

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,297
and hit me with six bottles
of champagne.

211
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,560
That was me.
I think it was me, actually.

212
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:12,467
Good champagne though.

213
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:14,528
Yeah, I'm absolutely whacked.

214
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,370
I spent the whole morning
just staring at the wall.

215
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:20,172
Kind of like, "Am I here?
Am I there What the hell?"

216
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:23,009
You know,
27-hour day and all that.

217
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,482
But seriously,
how fucking amazing was that?

218
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:30,688
How fucking amazing
was that?

219
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,018
I feel great.

220
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,217
I feel super weird,
but I feel good.

221
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,489
It is super weird,
it's completely weird,

222
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:43,125
but it's, like, we fucking went out
on a total fucking high.

223
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,602
I didn't feel great this morning...

224
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,333
but I feel pretty good now.

225
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:51,171
There was backstage booze,
I think, that I want to make sure...

226
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,074
Believe me, you...

227
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:56,239
From what I saw,
you had your fair share, dear boy.

228
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:57,645
It's a long show.

229
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,308
It's a long show.

230
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:02,046
Thank God you weren't drinking
Irish cunt, is all I can say.

231
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,610
Exactly.

232
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,486
Oh.

233
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,859
Uh, London.

234
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,159
Don't recognize it.

235
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,429
Uh, I think we'll say bye-bye.

236
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,402
Just wait till you see this.

237
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,132
You now have a weird one for me?

238
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:25,643
This is kinda like Monty Python
meets LCD Soundsystem...

239
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,440
at Madison Square Garden.

240
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,180
I'm going to leave this with you...

241
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,877
and go to the little boys' room
and have a pee-pee.

242
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:39,220
Dude, what is this thing?

243
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,727
It's your trophy, mate.

244
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,820
This is a sad object, dude.

245
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:08,480
There it is.
LCD Soundsystem sells out.

246
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:10,350
It literally says "sold out."

247
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,650
Sold out.

248
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:14,851
I've got a perfect solution
for your giant bottle of Scotch.

249
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:17,895
- What?
- Bring it to Marlow tonight for dinner.

250
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,590
Ahh.

251
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,791
Well, here's the thing.

252
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:25,462
I'm trying to keep
my marriage happy and intact.

253
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:28,005
Um, Laurie has to go away tomorrow.

254
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:29,062
Right.

255
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,704
And I need to be upstate
to look after the dogs,
take care of the farm.

256
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,578
Keep the serfs in line?

257
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:43,379
And to be fair, Marlow's
is kind of a young person's hangout.

258
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:47,714
You know...

259
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,454
You kind of...

260
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:53,191
You dress them up,
you put them on fucking
Madison Square Garden's stage,

261
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:56,359
you sort it all out,
and what do you get Abuse.

262
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:42,344
Yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

263
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

264
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

265
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,014
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

266
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,924
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

267
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:59,259
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

268
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,559
Whoo!

269
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:04,363
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah?

270
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:07,303
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

271
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,612
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

272
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:53,878
Yeah, yeah, yeah

273
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:56,614
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

274
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,348
Yeah, yeah, yeah

275
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

276
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:05,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

277
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:08,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

278
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:11,096
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

279
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,937
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

280
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,336
Yeah, yeah, yeah

281
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:18,934
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

282
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,472
The red place used to be a...

283
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,277
It was something else,
wasn't it?

284
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,909
Yeah, it's a French restaurant,
and it's been, uh...

285
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,713
But all these places,
they've all changed.

286
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,455
It's New York.
Everything changes.

287
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,729
What?
"It's New York, darling.
Everything changes."

288
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:54,169
Well, it does.
Perpetual state of flux.

289
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:55,729
Including us.

290
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,331
Including you.

291
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,347
So this is weird,
but I've got to roll.

292
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,409
I've got to go.

293
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:09,646
Take care of yourself, huh?

294
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,087
Love you, dude.
Love you, James.

295
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,421
I'll give you a call tomorrow, all right?
Yes, boss.

296
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,323
Look after yourself.
Yes, boss.

297
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,952
Drive safe.
I'm retired.

298
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:37,173
<i>Do you like talking about yourself?</i>

299
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,910
<i>Like, is it fun to have someone
ask you these questions...</i>

300
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:43,852
<i>and basically say,
"Consider your life
and put your life in a context...</i>

301
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,651
<i>"that other people will understand"?</i>

302
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:48,658
<i>I wish I could say, like,
"No, I find it so hard."</i>

303
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:51,820
<i>Why would you want to say that?
I would think you'd want to say,
"I love it."</i>

304
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,592
No, because it just seems like,
again, you know...

305
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,031
I know you think that you
should say you don't like doing it...
I don't like...

306
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,096
but you seem
very comfortable with it.
I don't like boring interviews.

307
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:05,870
So when I have to do interviews
and it's just like,

308
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,679
"So did Daft Punk really play
in your house?"
Yeah.

309
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,646
And it's, like, you know what...

310
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,877
And we call that talk...
You gonna go talk about yourself?

311
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,819
That's what we always joke.
"I gotta go talk about myself
for a half an hour."

312
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,288
Um, that I find really boring.

313
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:24,226
But I think
that underlying loneliness,

314
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,991
or that underlying desire
to be understood,

315
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:30,865
like to clarify, you know,
this endless kind of like...

316
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,637
is pretty real.

317
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:36,231
And...

318
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,839
explaining...

319
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:46,006
I want to...
You know what I mean?

320
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,212
I want to explain sometimes.
Like, not everything.

321
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,778
I don't want to get into, like,
"What's that song mean?"

322
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:57,984
That stuff drives me a little bit crazy,
but explaining why,
explaining the position...

323
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,963
I'm obsessed with the position,
like where this stuff is coming from.

324
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:03,591
Like songs I like...
I like when songs are from a place.

325
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,694
Not about something,
but from a place, from a moment.

326
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:18,406
I wake up and the phone is ringing

327
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:23,212
Surprised, as it's early?

328
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:27,850
And that should be the perfect warning

329
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:31,862
That something's a problem

330
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,422
To tell the truth, I saw it coming

331
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,260
The way you were breathing

332
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:43,569
But nothing can prepare you for it

333
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:50,376
The voice on the other end

334
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:09,227
The worst is all the lovely weather

335
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:14,396
I'm stunned it's not raining

336
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:17,771
The coffee isn't even bitter

337
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:22,476
Because what's the difference

338
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:26,677
There's all the work that needs to be done

339
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,188
It's late for revision

340
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:34,487
There's all the time and all the planning

341
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:39,988
And songs to be finished

342
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:43,864
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming

343
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:48,463
And it's keeps coming
till the day it stops

344
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,441
- And it keeps coming
- And it keeps coming

345
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,776
And it keeps coming
till the day it stops

346
00:22:56,847 --> 00:23:00,807
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming

347
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:05,117
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming

348
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:09,785
And it keeps coming
And it keeps coming

349
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,627
And it keeps coming
till the day it stops

350
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:16,496
I wish that we could talk about it

351
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:22,071
But there, that's the problem

352
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,371
With someone new I could have started

353
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,980
Too late for beginnings

354
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,847
You're smaller than my wife imagined

355
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:39,045
Surprised you were human

356
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:42,923
There shouldn't be this ring of silence

357
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:47,829
But what are the options

358
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:51,733
When someone great is gone

359
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:55,864
When someone great is gone

360
00:23:55,939 --> 00:24:00,104
When someone great is gone

361
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:04,376
When someone great is gone

362
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:09,045
When someone great is gone

363
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,022
When someone great is gone

364
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,460
When someone great is gone

365
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:21,396
When someone great is gone

366
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,593
We're safe

367
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:29,236
For the moment

368
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:32,570
Saved

369
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,713
For the moment

370
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:11,408
<i>I've always had this belief
that people or bands...</i>

371
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,950
<i>or whatever entities,
whatever you want to look at...</i>

372
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:20,389
<i>they're sort of remembered
for their collection of successes,</i>

373
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:25,225
<i>but they're sort of defined
by whatever is their singular failure.</i>

374
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:28,322
<i>This is kind of a sports example,
but Michael Jordan is remembered...</i>

375
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,867
<i>for all these great things he did
as a basketball player...
Right.</i>

376
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:34,166
<i>but I feel like
his singular failure was,</i>

377
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:38,231
<i>you know, his inability
to distance himself from competition.</i>

378
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,901
<i>That led to his gambling problem,</i>

379
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:44,311
<i>and it's led to his inability
to have a good life after basketball.
Right.</i>

380
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,043
<i>So I'm curious.</i>

381
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:50,178
<i>When you look at LCD Soundsystem,
or even just the trajectory of your life,</i>

382
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:52,784
<i>sort of, what were the successes,</i>

383
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,883
<i>and what do you feel might be
the defining thing you failed at?</i>

384
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:54,610
You can climb a mountain

385
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:57,353
You can swim the sea

386
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:00,787
You can jump into the fire

387
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,918
But you'll never be free, no

388
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:06,219
You can shake me up

389
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:10,399
<i>And I can tear you down?</i>

390
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:20,137
You can jump into the fire

391
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,047
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire

392
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:29,409
You can jump into the fire

393
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,129
We can make each other happy?

394
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:47,562
<i>We can make each other happy?</i>

395
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:50,868
<i>We can make each other happy?</i>

396
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:54,770
We can make each other happy?

397
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,824
You can climb a mountain

398
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,124
You can swim the sea

399
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,728
You can jump into the fire

400
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:55,169
But you'll never be free, no

401
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,037
You can shake me up

402
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:01,810
And I could tear you down

403
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:18,115
You can climb a mountain

404
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:21,420
You can swim the sea

405
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:24,427
You can jump into the fire

406
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:27,328
But you never will be free, no, no

407
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:30,162
You can shake me up

408
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,397
And I can tear you down

409
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:48,510
You can jump into the fire

410
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,918
You can jump into the fire

411
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:54,420
You can jump into the fire

412
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:56,187
You can jump

413
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,921
Into

414
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:01,658
The fire

415
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,055
You didn't answer the last part
of my question though,

416
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:37,657
which is, if you were...

417
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,498
I'll just ask the question.

418
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,731
What was the biggest failure...

419
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:44,639
What's the biggest failure?
of LCD Soundsystem?

420
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:46,573
Aside from like, you know,
when the volcano hit.

421
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:48,373
We didn't make it to Dublin
for the opening shows.

422
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:49,935
I felt really bad about that.

423
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,278
Yeah, that can't be
your biggest mistake.

424
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,146
You can't blame a volcano
for your biggest mistake.

425
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:56,243
I think the biggest failure...

426
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,948
I don't know if it's a failure.
I don't know yet.

427
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,081
Uh, stopping.

428
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,935
<i>I've been a little obsessed
with, like...</i>

429
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:14,698
Okay. You see these Kanye tweets.

430
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:18,606
People will be like, "You're"...
People call him ridiculous, or...

431
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:24,347
You know, make fun of him
for being egotistical
and all this other shit like that.

432
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,883
But I saw a quote
where he was just, like,

433
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,078
"Nobody's being a rock star.
None of you people are doing it.

434
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,246
Everybody is chicken.
Everyone is scared.
Like, scared to fail."

435
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:33,790
Scared... You know,
and it'd be, like, I'm doing it.

436
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:36,554
And I feel that if there is anything
that is going to be our great failure,

437
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,117
it's that...

438
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:43,691
even though I think I'm getting out
for what I think are <i>not</i> those reasons,

439
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:48,261
fear of failure or fear of
the responsibility of getting bigger,

440
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,138
it makes me suspicious,

441
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:57,943
because these other reasons
happen to also...

442
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,449
serve that potential fear.

443
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,047
Just the way it sounds to me
as you're talking, that actually,

444
00:33:07,123 --> 00:33:10,184
if... if my theory is true...

445
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,322
that people are remembered
for their multiple successes,

446
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:16,195
but they are defined
by a singular failure...

447
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:18,235
it would seem your singular failure...

448
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:23,296
would be an inability
to stop being self... conscious.

449
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:26,810
The fact that you're saying that the problem
might be quitting the band,

450
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:31,871
but what it really is,
is you're already thinking
what quitting could mean...

451
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:36,318
or could be perceived to mean,
or what your real motive might be.
It's more inside.

452
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,254
I want to look back and be very,
very proud of everything that we did.

453
00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:42,918
And I feel like right now I'm...
with a couple of snafus here and there...

454
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,655
I'm very, very like...

455
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,664
I like the way we've handled ourselves
and I'm proud of that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

456
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:52,759
But this quitting stuff, even though
I'm, like, it's the right thing,

457
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,339
I wonder if me saying, like,

458
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:01,810
"I don't want to be a famous person
because I like riding the subway.

459
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:03,710
"I like eating food.
I like being a normal person.

460
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,009
"I like it. I'm 41.

461
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:08,540
"I don't think I could adjust
to the kind of weird dichotomy."

462
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:10,177
But is that a good enough reason?

463
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:12,813
If you believe in your band...

464
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:18,126
and you claim to like music
and you claim to like
making music for people,

465
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:20,356
is that a good enough reason to quit?

466
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:19,505
The lead-up to it
was so excruciating,

467
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:23,246
but I promised myself
that I was going to enjoy it...

468
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,515
Oh?
and I did.

469
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:35,759
Hello.

470
00:36:35,832 --> 00:36:38,324
Very good. Williamsburg, please.
Second exit off the bridge.

471
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:41,337
Williamsburg,
second exit off the bridge, please.

472
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:43,630
Williamsburg.

473
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:46,540
Hey, hey!

474
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:50,169
Yeah, I guess we can...

475
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:51,737
<i>This is our last song.</i>

476
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,880
<i>Okay, let me point this out,</i>

477
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,652
<i>that even now,
at the end of our band,</i>

478
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:05,161
<i>I fucking didn't say that
so you would say "Oh, no."</i>

479
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:07,493
<i>It wasn't the false...</i>

480
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,964
<i>It wasn't, like, "This is our last song."
"Oh."</i>

481
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:13,469
- <i>This is our last song!</i>
- <i>No!</i>

482
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:17,467
<i>And...</i>

483
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:26,441
<i>There's a lot of people here
that we don't know...</i>

484
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:29,350
<i>that came and put a lot of effort
into coming to see us,</i>

485
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:32,013
<i>and we want to thank you very much.</i>

486
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,023
<i>Everybody...</i>

487
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,788
<i>And the people who are sitting up there
who have a hard time seeing, I'm sorry.</i>

488
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:42,764
<i>Thank you so much for coming
and doing this with us on both sides.</i>

489
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:48,366
<i>And all of our friends,</i>

490
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:51,601
<i>a few that we know,
are in this little area here,
so give them a wave.</i>

491
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:54,803
<i>They're good people.
They're not shitty people
who wanted free tickets.</i>

492
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:56,368
<i>They're good people.</i>

493
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:58,778
<i>And my family, hi.</i>

494
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:03,377
<i>And my sister and brother are here,
and their kids.</i>

495
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,746
<i>And hi, you guys.</i>

496
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:06,914
<i>And...</i>

497
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:09,686
<i>Um, I hope it's okay.</i>

498
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:13,196
<i>I'm wearing my dad's watch, so...</i>

499
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:14,890
<i>Tonight.</i>

500
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:08,851
<i>New York, I love you?</i>

501
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:11,547
<i>But you're bringing me down?</i>

502
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:22,721
New York, I love you

503
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,302
But you're bringing me down

504
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:51,049
I only get to pause
an interminable amount once more.

505
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,323
This is my last endless pause.

506
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:55,865
Like a rat in a cage

507
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,814
Pulling minimum wage

508
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:28,596
That's very... That's very dramatic, Nancy.

509
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:31,259
New York, I love you

510
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:36,466
But you're bringing me down

511
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:43,002
New York, you're safer

512
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,605
But you're wasting my time

513
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:52,551
Our records all show

514
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:55,352
You're filthy but fine

515
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,783
Oh

516
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,796
But they shuttered your stores

517
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:06,798
When you opened the doors

518
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,739
To those cops who were bored

519
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,935
When they ran out of crime

520
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:20,112
New York, you're perfect

521
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:23,243
Oh, please, don't change a thing

522
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:29,358
Your mild billionaire mayor's

523
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:32,953
Now convinced he's a king

524
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,531
Yeah

525
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:39,091
Oh, the boring collect

526
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:44,232
And I mean all disrespect

527
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,177
In the neighborhood bars

528
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:50,839
I once dreamt I would drink

529
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:57,743
New York, I love you

530
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,848
But you're freaking me out

531
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:07,392
New York, I love you

532
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:10,456
But you're freaking me out

533
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:17,270
Like a death in the hall

534
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:21,834
That you hear through your wall

535
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:25,915
New York, I love you

536
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:28,974
But you're freaking me out

537
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,281
New York, I love you

538
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:38,691
But you're bringing me down

539
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:44,763
New York, I love you

540
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:48,498
But you're bringing me down

541
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:53,675
Like a death of the heart

542
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,578
Oh, Jesus, where do I start

543
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,585
But you're still the one pool

544
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:07,384
Where I'd happily drown

545
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,485
And oh

546
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:16,726
Take me off your mailing list

547
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:21,601
For kids who think it still exists

548
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,334
Yeah, for those who think it still exists

549
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:30,436
Maybe you're right
and maybe I'm wrong

550
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:36,009
Maybe you're right
and maybe you're wrong

551
00:43:37,453 --> 00:43:39,388
Maybe you're right

552
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:41,515
Maybe you're right

553
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:47,257
And just maybe you're wrong

554
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:52,563
And oh

555
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:58,431
Maybe Mother told you true

556
00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:02,205
And there'll always
be somebody there for you

557
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:04,474
And you'll never be alone

558
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:07,210
But maybe she's wrong

559
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,115
Maybe I'm right

560
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:12,746
And maybe she's wrong

561
00:44:13,656 --> 00:44:17,388
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm right

562
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:20,486
And if so

563
00:44:20,563 --> 00:44:22,691
Is there

564
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:57,624
<i>Standing in the door
of the Pink Flamingo?</i>

565
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:00,134
<i>Crying in the rain?</i>

566
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,740
<i>It was a kind of so-so love?</i>

567
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:12,247
<i>And I'm gonna make sure
it never happens again?</i>

568
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:14,510
<i>You and I</i>

569
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:20,147
<i>Had to be the standing joke
of the year?</i>

570
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:26,320
<i>You were a sleep-around,
a lost and found?</i>

571
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:27,988
<i>And not for me?</i>

572
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:31,158
<i>I fear?</i>

573
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:42,638
<i>I tried to make it work?</i>

574
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,944
<i>You in a cocktail skirt
and me in a suit?</i>

575
00:50:47,015 --> 00:50:49,678
<i>Well, it just wasn't me?</i>

576
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:54,348
<i>You're used to wearing less
and now your life's a mess</i>

577
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:57,985
<i>So insecure, you see?</i>

578
00:50:59,194 --> 00:51:01,390
<i>I put up with all the scenes</i>

579
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:06,959
<i>And this is one scene
that's going to be played my way?</i>

580
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:12,631
<i>Take your hands</i>

581
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:17,874
<i>Off me?</i>

582
00:51:17,946 --> 00:51:21,747
<i>I don't belong?</i>

583
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:24,218
<i>To you?</i>

584
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:27,450
<i>You see?</i>

585
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:31,152
<i>Take a look?</i>

586
00:51:31,226 --> 00:51:33,661
<i>At my face?</i>

587
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:36,494
<i>For the last time?</i>

588
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:41,230
<i>I never knew you
You never knew me?</i>

589
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:44,796
<i>Say hello, good-bye?</i>

590
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:49,444
<i>Say hello?</i>

591
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:51,639
<i>Wave good-bye?</i>

592
00:51:55,517 --> 00:51:57,713
<i>Under the deep red light?</i>

593
00:51:57,786 --> 00:52:02,053
<i>I can see the makeup sliding down?</i>

594
00:52:04,826 --> 00:52:06,522
<i>Hey, little girl?</i>

595
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:09,258
<i>You will always make up?</i>

596
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:14,167
<i>So take off that unbecoming frown?</i>

597
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:15,727
<i>What about me??</i>

598
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:18,433
<i>Well, I'll find someone?</i>

599
00:52:18,507 --> 00:52:22,137
<i>That's not going cheap in the sale?</i>

600
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:25,870
<i>A nice little housewife?</i>

601
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:28,041
<i>Who'll give me a steady life?</i>

602
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:32,816
<i>And won't keep going off the rails</i>

603
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:36,916
<i>Take your hands</i>

604
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:42,192
<i>Off me?</i>

605
00:52:42,264 --> 00:52:46,099
<i>I don't belong?</i>

606
00:52:46,168 --> 00:52:48,535
<i>To you?</i>

607
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:51,698
<i>You see?</i>

608
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:55,505
<i>Take a look?</i>

609
00:52:55,577 --> 00:52:57,978
<i>At my face?</i>

610
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:00,811
<i>For the last time?</i>

611
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:05,616
<i>I never knew you
You never knew me?</i>

612
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:08,851
<i>Say hello, good-bye?</i>

613
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:13,728
<i>Say hello?</i>

614
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:16,629
<i>Wave good-bye?</i>

615
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,836
<i>We've been involved for?</i>

616
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:24,134
<i>Quite a while now?</i>

617
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:26,903
<i>And to keep you secret?</i>

618
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:28,568
<i>Has been hell?</i>

619
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,976
<i>We're strangers meeting?</i>

620
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:33,106
<i>For the first time, okay??</i>

621
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,616
<i>Just smile and say?</i>

622
00:53:35,684 --> 00:53:37,448
<i>Hello?</i>

623
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:41,313
<i>Say hello?</i>

624
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:47,761
<i>Then wave good-bye?</i>

625
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,831
<i>Say hello?</i>

626
00:53:50,899 --> 00:53:57,032
<i>Then wave good-bye?</i>

627
00:53:58,006 --> 00:54:00,271
<i>Say hello?</i>

628
00:54:00,342 --> 00:54:05,542
<i>Then wave good-bye?</i>

629
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:09,481
<i>Say hello?</i>

630
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:15,889
<i>Then wave good-bye?</i>

631
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,056
