<i>♪ To the head bone</i>

2
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,966
<i>♪ The head bone's connected
to the horn bone</i>

3
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,501
<i>♪ The horn bone's right
above the wing bones ♪</i>

4
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,841
Ah!

5
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,976
I scared you! No, you didn't.

6
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,778
Okay! Remember our field
trip rules, everyone.

7
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:20,848
Uh, no pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

8
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,516
What did I just say?

9
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,217
Eighteen, nineteen...

10
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,939
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

11
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,155
Oh. Mike Wazowski.

12
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,892
Thanks, Joe.

13
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,894
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

14
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,062
Sorry, Michael. I
didn't see you.

15
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:37,030
That's okay.

16
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,566
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!

17
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,535
I wish I had pockets.

18
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,803
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

19
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,809
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,011
Hailey? No? Pairing
up with Claire?

21
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,746
Great choice.
She's a good egg.

22
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,713
Russell.

23
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,115
Mike? Wazowski?

24
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,184
We car-pool?

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,622
<i>- We're cousins.
- Hey!</i>

26
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,258
Okay. Good catching up.

27
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,259
Well, Michael, it looks
like it's you and me again.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,635
Come on, Karen. We're
falling behind.

29
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,116
Please don't call me Karen.

30
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,277
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

31
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:26,146
We're entering a
very dangerous area.

32
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,949
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

33
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,283
Wow!

34
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,256
This is where we collect
the Scream Energy

35
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,625
to power our whole world.

36
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,595
And can anyone tell me whose job
it is to go get that scream?

37
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,663
Scarers!

38
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,131
That's right!

39
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,199
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,201
Me, me, me!

41
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,070
Oh! Sir! Right here!
Little green guy,

42
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,572
two o'clock!

43
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,106
No, it's like this.

44
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,608
Hey, guys, watch this one.

45
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,690
Hey, I got a really good...

46
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,212
Wow!

47
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,359
Whoa.

48
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,098
Well, hey there, kids. Are you
on a tour with your school?

49
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>- Yeah!
- Yes.</i>

50
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,602
We're here to learn
about Scream Energy

51
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:23,904
and what it takes
to be a Scarer.

52
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:27,741
Well, hey, you're in luck, because
I just happen to be a Scarer.

53
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,710
I learned everything I
know from my school,

54
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,078
Monsters University.

55
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,180
Whoa.

56
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,147
It's the best Scaring
School there is.

57
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,817
You wish! Fear
Tech's the best.

58
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,685
Okay. You guys watch
us and tell me

59
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,047
which school's the best.
All right?

60
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,654
MU is.

61
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,928
<i>West coast coming only.</i>

62
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,930
<i>Scarers coming O.</i>

63
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,298
Oops. Stop right there.

64
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,166
Don't cross over
that safety line.

65
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,301
Human children are
extremely toxic.

66
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,772
Look at that!

67
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,141
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye!
Ow!

68
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:02,309
Look at that! It's amazing!

69
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,244
I know!

70
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,013
<i>- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.</i>

71
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,847
How about we do
tallest in the back?

72
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,118
Look, he's going to

73
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,952
do a real scare!

74
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:15,956
Cool. I want to be a Scarer.

75
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,324
Yeah. Me, too.

76
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,859
Come on, guys. I want to see.

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,927
Out of the way, Wazowski.

78
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,328
You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.

79
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,174
Brian! Do not step
over the line.

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,342
Mrs. Graves, Michael
went over the line.

81
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,812
Michael!

82
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,251
See? I told you. He's fine.

83
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,892
Well, I thought I
heard something.

84
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,078
What?

85
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,953
Are you okay?

86
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,287
You could have gotten hurt!

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,667
That was real dangerous, kid. I
didn't even know you were in there.

88
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,435
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

89
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,438
Not bad, kid.

90
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,076
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

91
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,414
How do I become a Scarer?

92
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,568
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

93
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,107
Well, everyone, I don't
mean to get emotional,

94
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,510
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

95
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,478
Let it not be just the
beginning of my dream

96
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,147
but the beginning of
all of our dreams.

97
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:29,316
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

98
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,852
Marie, Mr. Right is
out there somewhere.

99
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,987
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

100
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,455
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

101
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,362
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.

102
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,593
Hello. How are you doing?

103
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,003
Ah!

104
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,106
Wooh-hoo!

105
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,580
Stroke! Stroke!

106
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,902
Come on, put all
you have into it!

107
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,389
Okay! First thing on my
list, get registered.

108
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,958
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A.,

109
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,060
and I'm here to say that
registration is that away!

110
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,628
Okay, Jay.

111
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,630
Have a great first day.

112
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,066
Hey, I'm Kay! Here's
your orientation packet.

113
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,567
Thanks, Kay.

114
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,169
You can drop your bags off here

115
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,404
and get your picture
taken with Trey.

116
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,604
Say hooray! Hooray!

117
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,474
I can't believe it.

118
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,244
I'm officially a
college student!

119
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,579
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

120
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,548
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

121
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,423
Here are the labs
where students learn

122
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,344
to design and build the
doors to the human world.

123
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,266
Looks like the Professor
is about to test a door!

124
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,481
The MU cafeteria serves a full
buffet, three meals a day.

125
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,049
I personally believe we have some
of the best chefs in the world.

126
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,354
Oh! Yeah!

127
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,289
Yeah!

128
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,225
The campus offers a
wide variety of majors,

129
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:56,528
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

130
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,046
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.

131
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,382
I disagree for the
following reasons.

132
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:16,483
True happiness is a
theoretical construct...

133
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,285
Hey there! Keep
your eye on the sky

134
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,753
at the astronomy club!

135
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,294
Hey, hey, hey! Come
join the improve club.

136
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,130
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

137
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,798
Ah, dang it!

138
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,036
Mu's Greek Council. We sponsor
the annual Scare Games.

139
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,070
The Scare what now?

140
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,571
The Scare Games!

141
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,707
A super-intense
Scaring competition!

142
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,676
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

143
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,546
A bunch of guys went to
the hospital last year!

144
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:47,714
You could totally die.

145
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,516
And it's worth it.

146
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,517
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

147
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,519
Cool.

148
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,801
Wazowski, Room 319.

149
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,671
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

150
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:03,563
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.

151
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,765
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.

152
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,334
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

153
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,578
Hey there. I'm your roomie.

154
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,747
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.

155
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,483
Oh! Mike Wazowski,
Scaring major.

156
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,218
I can tell we're going
to be best chums, Mike.

157
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,087
Take whichever bed you want.

158
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,121
I wanted you to
have first dibs.

159
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,589
Ahh!

160
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,524
You just disappeared.

161
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,661
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring
class, I'll be a joke.

162
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:37,464
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.

163
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:38,698
Really? Yeah, but
lose the glasses.

164
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,099
They give it away. Huh.

165
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,477
Okay!

166
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:53,746
Unpack. Check. Hang posters.
Check.

167
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,882
Now I just need to ace my
classes, graduate with honors,

168
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,851
and become the
greatest Scarer ever.

169
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,786
Boy, I wish I had your
confidence, Mike.

170
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,221
Aren't you even a
little nervous?

171
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,554
Actually, no.

172
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,858
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

173
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,430
I just can't wait
to get started.

174
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,549
Oh, man! I can't be
late on the first day!

175
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,178
Wow.

176
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:17,696
You got to be kidding me.

177
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm so nervous!

178
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,734
Relax. It will be fine.

179
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:22,656
Good morning, students.

180
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,636
Welcome to Scaring 101.

181
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,874
I am Professor Knight.

182
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,544
Now I'm sure all of you were the
scariest monster in your town.

183
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,581
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

184
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,315
and I do not scare easily.

185
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,829
Dean Hardscrabble. This
is a pleasant surprise.

186
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,868
She's a legend.

187
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,670
She broke the
all-time Scare Record

188
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,951
with the scream
in that very can!

189
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,375
I don't mean to interrupt.

190
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,377
I just thought I'd drop by

191
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,646
to see the terrifying
faces joining my program.

192
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,950
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

193
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,517
a few words of inspiration.

194
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,255
Inspiration? Very well.

195
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,996
Scariness is the true
measure of a monster.

196
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,263
If you're not scary

197
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,532
what kind of a monster are you?

198
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,638
It's my job to make
great students greater,

199
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:39,479
not make mediocre
students less mediocre.

200
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,381
That is why at the end of the
semester there will be a final exam.

201
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,654
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

202
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,928
So, I should hope you're
all properly inspired.

203
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,805
All right. All right.

204
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,774
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

205
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,676
Yes?

206
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,913
There are actually five.

207
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,416
Those include the
roar's resonance,

208
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,450
the duration of the
roar, and the...

209
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,390
Whoops. Sorry.

210
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,060
I heard someone say "roar," so
I just kind of went for it.

211
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,429
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

212
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,597
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

213
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,433
Very impressive, Mister...

214
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,733
Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan.

215
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,736
Sullivan.

216
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,838
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

217
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,940
Yeah. He's my Dad.

218
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,643
He's a Sullivan!

219
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,713
I should have known. I
expect big things from you.

220
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:49,682
Well, you won't
be disappointed.

221
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,751
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?

222
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,552
No, no. Mr. Sullivan's
covered it.

223
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,023
Huh.

224
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,058
Everyone take out your
Scaring textbooks

225
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,027
and open them to chapter one.

226
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,962
Hey, bub. Can I
borrow a pencil?

227
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,098
I forgot all my stuff.

228
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah! All right. Yes. There we go.
That will get it.

229
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,570
Mmm... Yeah.

230
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,472
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity

231
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,841
and sorority party.
We have to go!

232
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,775
If we flunk that Scaring
final, we are done.

233
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,145
I'm not taking any chances.

234
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,747
You've got the whole
semester to study,

235
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,515
but this might be
our only chance

236
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,617
to get in good with
the cool kids.

237
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,519
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.

238
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,055
That could have
been embarrassing.

239
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,990
When I'm a Scarer, life
will be a nonstop party.

240
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,891
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

241
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:32,693
Wild man.

242
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,805
What the...

243
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,009
Archie!

244
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,147
Boo!

245
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,348
Hey! What are you...

246
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,784
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

247
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:01,821
<i>- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.</i>

248
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:02,822
That guy's in big trouble.

249
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:03,622
Yeah, he is.

250
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,625
Hey, guys! Over here!

251
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,195
Fear Tech dummies.

252
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh, oh!

253
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,131
Sorry about that, buddy.

254
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,499
Why are you in my room?

255
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,460
Your room? This is my...

256
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,437
This is not my room.

257
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:18,805
Archie! Come here, boy.

258
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,139
Archie?

259
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,542
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

260
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,910
Why is it here?

261
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,778
I stole it. Going to
take it to the RORs.

262
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,513
The what?

263
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,883
Roar Omega Roar. The top
fraternity on campus.

264
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,985
They only accept
the highly elite.

265
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,655
Okay, I'll lift the
bed, you grab the pig.

266
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,156
Ready? One, two, three. What?
No, no... Oh! What...

267
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,658
That's it. Don't let go.

268
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,624
Careful. He's a biter.

269
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,162
<i>- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!</i>

270
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,500
I got him!

271
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,800
Uh-oh! Whoa!

272
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,973
That was awesome!

273
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,776
What am I doing? James P.
Sullivan.

274
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,078
Mike Wazowski.

275
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,246
Listen, it was quite
delightful meeting you

276
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,981
and whatever that is,

277
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,617
but if you don't mind, I
have to study my Scaring.

278
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:05,551
You don't need to
study Scaring.

279
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,487
You just do it.

280
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,889
Really? I think there's a
little more to it than that.

281
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,224
But, hey, thanks
for stopping by.

282
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,157
Let go of that!

283
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,560
My hat! My pig!

284
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,229
Ooh!

285
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,633
Hey! Come here!

286
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,900
Hey!

287
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,768
Catch it!

288
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,574
Ooh! Yeah!

289
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,908
Ride it to frat row!

290
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,081
<i>♪ Tentacles and serpent's
wings, they... ♪</i>

291
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:35,947
Hey!

292
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,817
Whoa... Ow!

293
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,624
Wow!

294
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,762
Whoa!

295
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,900
Go, go, go!

296
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,101
Hey...

297
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,069
Come on! Hey! Ooh!

298
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,637
Cupcake?

299
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,641
Whoa...

300
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,685
Ooh!

301
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,227
Got it!

302
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,733
Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules!

303
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,001
M-U! M-U! M-U!

304
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,880
Did you see him
catch that pig?

305
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:43,015
You are Jaws Theta Chi
material, freshman.

306
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,083
Oh, thanks. I don't know...

307
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,185
No, no, no. He's
an Omega Howl guy.

308
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,219
Back off. We saw him first.

309
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,055
No way. We did!

310
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,722
I'll take it from
here, gentlemen.

311
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,626
Johnny Worthington, president
of Roar Omega Roar.

312
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,929
What's your name, big Blue?

313
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,131
Jimmy Sullivan. Friends
call me Sulley.

314
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,801
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

315
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,202
I can't believe it!
That is crazy!

316
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,204
Chet, calm down. I'm sorry.

317
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,240
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

318
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,910
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

319
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:13,346
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

320
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,749
Slow down, squirt. This party
is for Scare students only.

321
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,018
Oh, sorry, killer, but you
might want to hang out

322
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,620
with someone a little
more your speed.

323
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,122
Uh... They look fun!

324
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,024
Oh, hey there. Want
to join Oozma Kappa?

325
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:25,657
We have cake.

326
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,330
Go crazy.

327
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,633
Is that a joke?

328
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,268
Sulley, talk to your friend.

329
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,005
Oh, he's not really
my friend, but sure.

330
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,007
You heard him. This is a
party for Scare students.

331
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,808
I am a Scare student.

332
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,644
I mean for Scare
students who actually,

333
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:47,013
you know, have a chance.

334
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,081
Aw, snap!

335
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,851
My chances are just
as good as yours.

336
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,532
You're not even in the
same league with me.

337
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,388
Just wait, hotshot.

338
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:57,923
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

339
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,604
Oh, okay. I'd
like to see that.

340
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,794
Oh, don't worry. You will.

341
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,236
Ready position.

342
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:12,138
Common crouch.

343
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:16,142
I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
Basic snarl.

344
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,077
Show me some slobber.

345
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,011
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.

346
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,916
Now here is a monster who
looks like a Scarer.

347
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,887
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

348
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,568
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

349
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,950
Yeah!

350
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,251
Give me another one.

351
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,886
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.

352
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,154
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.

353
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,290
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.

354
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,132
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

355
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,494
Go Monsters U! You
know what to do!

356
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,273
The answer is C, fangs.

357
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,975
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

358
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,044
A bowl of spiders! Correct!

359
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:27,179
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.

360
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,048
Warts, boils, and
moles, in that order.

361
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,130
Outstanding!

362
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,162
Ah! Whoa!

363
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

364
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,191
Ah!

365
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,401
Ogre slump.

366
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,869
Zombie snarl.

367
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,030
Dominant silver back gorilla.

368
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,073
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

369
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,945
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

370
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,362
A Tauntaun grimace
with extra slobber.

371
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,565
You got it! That's
what I'm saying.

372
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:55,201
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

373
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,336
Yes, you are, big Blue.

374
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,004
Hey, wait. What
are you guys...

375
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,573
It's just a precaution.

376
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,209
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

377
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,977
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

378
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,046
Wooh-hoo! I am on a roll.

379
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,881
I'm going to destroy that guy.

380
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,950
Well, then you'll get
this back right away.

381
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,418
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

382
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,860
Today's final will judge your
ability to assess a child's fear

383
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:24,495
and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.

384
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,105
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised

385
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:36,041
from Bed-wetter
to Heavy Sleeper,

386
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,978
so give it everything
you've got.

387
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,413
Dean Hardscrabble is
with us this morning

388
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,414
to see who will be moving
on in the Scaring program

389
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,582
and who will not.

390
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,425
Let's get started.

391
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,427
I am a five-year-old girl afraid
of spiders and Santa Claus.

392
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,529
Which Scare do you use?

393
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,465
Uh...

394
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,558
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.

395
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:07,639
Demonstrate.

396
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,518
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

397
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,221
Focus.

398
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:24,589
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

399
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,039
Hey. Do you mind?

400
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:42,727
Don't mind at all.

401
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,080
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.

402
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,953
Stay out of my way.

403
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,454
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

404
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,058
That's because you
don't belong here.

405
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,302
That's what I thought.

406
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,253
Whoa! Whoa...

407
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,734
I'm so sorry.

408
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,335
It was an accident.

409
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,472
What? This?

410
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,474
My one souvenir from a
lifetime of Scaring?

411
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,280
Accidents happen, don't they.

412
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,415
The important thing
is no one got hurt.

413
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,845
You're taking this
remarkably well.

414
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,656
Now, let's continue the exams.

415
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,325
Mr. Wazowski, I'm a
five-year-old girl

416
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,361
on a farm in Kansas
afraid of lightning.

417
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:43,428
Which Scare do you use?

418
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,765
Shouldn't I go up on the...

419
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,599
Which Scare do you use?

420
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,438
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

421
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,304
Demonstrate.

422
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,609
Stop. Thank you. But
I didn't get to...

423
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,743
I've seen enough.

424
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,846
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

425
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,552
I wasn't finished.

426
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:08,821
I don't need to know any
of that stuff to scare.

427
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:11,457
That "stuff" would've
informed you

428
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:15,094
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

429
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,596
So a roar wouldn't make him
scream, it would make him cry,

430
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,399
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

431
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,234
destroying life as we know it,

432
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,236
and of course we
can't have that.

433
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:26,205
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

434
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,841
in the Scaring program.
Good day.

435
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:31,643
Wait, what? But
I'm a Sullivan.

436
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,579
Well then, I'm sure your family

437
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,279
will be very disappointed.

438
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,366
And, Mr. Wazowski, what
you lack is something

439
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,633
that cannot be taught.

440
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,636
You're not scary.

441
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,808
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

442
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,218
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

443
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,316
Surprise me? I doubt
that very much.

444
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,526
<i>Welcome back.</i>

445
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,433
<i>I hope everyone had
a pleasant break.</i>

446
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,908
Some say that a career as a
scream-can designer is boring,

447
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,877
unchallenging, a waste of
a monster's potential.

448
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:46,485
Open your textbooks
to chapter three.

449
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,421
We will now plunge
into the rich history

450
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:50,421
of scream-can design.

451
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,469
Out of my way!

452
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:40,972
Coming through! Oh, sorry.
Ha-ha!

453
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,945
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

454
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,713
<i>The Scare Game! Yeah!</i>

455
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:56,488
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

456
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,689
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

457
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,492
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

458
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,530
<i>As a student, I
created these games</i>

459
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,797
<i>as a friendly competition,</i>

460
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,901
<i>but be prepared.</i>

461
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,837
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

462
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,538
<i>you must be the most
fearsome monsters on campus.</i>

463
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:20,379
<i>So good luck, and may
the best monsters win.</i>

464
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,682
<i>Alright everybody, we're closing down signup,
so we'll see you all...</i>

465
00:31:23,683 --> 00:31:24,548
Wait!

466
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:27,752
I'm signing up!

467
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,055
What?

468
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,961
<i>Uh... You have to be in
a fraternity to compete.</i>

469
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:39,064
Behold the next winning
fraternity of the Scare Games,

470
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:43,367
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

471
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,671
Hi.

472
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:51,576
Mr. Wazowski, what
are you doing?

473
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,012
You just said the winners are the
most fearsome monsters on campus.

474
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:56,081
If I win, it means you
kicked out the best Scarer

475
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,816
in the whole school.

476
00:31:57,817 --> 00:31:58,649
That won't happen.

477
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,920
How about a little wager?

478
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,588
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

479
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,092
And what would that prove?

480
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:09,960
That you were wrong.

481
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,901
Very well.

482
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:19,004
If you win, I will
let your entire team

483
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,471
into the Scare program.

484
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,344
But if you lose,

485
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,977
you will leave
Monsters University.

486
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,984
Deal.

487
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:36,421
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

488
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,556
We need six guys, right?

489
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,424
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

490
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,992
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

491
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,897
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

492
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,466
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late.

493
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,800
Can I squeeze by you? Randy!

494
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,902
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

495
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,071
Oh. Sorry. I'm
already on a team.

496
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,639
Boggs.

497
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,775
I'm finally in with
the cool kids, Mike.

498
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:57,908
Don't blow this for me.

499
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,646
Do the thing.

500
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,615
Oh! Where did he go?

501
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:04,883
Please, anybody.

502
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:07,486
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

503
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,421
<i>Yeah, sorry.
Doesn't look good.</i>

504
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:11,456
<i>We have to move on. Your
team doesn't qualify.</i>

505
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,523
Yes, it does!

506
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,995
The star player
has just arrived.

507
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:20,399
No way! Someone else! Please!
Anyone else.

508
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,840
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?</i>

509
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,324
Come on! Let's go!

510
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:29,807
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.

511
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:31,976
Good luck.

512
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,947
All right, Wazowski,
what's the plan?

513
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,823
This is a fraternity house?

514
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,925
Hey there, teammates!
Come on aboard!

515
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,863
As the president
of Oozma Kappa,

516
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,764
it is my honor to welcome
you to your new home.

517
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,603
We call this room
"Party Central."

518
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,172
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

519
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,106
But when we do, we'll be ready!

520
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,081
Wooh!

521
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:13,618
The hot cocoa train is
coming through! Whoa!

522
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,587
Next stop... You!

523
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,856
I would like to start
us off first by...

524
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:20,625
So, you guys are
Scaring majors?

525
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:23,762
We were! None of us
lasted very long.

526
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:26,832
I guess we just weren't what old
Hardscrabble was looking for.

527
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,466
Don Carlton, mature student.

528
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,170
Thirty years in the
textile industry

529
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,473
and then old dandy
Don got downsized.

530
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,508
Figured I could throw
myself a pity party,

531
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:38,610
or go back to school and
learn the computers.

532
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:40,612
Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...

533
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:43,181
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

534
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,749
And I'm not.

535
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,852
Five, six, seven, eight!

536
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,954
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

537
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:51,223
Because we never
agreed to do this!

538
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:52,591
You said this was
going to be cool!

539
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:53,925
No one said this
was gonna be cool.

540
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,026
Now I'm embarrassed. Now
you're embarrassed?

541
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,928
Yes, because it's
in front of people!

542
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,796
You should wake up embarrassed.

543
00:34:57,797 --> 00:34:59,698
Hey, hey, hey!

544
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,734
I'm Art! New Age
philosophy major.

545
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:04,455
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

546
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,704
and cry with you.

547
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,915
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

548
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,513
Guess that leaves me. Ah!

549
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:15,947
My name's Scott Squibbles.

550
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,682
My friends call me Squishy.

551
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,985
I'm undeclared, unattached,

552
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:24,656
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

553
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,658
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

554
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,561
So, basically, you guys
have no Scaring experience?

555
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,797
Not a lot! But now
we've got you!

556
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,900
You're about the scariest
fella I've ever seen.

557
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,101
Even with them pink polka dots.

558
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,236
Aw, thanks.

559
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:39,971
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

560
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,740
Your hands are as
big as my face!

561
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,308
He's like a Mountain with fur!

562
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,844
Oh, come on. I don't
even work out.

563
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:50,115
<i>- Yeah, me neither.
- I don't want to get too big.</i>

564
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:53,018
We thought our dreams were
over, but Mike said if we win,

565
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,586
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.

566
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,721
We're going to be real Scarers!

567
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,590
The best! You betcha!

568
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,657
Yeah! Right.

569
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,096
And here's what you've
been waiting for, fellas.

570
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:06,697
Your very own Oozma
Kappa bedroom.

571
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,336
Oh... Great! We're
sharing this room?

572
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,572
We'll let you guys get settled.

573
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:15,907
Anything you need, you just
give a big holler-oonie!

574
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:18,977
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

575
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,145
Look, they don't
need to be good.

576
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm going to carry
the whole team.

577
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:24,182
Really? And who's
going to carry you?

578
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,617
Hey, if you want to go
back to can design,

579
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:26,699
you know where the door is.

580
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:30,588
Great.

581
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,857
Guys?

582
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,126
Anybody home?

583
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,835
Um...

584
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:44,902
Hello?

585
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:46,770
Fellas?

586
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:56,181
Do you pledge your souls

587
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:58,149
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

588
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,184
Ow! Do you swear to

589
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:00,652
keep secret...

590
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:01,786
all that you learn here?

591
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,088
No matter how horrifying?

592
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,691
Hey!

593
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,226
Will you take the
sacred oath of the...

594
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,395
For crying out loud. Sweetie!

595
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,297
Turn the lights on while
you're down here!

596
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,199
You're going to ruin your eyes!

597
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,102
Mom! We're doing
an initiation!

598
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,938
Oh, scary. Well, carry on.

599
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,940
Just pretend I'm not here.

600
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:22,862
This is my Mom's house.

601
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,917
Do you promise to look
out for your brothers...

602
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,315
no matter what the peril?

603
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,189
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

604
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,259
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

605
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,195
From evils both
great and small?

606
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:45,863
In the face of
unending pain and...

607
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,101
Oh, forget it! You're in.

608
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,903
Look, we know we're
no one's first choice

609
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:53,405
for a fraternity,

610
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:55,807
so it means a lot to
have you here with us.

611
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:59,043
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

612
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,855
Time for a celebration! Yeah!

613
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,390
Grab the couch
cushions, gentlemen,

614
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:13,724
because we're building a fort!

615
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
Mom, can we stay
up late tonight?

616
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,380
Mmm, I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

617
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:38,916
Yuck!

618
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,486
Mom! What are you doing?

619
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,388
Your grubby paw was in my bed!

620
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,789
Were you kissing my hand?

621
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,759
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

622
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,726
I don't shed. Really.

623
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,262
Uh...

624
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:52,430
Excuse me. I just
want to get my stuff.

625
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,265
Would you just... Oh, hey.
Come on!

626
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,366
Let me get my stuff!

627
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,734
My butt!

628
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,271
First morning in the house.

629
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:02,140
That's going in the album!

630
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:03,341
Guys! We got a letter!

631
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,076
A letter?

632
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,745
We never get mail.

633
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:07,946
Oh! Sorry. It's stuck.

634
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:09,247
Would you... Give me that!

635
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:11,783
Tentacles. They're sticky.

636
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,751
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

637
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,455
"A child's room is
where you scare,"

638
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:20,391
"but avoid the toxicity
lurking there."

639
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,152
Wait a minute. Where do
they want us to meet?

640
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,034
Of all the sewers on campus, this
one has always been my favorite.

641
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,503
Art, you've been here before?

642
00:39:31,504 --> 00:39:33,504
I have a life outside
of the house, you know.

643
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:39,077
Welcome to your
worst nightmare,

644
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,310
the Scare Games!

645
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,528
Scare Games! Scare Games!

646
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,524
Yes! Yes, I love it!

647
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,857
I love this energy!

648
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,228
Okay. Okay, everybody.

649
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,898
Let's hear it for the
frats and sororities

650
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,800
competing in this
year's games...

651
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,167
Jaws Theta Chi!

652
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,138
Python Nu Kappa!

653
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,305
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

654
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,575
Roar Omega Roar!

655
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,344
Eta Hiss Hiss!

656
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,515
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

657
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,987
Yay! Wooh-hoo!

658
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,491
Hi, Mom!

659
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,825
Smile!

660
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:31,896
Let's begin the
first competition,

661
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,263
the Toxicity Challenge!

662
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,369
Human children are toxic!

663
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,073
And anything they
touch is toxic.

664
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:44,142
We don't have any human toys,

665
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:46,511
but thanks to MU's
biology department,

666
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,045
we found a close second,

667
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,114
the stinging glow urchin!

668
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:55,453
Trust me when I say,

669
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,322
you are not gonna want
to touch this bad boy!

670
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:59,257
I want to touch it.

671
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:01,499
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

672
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,865
Yeah, I want to touch them.

673
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:09,033
This is the starting line.

674
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,370
The light at the end of the
tunnel is the finish line.

675
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:15,138
And whoever comes in last is
eliminated from the games.

676
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,877
Mike... What is it?

677
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,044
Does that mean if
we lose, we're out?

678
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,546
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!

679
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,281
Squishy. We're not
going to lose,

680
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:26,283
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

681
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,920
Heart.

682
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,388
No! Me. I'm going to
win the race for us.

683
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,157
All right, all right.
That's very cute,

684
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:37,228
It's an obstacle course. What are
you going to do? Roar at it?

685
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,030
I can get through faster
than you, little guy.

686
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,967
Take your place at
the starting line!

687
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:44,301
This is all about teamwork.

688
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,937
Everybody, stick together.

689
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,475
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

690
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:52,176
Get ready to eat my dust.

691
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,545
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

692
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,448
Attention, teams.
One last thing.

693
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,049
Scarers work in the dark.

694
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,984
I want to go home!
On your marks...

695
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,094
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.

696
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,263
Thanks! We're going
to rip you to pieces!

697
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,064
What?

698
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,161
Get set...

699
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,571
Go!

700
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,532
I'm going to touch them!

701
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,153
Ow!

702
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:36,086
Come on!

703
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,304
Uh, guys! We're falling
behind a little! Fellas!

704
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:45,096
Cheese and crackers!

705
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:46,698
Son of a mustache!

706
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:49,000
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

707
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,301
Is that as fast as you can go?

708
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,582
Just getting started!
What the...

709
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,173
Whoa! Ah!

710
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,041
Oh... Ah!

711
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:00,243
That's got to hurt!

712
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,684
Ow, ow, ow...

713
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,386
Ooh! Terry!

714
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:09,987
Don't worry, we'll be fi...

715
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,002
Ha-ha!

716
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,072
Oh...

717
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,574
Uh-oh. Yikes!

718
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:31,341
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...

719
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,888
Roar Omega Roar wins!

720
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,731
Take that, Wazowski!

721
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,600
Are you delirious? I beat you!

722
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:56,600
Get your eye checked!

723
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,370
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!

724
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,139
Hey! Second place ain't bad.

725
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,306
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

726
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,375
What?

727
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:06,577
Your whole team has to
cross the finish line.

728
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:07,612
Third place, EEKs!

729
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,180
<i>- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.</i>

730
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:10,314
Fifth place, HSS!

731
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,716
No, no, no!

732
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,038
And in last place,

733
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,218
Oozma Kappa.

734
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,755
I can't feel my anything.

735
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,293
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

736
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,529
No.

737
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:32,570
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.

738
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:34,806
It would have taken a
miracle for you to...

739
00:44:34,807 --> 00:44:37,842
Attention, everyone. We
have an announcement.

740
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:40,343
Jaws Theta Chi has
been disqualified.

741
00:44:43,082 --> 00:44:46,284
The use of illegal protective
gel is 'cause for elimination.

742
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:47,350
What!

743
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,423
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

744
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,392
It's a miracle!

745
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,663
Your luck will run
out, eventually.

746
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,505
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

747
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,279
Okay! Listen up, Oozmas.

748
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,747
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

749
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,649
so that means I'm going to need

750
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,184
each of you guys to
pull your own weight.

751
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:21,819
Mike? What is it?

752
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,355
We've made a list of our
strengths and weaknesses.

753
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:27,191
In high school, I was the
master of the silent scare.

754
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,193
I could sneak up
on a field mouse

755
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,293
in a pillow factory.

756
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:33,497
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

757
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,268
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

758
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:39,536
We're experts in the ancient
craft of close-up magic.

759
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,441
It's all about misdirection.

760
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,812
Uh...

761
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:49,213
I have an extra toe.

762
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:51,582
Not with me, of course.

763
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,651
Guys, one slip-up on the next
event, and we're goners.

764
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:55,553
So for this to work,

765
00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:57,655
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have

766
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:58,777
and bury it deep, deep down.

767
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,625
Done.

768
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:01,459
From now on, we
are of one mind.

769
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,593
My mind.

770
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,595
Oh, please.

771
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,697
I will tell you exactly what
to do, and how to do it.

772
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,533
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.

773
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:10,334
All right. Give
me scary steps.

774
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,336
Fifty up and down, right now.
Let's go!

775
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,839
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

776
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,742
We can't just
"get a new team"!

777
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:20,211
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

778
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:21,646
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

779
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:23,548
Oh, no, no. We are
not cheating.

780
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:25,650
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know,

781
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,732
leveling the playing field.

782
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,656
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

783
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,824
They're not exactly the
scariest group in the world.

784
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:36,326
Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish!
Make a wish!

785
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,300
This is not going to work.

786
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:43,601
Where are you going?
We're training.

787
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:45,403
I'm a Sullivan.

788
00:46:45,404 --> 00:46:47,238
That's not enough. You're
all over the place.

789
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,339
You're charging
ahead when you...

790
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,640
Bup, bup, bup!

791
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,642
You tell them what
to do but not me.

792
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:52,976
So long, Coach.

793
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,448
Okay, Oozmas...

794
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,285
Boy, we need to get you a Bell.

795
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:04,789
Listen up. "If a kid hears you
coming, they'll call Mom or Dad",

796
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,289
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

797
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,559
Huh?

798
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,894
In the next event, if even
one of us gets caught,

799
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,862
we're all out.

800
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,897
So remember, do
exactly what I do.

801
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,911
We are at the halfway point
of the second event,

802
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,778
and things are
getting interesting.

803
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:33,717
Got it.

804
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:36,933
Only two teams left.

805
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,856
Who will make it out
with their flag,

806
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,858
and who will be eliminated?

807
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,929
You do not want to get
caught by a kid's parent.

808
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,665
And in this event, you do
not want to get caught by

809
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:48,665
the librarian.

810
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,570
Quiet.

811
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,721
What's so scary about a
little old librarian?

812
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,686
I said, "Quiet."

813
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,647
Faster. Slow and steady.

814
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,316
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.

815
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:39,583
Slow and steady.

816
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:40,717
Slow and steady.

817
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,839
Sullivan! Sullivan!

818
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,739
Sullivan! Sullivan!

819
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:11,915
Hmm.

820
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,823
Whew!

821
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,466
Ooh!

822
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,645
No!

823
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,791
Five, six, seven, eight!

824
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:55,625
Look over here!

825
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,968
Is that legal? You better
believe it, mop top!

826
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:06,403
The only rule is
don't get caught.

827
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:10,173
Wooh!

828
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,781
<i>- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!</i>

829
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,454
Come and get me! Come and get me!
Wooh-hoo!

830
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:24,722
Guys, what are you doing?

831
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:25,723
They said don't let
her catch you.

832
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:27,792
But they didn't say how!

833
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:29,154
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Come on!

834
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,063
Whoa!

835
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:37,067
Whew!

836
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,803
We did it!

837
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:41,138
No, we didn't. We
forgot the flag!

838
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,105
Mike?

839
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,562
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!

840
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:47,912
How?

841
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:49,712
Misdirection.

842
00:50:56,655 --> 00:50:58,722
The EEKs have been eliminated

843
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:02,827
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

844
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:05,128
We're Okay! We're Okay!
We're Okay!

845
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:11,836
I've never felt so alive!

846
00:51:11,837 --> 00:51:13,170
We were awesome!

847
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,006
Okay, look. That
wasn't real Scaring.

848
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,174
It was better than
what you did.

849
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:18,536
You should've stuck
to my strategy.

850
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,044
Whatever.

851
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:21,685
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

852
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,016
Hey! You guys going
to the party?

853
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:27,885
Oh, I think you've
got the wrong guys.

854
00:51:27,886 --> 00:51:29,887
<i>- We don't get invited to...
- Party?</i>

855
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:32,122
The mid-games mixer
at the RORs'.

856
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,664
It's for the top Scare Teams.

857
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:35,725
You're one of us now right?

858
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,193
See you there!

859
00:51:38,797 --> 00:51:40,865
Did you hear that? I
can't believe it!

860
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:43,167
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.

861
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:45,869
They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
We're going!

862
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,942
Do young people still dance?

863
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,611
Because my moves are
a little rusty.

864
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,779
Oh, we forgot to bring
a hostess gift.

865
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,281
We can't go in there without
some scented candles.

866
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:00,784
Calm down. We earned this.

867
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,186
What if there's a lull
in the conversation?

868
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:03,954
I never know what to...
You know...

869
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:05,289
Say?

870
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,291
How are you so good at this?

871
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,093
You just took on an angry
50-foot librarian,

872
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:10,995
and you're afraid
of a little party?

873
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:12,562
Take a deep breath...

874
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:14,279
and in you go!

875
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,040
Hello.

876
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,176
It's Oozma Kappa!

877
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,578
These guys are crazy!

878
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,680
What you did today was insane!

879
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:31,214
That was awesome!

880
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,820
Oozma Kappa, tonight
we party like Scarers!

881
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,146
I've never stayed up
this late in my life!

882
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,387
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

883
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:20,858
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.

884
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:23,293
All right. On
behalf of the RORs,

885
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:26,229
we'd like to congratulate all the
teams that have made it this far.

886
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:29,953
All, right, let's
hear it for the PNKs!

887
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,969
I love that trick! Never gets old.
HSS!

888
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,140
Very creepy.

889
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:39,442
And finally, the surprise
team of the Scare Games,

890
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,818
Oozma Kappa!

891
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,317
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

892
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:48,951
I thought you were a
bunch of nobodies.

893
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,056
But, boy, was I wrong.

894
00:54:52,057 --> 00:54:54,091
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

895
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:55,959
Oozma Kappa!

896
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,993
Oh!

897
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,264
What?

898
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:02,899
The most adorable
monsters on campus.

899
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,737
Ooh! Oh!

900
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,743
Release the stuffed animals.

901
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,248
Faced!

902
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:27,958
<i>- Don't worry.
- Nobody reads the school paper.</i>

903
00:55:27,959 --> 00:55:29,719
Yeah, but I'm pretty
sure they read the quad.

904
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:42,405
Wooh-hoo!

905
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,413
Thank you very much.

906
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:50,481
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

907
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:51,522
Thanks. Tell your friends.

908
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,885
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

909
00:55:54,886 --> 00:55:56,053
Raising a little
money for charity.

910
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:58,088
Yeah? Well, stop it.

911
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,011
You want us to stop raising
money for charity?

912
00:55:59,024 --> 00:55:59,957
That's not cool.

913
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,259
This guy hates charity!

914
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,028
I want you to stop making
us look like fools.

915
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,765
Hey, you're making
yourselves look like fools.

916
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:09,399
Let's be honest, boys.

917
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,401
You're never going
to be real Scarers,

918
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:14,103
because real Scarers
look like us.

919
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:20,110
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

920
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:22,311
they're always hiring
in the mail room.

921
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,085
Guys, hold on!

922
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,457
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

923
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,092
We just need to keep trying.

924
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:37,394
No, you need to stop trying!

925
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,930
You can train monsters
like this all you want,

926
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:41,252
but you can't change
who they are.

927
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,072
Mike...

928
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,941
We appreciate everything
you've done, but he's right.

929
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,480
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

930
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,083
We're built

931
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,601
for other things.

932
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:17,868
Sorry, squirt!

933
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,989
Some monsters just aren't cut
out for the big leagues.

934
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,507
The big leagues.

935
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,309
Guys.

936
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:29,873
We're going on a
little field trip.

937
00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:41,959
My tentacle fell asleep.

938
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,560
Thanks, Mom. Have fun, kids!

939
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,862
I'll just be here
listening to my tunes.

940
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,337
Hey, uh, where are we?

941
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:54,470
The big leagues.

942
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,581
Holy roly-poly.

943
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:05,883
Wow.

944
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:07,484
Nice fence.

945
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,651
This is amazing, Mike.

946
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,020
We're not stopping here.

947
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,615
This is crazy. We're
going to get arrested!

948
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:33,677
Oh, wow.

949
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:34,945
Whoa...

950
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:36,480
Oh!

951
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:38,649
<i>All Scare Floors now active.</i>

952
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,617
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

953
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,455
Look at them.

954
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,057
They're going into
the human world,

955
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:48,524
and they don't
even look scared!

956
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:53,597
Wow.

957
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:56,233
Take a good look, fellas.

958
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:57,514
See what they all
have in common?

959
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,472
Uh... No, not really.

960
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:06,410
Exactly. There's no
one type of Scarer.

961
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:08,692
The best Scarers use their
differences to their advantage.

962
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,982
Wow.

963
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,416
Terri? Look.

964
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,257
Hey!

965
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:22,960
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

966
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:26,063
Don, that old fella is Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!

967
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:28,699
What? Where?
That's really him?

968
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,034
He held the Scare
Record for three years!

969
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:33,170
Oh! Third door from the end!

970
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:35,539
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

971
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,041
Look! It's "Screaming"
Bob Gunderson!

972
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:39,710
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!

973
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:41,211
Doesn't have the speed
anymore, but his

974
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:43,045
technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.

975
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,283
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

976
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:48,552
Yep. 450 of them.

977
00:59:48,553 --> 00:59:51,421
Impressive. I have 6,000
still in mint condition,

978
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,223
but, you know, 450
is pretty good, too.

979
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:55,292
Hey, look at me! I'm Earl
"The Terror" Thompson!

980
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:56,426
Whoa!

981
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,562
Oh, that's great!

982
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,096
That's a pretty
good one, Squish.

983
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,301
I've been a real jerk.

984
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,104
So have I.

985
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:11,387
But it's not too late.

986
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,245
We could be a great team.

987
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:16,766
We just need to start
working together.

988
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:20,597
Hey!

989
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,772
What are you doing up there?

990
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,553
I can't go back to jail!

991
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,127
Come on!

992
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,327
They're right behind us!

993
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,232
Get back here!

994
01:00:43,241 --> 01:00:44,775
Up there! Get them!

995
01:00:44,776 --> 01:00:46,642
Wooh-hoo-hoo!

996
01:00:48,546 --> 01:00:49,867
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.

997
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:56,620
I'm fine, really! It's just
a little heart attack.

998
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:58,487
Aw... I want a piece
of that action!

999
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,767
Mom! Start the car!

1000
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,305
What? Start the car!

1001
01:01:15,306 --> 01:01:16,840
Stop the bar?

1002
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,842
The car! Start the car!

1003
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,476
Oh! Okay.

1004
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:23,713
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1005
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:25,348
Get in! Get in!

1006
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,749
Mom, go! Seat belts.

1007
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,352
Okay, go!

1008
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,353
Does anyone want gum?

1009
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,220
Just drive!

1010
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,189
Okay. Here we go!

1011
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,130
Oh, yeah! Let's break
in somewhere else!

1012
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:07,390
Rise and shine!

1013
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,127
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

1014
01:02:10,128 --> 01:02:11,760
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

1015
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,198
Wake up!

1016
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,900
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

1017
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:18,468
Do I hear thirty-nine?

1018
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:20,170
Come on!

1019
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:22,131
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

1020
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,408
"To frighten a child is
the point of a Scare."

1021
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:28,411
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

1022
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,493
Okay, scare the little kid.

1023
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:31,922
Avoid the teenager!

1024
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,555
I'm on the phone!

1025
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:41,824
No one understands me!

1026
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,360
Whatever.

1027
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,500
But, Daddy, I love him!

1028

"Stay hidden, take cover,

1035
01:03:16,594 --> 01:03:17,660
You got 10 seconds. Go!

1036
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:24,467
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

1037
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,669
And there should be one more.

1038
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,238
How did I do?

1039
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,606
Oh! Not too shabby, Don!

1040
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:32,442
Thanks! I cannot get down.

1041
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:33,643
Zombie snarl!

1042
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,779
Angry poodle. Jazz clown.

1043
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,646
My Aunt Phyllis.

1044
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:37,948
In the morning.

1045
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,149
That's what I'm talking about!

1046
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,360
Time to go to work.

1047
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,649
You're out!

1048
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:16,585
You're out.

1049
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,590
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

1050
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:33,602
Thank you.

1051
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:38,507
Yeah!

1052
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,644
Yeah!

1053
01:04:40,645 --> 01:04:43,046
<i>We're down to O
remaining team,</i>

1054
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,581
<i>Roar Omega Rr and Oozma Ka!</i>

1055
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,553
Which leads us to
the final event!

1056
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,456
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test."

1057
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:56,860
"The Scare Simulator will
prove who's the best!"

1058
01:04:56,861 --> 01:04:59,462
Tomorrow night you
finally get to Scare

1059
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:01,298
in front of the whole school!

1060
01:05:01,299 --> 01:05:04,534
Enjoy the attention
while it lasts, boys.

1061
01:05:04,535 --> 01:05:08,038
After you lose, no one
will remember you.

1062
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:11,340
Maybe. But when you lose, no
one will let you forget it.

1063
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,644
Oh, boy. That is a good point.

1064
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,948
Hey, Oozmas, you
guys are awesome!

1065
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,051
You've got to teach
us your moves.

1066
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,953
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

1067
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,922
Oh... Sure, I can teach you.

1068
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,691
All right. You want to
hide behind the chair?

1069
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:28,852
You have to become the chair.

1070
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,320
Thanks for coming, Dean.

1071
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,564
Dean Hardscrabble!

1072
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:37,033
If we get back into
the Scaring program,

1073
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38,274
I hope there's no
hard feelings.

1074
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,540
Tomorrow, each of
you must prove

1075
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,607
that you are undeniably scary.

1076
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,379
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

1077
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,355
No. He works harder
than anyone.

1078
01:05:58,356 --> 01:05:59,889
Do you think he's scary?

1079
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,458
He's the heart and
soul of the team!

1080
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:02,891
Do you think he's scary?

1081
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:18,842
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

1082
01:06:18,843 --> 01:06:20,523
We'll finally have our
lives back on track.

1083
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,013
Hey, Mike?

1084
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:27,083
You know, you've given me a
lot of really great tips.

1085
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:29,486
I'd love to return
the favor sometime.

1086
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,120
Oh. Yeah, sure. Anytime.

1087
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,558
We're doing this now? Okay.

1088
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,760
You've memorized
every textbook,

1089
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:38,661
every Scare Theory,
and that is great.

1090
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,130
Hey!

1091
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:42,065
But now it's time
to forget all that.

1092
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:45,135
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1093
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:47,036
Huh. Just feel it.

1094
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:48,938
Exactly. Go wild.

1095
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:50,819
I don't know. I've kind
of got my own technique.

1096
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:51,874
Give it a try.

1097
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:55,537
Good, but bigger!

1098
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,114
Nope. You're thinking again.

1099
01:06:58,115 --> 01:06:59,883
From the gut!

1100
01:06:59,884 --> 01:07:00,849
Let the animal out!

1101
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,086
Come on! Dig deep!

1102
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:08,424
Boys! It's a school night!

1103
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,428
So, how was that?

1104
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:14,897
Up top. Ha-ha!

1105
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,535
You know, it did
feel different!

1106
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,203
I feel like it's all
coming together.

1107
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,839
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole
school is finally going to see

1108

1126
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,868
Okay, just like we planned. I'll go first.
Then, Don...

1127
01:08:24,869 --> 01:08:27,504
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1128
01:08:27,505 --> 01:08:29,865
and I think it's only right if
he's the one who finishes it.

1129
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,187
I think you should go last.

1130
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,909
Yes!

1131
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:33,950
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

1132
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,981
All right. Don, you
okay going first?

1133
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:39,748
I guess I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.

1134
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,019
Oozma Kappa!

1135
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,787
Go Oozmas!

1136
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,623
I'm gonna do it. I'm
going to beat this guy.

1137
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:49,258
Hey, Bruiser! You take
it easy on grandpa.

1138
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,528
Unleash the beast, Don!

1139
01:08:53,196 --> 01:08:54,563
Okay, then.

1140
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:43,211
Huh? Huh?

1141
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,049
Thanks for taking
it easy on grandpa.

1142
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,610
<i>Next group to the
starting line.</i>

1143
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:57,225
Let's do this.

1144
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:06,935
Yes! Yeah!

1145
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,694
Come on, Art. Come on, buddy.

1146
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:32,935
You can do it.

1147
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,040
Yes!

1148
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,310
Aw!

1149
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,350
<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

1150
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:06,762
You got this, Sull.

1151
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,989
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

1152
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,393
<i>Ah! Tough break for the RORs.</i>

1153
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:38,226
Huh? Hearts?

1154
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,730
Huh?

1155
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:41,412
Way to go, Boggs!

1156
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,233
Yay!

1157
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,306
That's the last time I
lose to you, Sullivan.

1158
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:52,841
<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

1159
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,450
Hey.

1160
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:01,691
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

1161
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:05,455
Don't worry about anyone else.

1162
01:12:05,456 --> 01:12:07,989
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1163
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:11,460
Thanks.

1164
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:24,107
Don't take the loss too hard.

1165
01:12:24,108 --> 01:12:25,348
You never belonged here anyway.

1166
01:12:54,004 --> 01:12:58,441
<i>Amazing performance
by Worthington!</i>

1167
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:00,442
<i>- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!</i>

1168
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,013
<i>The Oozmas will need
a record-breaking.</i>

1169
01:13:04,014 --> 01:13:05,480
<i>Scare to win this.</i>

1170
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,986
<i>You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.</i>

1171
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:12,488
<i>- No one will remember you.</i>
<i>- You're not scary.</i>

1172
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,790
<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

1173
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,831
Yeah!

1174
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,903
<i>They did it!</i>

1175
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:48,023
Yeah! Hey!

1176
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,227
We're in the Scare program!
Yeah!

1177
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,467
Come here, you son of a gun!

1178
01:13:58,468 --> 01:13:59,869
Way to go!

1179
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,204
Yeah!

1180
01:14:01,205 --> 01:14:03,072
Oh! A little stuck.

1181
01:14:03,073 --> 01:14:04,507
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.

1182
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,508
It's Sherrie.

1183
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,345
We did it!

1184
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,419
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

1185
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,353
Thank you! Thanks a lot.

1186
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:19,121
You rule!

1187
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,623
I have never ruled before.

1188
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,291
You guys killed it out there!

1189
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,426
Awesome!

1190
01:14:23,427 --> 01:14:25,026
Hey, Wazowski!

1191
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:28,783
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.

1192
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:30,932
Mike?

1193
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:32,534
I did it.

1194
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,337
I can't believe it.

1195
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,508
I'm going to be a Scarer!

1196
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,244
Yeah, yes, you are.

1197
01:14:41,245 --> 01:14:43,346
You hear that? Get
plenty of rest, kiddo.

1198
01:14:43,347 --> 01:14:46,214
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

1199
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:57,193
I knew I was scary. I didn't
know I was that scary.

1200
01:14:57,194 --> 01:14:59,295
Yeah, we're so scary
I guess we broke it.

1201
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:00,395
Come on.

1202
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,577
It's been tampered with.

1203
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:16,538
Uh, I don't think you should
be messing with that.

1204
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,980
Why are my settings different?

1205
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,916
Mike, we should leave.

1206
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,387
Did you do this? Mike.

1207
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:26,122
Did you do this?

1208
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:27,188
I...

1209
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,061
Yes, I did. But you
don't understand.

1210
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:34,563
Why? Why did you do this?

1211
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:36,565
You know, just in case.

1212
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:37,432
In case of what?

1213
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,576
You don't think I'm scary.

1214
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:43,606
Mike...

1215
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:44,728
You said you believed in me.

1216
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,143
But you're just
like Hardscrabble.

1217
01:15:47,144 --> 01:15:48,644
You're just like everyone else!

1218
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:50,079
Look, you'll get
better and better...

1219
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,481
I'm as scary as you! I'm
as scary as anyone!

1220
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:54,383
I just wanted to help. No.

1221
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:56,085
You just wanted
to help yourself.

1222
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:59,054
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1223
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:34,423
So your calculations
were a little off.

1224
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:36,625
That door took me all semester.

1225
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,946
It's too dangerous. The Professor's
just going to shred it.

1226
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:49,271
There he is, the big guy.

1227
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,006
The first of many
trophies, I am sure.

1228
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:53,690
Sullivan.

1229
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,479
Nice work out there.

1230
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,160
I look forward to having
you back in class.

1231
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:00,682
Hey, there he is!

1232
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,620
Looks like I was
wrong about you.

1233
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,522
You're one of us after all.

1234
01:17:06,523 --> 01:17:08,690
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, bro-ham!

1235
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:12,561
You are one of us now, okay?

1236
01:17:12,562 --> 01:17:14,296
Anytime you want
to come hang out

1237
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,537
and do whatever,
you got a crew.

1238
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:18,567
You're a ROR, buddy!

1239
01:17:18,568 --> 01:17:19,467
Hey!

1240
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:21,369
Where are you going?

1241
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,620
You did what?

1242
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:39,221
My team had nothing
to do with it.

1243
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:41,556
It was all me. I cheated.

1244
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,692
I expect you off
campus by tomorrow.

1245
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:47,362
Yes, ma'am.

1246
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:50,565
You're a disgrace
to this university

1247
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,835
and your family name.

1248
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,743
What's going on?

1249
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:02,278
Someone broke into
the door lab!

1250
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:03,111
What?

1251
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:07,282
Oh, no.

1252
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,457
Open the door!
Don't go in there!

1253
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:55,864
You look funny.

1254
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,501
What?

1255
01:19:05,142 --> 01:19:07,476
I'm so tired. What's going on?

1256
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:08,917
It's the middle of the night.

1257
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:10,411
A little funny green guy.

1258
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:25,160
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!

1259
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:29,697
James!

1260
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,704
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1261
01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:36,639
You don't think
that could be...

1262
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,773
It's Mike.

1263
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:38,855
But he could die out there!

1264
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:44,213
James, wait! We can help.

1265
01:19:44,214 --> 01:19:48,384
Leave it to the old
master of sales.

1266
01:19:48,385 --> 01:19:48,918
We got a call in, but
that's the best we can do.

1267
01:19:48,919 --> 01:19:50,686
Ahem!

1268
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:54,690
Don Carlton, sales. Folks,
today is your lucky day.

1269
01:19:54,691 --> 01:19:56,892
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1270
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,426
Arrest him. Pardon?

1271
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:00,829
Spread them, pops!

1272
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,298
Do you mind? Don't move!

1273
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:03,699
What? Sullivan!

1274
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,621
Don't you dare!

1275
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:06,689
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1276
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:15,310
Mike?

1277
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:18,814
Mike!

1278
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,683
The kids said they saw
something in the cabin.

1279
01:20:20,684 --> 01:20:21,617
They're calling it an alien.

1280
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:23,219
It was!

1281
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,486
I saw a little green guy!

1282
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,421
What's the problem, ma'am?

1283
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,529
Mike?

1284
01:20:38,368 --> 01:20:39,802
Bear! A bear in the camp!

1285
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:40,963
Call this in to headquarters.

1286
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,778
Down this way. All right?

1287
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:57,919
I heard something over here!

1288
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,257
Mike!

1289
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,300
Come on, buddy. Let's
get you out of here.

1290
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,769
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.

1291
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,941
You were right. They
weren't scared of me.

1292
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,614
I did everything right.

1293
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:26,914
I wanted it more than anyone.

1294
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:32,520
And I thought... I thought
if I wanted it enough,

1295
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:34,545
I could tell everybody that...

1296
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:37,358
That Mike Wazowski is
something special.

1297
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,296
And I'm just

1298
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:43,998
not.

1299
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,375
Look, Mike, I know
how you feel.

1300
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:54,977
Don't do that! Please,
don't do that!

1301
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:56,412
You do not know how I feel.

1302
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:58,380
Mike, calm down.

1303
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,482
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1304
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:02,751
You can mess up
over and over again

1305
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:04,486
and the whole world loves you.
Mike...

1306
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:05,854
You'll never know what
it's like to fail

1307
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:07,756
because you were
born a Sullivan!

1308
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:09,091
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.

1309
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:10,926
I'm the Sullivan who
flunked every test.

1310
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,695
The one who got kicked
out of the program,

1311
01:22:12,696 --> 01:22:14,763
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1312
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,465
that I cheated.

1313
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:17,398
And I lied.

1314
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:23,071
Mike, I'll never
know how you feel,

1315
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:26,847
but you're not the
only failure here.

1316
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:35,583
I act scary, Mike,
but most of the time

1317
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:38,519
I'm terrified.

1318
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,987
How come you never
told me that before?

1319
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:55,770
Because

1320
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:59,040
we weren't friends before.

1321
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,981
Check the lake!

1322
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:06,903
I heard something here!

1323
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:09,784
This way!

1324
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,058
I saw movement!

1325
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,726
Over there!

1326
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:35,476
Sulley!

1327
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:43,611
He's cornered!

1328
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:52,827
No!

1329
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:56,632
They're still in there!

1330
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:59,568
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1331
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:02,204
No! You can't do that! No!

1332
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:05,908
Enough! I want this
room cleared now!

1333
01:24:05,909 --> 01:24:07,230
You can't do this!

1334
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:19,961
We got to get out of here!

1335
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,026
Let them come. What?

1336
01:24:24,027 --> 01:24:25,828
If we scare them, I
mean really scare them,

1337
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:27,229
we could generate enough scream

1338
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,964
to power the door
from this side!

1339
01:24:28,965 --> 01:24:30,566
What are you talking about?

1340
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:31,700
I have read every book about
Scaring ever written.

1341
01:24:31,701 --> 01:24:33,035
This could work!

1342
01:24:33,036 --> 01:24:34,970
They're adults. I
can't do this.

1343
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:36,292
Yes, you can. Just
follow my lead.

1344
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:09,070
<i>Mama!</i>

1345
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,707
<i>Mama!</i>

1346
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,241
<i>Mama...</i>

1347
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,123
What the...

1348
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:34,929
Now what? Phase two.

1349
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,106
Keep together.

1350
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,212
Are you ready?

1351
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:52,281
Mike, I can't. Yes, you can.

1352
01:25:52,282 --> 01:25:53,922
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1353
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,552
Call for backup.

1354
01:25:56,553 --> 01:25:57,920
Assistance on the north side.

1355
01:25:57,921 --> 01:26:00,722
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1356
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,157
<i>Ranger, answer me,
what's your 20?</i>

1357
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,760
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1358
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,661
Look! What was it?

1359
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,995
Let's go.

1360
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:44,031
Sulley, come on!

1361
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,626
How?

1362
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:14,862
How did you do this?

1363
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:16,831
Don't ask me.

1364
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:27,643
Move, move, move! This
is a 54-23 in progress.

1365
01:27:27,644 --> 01:27:28,744
All right, everybody,
clear out.

1366
01:27:28,745 --> 01:27:30,412
Secure the perimeter.

1367
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:32,046
No child breach.
No child breach.

1368
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:34,650
You ruined our doors!

1369
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:36,785
I've been working on
my door all semester!

1370
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:37,853
Let's go, you two.

1371
01:27:37,854 --> 01:27:39,021
You're alive!

1372
01:27:39,022 --> 01:27:40,103
We are so glad you're safe.

1373
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,793
Hey, wait! What doing to be happening to them?

1374
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:50,198
That's for the university
president to decide.

1375
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:53,835
But you can be sure we'll
be watching these two.

1376
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:55,336
Always watching.

1377
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,176
Expelled?

1378
01:28:02,201 --> 01:28:04,145
Yeah, we really messed up.

1379
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:06,248
So, you're leaving?

1380
01:28:06,249 --> 01:28:08,115
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1381
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:11,420
Harsh, man.

1382
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:13,822
I'm sorry, guys. You'd be
in the Scaring program

1383
01:28:13,823 --> 01:28:15,023
right now if it wasn't for us.

1384
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,761
What?

1385
01:28:19,762 --> 01:28:21,963
Well, it is the
gosh-darnedest thing.

1386
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:23,331
Hard scrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1387
01:28:23,332 --> 01:28:25,200
What?

1388
01:28:25,201 --> 01:28:27,202
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.

1389
01:28:27,203 --> 01:28:29,471
She invited us to
join next semester!

1390
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:32,274
Congratulations, guys!

1391
01:28:32,275 --> 01:28:34,242
And that's not the only
piece of good news.

1392
01:28:34,243 --> 01:28:35,409
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1393
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,114
Oh. Who is Sherrie?

1394
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:41,016
She's my Mom.

1395
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:43,719
Well, if it isn't my
two favorite fellas!

1396
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,187
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1397
01:28:45,188 --> 01:28:45,953
Oh!

1398
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,724
Ugh! So uncomfortable.

1399
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:50,726
Oh, come on, Scott.

1400
01:28:50,727 --> 01:28:52,928
I don't want you to think
of me as your new Dad.

1401
01:28:52,929 --> 01:28:54,362
After all, we're
fraternity brothers first.

1402
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:56,164
This is so weird.

1403
01:28:56,165 --> 01:28:57,966
Just think of me as
your big brother

1404
01:28:57,967 --> 01:28:59,034
that's marrying your mother.

1405
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:00,469
Wait. Hold on.

1406
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:03,371
We're brothers who share
the same Mom slash wife.

1407
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:04,138
That's worse.

1408
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,948
Well, I guess we
should be going now.

1409
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:11,879
Promise me you'll
keep in touch.

1410
01:29:17,986 --> 01:29:20,106
You're the scariest bunch of
monsters I have ever met.

1411
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,426
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

1412
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,488
So, what now?

1413
01:29:56,458 --> 01:30:00,228
You know, for the first time in my
life, I don't really have a plan.

1414
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,797
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1415
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,314
I think it's time I leave the
greatness to other monsters.

1416
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,970
I'm okay just being okay.

1417
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:20,214
So long, Sull.

1418
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:22,817
So long.

1419
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:51,580
Wazowski!

1420
01:30:51,581 --> 01:30:53,214
Whoa! Stop the bus!

1421
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:55,950
Are you crazy?

1422
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,987
Mike,

1423
01:30:58,988 --> 01:31:01,356
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1424
01:31:01,357 --> 01:31:03,859
I know, everyone
sees us together,

1425
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:06,161
they think I'm the one running
the show, but the truth is,

1426
01:31:06,162 --> 01:31:09,264
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!

1427
01:31:09,265 --> 01:31:11,266
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.

1428
01:31:11,267 --> 01:31:13,435
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1429
01:31:13,436 --> 01:31:15,570
All I did was catch a pig!

1430
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:17,272
Technically, I caught the pig.

1431
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:20,442
Exactly! And you think
you're just okay?

1432
01:31:20,443 --> 01:31:22,978
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1433
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:25,146
That wasn't me! That was you!

1434
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:27,315
You think I could have
done that without you?

1435
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:29,517
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1436
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,322
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.

1437
01:31:34,323 --> 01:31:35,422
But you are fearless.

1438
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,462
And if Hardscrabble can't see
that, then she can just...

1439
01:31:40,463 --> 01:31:42,329
I can just what?

1440
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:47,434
Careful, Mr. Sullivan. I was
just warming up to you.

1441
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,370
Sorry.

1442
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,305
Well, gentlemen,

1443
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:55,576
it seems you made the
front page again.

1444
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:00,649
The two of you did
something together

1445
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:02,182
that no one has
ever done before.

1446
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:04,618
You surprised me.

1447
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:10,292
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises

1448
01:32:10,293 --> 01:32:11,358
like you in my program.

1449
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,931
But as far as the two
of you are concerned

1450
01:32:15,932 --> 01:32:17,412
there is nothing I
can do for you now.

1451
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:21,435
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1452
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:29,343
And, Mr. Wazowski, keep
surprising people.

1453
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,190
You know, there
is still one way

1454
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:43,431
we can work at a Scare company.

1455
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,029
They're always hiring
in the mail room.

1456
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:56,071
This is better than
I ever imagined!

1457
01:32:56,072 --> 01:32:58,306
I bet we break the all-time
record in our first year.

1458
01:32:58,307 --> 01:33:00,342
Mike, we're mail guys.

1459
01:33:00,343 --> 01:33:03,010
I know. I'm talking about the
record for letters delivered!

1460
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,682
All right, newbies,
quit goofing around.

1461
01:33:07,683 --> 01:33:09,985
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1462
01:33:09,986 --> 01:33:11,753
punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.

1463
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:13,521
We're right on
it, Mr. Snowman.

1464
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:15,290
The team of Wazowski
and Sullivan

1465
01:33:15,291 --> 01:33:17,058
are going to change the
world starting today!

1466
01:33:17,059 --> 01:33:18,193
Say scream!

1467
01:33:18,194 --> 01:33:19,026
Scream! Scream!

1468
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:05,240
Wazowski, good luck
on your first day!

1469
01:34:05,241 --> 01:34:06,341
Thanks, Merv.

1470
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:07,341
Good luck, Mike!

1471
01:34:07,366 --> 01:34:09,366
Thanks, fellas.

1472
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:16,183
You coming, Coach?

1473
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:19,053
You better believe it.

1474
01:43:00,074 --> 01:43:02,275
I made it! My first
day of class!

1475
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:07,280
Uh, the school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1476
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,017
Great.
