|CHIMP CHATTERS|

2
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:35,184
You lose.

3
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,418
Again.

4
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,742
I changed your flight sequence.

5
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:44,738
That's enough.

6
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,420
Pay attention.

7
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,776
Pericles, stop! Or no treat!

8
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,258
How well do I know you?

9
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:35,617
Hey, there you are.

10
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,975
Was the homo sapien mean to you?

11
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,501
We all know it's just rocket envy.

12
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:45,335
-Ever consider a boyfriend?
-Do I enjoy being miserable?

13
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,736
-I'll stick with my chimps.
LEO: Hey.

14
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,421
-I'm teaching him.
-You're teasing him.

15
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:59,460
He's gene-spliced, chromosome-
enhanced. He can handle it.

16
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:04,296
When you frustrate them, they lose
focus. They even get violent.

17
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:07,504
Hey, Pericles,
you're gonna be a daddy.

18
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:13,062
-Thought I saw a smirk on his face.
-The female was the aggressor.

19
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,461
Hey, Leo. You got a postcard.

20
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,375
Leo!

21
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,335
Leo!

22
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,812
It's been two years.
When are you coming home?

23
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,732
Not too quick.
I'm enjoying that apartment.

24
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,577
-No, we miss you!
-Are you flying yet?

25
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:35,538
-Or are the chimps doing the work?
-We got something to tell you.

26
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:40,176
When you gonna make
that kind of commitment--

27
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,980
MAN 1 : Captain Davidson,
report to the bridge.

28
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,619
FRANK: Found it.
HANSEN: It's moving like a storm.

29
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:22,496
It is. It's an electromagnetic storm.

30
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:26,298
LEO: The digital clocks are stopped.
MARIA: It's beautiful.

31
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:29,813
-So is the sun till you get close.
HANSEN: This is weird.

32
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:33,698
HANSEN: I hear frequency patterns.
-Tune them in.

33
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:39,178
HANSEN: It's electronic communication
from Earth, from all time.

34
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:42,062
HANSEN:
The storm's bouncing it back to us.

35
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,460
We'll start with a pass
through the core.

36
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:50,696
Take radiation gamma-ray reading.
Get your monkey ready.

37
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,781
Sir, this is a waste of time.

38
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,655
We have standard procedures--

39
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,782
-I'm aware of the procedures, but--
-No manned flights.

40
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:03,652
We send an ape. If it's safe,
we talk about a pilot.

41
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:06,741
Why don't you just allow me
to do my job?

42
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:11,255
He's the canary, that's the coal mine.
He launches at 1 6:00.

43
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:32,375
Just follow your sequence
and come home. Understand? Home.

44
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:46,892
VASICH: Stand by. Alpha pod launch
in 30 seconds.

45
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,935
VASICH: Chart his course
to the eye of the storm.

46
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:11,292
LEO:
Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.

47
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,419
LEO:
Activate reading systems.

48
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,302
LEO:
lgnition.

49
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,695
VASICH: Have him start
taking perimeter readings.

50
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,413
-What's wrong?
-He's off-course.

51
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:47,698
Lock on him.

52
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,901
He can't respond, sir.

53
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:56,540
-There's a surge in the heart rate.
-Light him up again.

54
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,501
I can't.

55
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,978
He's gone.

56
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:04,295
He's trained to come back.

57
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,099
You think he's still alive?

58
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:14,662
-Sir--
-For now, we just sit tight and wait.

59
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:20,101
I'm gonna run some sequences
to see what he did wrong.

60
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:31,053
HANSEN: The signal is breaking up.
VASICH: He must be panicking.

61
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,174
ALEXANDER:
He'll return to the Oberon.

62
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,776
HANSEN:
I can 't hold him.

63
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,621
VASICH:
That's it, we lost him.

64
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:40,458
FRANK: Wanna send up another chimp?
-It's too dangerous.

65
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,699
VASICH:
I won 't waste another pod.

66
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,332
VASICH:
Shut down launch operations.

67
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,216
Sir?

68
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,215
Delta pod has launched.

69
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:24,258
Your flight is not authorized!

70
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:26,215
I'm going to get my chimp.

71
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:29,779
VASICH: Bring that thing back here!
Return to base!

72
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:32,895
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.

73
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,734
I got a visual on Alpha pod.

74
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,854
Oberon, come back!

75
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,813
Oberon, come in!

76
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:40,061
-I'm getting a mayday, sir.
-Alpha pod?

77
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:43,579
-I don't know, but it's strong.
VASICH: Put it up.

78
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,779
Mayday! Mayday! Come in!

79
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,459
Request-- We're going down! Mayday!

80
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:53,816

Hey, where am l?

87
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,695
What is this place?

88
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,460
Here! I'm open! Come on!

89

GORILLA BOY 1 : Stupid human!
ARl: Stop it!

95
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:26,211
-Who said to throw stones at humans?
-My father.

96
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:28,094
Well, he's wrong.

97
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:31,374
-And you can tell him I said so.
-Human-lover.

98

GORILLA 5:
Move along!

99
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,415
Are you trying
to put me out of business?

100
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,015
These are the skankiest, scabbiest. . .

101
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:07,819
. . .scuzziest humans I've ever seen.

00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:11,973
-You don't want them?
-I'll take the whole lot.

103
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,139
I must be out of my mind.

104
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,734
I'll have to make it up on volume.

105
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,652
All right, get them out. . .

106
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,453
. . .and get them clean! Chop, chop!

107
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,453
Let's go!

108
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,291
Keep it moving!

109
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,052
Come on! Hurry up!

Ladies to the right, please!

00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,533
Don't be afraid.

112
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,333
Come on.

113
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,933
Very touching. I can't see
for the tears in my eyes.

114
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:54,212
Come on. That one's
crawling with lice.

115
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,854
Check the teeth
on that little one. Nice.

116
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,610
Stay back. Back!

117
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,290
Get in there!

118
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:20,617
Move! You too!

119
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:26,813
How many times have I told you to
wear gloves when you handle humans?

120
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,457
You normally hack off a limb, Limbo.

121
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:37,452
Yes, general. That's true.

122
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,810
LIMBO: Unfortunately,
they're worth more intact.

123
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,499
Keep your eye on this one.

124
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,816
He's feisty.

125
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,289
Were these the ones
raiding the orchards?

126
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,578
I know an old country remedy
that never fails.

127
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:05,574
You gut one human,
and you string the carcass up.

128
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,408
The Human Rights faction
is on me already.

129
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,413
Do-gooders. Who needs them?
I'm for free speech as long as they. . .

130
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:16,851
. . .keep their mouths shut.

131
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,212
My niece wants one
for her birthday.

132
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:24,814
Excellent. The little ones
make wonderful pets.

133
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,947
But be sure
you get rid of it by puberty.

134
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,701
One thing you don't want in your
house, it's a human teenager.

135
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,427
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.

136
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,942
That one.

137
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,348
Oh, isn't she pretty.

138
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,226
I'll get that for you, sir.

139
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:14,935
And I have a pretty new collar. . .

140
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,263
. . .just for you.

141
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,423
Compliments of the house.

142
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:26,936
You stink of humans.

143
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:41,378
It's disgusting
the way we treat humans.

144
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:44,094
It demeans us as much as them.

145
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:51,578
Ari, let's go.

146
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:01,905
Get them marked!
I got orders to fill!

147
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:23,498
Next!

148
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:38,825
Not you again.

149
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:43,622
I can't stand by while humans
are being mistreated and tortured.

150
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:49,777
The only reason I put up with your
nonsense is because of your father!

151
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,944
You want me to stop?
Give up the business.

152
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:56,377
Hey, I do the job
that nobody else wants!

153
00:25:56,706 --> 00:26:00,096
I don't see you bleeding-hearts
spending all day. . .

154
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:03,821
. . .with these dangerous,
dirty, dumb beasts.

155
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:07,496
They can be taught
to live with us as equals.

156
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,224
I'm gonna prove it.

157
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,777
LIMBO:
Don't do that.

158
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:15,222
Don't do that.

159
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,060
Stay back.

160
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:21,421
Well, now there's your proof.

161
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:24,536
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.

162
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,140
Help me.

163
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,820
Please.

164
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:30,459
Please help me.

165
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:36,216
You're giving me such a headache.

166
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:42,616
I don't need this aggravation!

167
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,021
Sell him to me.

168
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:48,702
Are you crazy? He's wild.
They're both wild.

169
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,379
Then I'll buy them both.

170
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:53,825
That would be expensive.

171
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,336
That would be. . .

172
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,577
. . .very, very expensive.

173
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,499
I'm sure we can. . .

174
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:10,136
. . .you know, come to a deal.

175
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,181
You know?

176
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,856
Deliver them to my house.

177
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:26,616
SANDAR:
Semos, help me!

178
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:30,946
Rise when your master enters.

179
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,262
Wild humans. . .

180
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,376
. . .in my house.

181
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,777
This one seems different.

182
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:47,377
How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other!

183
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:49,178
My guests are here.

184
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:53,101
Keep the savage ones out of sight.

185
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:59,981
Especially from General Thade!

186
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,055
SANDAR:
You'd better be nice to him!

187
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:09,384
And wash your hands before dinner.

188
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,970
Senator, good evening.
Dear, you look lovely tonight.

189
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:24,346
But I'm having a bad hair day.

190
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:27,316
Yet, she spends a fortune grooming.

191
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:29,548
And I'm worth every penny.

192
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,467
Would you like to freshen up?

193
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:35,986
We're fine.

194
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:56,428
-How'd these monkeys get like this?
-How else would they be?

195
00:28:56,677 --> 00:29:01,467
-They'd be begging me for a treat.
-What tribe are you from?

196
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:04,916
U.S. Air Force. I'm going back to it.

197
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,027
Finish your work.

198
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,907
Please, everyone sit.

199
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:34,034
We just returned
from our country house.

200
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,268
-How was it?
-Boring.

201
00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:41,068
I find it relaxing being away
from the bustle of the city.

202
00:29:41,317 --> 00:29:43,467
NOVA:
There was no place to go.

203
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:46,789
Nothing but trees and rocks.

204
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:50,034
-All you did was nap.
-Exactly.

205
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,672
Time away from politics. . .

206
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,674
. . .is what I needed.

207
00:29:55,997 --> 00:30:00,468
We'd lose ourselves for days
in the forest when we were young.

208
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,793
Now I can barely climb a tree.

209
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:07,026
Trite but true:
"Youth is wasted on the young. "

210
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:12,230
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?

211
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:16,715
Living with your daughter
would age any ape quickly.

212
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,351
SANDAR:
You've been a stranger lately.

213
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,629
I apologize for my lateness, senator.

214
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,353
I stopped to see my father.

215
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:30,594
-How's my old friend?
-Slipping, I'm afraid.

216
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:34,995
I'd like to see him more,
but these are troubled days.

217
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:37,387
The humans infest the provinces.

218
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,827
We encroach upon their habitat.

219
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:43,268
They breed while we grow soft
in our affluence.

220
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,832
THADE:
They outnumber us four to one!

221
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:48,505
Why can't we simply
sterilize them all?

222
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:51,387
The cost would be prohibitive.

223
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,833
Although scientists tell me. . .

224
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:57,274
. . .these humans
carry terrible diseases.

225
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:58,830
How would we know?

226
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:02,586
The army burns the bodies
before they're examined.

227
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:07,551
Father?

228
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:16,794
At times, perhaps, the senate feels
that the army has been. . .

229
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:18,589
. . .a tad extreme.

230
00:31:18,797 --> 00:31:23,996
Extremism in defense of apes
is no vice, senator!

231
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,911
Your ideas threaten our prosperity!

232
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:30,435
The human problem
can't be solved with money!

233
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:33,674
We tried that once,
and all we got was. . .

234
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:36,630
. . .a welfare state that nearly broke us.

235
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:41,029
I think the city has about
as much diversity as I can handle.

236
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:46,233
This garment was made
by one of my humans.

237
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:49,865
And can you deny the skill?

238
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:53,429
Obviously, they're capable
of a real culture.

239
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:58,793
Everything in the human culture
takes place below the waist.

240
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,956
Bow your heads!

241
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,875
We give thanks
for the fruit of the land.

242
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:18,707
Bless us, holy father, who created
all apes in his image.

243
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:24,116
Hasten the day when you will return
and bring peace to your children.

244
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:26,911
-Amen.
GROUP: Amen.

245
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:37,632
Next you'll be telling us
these beasts have a soul.

246
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,391
Of course they do.

247
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:43,351
The senator's daughter
flirts with blasphemy.

248
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,996
Is there a soul in there?

249
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,146
Do you have a towel?

250
00:33:18,274 --> 00:33:19,832
I've lost my appetite.

251
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:56,183
I'm bored by these society dinners.

252
00:33:56,394 --> 00:34:00,103
-I came to see you.
-Oh, how sweet.

253
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,191
You've wasted your time.

254
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,745
My feelings haven't changed.

255
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:07,422
I still care about you.

256
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:15,024
You only care about my father's
influence. And your own ambition.

257
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:21,425
I know about the trouble
you caused today.

258
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:25,866
-I could have you arrested.
-I'd do it again.

259
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:29,792
You feel so much for these humans. . .

260
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,629
. . .yet you feel nothing for me.

261
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:46,473
A moment, sir.

262
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,673
What is it?

263
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,509
We found something.
We think you should see it.

264
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,164
There's a curfew.

265
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,651
If they see you, they kill you.

266
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:32,735
You stay here, you're already dead.

267
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:38,130
Can you take me to
where we were caught?

268
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,488
Not without my family.

269
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:00,495
APE 1 :
This is where I saw it.

270
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,455
APE 1 :
This is where I saw it.

271
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,364
THADE:
Go on.

272
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:09,211
APE 2: Something fell from the sky
with wings of fire.

273
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:13,534
APE 2: There was a thunderous sound
and the ground itself shook.

274
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,523
-You weren't dreaming this?
-It was no dream, sir.

275
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:19,088
Look.

276
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,735
-You told no one?
APE 1 : No, sir.

277
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:31,489
APE 1 :
We had to come right to you.

278
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,484
You did exactly the right thing.

279
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:23,244
You smell that?

280
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:25,923
Don't start now. We're off-duty.

281
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:27,807
And I'm starving.

282
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:41,825
You're hurt.

283
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,235
How did you get away?

284
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:04,356
-Who are you?
-Somebody trying to get out.

285
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:11,067
She promised to take me back.

286
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:16,316
This is a house-human.
He thinks he's better than us.

287
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:17,427
Hey!

288
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:21,515
We'll go together.

289
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:37,314
|APES LAUGH|

290
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:42,669
|APES CHATTER|

291
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:00,510
|APES CHATTER|

292
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,305
|NOVA SCREAMS|

293
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:51,146
Good night, little girl.

294
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:04,115
|SCREAMS|

295
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:15,789
You go this way.

296
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,952
The rest of you, come with me.

297
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,871
ATTAR:
Send a squad to the north gate! Hurry!

298
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,552
Wait! Someone's coming.

299
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:55,310
You're lucky I found you first.

300
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:58,270
Come on. I can reason with them.

301
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:01,513
-We know how apes reason.
-How can we escape?

302
00:41:01,716 --> 00:41:04,230
Don't get involved with these humans.

303
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,947
Why did you help me?

304
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:09,952
Why would you take that chance?

305
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:12,271
Because. . .

306
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:16,066
. . .you're not usual.

307
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:21,756
Show me a way out. I'll show you
something that will change your world.

308
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:27,355
Trust me.

309
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:38,230
When I was little. . .

310
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:43,027
. . .I used to sneak outside the city,
where no one could find me.

311
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:46,504
I can show you.

312
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:50,155
If we're caught, no one can protect us!

313
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:52,155
Trust me.

314
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:58,754
What about her?

315
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:04,352
-A human child won't survive.
-Bon can take her. Hide her at home.

316
00:42:19,756 --> 00:42:21,155
Check every house!

317
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:26,713
APE 1 : Have you seen any humans?
-No.

318
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:37,155
Hurry!

319
00:42:39,836 --> 00:42:42,270
-Father.

-Through the tunnels.

When you find them, kill them all.

326
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:41,913
Except for the troublemaker.
I want to talk to him before he dies.

Sir, the senator's daughter is with them.

-They took her?
-She's helping them. I saw her myself.

She had no choice.
They threatened her life.

330
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:06,356
I'll report to the Senate. They'll beat
their chests and ask for my help.

331
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:08,945
They are weak without you, sir.

We can still go back.

I can't now.

That's where I flew in.

You did that?

339

No, my retroburners.

Monkeys are further down
the evolutionary ladder.

Just above humans.

-From planet Earth.
-Your apes let you fly?

367

They live in zoos and do what we say.

I wouldn't hurt my property.

But I'll make an exception.

No harm done. Come here, kid.

-Kill him.
-Slave trader.

You kill him, you lower
yourself to his level.

00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:54,397
Exactly.

"Separate but equal. "
"To each his own. "

Can't we all just get along?

392
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:22,839
I'm probably just in the way.
So why don't I just get going?

He'll lead them to us.

Then we'll make him our guest.

395
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:31,282
Cuff him.

Ow! These things hurt.

-You could use that against us.

-Who invented that?
-It was gonna save us.

-We're better off now.
-We?

-You're so difficult.
-Like a slave?

-That's not what--
-Shut up!

That goes for all species.

capable of kidnapping my daughter--

Look how they've repaid you.

Declare martial law.

once and for all.

or indecisive.

We are friends.

No. You're not telling me everything.

You believe he is not born
of this world.

of this world.

How can you possibly know?

455
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:26,281
I have something to tell you.

456
00:55:27,009 --> 00:55:29,603
Something my father told me. . .

457
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:33,324
. . .and his father told him.

458

Back along our bloodlines to Semos.

459
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,360
In the time before time. . .

460

. . .we were the slaves
and the humans. . .

Impossible.

463
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,278
Break it.

464
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:36,848
What you hold in your hand
is the proof of their power.

465
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,160
Their power of invention.

466
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,764
Their power of technology.

467
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:46,918
Against this, our strength
means nothing.

468
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:55,118
This has the power
of a thousand spears.

469
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:57,122
I warn you.

470
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:01,800
Their ingenuity goes hand in hand
with their cruelty.

471
00:57:03,329 --> 00:57:04,682
No creature. . .

472

You must find this human quickly.

474
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:16,127
Do not let him get to Calima.

475
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:18,247
The forbidden area?

476
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:24,684
Calima holds the secret
to our true beginnings.

477
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:29,521
Damn them.

478
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:32,477
I will stop him, Father.

479
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:35,288
Damn them.

480
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:38,526
Damn them all to hell.

481
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:21,310

What's on the other side?

484
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:30,144
It leads to the sacred
ruins at Calima.

-What is that?
-Calima? That's where, well. . .

Where the Almighty
breathed life into Semos. . .

It is where Semos will return.

491
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:59,900
Most educated apes consider
such religious notions as fairy tales.

Metaphors we use to explain our origins.

No time. Gets dark,
we're going right through.

499
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:55,105
Semos smiles on me.

You win too often.

-Who's in charge here?!
-I am, sir!

No, sir.

01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:48,785
I'm assuming command.
This camp will be prepared!

512
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:12,179
Just grab the reins.

Hold tight. We're gonna
cross the river.

514

Horses are great swimmers.
They'll carry you across.

515
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:33,903
Good luck. Have a nice ride.
Leave me. I'll only slow you down.

-Letting him go?
-No. He'll ride with us.

No, wait. Wait. This is suicide.

518
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:44,378
Only a human would think
that this could work.

01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:54,933
They tried to kill me like
I was nothing but a miserable--

You're hurt.

01:05:38,652 --> 01:05:43,043
The soldiers will cross downstream.
We should move quickly!

541
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:53,290
ATTAR: They crossed the river.
-You didn't stop them?

542
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:57,246
ATTAR:
Horses carried them.

Forgive me, my friend.
I'm not angry with you.

547
01:06:46,995 --> 01:06:48,633
Father was taken from me.

548
01:06:49,195 --> 01:06:53,427
He was a great leader
and a direct descendant of Semos.

Now it's time for you to lead.

He'll stay like that all night.

A soldier, isn't he?

558
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:08,592
A general. Well, he was
until he opposed Thade.

559
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:12,667
When Thade ruined his career,
my father took him in.

560
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:17,989
He was a great soldier.
Attar was his best pupil.

Now they're enemies.

I'd like to see your world.

563
01:08:28,153 --> 01:08:32,749
They'd probably prod you and poke you
and throw you in a cage.

564
01:08:35,393 --> 01:08:37,031
You'd protect me.

They think you'll save them.

566
01:08:55,193 --> 01:08:59,106
After you meet your friends,
we'll never see you again.

567
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:04,109
Well, I didn't promise them anything.

No.

569
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:09,872
You just dropped in from the stars.

It's my ship.

577
01:11:51,233 --> 01:11:54,350
These ruins are
thousands of years old.

578
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:57,542
I was just here a few days ago.

579
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:17,345
This is what I was
picking up. The Oberon.

ARl:
What are you doing?

581
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:31,350
It has a power source
that lasts forever.

582
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:45,591
Maybe I can access
the ship's visual log.

583
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:49,311
Then I can figure out what happened.

Going down!

We were searching for a pilot
in an electromagnetic storm.

01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:13,825
I got pushed forward through time.

We haven 't had any communications
since we crashed.

589

This planet is uncharted, uninhabited.

are a lot stronger...

...and a lot smarter...

592
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:31,310
... than we ever imagined.

593
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:39,951
Apes are out of control.

594
01:13:40,513 --> 01:13:41,992
One male named Semos...

595
01:13:43,033 --> 01:13:47,151
... who I raised myself,
has taken over the group.

596
01:13:47,353 --> 01:13:50,789
We have weapons but I don 't
think we'll last long.

597
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,303
Maybe I saw the truth,
but I wouldn 't admit it.

598
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,344
They were good students--

599
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:09,752
They're all dead
because they looked for me.

600
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:16,548
We're alive because of you.

Send them all back.

605
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:52,144
Where? They left their homes
to be with you.

606
01:16:02,593 --> 01:16:03,912
I saw them.

607
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:05,427
How many?

608
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:07,544
As far as I could see.

01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:12,347
Thade has all his legions.
The senate's capitulated.

He answers to no one now.

You're gonna have to get your people
out of here.

612
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,751
They won't listen to me.

This is a fight we can't win.

614

Break up and scatter.

I'm so sorry.

I'm responsible for all of this.

646
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:28,349
And I'm never going home.

647
01:21:30,593 --> 01:21:32,265
Just like them.

648
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:37,303
The apes are out of control.

649
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:51,149
I can't go home, either.

650
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,710
Maybe we're not so different.

651

No. We're very different.

You care about everybody but yourself.

Doesn't matter. Apes, humans.
My planet, your planet.

654
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:14,590
The universe rewards cruelty with power.

655

No.

656
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:21,821
Not always. Not if we fight back.

657
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:29,149
I'm just not sure how.

658
01:22:36,553 --> 01:22:38,544
Better take care of that.

I respect your courage.

660
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,742
But my advice to you is
to put that away. . .

661
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:58,583
. . .and head for the mountains.

662
01:23:41,993 --> 01:23:43,665
There's one possibility.

663
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,466
I want those people behind the ship.

664
01:23:47,673 --> 01:23:50,949
-Not hiding, they need to be seen.
-And us?

665
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,106
You'll be in front. You're the bait.

-You won't be there.

-I know. I need you back with them.

668
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:04,626

We may have a chance.
I need you behind the ship.

Hey, we can win this.

673

can make a difference, okay?

You know you can't defeat Thade's army.

680
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:56,342
We might confuse them.
It could give us a chance.

681
01:24:58,633 --> 01:25:03,388
You don't understand Thade.
He'll keep coming for you.

No matter what.

we cannot defeat them!

No! Wait!
