00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,097
<i>Swedish House Mafia.</i>

2
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,801
<i>They're all from Sweden:
Axwell,</i>

3
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:13,505
<i>Sebastian Ingrosso,
Steve Angello</i>

4
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,809
<i>and the Swedish House Mafia.
Make some noise!</i>

5
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,578
<i>Swedish House Mafia headlined Coachella</i>

6
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,414
<i>and sold out
Madison Square Garden.</i>

7
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:28,887
<i>Thousands of gigs.
Millions of fans.</i>

8
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,757
You can't explain it.
You got to experience it.

9
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,644
News has reached us

10
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,246
that the successful group
Swedish House Mafia

11
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,848
is splitting up.

12
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,816
<i>Swedish House Mafia are breaking up.</i>

13
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,586
<i>They stated on their
website it was no more.</i>

14
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,355
<i>Axwell,
Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso.</i>

15
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:07,159
..their next tour
is their final one.

16
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,261
I don't know
why they would end it.

17
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,896
It's ridiculous.

18
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,231
They should keep going.

19
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,732
They can get better.

20
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,834
Got to move on
and make new things.

21
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,770
Maybe they'll rejoin, who knows?

22
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,406
<i>Steve Angello,
Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso!</i>

23
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,911
What's the plan now? A big tour?

24
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:30,415
Yes, a big world tour.
That's the plan for now.

25
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,386
And what's happening
after the tour?

26
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,891
Well, I guess we're all going
to pick up on our solo careers.

27
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,794
And keep making music. As usual.

28
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,931
Have you guys fallen out?
Is there a problem?

29
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,166
No, no.

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,715
<i>How is it going to work if it is like this?</i>

31
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,285
<i>It's not going to work.</i>

32
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:43,222
I like to make
music while I'm getting ready.

33
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,358
You're listening,
but in a passive mode.

34
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,263
This is the best bit.

35
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,732
The best part is
when the beat comes in,

36
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,301
and then there's
an immediate pause.

37
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,674
I mean, it just started!
It's awesome.

38
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,250
Then it comes back.

39
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,786
It's like...

40
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,430
Just got my laundry back.

41
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,033
When I arrived,
I only had five clean T-shirts.

42
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:33,272
But now I've washed
pretty much everything.

43
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,051
Well, now I have 16 T-shirts.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,735
I'm not feeling this T-shirt.

45
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,072
I feel fat and swollen.

46
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:10,042
Damn, I didn't bring a hoodie
or anything.

47
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,447
Weird.

48
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,121
I don't feel comfortable
in this.

49
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,495
Wait...

50
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,130
Goddamnit.

51
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:36,468
Can't forget the wedding ring.

52
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,971
Where the hell are
my cigarettes?

53
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh, well, fuck it.

54
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,519
<i>Swedish House Mafia have released tickets</i>

55
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,790
<i>to their One Last Tour.
50 shows in 26 countries.</i>

56
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,927
It's all about
getting into tour mode now.

57
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:06,498
<i>We need to be warmed up
and ready.</i>

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>There are obviously reasons</i>

59
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,901
<i>why they're breaking up
the band.</i>

60
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,671
<i>I mean, how are they
going to keep it together</i>

61
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,740
<i>for that whole world tour?</i>

62
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,744
<i>Swedish House Mafia</i>

63
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,912
<i>sold out Madison Square Garden
in nine minutes.</i>

64
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:25,717
<i>It's Jojo. In the studio
with me is Swedish House Mafia.</i>

65
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,453
They're unique from
anything else in the industry.

66
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,456
And they made
house music popular.

67
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,626
They say two minds are better
than one. How about three minds?

68
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,129
It puts you in a good mood,
lifts your spirits.

69
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,797
<i>Their own individual styles,</i>

70
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,766
the way they've
come together as a group.

71
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,167
We're so excited about it.

72
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,205
<i>The stage is built of 26 Kinesys motors</i>

73
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,908
<i>that are holding up
three flying video screens.</i>

74
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,878
Two in front, one in the back.

75
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,515
It pushes all the energy out
front. They're very powerful.

76
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,486
That's a lot of laser.

77
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,856
There's 800 LED panels on there.
That's so bright.

78
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,958
<i>It's the most elaborate pyrotechnics</i>

79
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,895
these guys ever had on any tour.

80
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,799
These are the PRG Bad Boys.
We have three, one for each guy.

81
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:19,571
It's going to be
an assault on all senses.

82
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,074
It's very important
that we are at the top of our game,

83
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,011
because this is
the biggest thing

84
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,480
we've ever done together.

85
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,487
<i>This is THE essential new tune</i>

86
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,589
<i>and it is the brand new single</i>

87
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,492
<i>from the Swedish House Mafia,
eagerly awaited.</i>

88
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,028
<i>It's called
"Don't You Worry Child".</i>

89
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,134
Steve Angello has arrived. Over.

90
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,503
It's small, isn't it?

91
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,573
It's massive.
Yeah, no kidding. What's up?

92
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,108
It's big, but...
But also intimate.

93
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,246
It feels kind of naturally big.

94
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:05,484
It's not like "aaah"...!

95
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,119
Maybe a bit, actually.

96
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,799
Oh, damn.
Massive.

97
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,834
Oh, God, it's massive.

98
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,644
Wait! Wait! Wait! Before it
drops, what happened there?

99
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,180
What happened with the lights?
Dun, dun, dun!

100
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,583
That was a different
mix to the other one...

101
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,752
You're always going
to hear a different mix.

102
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,587
Oh, I know.

103
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,923
We need some: "Dun, dun!"
Something.

104
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,958
It looks kind of dead there.

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,860
Let's do it.

106
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,295
I like this part best,

107
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,197
'cause you can see
how big it is.

108
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,798
Check it out now.

109
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,808
Everyone is gonna go like this!

110
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,212
The love is everywhere.

111
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,373
Can we take a picture real quick?

112
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,374
We don't have time.

113
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,677
We came from California...

114
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,179
Yeah, awesome. Cool.

115
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,649
My shrink just told me:

116
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,954
"Try to avoid stress and take it
easy over the next few days."

117
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,890
Swedish House Mafia!

118
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,391
Swedish House Mafia!

119
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,240
Stand by.

120
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,711
Fifteen seconds to go.

121
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,747
<i>We got artists walking.</i>

122
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,824
<i>It's the beginning of the end.</i>

123
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,926
<i>What emotions are
going through all of you?</i>

124
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,328
<i>I don't really think of it as an end.</i>

125
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,964
<i>Now it feels like
a beginning of something.</i>

126
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,984
<i>You're going around all
these parts with your best friends</i>

127
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,086
<i>and just having fun
and exploring,</i>

128
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,188
<i>playing the biggest
venues around the world.</i>

129
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,923
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

130
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,125
<i>I'm looking forward to hanging out,</i>

131
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,027
<i>really, with all of the guys.</i>

132
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,996
<i>I'm sure we'll have some fun.</i>

133
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,899
<i>I'm happy we're
traveling the world together</i>

134
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,768
<i>and that we're going
to do this once and for all</i>

135
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,972
<i>and just go out with a bang
and just do this.</i>

136
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,182
Swedish House Mafia!

137
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,822
Ingrosso!
Axwell is tight!

138
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,591
Fuck me,
that was awesome. Insane.

139
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,829
Swedish House Mafia are legends.
They are in my heart, my blood

140
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,598
Swedish House Mafia,
you can't stop now!

141
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,183
Hey.
Hey.

142
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,118
Messy girl.

143
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,021
We can wave you off outside.

144
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,557
Daddy loves you.

145
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,126
Goodbye.

146
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,662
She doesn't care as long
as she gets to play.

147
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,464
Bye, Mum.

148
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,199
Goodbye.

149
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,477
What do you want for Christmas?

150
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,678
A watch.

151
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,712
A watch?

152
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,548
I want a daddy-watch.

153
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,651
Do you want a watch like daddy's?

154
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,252
In black.

155
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:26,557
You want it in black?
OK. Same size?

156
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,960
What?

157
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,004
I'll see you soon.

158
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,977
Sing opera.

159
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,579
You want me to sing opera?
Hm.

160
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,114
Like you were singing
in the car.

161
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,684
In the car?
That was our secret!

162
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,154
Daddy, come on!

163
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,589
Do it, fatty!

164
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,060
Come on, please, Dad!
OK, fine, hang on

165
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,495
Daddy, do it, you lazy man.

166
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,632
Leon!

167
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,636
OK, thanks.
You're welcome.

168
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,347
Yeah, that's good.

169
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,189
At the end of the tour
we're going to quit this.

170
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,191
One last cigarette.

171
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,061
One last...
I don't have a lighter.

172
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,798
<i>"Partouze".</i>

173
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,710
<i>My father started a record company in '89,</i>

174
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,512
<i>Plumphouse and Loop Records,</i>

175
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,547
<i>that released
a lot of deep, tech house,</i>

176
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,750
<i>techno, acid house.</i>

177
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,186
I fell in love with the energy
and the intense, you know...

178
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,422
The whole, "My God,
what's happening?"

179
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,591
Something happened to my body

180
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,593
with the beats coming in
and the bass drum

181
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,529
and the toms and everything
building up to something

182
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,098
I'd never heard before,
it was something new.

183
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,770
<i>I felt that some day
people will feel this.</i>

184
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,839
People will love this
because I can't be wrong.

185
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:26,577
So my mission was to find
other people doing what I did.

186
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,216
I'm going to tell you
how I met Steve.

187
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,286
<i>He was a DJ.
He was a hip hop DJ.</i>

188
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,290
We would hang out
with the same people

189
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,292
and we grew in to each other.

190
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,194
We saw that we had
the same interests

191
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,696
and he had two turntables
before anyone,

192
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,400
<i>because you couldn't get
the Technics 1210s anywhere.</i>

193
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:54,272
<i>I always bought vinyls
and went to him to listen to it</i>

194
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,474
<i>because I didn't have
a vinyl player.</i>

195
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,845
He was like, "Man, you need to
stop listening to this music.

196
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,414
What the fuck
is wrong with you?"

197
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,583
I had orange pants,
my hair in the back,

198
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,485
my glow-in-the-dark T-shirt,

199
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,788
standing and jumping in his room
and he was sitting there

200
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,158
<i>smoking weed with his,
you know, baggy pants</i>

201
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,661
<i>and the whole swagger Steve has.</i>

202
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:20,565
A lot of energy. He was always
very happy and very funny.

203
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,534
<i>And he always
wanted to do stuff,</i>

204
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,337
you know,
he had spikes and Buffalos.

205
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,106
This real rave kid.

206
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,740
He made hip hop beats.

207
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,409
<i>I was just partying</i>

208
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,479
<i>and coming into my
puberty and drinking beer.</i>

209
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,881
<i>And he just wanted to work.</i>

210
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,716
Then we went
to my father's office.

211
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:42,186
I'd just got this CD
called<i> Homework</i> by Daft Punk.

212
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,325
<i>I saw in Steve's face
that something happened</i>

213
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,660
and the same thing
happened to me

214
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,829
when I was a kid
and listened to techno.

215
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,765
When I heard this the first time
I was so shocked.

216
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,835
And he was like,
"I don't know what happened,

217
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,172
but I got a musical orgasm
listening to this."

218
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,710
I remember me and him
coming into

219
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,479
the same world from hip hop
to techno and we met.

220
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,796
Did I shit my pants, man?
Ha-ha-ha!

221
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,867
What is it?
Wow. I'm going to throw up.

222
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,303
Is it me that smells?
I don't know.

223
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,905
Is it my mouth?
No.

224
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,341
What is with your hat?
Is there something?

225
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,311
You crapped in your hat.
Is it that?

226
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,180
Yeah, I think so.

227
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,848
No, it's not that.

228
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,285
Wow, somebody ate dog shit?
Yeah. I think it's my mouth.

229
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,655
Did you eat dog shit?
Oof! Wow!

230
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,392
What? What?

231
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,593
What is it?

232
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,830
It's here.
It's the fucking food.

233
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,575
In school, I discovered
this music-making software.

234
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,351
<i>Nerds, much like myself,</i>

235
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,920
would get together
and make a demo,

236
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,323
which meant a programmer

237
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,858
would program the most
advanced possible stuff

238
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,895
he could on the screen,
like make a square spin

239
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,897
<i>and that would be like,
"Oh, my, God!"</i>

240
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,633
Then you would have a guy
making music to this.

241
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,703
And this was a demo.
Basically computer nerd music,

242
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:42,940
demo music is amateur
versions of techno and trance.

243
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,244
And the better I got
and the better computers got,

244
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,613
the more it started
to sound like the real thing.

245
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,948
You can find it,
it's really fast

246
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,484
and actually sounding
quite amateurish.

247
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,454
I remember hearing
the drums in that song.

248
00:20:56,456 --> 00:21:00,391
It was funky. It was groovy.

249
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,326
Well, we met at a restaurant.

250
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,630
<i>He was just some kid
who came in and just like,</i>

251
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,899
boys are coming in
being like boys, hello, just...

252
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,901
"Oh, my God, you are that guy.

253
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:15,439
I just heard your song on
<i>StoneBridge 2.</i> It's amazing."

254
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,508
I remember Ax
was looking at me like,

255
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,778
"What is this guy talking
about?" He was like, "Whoa!"

256
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,348
He was very flamboyant.

257
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,486
<i>I guess the Italian in him
was very apparent. Ha, ha!</i>

258
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,688
I'm like, "Do you have
a studio in Stockholm?

259
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,890
I'll come tomorrow."

260
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,993
He's a bit of a pushy guy.
He's a bit weird, you know.

261
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,762
<i>I'm coming there at 3.</i>

262
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,899
But you have to bear in mind,
I came from south of Sweden

263
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,901
<i>and it's very low key, you know,</i>

264
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:47,004
just very calm and Swedish,
I guess.

265
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:51,342
I grab some music, I take Steve
with me and I go to the studio.

266
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,678
When you met somebody
that was into dance music,

267
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,714
it's as if you let
two dogs into a room,

268
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,518
they smell each other's asses
and run around in a circle.

269
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,687
We were like, "Wow,
you're also into dance music?"

270
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,990
So we had to become
best friends on the spot.

271
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,436
Let's get into the mode.

272
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:27,478
Can you rewind a bit?
Oh, there it is.

273
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,583
Always the same high hats.

274
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,421
There it goes.

275
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,565
Say "Greyhound."

276
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,504
- How are you?
- I'm a mess.

277
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,006
Come over here.
You want water?

278
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,409
I can't breathe.

279
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,779
We're just three normal guys
from the suburbs of Stockholm.

280
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:06,083
Don't destroy the illusion.
We're not normal.

281
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,052
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,889
One, two, three.

283
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,494
<i>The artists are on stage.</i>

284
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,180
Where the fuck are we?

285
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,922
I can't ski at all.

286
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,924
Me neither. I suck.

287
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,230
It's incredible.

288
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,953
<i>The more you think about it,
the more you realize</i>

289
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:52,022
<i>how big of a step
dance music has taken.</i>

290
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,792
<i>We couldn't go to Madison
Square Garden ten years ago.</i>

291
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,161
<i>They would say
we're out of our heads.</i>

292
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,164
<i>And suddenly we can
play any stadium in the world.</i>

293
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,081
Blows your mind, opens your
heart always, always.

294
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,020
I love Russia.

295
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,715
<i>Who quits when they're at the top?</i>

296
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,050
<i>What do we do after this?</i>

297
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,618
<i>It doesn't get bigger than this.</i>

298
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,121
<i>So that would mean
repeating ourselves.</i>

299
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,323
<i>So we were, like,</i>

300
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,159
<i>"The biggest change we could
do right now is to stop."</i>

301
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,196
Even though it's really early

302
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,666
and it might not be
the best decision ever made,

303
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,669
it's still exciting.

304
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,138
<i>It's going to be very sad,
obviously,</i>

305
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,908
<i>but also, a little bit,
"Oh, finally", in a weird way.</i>

306
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,012
You know, it is an end, but it's
also a fucking amazing final.

307
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,986
The first time
I heard "<i> Greyhound</i>,"

308
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,822
that breakdown, I just lost it.

309
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,625
It was one of the best songs
I heard in my life.

310
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,727
Do you know they open
the show with<i> Greyhound</i>?

311
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,596
Yeah, I did know that.

312
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,598
What'll you do when you hear that?

313
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,335
I'll lose my marbles,
scream my head off.

314
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,871
Lose my mind as I usually do
when I listen to music.

315
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,645
<i>All alert.</i>

316
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,748
Go!

317
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,026
<i>The winner of the Grand Prix, Axwell!</i>

318
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,805
Hey, honey, it's Daddy.

319
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,080
Hey, honey, it's Daddy.

320
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:10,120
♪ One chilly night,
night, night My boat I steered ♪

321
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:14,158
♪ On the wavy Wavy, wavy sea ♪

322
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:23,233
Great crowd.
Yes.

323
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,741
Damn good crowd.

324
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,219
Coming from 20,000 people,
all going bananas,

325
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:47,991
adrenaline pumping
and us playing the drums

326
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:54,331
to a silent,
not so romantic hotel room.

327
00:28:54,333 --> 00:29:00,971
I shouldn't complain,
but I get this kind of anxiety.

328
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:05,109
I almost panic.
I have to wind down.

329
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,820
I thought about something.

330
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,455
I wonder if we will ever be on
that MTV show,

331
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,791
<i>One Hit Wonders.</i>

332
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:24,928
Whatever happened to?

333
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,231
You know, like Right Said Fred,

334
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:30,300
they had one hit
and then what happened?

335
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:33,137
Do you remember this group,
Swedish House Mafia?

336
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,073
They had this one song,
"Don't You Worry Child."

337
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,910
All three members now
went off to do their own things,

338
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:44,414
not as successful as the
"Don't You Worry Child" single.

339
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:48,485
And one of them went on
to become a crack addict, also.

340
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,120
One of them bought
a lot of houses

341
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,156
that he later had to sell.

342
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:55,325
And they tried to make
a reunion tour

343
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,428
after a few years, nobody came.

344
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,398
So, on our number ten
of One Hit Wonders,

345
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,168
Swedish House Mafia.

346
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,304
That could happen.

347
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,375
Like I've said before,
it feels like

348
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:15,879
we have been given the key
to the golden city

349
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,482
and we are throwing it away.

350
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:27,391
We could have kept going
and gotten even bigger.

351
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,372
It was very organic.

352
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:45,042
<i>It's more the fans
forming Swedish House Mafia</i>

353
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,177
<i>than us sitting down saying,</i>

354
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,346
<i>"Shall we become
Swedish House Mafia?"</i>

355
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,321
<i>We were a bunch of guys having
a great time and loving music.</i>

356
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,957
<i>We've loved every second of it.</i>

357
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,396
<i>That was the feedback from the
shows and comments afterwards.</i>

358
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,398
<i>That was what people
wrote about us:</i>

359
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,535
<i>They are having
an amazing time up there.</i>

360
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,203
<i>Then it became a festival,</i>

361
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,205
<i>then it became
a residency somewhere.</i>

362
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:24,615
<i>We started for fun,
not knowing what we started,</i>

363
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,950
<i>didn't think about
what we started,</i>

364
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,352
<i>we didn't plan anything.</i>

365
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,321
Are you ready
for some Swedish House Mafia?

366
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:39,196
We didn't see this
as a long-lasting career

367
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:43,267
even if we had a dream of,
you know, the dream was that,

368
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,036
<i>but we were like, "Oh,
my God, we're going abroad?</i>

369
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,006
This is a first." That's how
we felt with everything.

370
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,908
It'll be the first
and the last gig,

371
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,110
so we need to
party our asses off.

372
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,267
<i>It was at the right moment in time</i>

373
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,504
<i>at the right moment
for this music</i>

374
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,340
<i>at the right moment
where we were with our music.</i>

375
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:25,242
We really hit the mother lode.

376
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:41,258
It's just become this big
machine, you know, monster.

377
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,048
<i>This is the UK's official number one,</i>

378
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,617
<i>"Don't You Worry Child."</i>

379
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,598
Today is a good day.

380
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,039
We partied
for six years straight.

381
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,641
Constantly, five days a week.

382
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,511
Then two days travelling.

383
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:42,319
We didn't just consume alcohol.
We did pretty much everything.

384
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:47,424
I woke up after my birthday
party a few years ago.

385
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:50,060
There were beer bottles, liquor,

386
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:54,297
all kinds of shit all over
the place, people everywhere.

387
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,735
This is enough.

388
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:03,073
I threw everyone out
except for my friends

389
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:07,444
and said, "Those of you who want
to quit this can join me,

390
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:08,845
those of you who want
to keep going,

391
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:12,349
delete my number
and never call me again."

392
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,318
That's how it went down.

393
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,823
And I've been good
from that day on.

394
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,703
<i>It started with us just messing around</i>

395
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:37,774
<i>with no responsibilities.</i>

396
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:42,145
<i>The requirement was
that we showed up,</i>

397
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,748
<i>drank booze and partied.</i>

398
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,584
But since we've reached
this level,

399
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:53,290
people expect more from us

400
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:59,629
to not make us look like fucking
failures, I don't want that.

401
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:05,502
I feel there is a difference
in how much we put into this.

402
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,841
Can you see the one in there?

403
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,809
Damn, check out the lion!

404
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,312
- Look at the lion over there.
- Go inside there.

405
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,548
That's the sound I was afraid of.

406
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,218
That's the sound
I did not want to hear.

407
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,487
They're going in there,
check it out.

408
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,323
Wait,
they are going in with the cheetahs?

409
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:30,894
That's amazing.
Are they dangerous?

410
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,130
I hope you guys
are going to enjoy it.

411
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,266
I hope there's no sissies
amongst the lot of you.

412
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:40,437
I'm a sissy. I can tell you...
I'm a sissy. Yeah. I admit.

413
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:44,508
Like there, like there.
Beautiful.

414
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,409
You can leave if you don't like it.

415
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,245
You can walk straight back out.

416
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,813
I'll be standing right there.

417
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,148
No, no, no...

418
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,582
You just stand and watch.

419
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,151
I don't want to.

420
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,686
Come on, if they try anything
on, I'll kill them.

421
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,889
I promise you.

422
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:06,796
The best way to get used to you
is allow it to lick your scent.

423
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,171
He's purring so he's OK.
Can I take my hand away?

424
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,439
You don't take the hand away.
Now?

425
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,908
Yeah, you can.
OK.

426
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,644
But it's not a problem.
No. OK.

427
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,484
You did it, though.
I didn't like it.

428
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:31,421
You didn't like it at all?
No. It's not my thing. Look.

429
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,199
Do you remember
about two years ago, when I said

430
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:46,736
we should focus on Swedish
House Mafia 100 per cent?

431
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:50,640
I don't remember if we were
on drugs or not.

432
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:54,711
We should have focused on SHM
and given up on our own stuff.

433
00:36:54,713 --> 00:37:01,284
Yes, you said that.
Then nothing happened

434
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,552
If we had committed,

435
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,555
then we could have done
this properly.

436
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,658
We're playing
for 2 x 27,000 people here.

437
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,926
To be on the level they deserve,

438
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:14,698
we should focus
on this thing only.

439
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,001
Get into the studio for months,
say goodbye to our families

440
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,608
You mean commitment.

441
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,946
Just got here?
Yeah, we did.

442
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,582
The question on a lot
of people's minds,

443
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,518
is this it, is it over?

444
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,587
Is it maybe just
a start of things,

445
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,956
you guys take a break,
do your own thing,

446
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,393
maybe come back later on?
What do you think?

447
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,262
Um...

448
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,565
How about you take this one?

449
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,838
I think we all feel the same way

450
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,542
since we all agreed
to this decision.

451
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,045
It's just that we haven't talked
about it.

452
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,619
<i>A couple of hours a week,
everything is awesome.</i>

453
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,554
<i>We get nostalgic about the music</i>

454
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:12,956
<i>and we feel the magic.</i>

455
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:17,460
<i>But then it's back
to this emptiness.</i>

456
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,566
<i>There is an elephant in the room</i>

457
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,003
The times when we've tried
to address it,

458
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:31,741
it's been very difficult

459
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:37,847
and nothing has come out of it.

460
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:44,054
So instead, we have just swept
it under the carpet.

461
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,955
We have our opinions,
but we don't talk about it.

462
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,793
That's how it is.

463
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:52,662
I mean, who likes arguments?

464
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:13,703
It's really stuffy in here,
I can't breathe.

465
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,473
This tour should be called
One Last Complaint.

466
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,807
We're complaining all the time,

467
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,909
even though everything
is perfect.

468
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,712
We're looking for things
to complain about.

469
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,949
It's messed up. I've never seen
anything like it.

470
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,083
Open the window.

471
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,885
See, now you're
complaining again.

472
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,887
I'm not, I just asked you
to open the window.

473
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:36,726
It's true. We're just trying
to find faults all the time.

474
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,662
Just enjoy, man.

475
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,668
<i>We all grew up,
it becomes different,</i>

476
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,505
<i>we don't hang out as much
as we used to,</i>

477
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,306
<i>you know, we live
in different places.</i>

478
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,075
<i>It's not the same anymore.</i>

479
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,781
<i>We are three people that
have had individual agendas</i>

480
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,218
<i>all the time, living in
different parts of the world.</i>

481
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,855
<i>We've not been able to give
Swedish House Mafia</i>

482
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:10,560
<i>the type of commitment
that it deserves.</i>

483
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,162
<i>I guess it's for every friendship</i>

484
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,732
<i>and long-distance
relationships,</i>

485
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:19,202
<i>it's tight in the beginning
and then it just fades out.</i>

486
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,690
It's a sick view from up here,
isn't it?

487
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:02,078
OK, let's check. Billboard.

488
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,814
Number one, Bruno Mars.

489
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:12,088
- Yeah! Number seven.
- What?

490
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,157
- Top ten!
- It's crazy.

491
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,928
- That's fucking wild, man.
- That's unbelievable.

492
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,973
Why the decision to finish
it with all this success with you?

493
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:34,410
It's about, you know,
us doing a world tour

494
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:37,947
and putting our other
projects on the side for a while

495
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,783
and saying hello and goodbye
to our fans.

496
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,386
And, yeah, I mean,
you can continue this, maybe.

497
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:52,729
I think, yeah, we've had
an amazing time and...

498
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:56,165
It's like my father once said,

499
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,668
if the cheetah approaches you,

500
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,070
you have to push
the cheetah down.

501
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:05,842
And so that means that,
you know, this became so big

502
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:08,111
and we really,
like Sebastian said,

503
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,647
we wanted to finish it
on the perfect level,

504
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,849
you know, so just,
"Down, cheetah".

505
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,339
They must be like:

506
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,909
"Shit, it's the president!"
No, it's three DJs from Sweden."

507
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,278
I can't see shit.
Here.

508
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,314
No, I'm gonna puke!

509
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,085
I'm gonna puke, I'm gonna puke!

510
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,092
What the fuck!
Where is it?

511
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,197
Someone is
running around with it!

512
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:49,205
<i>We went to Australia.
We rented a big house on the water.</i>

513
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:51,607
<i>We were, like, we'll try and do
"Don't You Worry Child."</i>

514
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,509
Damn, it's warm now.

515
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,977
Is it warm now?

516
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,547
Are you kidding?
Well, not that warm.

517
00:46:57,549 --> 00:46:59,182
It's set to 33 degrees Celsius.

518
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:00,283
OK.

519
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:01,818
They say there are sharks here

520
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,220
and that you shouldn't go
in the water.

521
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,323
We won't then.

522
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:12,128
I want to make music
that sounds like this view.

523
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,163
You think we can make music
that sounds like this?

524
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,631
Sure.

525
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,568
What does this sound like?

526
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,838
I think up a few notes.

527
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,278
Maybe one more.

528
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,447
One more up.

529
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,218
There!

530
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,554
I'm gonna do the beats now.

531
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,163
That's fucking tight, man.
Yeah, for sure.

532
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,602
See if any of these work.
I'll just try all of them.

533
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,107
You mean...

534
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,276
So it plays over here.

535
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,962
I want this to
come together with a baby angel

536
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,365
that I want to have on my neck.

537
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,503
He's not picking up?

538
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,539
He can't pick up if he's getting
tattooed right now.

539
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,174
How long does it take
to get a tattoo?

540
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:35,011
It depends on how complex it is.

541
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:41,017
This one took four hours
because it's got several layers.

542
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,685
What a retarded thing to do now

543
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:47,657
when we've rented a house for
half a billion to make music?

544
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:51,427
You can get a tattoo in LA,
right?

545
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,095
Last time I checked.

546
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,431
This is gonna hurt.

547
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,236
Nobody cares anymore.

548
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:04,507
I left my family, he left his
family, Steve left his family

549
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,043
to come to work
and spend five days.

550
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,545
Fuck that shit, man.
I'm tired of it.

551
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,280
Nothing's going to happen.

552
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,684
We won't finish this record
on this trip, we are not.

553
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:18,521
We need to be in the room
and be creative and have fun

554
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:22,425
and when he comes he's going
to be fucked. It hurts, man.

555
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:26,996
- I mean, it's just bad, man.
- Yeah.

556
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:30,566
Me and Ax are going to speak
to Steve when we have time

557
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:33,202
and if he doesn't
really understand it,

558
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,172
then we have
a huge problem, I mean...

559
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,312
The lost member is back.

560
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:47,984
I didn't know it was
gonna take that long.

561
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:51,053
- That was the worst idea.
- To get a tattoo?

562
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,755
I told you that three months
ago by e-mail.

563
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,757
But we're here working.

564
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:57,793
Yes, but still.
It sucks.

565
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,067
Whatever, let's just work now.

566
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:15,544
<i>We felt that we've taken
it in the right direction.</i>

567
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,581
<i>But we didn't really
get that far.</i>

568
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,550
<i>And then we had to leave.</i>

569
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,495
<i>At the same time,
things were not really</i>

570
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:35,297
<i>going so well with
Swedish House Mafia.</i>

571
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,674
I can skip it,
our stuff is more important.

572
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,714
Or we can do it tomorrow?

573
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,283
You can count on me tomorrow,
I swear.

574
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,058
<i>There's a lot of stuff</i>

575
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,560
<i>that everybody puts
time and effort in</i>

576
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,164
<i>that doesn't get credited for.</i>

577
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,399
<i>If I go to loads of
meetings about something,</i>

578
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,202
<i>I'm not going to put that
on the spreadsheets.</i>

579
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:16,705
<i>Seb dropped out of many
studio sessions for reasons</i>

580
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,707
<i>but I have never
accounted him for that</i>

581
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,676
<i>and said, "You didn't show up."</i>

582
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:25,714
<i>I don't care.
We're in this together.</i>

583
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,717
<i>You know what?</i>

584
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,220
<i>We already had the best
time with Swedish House Mafia,</i>

585
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,888
<i>so why not just leave it there,</i>

586
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:37,126
<i>because we know that
we're not going to commit.</i>

587
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:39,562
<i>We don't want to have some sort of group</i>

588
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,730
<i>that's half-assing it.</i>

589
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:45,367
<i>I feel like nobody's
pushing anything further.</i>

590
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,603
<i>We don't want to
mess up our friendship,</i>

591
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:51,107
<i>because we're angry at each
other for not working enough.</i>

592
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,778
<i>And then actually I dropped</i>

593
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,348
<i>what I'd been thinking
for a bit:</i>

594
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,618
<i>"How about we quit
Swedish House Mafia?"</i>

595
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,765
<i>It was after they left the stage</i>

596
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,634
<i>they put a thing
up on their website</i>

597
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,269
<i>saying it was no more.</i>

598
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,851
"Swedish House Mafia,
forever in my heart."

599
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:39,421
"Assholes, you don't
care about your fans."

600
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,725
"Something died in me,
faggots!"

601
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,330
"Swedish House Mafia break-up
is death of house music."

602
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,599
"You guys rewarding your fans

603
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,568
in this matter,
question mark."

604
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,205
"Now I think my biggest hope
and interest in life

605
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:59,308
has died, damn,
I'm really fucking sad."

606
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:04,446
<i>"Why, why, why. No, no, no.
Please, don't do it."</i>

607
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:10,352
<i>The call I got which was like,</i>

608
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:14,223
<i>"We're going to break up,
fuck this shit. It's evil."</i>

609
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,327
<i>It got so big, so fast.</i>

610
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,331
<i>It's only real
if you all mean it.</i>

611
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,934
<i>And you all
really love each other.</i>

612
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:29,205
<i>But the energy
is no longer pure.</i>

613
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:34,410
<i>And so</i> One Last Tour<i> was born.</i>

614
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,217
<i>The success of Swedish House Mafia</i>

615
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,419
<i>is something no one can deny,</i>

616
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:45,454
<i>you've released hit tracks,</i>

617
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:48,224
<i>played sold-out arenas
across the globe.</i>

618
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,760
<i>Aren't you afraid of
the future without SHM?</i>

619
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,230
<i>Not really.
I mean we're here now</i>

620
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,298
<i>and enjoying
the moment right now</i>

621
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,435
<i>and I'm just looking forward
to what's going to happen next.</i>

622
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:02,037
<i>There's no sort of big scheme or plan.</i>

623
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:06,275
<i>We've always done what we do
and released our stuff</i>

624
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:09,345
<i>and played big events
individually.</i>

625
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:12,615
<i>We just see this as
an end of an amazing journey</i>

626
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,516
<i>that we've done
together as friends</i>

627
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:17,653
<i>and, you know,
it just feels right.</i>

628
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:24,693
<i>We all saw an end to the limbo.</i>

629
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,796
<i>We were like,
"We need to do this."</i>

630
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:33,636
<i>And we got really excited
about ending the band.</i>

631
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:39,041
<i>And that then led to</i>

632
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:43,579
us announcing Milton Keynes Bowl
as our last show in the UK.

633
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:44,980
We said in an interview,

634
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,982
"We are premiering
our last single there."

635
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,917
So that kind of

636
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:53,055
set a time schedule
to finish that fucker,

637
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,624
because if we told 60,000 people

638
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,993
they're going to hear
"Don't You Worry Child"

639
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,796
at our show,
we better fucking finish it.

640
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,438
<i>Great to meet you guys.
You played some massive shows.</i>

641
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,540
<i>What makes this one so special?</i>

642
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:15,577
It's our last Swedish
House Mafia show in the UK.

643
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,846
<i>Can you confirm that your next single</i>

644
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,948
<i>is going to be
"Don't You Worry Child"?</i>

645
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,984
<i>Yes.</i>

646
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,653
<i>So for the last time ever in the UK,</i>

647
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,689
<i>Milton Keynes, make some noise.</i>

648
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,625
<i>The Swedish House Mafia!</i>

649
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,066
<i>"Don't You Worry Child"
received a Grammy nomination.</i>

650
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,568
<i>You are officially number one in the UK.</i>

651
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,171
<i>iTunes number one in 42 countries.</i>

652
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:53,208
<i>Swedish House Mafia's
first ever UK number one.</i>

653
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,679
We want everybody to sit down.

654
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,014
Every single person out here,

655
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,650
please sit down.
When the track kicks in,

656
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,453
we want you all to jump up.

657
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,223
Are you ready?

658
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,534
Don't you worry...

659
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,812
It's nice and warm here, huh?
Yes.

660
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:41,683
Am I in Hawaii? Is this Hawaii?
This is Malaysia.

661
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,020
Malaysia.
You have this thing here also?

662
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,555
Nice.

663
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:49,157
- Maybe you should sing a song.
- What up?

664
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:52,194
I'm OK, I'm OK, thank you.

665
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,929
You need to take one.
No.

666
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:57,132
Come on, it's impolite.
Just put it on.

667
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:58,967
Why is that?
It's impolite.

668
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,802
Who says that?
It's their culture.

669
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:02,905
I don't give a shit.

670
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,806
You know this is a theme park?

671
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,241
Oh, yeah?

672
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,915
It's so weird this whole thing.

673
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:57,593
I can't see myself DJing
when I'm 40.

674
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,029
I'll still be involved,

675
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,333
but I don't think
I'll be touring.

676
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:07,669
And you can't know how long
this scene will last

677
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,104
Time will tell.

678
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,375
Everything comes to an end.

679
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,925
I cried myself to sleep last night.

680
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,627
Really?

681
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:36,131
I'm going through some rough times.

682
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,301
That's life sometimes, I guess.

683
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:42,904
You have to clean out
all the shit.

684
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,873
That's too bad.

685
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,343
Otherwise it gets to you later,
you'll see.

686
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:55,851
I've come to a point in my life

687
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:59,054
where I want to clear things up.

688
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,256
Why can't we sit down and talk
about this like adults?

689
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:05,761
What the hell are we doing?

690
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,196
We're behaving like teens!

691
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,940
This is not gonna fly.

692
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:22,110
It's not working.
It really isn't.

693
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:31,319
<i>I focus 100 per
cent on Swedish House Mafia.</i>

694
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:36,158
<i>If you don't feel that everyone
is on the same page,</i>

695
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,027
<i>it gets really boring.</i>

696
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,798
Come on, just spit it out!

697
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,900
If you've got something
to say, say it.

698
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:46,368
What's the fucking problem?

699
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,841
If you don't deal with problems
straight away, leave it!

700
01:01:56,446 --> 01:02:00,982
It wears you down, you know.

701
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:04,052
But do we want to start a war
now? 'Cause it will be a war.

702
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,120
Aah, aah!
We need to relax, OK?

703
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,137
So fucking stupid!

704
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,902
I think Steve took off.

705
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,237
Where to?

706
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,474
I don't know.
Curly just showed him to a car.

707
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:27,562
You know, ahem,
it is what it is, man.

708
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:32,601
You know, it's like,
it's over, you know.

709
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,372
So...

710
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,545
<i>A lot of things happened this year</i>

711
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,948
<i>and made me realize that,</i>

712
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,286
you know, we're not
best friends anymore.

713
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:26,421
And that's the truth.

714
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,939
<i>Normally, we say, "Well,
we've taken it as far as we want",</i>

715
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,607
<i>and so and so and so,</i>

716
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:50,145
<i>which is also true but
maybe we are not meant to be.</i>

717
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,753
It's coming.

718
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:37,125
Come here, shark!

719
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:38,593
The winds have spoken.

720
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,223
She's grown.

721
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,260
Look.

722
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,129
You want a flower?

723
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,773
Hey, honey.

724
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,844
You can never go away again.

725
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,483
What's up?

726
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,185
Daddy.

727
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:41,122
Daddy, I love you.
I love you too.

728
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:43,324
I've missed you.

729
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:50,765
And a kiss too. How are you?
Fine.

730
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:53,068
Look, I'm going to swim.

731
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,239
Aha!

732
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,456
<i>Welcome to Indira Gandhi</i>

733
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,758
<i>International Airport,
New Delhi.</i>

734
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,128
<i>The outside temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius.</i>

735
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:52,260
- Thank you so much.
- Have a nice day.

736
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,586
Nikhil, when was the first time
I came to India?

737
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,488
2007.

738
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,858
It was so different
and the energy was so amazing

739
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,162
that I was just like,
"Wow, this is something else.

740
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:29,697
I have to come here
more often."

741
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,667
The scene that we have
in India today

742
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,904
with millions of fans
of dance music.

743
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:38,439
This guy's fault.
He started it.

744
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,880
An old friend of mine.

745
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,785
<i>I think Axwell's going to be surprised</i>

746
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,921
<i>by the number of fans
he has in India now</i>

747
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:55,356
<i>compared to what
was going on in 2007.</i>

748
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:11,539
I would like to go crazy
and hear the music like...

749
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:23,218
There're so many fucking people
here to see them right now.

750
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:30,658
<i>I've got a special connect
with them so when I see them play</i>

751
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,260
<i>I get a special feeling</i>

752
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:35,230
which I don't get
when I see other DJs play.

753
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,756
My name is Axwell.

754
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:37,759
This is Sebastian Ingrosso
and Steve Angello,

755
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:40,528
and we are
the Swedish House Mafia.

756
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,707
Whoo!

757
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,619
What happened tonight?
Axwell,

758
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,555
Sebastian Ingrosso,
and Steve Angello,

759
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:43,091
killed the fuck
out of this place.

760
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:45,727
Tonight was madness.

761
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:48,396
<i>I can't even speak.</i>

762
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:55,436
We've been waiting for this
for so long. You have no idea.

763
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:57,572
<i>I think we're going
to say that it's probably</i>

764
01:12:57,574 --> 01:13:00,742
<i>the change of house
movement in India, you know.</i>

765
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,677
Let's say it's come of age.

766
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:05,179
Seeing about like
15,000-20,000 people,

767
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:09,484
<i>EDM has come of age in India.
Let's put it that way.</i>

768
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,718
I want to smoke so bad seeing you do that.

769
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,119
You look like Burt Reynolds.

770
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,954
I could give you a blowjob.

771
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,060
You'll just feel bad
if you smoke. Don't do it.

772
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:57,031
Relax and pass me that thing.
It's just a damn cigarette.

773
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,066
I just want your best, bro.

774
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:00,935
I know, bro.

775
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,022
<i>Hey, Michelle, it's Amy.</i>

776
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,790
I really have got to be quick.

777
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,560
I'm in the middle
of literally running a festival,

778
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:28,896
so when can we do this call
and how long will it be?

779
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:34,068
<i>I'm basically the
chairwoman of Swedish House Mafia.</i>

780
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:39,640
<i>They are kind of like
my second family, I suppose.</i>

781
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,977
<i>I rang Steve Angello,
"Can I book you?</i>

782
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,947
<i>Can I do some stuff with you?"
He was like, "Sure."</i>

783
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:48,182
<i>I also called Axwell.</i>

784
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:51,219
<i>Steve introduced me
to Sebastian.</i>

785
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:56,123
I just remember
that they had swagger,

786
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:59,660
especially Steve,
especially Steve.

787
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,998
<i>I think they knew
they could have swagger</i>

788
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,567
<i>because they knew their
music was so fucking good.</i>

789
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:09,937
<i>You know, they knew what
they were hearing.</i>

790
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,706
<i>They knew what they were making.</i>

791
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:15,810
And they were kind of like,
"Yeah, listen to that." Ha, ha!

792
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,182
And you are?

793
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,784
Steve Angello.
OK, good.

794
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,189
Comments?
Phat.

795
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,611
Axwell, what do you have to say?

796
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:53,581
In the beginning,
there was house.

797
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,349
In the end, there was house.

798
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,852
And in the middle
there is Axwell.

799
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,928
<i>I think some of us made some mistakes</i>

800
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:11,832
<i>and the fact that we haven't
been able to sit down</i>

801
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:16,837
<i>and say sorry to each
other is a tragedy.</i>

802
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:20,341
<i>But I also think that
even if we said sorry,</i>

803
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,843
<i>I don't think it would fix it.</i>

804
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:29,250
<i>And I think that we all
want to be happy</i>

805
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,154
<i>more than we want to be
in Swedish House Mafia.</i>

806
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,058
<i>We're pleased to have with us today</i>

807
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,260
<i>the members of
Swedish House Mafia:</i>

808
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,964
Axwell, Steve Angello
and Sebastian Ingrosso

809
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,333
to help us light
the Empire State Building.

810
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:47,602
<i>Hello, New York,
this is actually</i>

811
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,638
the first time we visit
the Empire State Building.

812
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,608
And what an awesome way
to visit it in,

813
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,210
you know, having it
lit up in the Swedish colors.

814
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,223
It's coming to an end very soon.

815
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,759
The circle is about
to be completed.

816
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:18,366
It's starting to feel
very emotional.

817
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,668
At the start of the tour,
it never felt like the end.

818
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:24,238
The end was so far away.

819
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,308
I wasn't thinking that it would
all be over so soon.

820
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:32,380
Do you regret it?
Sometimes. Sometimes.

821
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:35,082
Look, here comes
Sebastian Ingrosso.

822
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:38,185
And look now,
I'm Swedish House Mafia.

823
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,855
Ta-da!

824
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,890
Can we have a picture before you go on?

825
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:45,793
With your badass outfit.
Yeah!

826
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:48,229
You need to chill out
in a big way.

827
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:49,997
I'm saying it's good.

828
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:53,467
He said it's my best
outfit ever if I added oil.

829
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:56,370
I mean, I'm just saying,
that's not right.

830
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,474
Alex, who am I?

831
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:01,709
Sebastian.

832
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:05,246
And now?
Swedish House Mafia.

833
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:13,220
<i>We needed Ax to be
the guy that always was there.</i>

834
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,857
<i>And I myself,
pretty bad in the beginning,</i>

835
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,492
<i>partying and, like,</i>

836
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:21,162
<i>taking maybe Ax or Steve
for granted a little bit.</i>

837
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,297
<i>I can be with these
fucking people here</i>

838
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,700
<i>at this after-party,
they will fix that.</i>

839
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,702
And then four years later

840
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:30,404
I woke up and was like,
"What have I done?"

841
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,274
<i>But, you know,
this year and the year before,</i>

842
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:37,278
<i>I've been working my ass off
to prove to both Ax and Steve</i>

843
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,915
<i>that I wanted to give
something back to them</i>

844
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:43,451
<i>for how many years
they have been there</i>

845
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,419
<i>and got my back.</i>

846
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:20,187
What's up? You want to party?
What's up?

847
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:23,157
She's like, "I'm Paris Hilton",
and I'm, "I don't give a fuck."

848
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:26,393
I just want a hug.

849
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,030
I'm just so hyped.

850
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,566
Wow, I'm going to fuck
this nightclub into pussy.

851
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,157
You've got swag.

852
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,998
Never seen so much
people smile. Kind of like...

853
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:43,537
Who can say that they have
been playing drums

854
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,441
at Madison Square Garden?
I can.

855
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,476
Steve! Ax!

856
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,216
I took off my earplugs.

857
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:57,852
I took a vodka shot,
because it was so great.

858
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,353
Oh, you took a vodka shot?

859
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,890
Yeah, like this big.
I needed to.

860
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,959
If it continues like this,

861
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:08,028
by the end of the tour
we'll be back to doing coke,

862
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,431
just getting hammered
all the time.

863
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:13,334
Yeah, I think so, too.
We're going to, the last show:

864
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:17,671
Back to the start again.
Ha-ha-ha!

865
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,375
Why not?
Why the fuck not?

866
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,525
<i>So just tell us why you chose Miami</i>

867
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:14,395
<i>to end the Swedish House Mafia?</i>

868
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:19,233
<i>We always come back to
Miami every year for the conference</i>

869
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,335
<i>and it kind of felt natural to</i>

870
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,070
spread the ashes here

871
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:26,206
so we can come and visit
from time to time. Ha, ha.

872
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,509
<i>Say hi to the boys.</i>
I will.

873
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,511
<i>The best of luck
and thanks so much</i>

874
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:32,980
<i>for everything that
you've done for everybody</i>

875
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,049
<i>and then the good times
you've given everybody.</i>

876
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:37,484
Thank you, man. Thank you.

877
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:50,230
This is something
we were doing on our own before.

878
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:53,567
And we will keep doing it
on our own after this.

879
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,273
It's actually not that strange.

880
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:07,314
We're all different, you know.

881
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,690
It's hard to...

882
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:28,535
Anyway it's over now.
This was the last...

883
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,212
<i>I feel that you have a lot of things</i>

884
01:23:38,214 --> 01:23:40,514
<i>between you three
that is unsaid.</i>

885
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,183
<i>Yeah, it's probably
never going to be said either,</i>

886
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,519
<i>maybe in the future.
Well, you never know.</i>

887
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,523
<i>Then we will be older and,
hopefully,</i>

888
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,126
<i>we'll meet each other in Ibiza</i>

889
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:54,428
or have a glass of wine
or whatever

890
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,030
and talk about it or not.

891
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,110
At the start say:

892
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,212
"I'm...
This is Steve, this is Sebastian,

893
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:13,781
we are still
the Swedish House Mafia."

894
01:24:13,783 --> 01:24:15,783
Or I can say:

895
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:18,819
"We are the Swedish
House Mafia for one last time."

896
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,320
No, I think it's better
to say...

897
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,089
It's much better.

898
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,591
More massive. When you said it
last time, I was like aaah!

899
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:27,628
I felt like I was in the crowd
and wanted to fuck everyone.

900
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,798
OK, fine then.

901
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,634
Yes, it's like poof!

902
01:24:33,636 --> 01:24:37,171
Damn, are we up soon?
Yes.

903
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:40,174
Are you sure?
Very shortly.

904
01:24:40,176 --> 01:24:41,475
We should go up there

905
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:43,811
and get into the vibe,
play some drums.

906
01:24:43,813 --> 01:24:47,247
Need to get into the rhythm.
Damn, I'm stressed out now.

907
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,994
Miami.

908
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:45,732
I'll always be their friend,
obviously.

909
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:48,669
But it's just not
the same work-wise anymore.

910
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,506
<i>We had an amazing thing</i>

911
01:26:52,508 --> 01:26:58,011
<i>and it's always sad to see
things go that you loved.</i>

912
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:00,380
But look at us now,
we've endured.

913
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,382
<i>We have this thing
to look back on</i>

914
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:05,819
<i>and I think that's something
that I would like to treasure.</i>

915
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,957
Gracefully, we will
have a friendship,

916
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:12,993
we will have
a graceful friendship.

917
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:14,661
It's sad, you know,

918
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:17,998
when you think about it
but it's also very beautiful

919
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,800
because we made
something together

920
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:21,435
and we were best friends.

921
01:27:21,437 --> 01:27:24,504
<i>And we took
this journey together</i>

922
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:26,506
so it's not this little thing

923
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:28,508
just in the end
of not committing to things

924
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,044
that breaks this up.
It's just we want to leave it,

925
01:27:31,046 --> 01:27:34,748
we don't want to end our
friendship in a super bad way,

926
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,383
it could be worse, it could be

927
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:38,552
flying chairs
in the fucking faces

928
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:41,421
and hitting
each other with knives. Heh.

929
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,757
But that's what we
don't want, you know.

930
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,910
Let us hear you singing, Miami.

931
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,084
You can do louder!

932
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:21,528
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

933
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:25,065
thank you for this great
journey that you've given us,

934
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:28,702
all the places we've been
and all the love we got.

935
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,119
Words can't describe
how I feel right now.

936
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:47,988
I'm so sad.
I'm like happy but sad.

937
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,456
<i>At the same time.</i>

938
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:55,062
Madison Square Garden,
Barclays, Barclays,

939
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:58,098
I only go to my brothers
that many times, you understand?

940
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,634
Vibes are strong, energy.

941
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,704
I'm never getting
over that ever.

942
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:05,505
Best night of my life.

943
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:08,675
It's sad to see them leave.
They're going to be fine.

944
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,377
You mean individually, yeah,

945
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:12,746
but it would be nice
to see them together.

946
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:14,614
<i>Maybe they'll
come back from there.</i>

947
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:16,850
They should stay together.

948
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,618
Because everyone loves them

949
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,088
and they're just
a great group of people.

950
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:30,964
They were
the best thing happened

951
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:32,966
in my entire life.
The best thing.

952
01:29:32,968 --> 01:29:35,902
Human beings can't
take emotion out of me,

953
01:29:35,904 --> 01:29:38,705
but Swedish House Mafia
apparently can.

954
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,877
I can die happy.
I can die happy.

955
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:04,865
We are still
the Swedish House Mafia.

956
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,998
Miami, thank you so much.

957
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,868
You know that we came,

958
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:45,505
you know that we raved,
and that we love you!
