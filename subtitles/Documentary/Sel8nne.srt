1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,844
"My time will come"

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:07,484
"I'll play as long as it's fun"

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:10,170
Teemu wants to quit on top

4
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:12,896
Teemu Selanne:
"I take everything too lightly"

5
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,970
He is a tremendous hockey
player with a lot of class.

6
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,092
And he's only getting better.

7
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:10,209
We boo the other players
who have come back -

8
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,527
but Teemu... it will be one of
the biggest cheers ever. I guarantee it.

9
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,925
2012 June
Helsinki-Vantaa Airport

10
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,570
I'm not good at being alone.

11
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,611
I am happiest
when I get to do things -

12
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:30,330
and do them with others.

13
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:36,894
Therefore, it was obvious
that whatever I do -

14
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,524
I do it with other people.

15
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,249
When you meet Teemu -

16
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,045
there is immediately
a positive aura -

17
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,134
that is emotionally charged.

18
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,651
He symbolizes Anaheim.

19
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,968
When someone thinks of the Anaheim Ducks,
they think of Teemu Selanne.

20
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:02,492
There's always a bunch
of people around him.

21
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,374
There is always something happening.

22
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,972
Teemu's bad at making decisions.
It's frustrating.

23
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:11,573
Teemu want to arrive
and he wants to win.

24
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:15,126
I think Teemu's intelligence as
a hockey player is unsurpassed.

25
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:20,730
Teemu has always hated losing.

26
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:24,174
Every time we put on
skates -

27
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,292
we are taking a pretty big risk.

28
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:30,734
A hit or a skate blade
against your neck -

29
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,773
can end your life.

30
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:36,096
Hi, Bob. It's Teemu.

31
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,808
How're you doing?

32
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,614
I'm good.

33
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,086
Yeah, I have actually.

34
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:50,090
You can count me in. I'm
really excited about it.

35
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,971
I'm ready to come back
for one more year.

36
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:57,169
An average NHL career
is about four years.

37
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:03,809
These are the last moments
I can still play there.

38
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:09,893
It would be sad to end the career
just because there is a lockout.

39
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:18,730
It was the weekend before
I would start serving in the army.

40
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:24,287
I was celebrating my last
"free" weekend with my friends.

41
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,572
We slept at a friend's place.

42
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:31,253
For some reason I felt
very nauseous in the morning.

43
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,852
My friend's mom
woke us up and said,

44
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,365
"Teemu, you have been drafted to the NHL."

45
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,925
I asked where.

46
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,487
"To Winnipeg."

47
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:48,006
"First round."
I turned -

48
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,051
and went back to sleep.

49
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:54,765
When I woke up, I asked again
which team it was.

50
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:59,735
Here in Finland many people told me -

51
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,887
That I won't succeed in the NHL.

52
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:05,765
I was hungry
and wanted to show myself -

53
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:09,053
I can play there
and play well.

54
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,414
It was easy to go there
because they had other finns.

55
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,488
Teppo put me on cleaning duty.

56
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,171
Teppo had played there for four years.

57
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:21,928
It helped a lot.

58
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,088
Teemu trusted Teppo so
much that in the morning -

59
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,168
he never knew
when training began.

60
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,167
He always phoned Teppo.

61
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,804
<i> This is Winnipeg Jets' </ i>
<i> last training -

62
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:35,490
<i> before the season's first game tonight. </i>

63
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:38,216
<i> Winnipeg's biggest newspaper </ i>
<i> celebrates the new star. </ i>

64
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:41,015
<i> "Selanne is one of </ i>
<i> the best players in the world -

65
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:44,009
<i> And maybe the Jets' most interesting </ i>
<i> player in a long time. "

66
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:47,772
It was great pressure on me.
I had not played yet.

67
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:52,293
I knew how people found out
What kind of the new guy is.

68
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:57,689
Location was the Cow Palace,
San Jose.

69
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,567
We played power play -

70
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:04,365
and I shot from
my own position.

71
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,732
It went in under the glove.

72
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,928
It was like a snowball
going downhill.

73
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:13,656
My confidence grew.

74
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:16,451
He's such a phenomenal talent.

75
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:23,653
I just couldn't take my eyes off him,
when I watched Winnibeg play.

76
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:27,888
I scored and I knew
I'd get another one.

77
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,535
I was so hungry.

78
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:33,565
Three years from now will Winnipeg
be able to afford Teemu Selanne?

79
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:37,809
If the Jets are in the NHL
they'll have to.

80
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:41,013
Don treated me like a son.

81
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,089
He was much more
than an agent.

82
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,008
We trained in the morning.

83
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:49,533
I was in charge of the training sessions.

84
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:53,170
I was on the ice
when the team came out.

85
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:58,933
The door was open.
I wondered what was going on.

86
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,928
Teemu's not there.

87
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,849
He was a rookie,
our youngest players.

88
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,849
Everyone else was ready for training.

89
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:11,889
Suddenly he came on the ice.

90
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:14,696
He had a plastic bucket on his head.

91
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,775
On the bucket there
was the word "Domi."

92
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:20,689
Domi came from
New York Rangers.

93
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,689
Tie Domi got angry
and went after Teemu.

94
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,812
They skated around the rink -

95
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,809
but obviously he
can't catch Teemu.

96
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:32,286
Everyone laughed.
And I would train them...

97
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,526
Domi was an enforcer
and a good friend of mine.

98
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:40,607
Phil Housley had an important role
when Teemu broke the rookie record.

99
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:46,171
We had a unique chemistry
when we were out there.

100
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:52,809
Being able to read each other, find each other,
and we just knew where we were gonna be.

101
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:56,852
<i> Selanne taking a pass from Phil Housley. </i>

102
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,576
I think he got 20 breakaways
during the season.

103
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:04,249
Even though the teams knew we were gonna
do that play, we still executed it.

104
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,254
I went home after training
in the afternoon.

105
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:16,973
Head coach, John Paddock,
called me.

106
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,736
He was sick and could not come to the game.

107
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,654
I was the head coach.

108
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,808
It was the first game
he had a chance of -

109
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,048
beating a legendary record.

110
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,689
It was my first game
as head coach.

111
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:03,165
The game was suspended for half an hour.

112
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:08,255
People made speeches.
Teemu got a car.

113
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,976
The car came in
with Paavo behind the wheel.

114
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:18,093
Teemu went forward.
The audience stood up and applauded.

115
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,407
It is indescribable.

116
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:24,171
People didn't realise then -

117
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:28,011
that Teemu's record
will probably never be broken.

118
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:37,212
We were on a boat trip
from Helsinki to Rauma.

119
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:41,847
In Turku my wife began feeling
it was time.

120
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:46,453
We went to the University Hospital
for a radiograph.

121
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:51,055
We were told that we would have twins.

122
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,885
Teemu was born 20 minutes before me.

123
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:57,015
It was crowded,
so I kicked him out.

124
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:03,692
Paavo is conscientious,
warm-hearted and diligent.

125
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,730
A proper old-fashioned boy.

126
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:12,250
Teemu, on the other hand,
was very purposeful.

127
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,249
He is also warm-hearted
and helpful.

128
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,772
He is wise
and very social.

129
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,693
The boys started
skating in Lauttasaari -

130
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,528
when they were four.

131
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:28,166
We bought skates
and they got to skate in the park.

132
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,526
The stick was like a third leg.

133
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,005
It made it easier
to stand up.

134
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,736
I remember when we moved to Nöykkiö.

135
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:40,128
Suddenly we had a villa.
We had a large garden.

136
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:43,413
We had no close neighbors,
which was fun.

137
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:48,934
We often had a dozen kids
who played and did everything possible -

138
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,291
in our garden.

139
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,892
Sometimes our kids were not even there.

140
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,809
We also made films.

141
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:01,969
Tidy up that old hag.
- Okay, sure.

142
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:04,173
The sports park in upper Kivenlahti

143
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:09,535
The boys came
always here during the winter.

144
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:13,845
The boys didn't have time for mischief
because they were always here.

145
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,812
Our parents were strict.

146
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,492
Strong-willed children need
strong-willed parents.

147
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:23,728
Discipline was needed,
especially with twins.

148
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,653
We did get to practice with Panu first.

149
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:32,048
With three guys you have to be determined.

150
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,935
The boys always
carried their own equipment -

151
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,814
and took care of it.

152
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,525
If they didn't hang
up the equipment to dry -

153
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,886
they had to play in damp gear.

154
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:48,285
Teemu has probably never
complained about the discipline.

155
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,168
He appreciates it now.

156
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,453
In Nöykkiö we weren't allowed to shower -

157
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:56,130
If we hadn't run or trained.

158
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:03,170
We had bedtime at nine
until we were fifteen.

159
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,334
Dad thought that young people need rest.

160
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,049
I also believe -

161
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,730
that rest is important
for development.

162
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,534
We leave in half an hour.

163
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,567
Take a shower, I'll make breakfast.

164
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,728
Paavo's role was
trying to keep up with Teemu -

165
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:22,128
and ensure that he doesn't do anything stupid.

166
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:28,175
Teemu didn't like it
because Paavo was more sensible.

167
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,372
He wouldn't do some things Teemu would.

168
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:33,093
The rules in the rink -

169
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:37,534
were almost the only rules
he respected.

170
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:42,451
Paavo always saved and
hid his weekly allowance.

171
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:48,771
Panu and I wasted ours
and looked for Paavo's stash.

172
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,536
If we found his money,
we splurged it, too.

173
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,448
But when we got caught -

174
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:57,052
Paavo got our allowances
next week.

175
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,891
Change the vests. You must wear your own.
- Okay.

176
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:05,408
Panus buddies started drinking.

177
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:09,128
Then they started using drugs -

178
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,494
and hard drugs.

179
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:17,411
In the end, they got involved in crime.

180
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,893
My name is Panu Selanne,
Teemus and Paavo's big brother.

181
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,008
I am four years older.

182
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,726
I have no title at the moment.

183
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:31,646
Panu has been our
family's black sheep.

184
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:35,047
I was a good bad example.

185
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,969
<i> Selanne streaking down the right side -

186
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,933
<i> and Selanne scores! </ i>

187
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:50,969
I had never seen another player
with such passion to score.

188
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,172
It was our last game
of the season.

189
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:57,773
I had scored 1 goal more
than Alexander Mogilnyj -

190
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,654
before the last games.

191
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:03,173
We competed
for the NHL goal scoring title.

192
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:06,567
Buffalo's game at the East Coast
was over before ours began.

193
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,489
He scored twice.
He ​​had 76 goals against my 75.

194
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,294
I had a chance.

195
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,606
I scored a goal
in the second period.

196
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:18,249
We had a 5-on-3 powerplay
at the end of the game.

197
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,567
The guys tried their best
to help me score -

198
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,328
but I couldn't.

199
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:26,056
Later Mogilnyj
and I became friends -

200
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:29,686
so it was fun to share the honor.

201
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:32,896
And The Calder Award goes to...

202
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,293
... Teemu Selanne.

203
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:38,249
I appreciate recieving this award.

204
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:45,528
Especially when this year
we had so many good rookies.

205
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:51,885
I don't want to forget to say
thanks to many people in Finland -

206
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:58,209
who have helped me so much
in making this night possible. Thank you.

207
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:06,935
When you come to a new team
and a new city -

208
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:12,489
teammates usually help you to
find a place to live, a car and so on.

209
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:16,365
Sirpa and I looked at many houses.

210
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,528
When I saw this house,
I said "Wow!"

211
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,493
We were here for over two hours.

212
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,886
I looked around, thinking.

213
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:27,854
On the way home I said to Sirpa -

214
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:31,532
that we can't
go back to our old house.

215
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,574
We must do it. We'll buy it.

216
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:39,369
So we bought it and now
we have lived here for over 12 years.

217
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:43,495
This is an incredible place.
We love it.

218
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,372
My life is perfect now
with the NHL lockout.

219
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:52,012
He helps me at home
and takes the boys to training.

220
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,655
I cook!

221
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:57,605
There are seven people
here all the time.

222
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,926
There are six in the family -

223
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:05,409
and now we have Tatu, 17,
living here.

224
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,407
He is my nephew.

225
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,048
Turn there.

226
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,736
Eemil scored a goal
and Tatu scored twice.

227
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:31,330
The boys take hockey seriously.

228
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,610
I don't have time for any own hobbies -

229
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:58,054
when I have two sons
at different ages.

230
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:08,567
He looked like a small crow
during the first practice.

231
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:14,652
His hair stood up...
he was so excited.

232
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:18,492
He wore swetpants
and sneakers.

233
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:21,090
Not fishing clothes, but almost.

234
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:24,931
We bought a trailer for the family.

235
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:29,487
We drove around Finland
to the children's tournaments.

236
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,811
I also kept on with athletics.

237
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,134
I played football,
hockey and bandy.

238
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:40,935
and I also trained skating.

239
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:49,684
I was quite small,
even when I was 13-14.

240
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:54,329
My football and hockey coaches said

241
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:59,174
that athletics might suit me better.

242
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,685
I was fast,
but still persistent.

243
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:05,644
I competed in 60 and 100
but even 1,000 meters.

244
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,365
<i> Teemu Selänne's free kick. </ i>
<i> A very hard shot. </ i>

245
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:12,807
At 15 years old Teemu trained
with the national junior team in football.

246
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,686
Then he had to choose
between football and hockey.

247
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:20,691
Hitherto Teemu played
in Espoon Jääklubi -

248
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:25,094
which was a successful team
in boys born in 1970.

249
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,927
They were unofficial Finnish champion.

250
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:34,126
They had so many boys
they had two teams: A1 and A2.

251
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:38,653
Paavo was the goalie of A2
and Teemu stayed in A1.

252
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:42,092
Jorma lkonen,
Teemus coach at the time -

253
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:48,408
did a fine job
and taught him the basics.

254
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:50,966
He taught Teemu to skate.

255
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:56,449
It was clearly
that the family went for the one -

256
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:59,176
which had better resources.

257
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:04,975
My twin brother Paavo
didn't have the same motivation -

258
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:08,691
getting up
to the highest level.

259
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:11,812
One must have a great desire -

260
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:15,489
and fight his way up with his elbows
if necessary.

261
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:19,934
I was a bit annoyed when dad
didn't drive me to training -

262
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:23,850
As often as he drove Teemu.

263
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,974
I felt sorry for Paavo
who dragged his big bag along -

264
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:28,728
already as a little boy.

265
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,932
Paavo's also really funny.

266
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:33,132
Teemu and Paavo often joke -

267
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:37,608
and sometimes become a
bit angry with each other.

268
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:43,455
I think Paavo
is a little smarter than Teemu.

269
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:46,494
But don't tell Teemu
that I said this.

270
00:18:46,696 --> 00:18:51,816
Paavo has supported Teemu
in an admirable way -

271
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,246
throughout Teemu's career.

272
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,566
He has been a big part
of Teemu's life.

273
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,894
He ​​has encouraged and defended him.

274
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,487
One more game.

275
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:15,564
I transferred from Espoon Jääklubi
to Jokerit when I turned fifteen.

276
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:21,212
At the same time Jokerit got
a new coach, Leo Äikäs.

277
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:25,894
Teemu was not a child star
at the time.

278
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,564
He trained passionately.

279
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:32,854
I think his father was
part of Teemus exercising -

280
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,655
in a way I did not know.

281
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:38,968
I was a little scared and thought -

282
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:43,175
that the father might be
demanding too much of him.

283
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:49,491
I retired from the coaching
when Teemu got a professional trainer.

284
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:54,810
I was not bitter or sad -

285
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,649
but I missed it.

286
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:02,851
Leo became like a second father.

287
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,451
Teemu's appetite was incredible.

288
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:10,690
I have never seen anything like it.

289
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,410
One time we ate steak.

290
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:17,854
Teemu ate his in a flash.

291
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:22,134
He asked if I was still hungry
-

292
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:24,093
and if there were any leftovers.

293
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,053
I gave him my own steak.

294
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:29,288
He often takes food
from others' plates.

295
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:35,008
Everything went fine.
Anything could happen.

296
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:40,045
When we trained hard,
Teemu's knee problems began.

297
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,774
There were growing pains.

298
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:45,406
It was like a bullet in the knee.

299
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,488
He would have had to play,
but he could not.

300
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:50,806
He ​​crawled back to the bench from the ice.

301
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:54,651
We tried to get on
alternative exercises.

302
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:58,812
We knew he must train.

303
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:02,651
Some painkillers
probably would have helped -

304
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,534
but we did not use any.

305
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:10,374
Daddy massaged Teemus
knees so he could sleep.

306
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,887
And he liked it -

307
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,616
because he always asked me to
massage the knees.

308
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,654
I had a lot of pain
for about a year.

309
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,895
If everyone would have liked
winning as much as Leo -

310
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,887
We would have been invincible.

311
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:28,446
As a coach, I aim to win -

312
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,374
and also to maintain the team's wellbeing -

313
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:33,767
and let the players
develop as individuals.

314
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:39,568
I demand punctuality
and good manners.

315
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:44,014
We also talked about the school.

316
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,525
Everything can not be about hockey.

317
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:51,452
Parental demands for Teemu's
schoolwork was not as severe.

318
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:55,689
It was an unspoken deal
that he can invest in sports.

319
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:01,135
The message I got from home
was clear:

320
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,932
"Do things you enjoy."

321
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,806
When we saw that Teemu was talented
and loved to play -

322
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:14,608
, it was clear that he can
study later in life if he wants to.

323
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:21,769
He didn't do much
homework in high school.

324
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:26,692
He copied mostly from me.

325
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:29,450
Or I did his homework.

326
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:33,012
It was a good idea
until there was a test.

327
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:38,693
When I barely passed
our parents told -

328
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:42,013
that it didn't look particularly good.

329
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:47,776
I had to
brush up on my school work a little.

330
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:52,128
Then I got mediocre grades.
It didn't require much.

331
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:58,007
After the elementary school, I thought
about what I wanted to do.

332
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,485
I went into
commercial school.

333
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:03,046
I trained
in the morning -

334
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,686
and went to school and ate lunch.

335
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:08,488
Sometimes I ate twice.

336
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:13,816
During the second year
I didn't even have my books with me.

337
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,088
I never graduated.

338
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:20,009
I knew I didn't need it.

339
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,055
I asked people
if there was any kindergarten -

340
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:24,808
that needed help.

341
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:29,015
In the beginning he got paid,
but when the contract ran out -

342
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:32,885
he worked in exchange for food.

343
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,686
It was a fun job.

344
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:41,370
I got to play and clown
with six-year-old pre-school children.

345
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:45,565
The working hours were perfect,
nine to one.

346
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:52,130
I got to think of something
other than hockey for a while.

347
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,935
And it forced me to
get out of bed.

348
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:04,046
One day I noticed
that he was unusually quiet.

349
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:10,534
I sensed that something had happened.

350
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:18,126
I remember it was
a sunny spring day.

351
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,213
Or maybe it was summer.

352
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:24,130
Our parents asked us to
get to the kitchen.

353
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,447
They told us what would happen.

354
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:30,767
We thought they were so independent -

355
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:35,326
that we could get divorced.

356
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:41,213
They waited until you were 15
before they divorced.

357
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:44,533
The children took it sensibly.

358
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:46,891
I rebelled a little.

359
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:52,414
The divorce was a surprise.
At least for Teemu and me.

360
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:55,215
Was it? - It was a shock.
At least for me.

361
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,976
We had never seen them argue.

362
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:03,565
They kept it all hidden -

363
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:07,246
to create a healthy home.

364
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:11,092
I wondered why we didn't travel together.

365
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:17,367
We were later told
who they traveled with.

366
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:23,095
It was hard to accept that
dad had a new woman in his life.

367
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:28,495
We probably didn't treat Kirsi
as well as she'd deserve.

368
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:33,647
Teemu did not accept that a new
woman took his mother's place.

369
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,772
He became engaged at age 16.

370
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:42,769
Teemu searched
security and stability in our relationship.

371
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:47,168
Anu was a good athlete.
She was a finswimmer.

372
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:51,329
Teemu has always been
charismatic and charming.

373
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:58,254
It was a surprise when Teemu,
normally smart -

374
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:00,930
came and asked for money.

375
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:05,051
300 Marks.
It was a large sum.

376
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,133
I asked why.

377
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,688
He said he would tell me later.

378
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:14,732
We got engaged
quickly and merrily.

379
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:18,486
I was told that he needed
money for a ring.

380
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:22,285
Teenage Love is tough.

381
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,653
Anu was an exchange student
in Seattle for a year.

382
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:28,250
I even sold my
motorbike -

383
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,965
so that I could fly there
and see Anu.

384
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:38,735
After that Teemu
became better known -

385
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,252
and people were more interested -

386
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,852
than when I got him
for myself.

387
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:49,806
I had no time
for a girlfriend anymore.

388
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,214
Not a steady one anyway.

389
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,651
We rode motorcycles together.

390
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:57,410
We went around Finland every summer.

391
00:26:57,776 --> 00:27:00,529
We turned many cities
upside down.

392
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,173
It's fun to look back to the time
when I played in Jokerit.

393
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:08,615
There was a great atmosphere
around the whole team.

394
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:12,088
I became his secretary
when he started in Jokerit.

395
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:18,333
Sometimes, I received mail from
girls who sent nude pictures.

396
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,532
It felt incredible.

397
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:24,773
I opened and read all the letters.

398
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:28,053
If there were issues,
I asked Teemu's opinion.

399
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:30,850
He became a star that year.

400
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,729
He was the best
player in Finland -

401
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:37,332
when Jokerit won the Finnish championship.

402
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,647
We created his stardom
systematically.

403
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:44,809
It was not hard.
He ​​is a natural star.

404
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:46,648
<i> He shoots! </ I>

405
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:52,688
<i> He scores! </ I>

406
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:56,093
He became the "milk boy" then.

407
00:27:56,616 --> 00:28:01,406
The advertisements were made in the USA.
It was really good advertising.

408
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:05,485
Teemu also has
narcissistic traits.

409
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,574
He wants to be the best -

410
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:11,012
and maybe not the hottest,
but whatever.

411
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:19,892
He doesn't drink only milk.

412
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:23,248
<i> Product of the Month </ i>
<i> is Teemu Selanne... </ i>

413
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:26,772
No other athlete
has been featured in more -

414
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:30,212
nonsense articles than Teemu.
Teemu sells papers.

415
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,815
Hello!

416
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,889
Media has always treated
him with kid gloves.

417
00:28:36,056 --> 00:28:39,048
It's because Teemu
can charm people.

418
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,652
Media has always treated me well.

419
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,245
I have also tried to live in a way -

420
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:49,008
that does not cause
any major scandals.

421
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:55,570
Once I'd buy
candy or something with the kids -

422
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,488
when I saw the headline.

423
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:01,012
I turned the children's heads
and suggested another store.

424
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:05,767
People like to talk
about negative things.

425
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:10,846
One hears rumors about Teemu
or even me.

426
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:14,249
People often point out that
hockey players, -

427
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:21,174
athletes and stars
often have women around him.

428
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:24,809
One must remember -

429
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:28,056
what acting stupidly
can cost.

430
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:30,571
We both are pretty jealous.

431
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,285
Many people find it hard to believe
Teemu is also is jealous.

432
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:38,730
No one can come between two people
if there is no room.

433
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,292
1993 SUMMER l FINLAND

434
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:45,209
AFTER THE FIRST NHL SEASON

435
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:50,409
When I came back to Finland
there was much hubbub.

436
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,692
I had to learn to deal with it.

437
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:56,644
People I know asked me to come
to Corporate events.

438
00:29:56,816 --> 00:30:00,809
I had a lot of sponsor stuff
I had promised to do.

439
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:06,374
Sometimes I came home
at ten o'clock in the evening.

440
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:10,415
I called Sirpa and told her to take my running shoes
-

441
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,886
and come to
the Kirkkonummi intersection -

442
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,093
so that I could train even a little.

443
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:21,534
I recall the journey
back to North America.

444
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:24,609
I sat on the plane -

445
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:30,055
and thought:
"Thank God, now I can rest."

446
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:34,045
And I can assure you of
that the NHL is not a resting place.

447
00:30:34,216 --> 00:30:38,255
I learned a lesson
and grew as a person.

448
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,333
Sometimes you have to be selfish.

449
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:47,810
Our mothers met
before we were born.

450
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:51,686
I was head
in a retirement home in Ruskeasuo.

451
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:53,812
Sirpa's parents lived there.

452
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:57,732
When my oldest son, Panu, was born -

453
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:01,332
I went there on
prenatal counseling.

454
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:04,693
Sirpa's mom was there with
Sirpa's sister, Jaana.

455
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:06,847
My mother became pregnant with me -

456
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:10,804
and after a year Liisa became pregnant
with Teemu and Paavo.

457
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:14,332
Liisa borrowed
the maternity dress of my mother.

458
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:17,886
Our mothers had the same
maternity dress when we were on our way.

459
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:22,010
We moved to Lauttasaari,
but we kept in touch.

460
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,929
Our kids played together
and such.

461
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:28,449
Then we didn't see very often.

462
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:31,972
Our families had other things.

463
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:36,255
When Paavo graduated from high school -

464
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,726
Sirpa and her parents
came to the party.

465
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:45,284
I think it was actually
the next day after the graduation party.

466
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:48,050
I got home from training.

467
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:51,253
He had worn out
Adidas sweatpants.

468
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:55,204
He pulled down his pants
and showed us his underpants.

469
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,253
We thought he was pretty bold.

470
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,488
I thought immediately
that she was very  pretty.

471
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:04,012
We talked all evening.

472
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,327
When Sirpa and her parents left
-

473
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:10,125
I thought there was
something special about her.

474
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:16,087
I was a bit shy and wondered
if I could call her.

475
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,366
Teemu asked me to
call Sirpa's mother -

476
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,845
And ask if
Sirpa had a boyfriend.

477
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:23,132
I called and asked -

478
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:28,172
if she wanted to come to a
Pink Floyd concert with me.

479
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:33,735
The mothers were very happy
because the families knew each other.

480
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:37,571
They thought it was nice
that the children were together.

481
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,933
Teemu was a very popular young man.

482
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:44,375
He had lots of girl fans.

483
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:48,211
We wondered if we could walk hand in hand -

484
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,731
or if fans would disagree.

485
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:58,651
I was conscious about it
in some interviews.

486
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,889
I wanted the girls to know
that Teemu had a girlfriend.

487
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:09,134
I got married first
of my buddies.

488
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:12,886
We had decided that whenever there's a stag party -

489
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,411
we design a tattoo
for the groom.

490
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,208
I was blindfolded.

491
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:20,174
I didn't know
where we were going.

492
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:25,091
I thought we were at the strip club.
I was hoping that, anyway.

493
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:30,894
Then I heard the sound
of a tattoo machine.

494
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:32,648
"Holy shit!"

495
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,852
The guys had drawn a picture -

496
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,655
of Finnish flag
with a lightning bolt through.

497
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:42,407
When the tattoo artist recognized
it was me in the chair -

498
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:46,609
he became so confused
that the flag's colors were reversed.

499
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:50,007
It looks like a "Swedish Flash."

500
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:55,370
When I played in Colorado
with Peter Forsberg -

501
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,686
he said: "I knew it."

502
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:01,246
"Deep inside, you always have
wanted to be Swedish."

503
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:08,095
Teemu had a friend
he had known for a long time.

504
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,413
That friend leaked photos
from Teemu's wedding -

505
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:14,453
to the magazine "7 päivää."

506
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,206
The friendship ended right there.

507
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:23,844
<i> It was an easy choice </ i>
<i> I bought salty licorice candy </ i>

508
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:29,092
<i> I bought every salty licorice candy </ i>
<i> in the whole store </ i>

509
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:35,607
<i> Then I was banned from the</ i>
<i> store for the rest of my life </ i>

510
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:47,046
There was much talk
that you would play in SM-liiga.

511
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:51,732
But you stayed in Jokerit
and Division One.

512
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,292
Why this decision?

513
00:34:54,496 --> 00:35:00,412
I thought the
league is too tough right now -

514
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:04,569
since I willl
start doing military service in June -

515
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,376
at the Defence Forces Sports School.

516
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:12,610
Jokerit played in division one
and the team was almost bankrupt.

517
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,686
HIFK also wanted us.

518
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:19,327
But Jokerit had a coach
named Leo Äikäs.

519
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:24,288
I don't know what he was doing,
perhaps it had something to do with money -

520
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:28,046
But he got Teemu
to stay in Jokerit.

521
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:30,093
We were four 18 year-old players -

522
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:32,770
who decided to stay another year.

523
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:36,326
Keijo Säilynoja, Waltteri lmmonen
and Mika Strömberg.

524
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:42,129
I should have known
that now I have to do a good bid.

525
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:45,288
But I did not.
A big mistake.

526
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:50,452
It was a tough year.
I played about 120 matches.

527
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:54,245
I played for Jokerit and also their junior team,
the national junior team -

528
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,570
and the army team.

529
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:04,565
The fifth games in Division One's
promotion series were played today.

530
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:09,011
<i> Jokerit led 3 to 1
<i> after the first period. </ I>

531
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:11,611
<i> Match result was 5 to 2. </i>

532
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:17,254
It was 19. October 1989.

533
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:20,693
It felt as if my whole life had just stopped.

534
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:25,449
Jokerit against JYP in overtime.

535
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,733
I remember the time.
It was 60:56.

536
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:34,890
A guy tried to hit me
and I tried to get away.

537
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:39,652
My foot got stuck
between his legs and he fell.

538
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:45,005
You could see from the leg
that this was something serious.

539
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,214
We thought his career was over.

540
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,008
I tried to get up -

541
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:55,567
but I realized that my foot was hanging like this.

542
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:57,852
Both bones had been broken.

543
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,167
It was only
tendons and skin that held it together.

544
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,129
I cried
and so did Teemu.

545
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:09,006
I woke up many times during the night
-

546
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:12,407
and wished that it was a nightmare.

547
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,613
I missed a whole year.

548
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:20,130
I had a long plaster
for three months.

549
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,487
I remember when
plaster was removed.

550
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:26,932
I didn't know if I should
laugh or cry.

551
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:31,726
The leg was just skin and bones.

552
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,727
I thought that everything is over.

553
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:37,329
I trained one month just to
learn to walk again.

554
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:40,772
Afterwards I told
that he needed it.

555
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:43,132
It was a good thing.

556
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,084
I no longer took for granted
that I was healthy -

557
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,531
and that my body worked.

558
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:55,254
Ever since I was little -

559
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:59,932
we've said evening prayers
before bedtime.

560
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:04,135
I believe in God
and a higher power.

561
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,007
Teemu took to prayer.

562
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:11,934
When he said his prayers -

563
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:15,486
he mentioned all the friends
that God should protect.

564
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:20,571
It was not enough that
he prayed for his cousins.

565
00:38:20,856 --> 00:38:22,926
I remember what he said -

566
00:38:23,096 --> 00:38:27,135
"Dear God, let Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter
-

567
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,093
become really good friends."

568
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:35,534
15000 euro for both organizations.

569
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:37,926
I want to thank you all.

570
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:42,135
Our family will come to Finland
in mid-June.

571
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:45,769
I have three things I must do:

572
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:47,892
Children's Hospitals' golf tournament -

573
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:52,652
my Finnish Flash Golf Tournament
and a hockey camp in Vuokatti.

574
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:56,604
Markus Ketterer, Waltteri lmmonen,
Keijo Säilynoja and I -

575
00:38:56,776 --> 00:38:59,006
started a hockey camp -

576
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:02,771
so we wouldn't need to
go to other people's camps.

577
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:06,815
We decided to
make it a charity thing.

578
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,971
This year is our 18th anniversary.

579
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:15,927
Our reward is
that we see young people having fun.

580
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:20,895
Hello?

581
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:26,414
Our reward is
when we hear the nurses tell -

582
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:32,094
how patients cope
many days without painkillers.

583
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:34,167
The boys get so excited.

584
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:38,614
At home I hug
my kids a little extra.

585
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,494
I have been very lucky.

586
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:49,854
<i> These passes are dangerous. </ I>
<i> Teemu Selanne on a breakaway. </ I>

587
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,854
<i> A perfect ending. </ I>

588
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,007
I remember when I had the broken leg....

589
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:59,567
I flew in America to see
three playoff games.

590
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:01,806
I remember how I watched those guys.

591
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:07,334
The hatred between the teams
was totally sick.

592
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,249
The teams played ugly and hard.

593
00:40:11,336 --> 00:40:15,011
I remember when I got home.

594
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:19,130
I felt a surge of motivation.

595
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:22,094
I didn't know
if I could play in the NHL -

596
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:25,054
but I decided
to work hard.

597
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,207
I also practiced boxing.

598
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,571
Jokerit was near bankruptcy.

599
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:32,330
A friend and I bought the team.

600
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:37,616
Hjallis and I got Teemu
to stay in Finland for another year.

601
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:41,610
Teemu was riding in my car once.

602
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:44,973
I thought:
"Damn, I'm not letting him out -

603
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:46,967
until we have a contract."

604
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:50,685
<i> Jokerit players throw </ i>
<i> their sticks and gloves up. </ I>

605
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,892
We were far superior.

606
00:40:53,136 --> 00:41:00,929
<i> Jokerit are Finnish champions </ i>
<i> of the 1991-92 season. </ I>

607
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:04,486
Jokerit's last championship was in 1973.

608
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:08,735
What did you do then?
- Shoveled shit in a sandbox.

609
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:12,855
But you won't in any case play
in Finland next season.

610
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,688
Probably not.

611
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:17,131
It was as inserting
money in the bank -

612
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:19,366
When he played in Jokerit
for another year.

613
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:22,895
When I think of
my time with Jokerit -

614
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:25,490
it makes me warm inside.

615
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:27,726
Deep inside he is a Jokeri.

616
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:33,529
If you ask me,
, he has always been -

617
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:38,048
one of the most important figures
in Jokerit.

618
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:48,731
In the NHL there is a rule
that if you don't have a contract -

619
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:51,330
within three years
after being drafted -

620
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:53,532
you'll become a free agent.

621
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:55,368
It happened to me.

622
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:58,528
Don and I flew to San Jose.

623
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,574
The team was very interested.

624
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:05,527
While we were there we got a
phone call from the Calgary Flames.

625
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:09,805
We decided to fly to Calgary.

626
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:16,968
In the end, we signed a
contract with Calgary.

627
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:22,212
Winnipeg matched their offer,
so I started my career there.

628
00:42:23,176 --> 00:42:26,486
He has been a good investment -

629
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:29,005
Both on and off the ice.

630
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:32,765
We are like racehorses.
As long as we run good -

631
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:37,327
they take care of us.
When we can't manage to run anymore -

632
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:39,373
they make sausages out of us.

633
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:43,006
People thought it was a shame
when the team left town.

634
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:46,413
There is nothing more
than hockey in Winnipeg.

635
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:49,765
Three of us had the same salary:

636
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:53,770
Alexei Zjamnov,
Keith Tkachuk and me.

637
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:58,248
The team had
to sell one of us.

638
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:01,405
 The PR manager gave me a phone -

639
00:43:01,656 --> 00:43:05,046
and said that the owner
wanted to talk to me.

640
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:08,049
The owner called me and said, -

641
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:12,289
there's lots of rumors but that
I definitely was not for sale.

642
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:16,893
10 days later
we trained in our home rink -

643
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:22,565
when I was asked to leave to
answer a phone call.

644
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:26,331
The General manager
said that he had had a tough day -

645
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:30,489
and that he had sold me.

646
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:35,133
After a minute's silence
I asked where I'm going.

647
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,093
"To Anaheim."

648
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:42,494
Again there was a moment of silence
and after that I said "Thank you."

649
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:47,572
Sirpa was nearly nine months pregnant.

650
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:50,967
A few weeks earlier
Sirpa had asked me -

651
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:53,326
if I would take her to Disneyland.

652
00:43:53,656 --> 00:43:57,331
I promised I
would do it one day.

653
00:43:58,216 --> 00:43:59,968
Then I drove home.

654
00:44:00,656 --> 00:44:04,012
Sirpa immediately noticed that
something was wrong.

655
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:06,212
She asked what had happened.

656
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:09,368
I said that now she can go
to Disneyland every day -

657
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:11,128
if she so desires.

658
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:14,094
I said we have been
sold to Anaheim.

659
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:17,329
I went there the
very next day.

660
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,092
I had conflicting emotions.

661
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:23,134
I knew it would be fun to play in Anaheim.

662
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:28,689
I knew I would
get to play with Paul Kariya.

663
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:35,612
I remember the first morning
in Anaheim after I was sold.

664
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:39,252
It was probably 26 degrees Celsius.

665
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:42,613
I walked out from the hotel
to get breakfast.

666
00:44:42,776 --> 00:44:45,165
It was truly a paradise.

667
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:50,808
Two weeks later, I flew back
to Winnipeg for Eemil's birth.

668
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:54,013
We had decided
to trigger the birth.

669
00:44:54,176 --> 00:44:57,248
Everything was arranged around
my schedule.

670
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:02,490
It was a bit funny
but I wanted to be there.

671
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,294
I was quite nervous.

672
00:45:04,656 --> 00:45:09,810
Three o'clock Teemu phoned
and said they had a boy.

673
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:15,814
I remember the incredible feeling -

674
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:18,126
when I got to hold my own child.

675
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:24,014
I took out my buddies
to celebrate the birth.

676
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:31,415
We were out a little later
than we had planned.

677
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:33,965
I flew to Anaheim in the morning.

678
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:36,604
In the evening I had a game.
I was completely exhausted.

679
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,530
After warming up
I wanted almost skip the game.

680
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:45,255
But I had skipped a game
already, so I did not complain.

681
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:47,414
I started playing -

682
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:50,369
I don't know
where the energy came from -

683
00:45:50,536 --> 00:45:53,414
but I had a great night.

684
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:57,172
After the game, I wasn't even tired.

685
00:45:57,336 --> 00:46:00,328
I even had
a hat trick.

686
00:46:16,616 --> 00:46:18,846
How ya doin'?
- Good!

687
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:22,292
Paul Kariya and I became
good friends.

688
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:25,056
I had met him
at the all-star game -

689
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,047
two weeks before I was sold.

690
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:32,651
He joked that
I should play in Anaheim.

691
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:38,210
Everything Teemu did,
shooting, passing -

692
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,930
he did it at top speed.

693
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:44,054
I also liked to do
everything at top speed.

694
00:46:44,216 --> 00:46:48,732
If I had good chemistry with a player before -

695
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:54,090
maybe he was  intelligent and a good passer,
but he couldn't do it at top speed -

696
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:57,487
or maybe he was just a good goal scorer.

697
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:03,686
Teemu did everything at top speed
and at the highest level.

698
00:47:03,976 --> 00:47:09,494
We just knew where
each other was on the ice.

699
00:47:09,816 --> 00:47:16,085
Paul needed somebody like Teemu
to bring him out of his shell.

700
00:47:16,256 --> 00:47:18,053
He was very quiet.

701
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:21,208
He ​​needed somebody upbeat and
positive and... noisy.

702
00:47:21,496 --> 00:47:23,646
I got half of my pay for my playing

703
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:26,614
and the rest because I
taught Paul to be a human.

704
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,126
When we got to a hotel -

705
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:33,891
he ran to the hotel
to avoid signing autographs.

706
00:47:34,136 --> 00:47:37,208
I learned from Paul his
dedication to hockey -

707
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,968
and to everything he did.

708
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:41,047
I have never seen anything like it.

709
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:44,891
Who's gonna pay the whole bill?

710
00:47:45,056 --> 00:47:48,048
I took all the cards and I

711
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:52,732
held Paul's card like this.

712
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:57,208
I squeezed it so hard
he couldn't get it.

713
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:01,369
And Paul wondered: "how I always
lose the big ones?"

714
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:05,127
You never told me that.

715
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,805
2012-2013 SEASON

716
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:13,014
I have often laughed
with the other women -

717
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:17,772
that the NHL is like a kindergarten.

718
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:24,091
These adult males
can't say no to anything.

719
00:48:24,256 --> 00:48:30,855
Pretty demanding of your schedule and your energy
to go out there every game and trying to perform your best.

720
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:36,853
You can't find the same things
anywhere else as from your team -

721
00:48:37,016 --> 00:48:38,813
and life in the NHL.

722
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:41,365
Sometimes it's a roller-coaster.

723
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:43,652
One's emotions go up and down.

724
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:48,970
It is a love-hate relationship.

725
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:54,250
It's easy to live
according to certain procedures.

726
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:57,726
You don't have to think
on something else.

727
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:02,206
Off the ice
he offers leadership.

728
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,253
He's a leader by nature.

729
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,725
Then he brings an upbeat uproach.

730
00:49:06,896 --> 00:49:08,648
He is a positive guy.

731
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:12,604
Doesn't matter if you won 5 to 1
lost 8 to 1.

732
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:16,366
He's happy and excited to
be a hockey player.

733
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,004
He brings positive energy to the team.

734
00:49:19,176 --> 00:49:21,167
It's almost impossible to replace that.

735
00:49:22,216 --> 00:49:26,448
Five games, seven days.
I get to play enough.

736
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:31,491
We have two kinds of days:
game day and between days.

737
00:49:31,656 --> 00:49:33,453
They are quite alike.

738
00:49:35,896 --> 00:49:38,456
A game day morning workout
is optional.

739
00:49:38,696 --> 00:49:42,450
I often come to the arena
not knowing whether I will practice.

740
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:44,413
A couple of meetings -

741
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:47,488
and then I go home,
eat and take a nap.

742
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:50,330
Sirpa has made pasta
on game days for 20 years.

743
00:49:50,496 --> 00:49:54,011
Always quite the same.

744
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:58,294
It has always been...
- Good? - Yes.

745
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:00,765
He has a professional attitude -

746
00:50:00,936 --> 00:50:03,769
towards training
and preparation.

747
00:50:03,936 --> 00:50:08,088
I followed him as a young boy
and tried to learn from him.

748
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:13,689
There is pressure to win
and a fear of losing.

749
00:50:13,896 --> 00:50:18,447
I'm aware of it
but I do not think about it much.

750
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:24,691
A typical thing for top athletes
is their tolerance for stress.

751
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,416
Some don't even know what stress is.

752
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:29,214
They are very laid back.

753
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:34,211
The guy is always smiling,
but he still is a warrior.

754
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:36,173
Physically and mentally.

755
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,213
He wants to win and score goals.

756
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:42,449
He is a dangerous player
because he is so fast -

757
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:44,493
and can scores from bad positions.

758
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:48,610
He makes very ugly goals -

759
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,764
tip-ins and rebound goals.

760
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:58,165
I have always had a sidekick
and then a third link in the chain.

761
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:01,931
Right now I have none of them.

762
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:06,567
When he's on his game, I play him a lot,
'cause I know good things are gonna happen.

763
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:13,245
If you don't need ice packs
after the game -

764
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,213
you haven't played hard enough.

765
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:17,773
When I get up in the morning -

766
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:20,814
I take my first steps
gently -

767
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:22,807
to see where it hurts.

768
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:29,533
It's challenging to recover quickly
after a game.

769
00:51:29,696 --> 00:51:33,928
I stretch
10-15 minutes every night.

770
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:36,166
We also have
cold and hot baths.

771
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:38,611
Two minutes in both -

772
00:51:38,776 --> 00:51:42,530
maybe four times,
so I get lactic acid moving.

773
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:45,654
Careers are longer nowadays -

774
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:49,451
because medicine
and especially treating injuries  -

775
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:51,607
have evolved greatly.

776
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:57,013
This year, I have noticed that if we have
games two days in a row -

777
00:51:57,216 --> 00:52:01,414
I don't have full energy
in the second game.

778
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:05,169
I guess my age is starting to show.

779
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:09,007
We were away for 13 days -

780
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:12,566
and for some reason
I slept poorly all the time.

781
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:15,967
A few times I thought
that this probably is my last year.

782
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:21,130
But after a few days of rest
and a good game -

783
00:52:21,296 --> 00:52:25,369
you change your mind.
I realized this is pretty fun.

784
00:52:25,696 --> 00:52:31,532
He won't probably stop playing
hockey until a doctor forbids him.

785
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:35,609
When we played 26 games in 44 days -

786
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:41,132
there were nights when I wasn't recovered.

787
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:44,766
I am grateful that my old
body did not give up.

788
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:50,370
I like to listen to Finnish music.

789
00:52:50,536 --> 00:52:52,766
I do not know if I'm homesick -

790
00:52:53,216 --> 00:52:57,687
but especially abroad
and on game trips -

791
00:52:57,856 --> 00:53:01,451
music has a special significance.

792
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:04,694
When I'm driving home late at night
-

793
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:07,575
listening to Arttu Wiskari
makes me feel good.

794
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:16,568
<i> It was June 1986, </ i>
<i> our Sierra was almost new </ i>

795
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:22,051
<i> Dad filled up, </ i>
<i> mom packed lunch < / i>

796
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:32,005
<i> I was already sitting in the back seat, </ i>
<i> I smiled broadly with the seat belt on </ i>

797
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:37,045
<i> Dingo sang about the girl in the leather jacket </ i>

798
00:53:40,096 --> 00:53:42,007
My brother Paavo called me.

799
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:46,294
My father had suffered a stroke.
Fortunately, a fairly mild.

800
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:52,932
He lost feeling in his hand
and his posture was crooked.

801
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,007
His eyelids drooped.

802
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:58,568
Such news make you stop and think
to stay up -

803
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,534
especially when you live
far from Finland -

804
00:54:01,896 --> 00:54:03,932
and your loved ones.

805
00:54:12,176 --> 00:54:15,168
We fly often in
really bad weather -

806
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:18,772
because we have a
game the next day.

807
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:23,367
It's idiotic.
It scares me the most.

808
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:27,927
What happened last year -

809
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:32,009
has always been my biggest nightmare.

810
00:54:32,176 --> 00:54:35,771
When the plane crashed in Yaroslavl -

811
00:54:36,216 --> 00:54:40,926
I felt that this is not
worth playing anymore.

812
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:45,131
I lost  many old teammates.

813
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:48,851
Ruslan Salej
was a really good friend of mine.

814
00:54:49,016 --> 00:54:52,053
I played with Igor
Korolev in Winnipeg.

815
00:54:52,216 --> 00:54:55,208
And Karpovtsev...
They were unbelievable guys.

816
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:19,012
I sharpened Teemu's skates
until he turned 12.

817
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:24,170
Most players don't know a thing about
skate sharpening and curvatures.

818
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:27,852
We were lucky enough
to get to try different versions -

819
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:29,813
and find the best one.

820
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:34,489
We tried many different options.

821
00:55:34,736 --> 00:55:37,808
Many said that I sharpened them wrong.

822
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:40,291
They said that the grooves were too deep.

823
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:42,731
That human ankles can't handle it.

824
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:47,085
I was the doorman at the pub
Kosmos for 30 years.

825
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,087
Near the end of the second period -

826
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:52,214
I got a phone call from Ismo
Syvähuoko, the Jokerit doctor.

827
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:55,174
He said Teemu's skates need
to be sharpened.

828
00:55:55,336 --> 00:55:58,931
I called a taxi
and went to the arena.

829
00:55:59,096 --> 00:56:02,486
I went to the grinding room
in my suit.

830
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,448
I sharpened his skates, -

831
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:07,176
jumped into a taxi
and went back to work.

832
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:11,052
He sharpened 10 blades for me
before every NHL season.

833
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:16,928
We followed what he had done in Finland
and just tried to emulate that.

834
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,007
We developed a padding -

835
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:22,964
which was between the glove
and the elbow pad -

836
00:56:23,136 --> 00:56:25,252
to protect his arms.

837
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:28,052
The ice is better in Finland -

838
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:33,812
and I used to play
with this narrower blade.

839
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:37,133
The ice in the NHL is really bad.

840
00:56:37,696 --> 00:56:43,373
It turns to slush
after five minutes of play.

841
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:46,496
It was annoying
to get a good pass -

842
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:48,806
that bounced over the blade.

843
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:51,046
This makes the stick a little heavier.

844
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:54,891
It bothers many players,
but I don't mind.

845
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:57,412
I can say with my hand on my heart -

846
00:56:57,576 --> 00:57:00,807
that I haven't heard about
any player who has doped -

847
00:57:00,976 --> 00:57:02,807
or even been offered any.

848
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,968
A hockey player can fill himself
with drugs -

849
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:08,331
but it takes so much more.

850
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:13,092
You have to have hockey sense,
skill and technique.

851
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:17,414
There are sports
that doping suit.

852
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:20,613
Ice hockey is not one of them.

853
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:26,044
All the Finnish top coaches
in individual sports -

854
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:29,492
like Kari-Pekka Kyro,
are convinced -

855
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:32,853
that most NHL players
use illegal drugs.

856
00:57:33,056 --> 00:57:36,765
Ice hockey is the world's toughest sport.

857
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:40,767
They have skates and a stick -

858
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:42,853
A small puck and they play on ice.

859
00:57:43,016 --> 00:57:44,529
If the alternative is -

860
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:48,086
earning $ 1,500 a month
in the East Coast Hockey League -

861
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,928
or a million a year in the NHL -

862
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:52,291
you'd do anything
to play in the NHL.

863
00:57:52,456 --> 00:57:55,573
You can't be on drugs -

864
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:58,569
if you want to move fast
in a small area.

865
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:04,215
Since doping is forbidden,

866
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:06,767
if we want to get rid of the problem -

867
00:58:06,936 --> 00:58:10,531
cheaters must be banned
for life right away.

868
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,891
1991 WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS

869
00:58:15,936 --> 00:58:17,574
<i> Selanne shoots! </ i>

870
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:25,894
When I was a small boy
I wanted to play in SM-liiga.

871
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,209
My dream was
to be in the national team.

872
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:37,052
My fantasy, which felt distant
and even unrealistic -

873
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:40,014
was to get to the NHL.

874
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:46,845
I played in a 4 country tournament
in Seinäjoki when I was 16.

875
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:49,406
When I got the national team jersey -

876
00:58:49,576 --> 00:58:53,251
I shuddered because I had
dreamed about it for so long.

877
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:59,605
The national team has helped me
step into bigger boots.

878
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,930
<i> Teemu scores! </ i>

879
00:59:03,296 --> 00:59:06,527
The Nagano Olympics
were an incredible experience.

880
00:59:06,696 --> 00:59:10,974
For the first time
the best players from the NHL -

881
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:13,127
played in their national teams.

882
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,093
<i> Two against one. </ I>

883
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:19,566
<i> Koivu, Selanne. </ I>
<i> Selanne scores! </ i>

884
00:59:19,776 --> 00:59:22,688
The quarter final was the first
"do or die" game.

885
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:25,495
Sweden had their <i> dream team. </ I>

886
00:59:25,656 --> 00:59:29,615
<i> Nice pass from Saku Koivu </ i>

887
00:59:30,856 --> 00:59:35,486
In the 1999 World Championships
the finals were a two game series.

888
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:39,574
We lost the first
against the Czechs with one goal -

889
00:59:39,736 --> 00:59:42,204
won the second with three goals.

890
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:46,528
I celebrated for a while
before I remembered the rules.

891
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:51,454
The atmosphere was a bit flat
when we went into overtime.

892
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:54,809
We lost in overtime.

893
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:59,016
<i> So it goes. </ I>
<i> Nothing to do about it. </ I>

894
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:06,048
In the 2006 Olympics -

895
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:08,692
we were without a doubt the best team.

896
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:12,087
All the pieces fell into place.

897
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:15,286
Everyone found his role immediately.

898
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:22,006
Too bad we lost in the final.

899
01:00:22,776 --> 01:00:24,732
<i> Sweden win Olympic gold! </ i>

900
01:00:24,896 --> 01:00:28,935
I would also have
wanted to win with the national team.

901
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:41,094
My brother Panu and I
are both social.

902
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:47,412
Panu needed money for drugs.

903
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:52,295
We saw him sink really low.

904
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:56,330
He was like a warning sign
for Paavo and me.

905
01:00:56,496 --> 01:00:58,293
We'll never go that route.

906
01:00:58,536 --> 01:01:01,209
I have often thought of -

907
01:01:01,376 --> 01:01:05,927
how much it was my fault -

908
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:08,696
and what I could have
done differently.

909
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:12,007
When Panu sat inside
in Sörnäinen Prison -

910
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:15,692
he called me and asked for 500 Marks.

911
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:18,848
"Come on Saturday
when it's visiting hours."

912
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:24,966
We rolled up the money.

913
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:30,251
Then we gave them to Panu
who hid them somewhere.

914
01:01:30,976 --> 01:01:36,528
He is my dear brother.
You try to help any way you can.

915
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:38,891
Paavo has always
helped him a lot.

916
01:01:39,056 --> 01:01:41,047
And Mom, Dad and everyone else.

917
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:45,124
I do know now
what I should have done.

918
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:48,732
I should have spent more
time with my family.

919
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:52,127
But it's good -

920
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:57,893
That Panu has been clean
for over ten years.

921
01:01:58,056 --> 01:02:03,050
Paavo has been tougher
against Panu.

922
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:05,605
He has said that we shouldn't
help him now.

923
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:09,286
He has caused his own problems
and he must take the consequences.

924
01:02:10,016 --> 01:02:14,248
In my budget, I have counted
a moped a year to Panu -

925
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:17,974
because he has absolutely
incredible stories.

926
01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:23,688
Panu is going to
visit for a month now.

927
01:02:24,176 --> 01:02:26,406
Panu!
- Hey!

928
01:02:27,736 --> 01:02:31,251
Leevi, how are you?
- My little darling.

929
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:33,694
Good to see you.

930
01:02:33,856 --> 01:02:35,767
Teemu! How're you doing?

931
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:38,606
Come here.
- Okay.

932
01:02:40,496 --> 01:02:43,329
Hey, what's your name?
- Daisy.

933
01:02:43,736 --> 01:02:46,125
Wow, that's a beautiful name.

934
01:02:46,456 --> 01:02:48,845
A friend gave me a book called -

935
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:51,406
"How to choose
the sex of your child."

936
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:55,206
Sirpa said that she wants a daughter.

937
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:58,607
She was begging for two months.
I said, "Absolutely not."

938
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:02,974
I begged for one month.
- It felt like two.

939
01:03:03,496 --> 01:03:08,365
Sirpa
read the book and then I looked through it.

940
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:12,808
The book seemed logical.

941
01:03:13,176 --> 01:03:18,045
I wrote down a list of things
I would not have to do -

942
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:19,894
and she signed it immediately.

943
01:03:21,136 --> 01:03:24,685
We started working on the project.

944
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,213
If ovulation
was on a Wednesday -

945
01:03:28,816 --> 01:03:33,936
you would start early
if you wanted a girl.

946
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:39,848
After 60 or 70 hours
all the boy sperms are gone.

947
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,328
More than 90 percent are girls.

948
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:45,852
We followed the instructions.

949
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:50,812
It was great to hear the
gynecologist say it was a girl.

950
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:53,968
The relationship between a father and a daughter
is special.

951
01:03:54,136 --> 01:03:59,256
After Veera was born
Teemu has now and then said -

952
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,407
that maybe we could have
another girl.

953
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:03,532
I have put a stop to it.

954
01:04:03,696 --> 01:04:06,164
He can beg all he wants -

955
01:04:06,336 --> 01:04:07,928
but there will be no more kids.

956
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:12,251
Ever since he was a little boy,
, Teemu has woken up like a little bird.

957
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,408
He was never grumpy.
Veera is the same.

958
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:20,854
For many athletes
sport is their own thing -

959
01:04:21,016 --> 01:04:22,927
and their families suffer.

960
01:04:23,096 --> 01:04:27,328
But in this family, it is
a lifestyle for everyone.

961
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:32,094
He is my idol.

962
01:04:32,656 --> 01:04:35,170
Naturally he's my dad too.

963
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:40,524
He has always been there for
me, when nobody else is.

964
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:44,573
How was the game?
- Okay.

965
01:04:44,736 --> 01:04:50,811
My dad plays in the NHL
and is doing something he loves.

966
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:54,335
But it isn't necessarily
a real job.

967
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,211
He always stops here.

968
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:04,326
If there is even one person here,
, he writes an autograph.

969
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:09,484
I never tell anybody
 who my father is.

970
01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:15,646
I don't want to be recognized
because I'm Teemu Selanne's son.

971
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:20,887
Top athletes are selfish.

972
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:23,769
They wouldn't be as good
if they were not.

973
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:27,008
They do what they want to
and when they want to do it.

974
01:05:29,656 --> 01:05:31,214
Oh, they're swimming.

975
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:38,406
It doesn't matter which one is the
top athlete in a relationship -

976
01:05:38,576 --> 01:05:42,171
the partner must understand what he or she needs.

977
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,213
Otherwise things won't work.

978
01:05:44,976 --> 01:05:49,015
Teemu is the boss here.
I am his slave.

979
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:52,688
He's making a sandwich in the kitchen.

980
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:54,733
I am in the living room.

981
01:05:54,936 --> 01:05:56,927
Then he asks me to come to the kitchen.

982
01:05:57,096 --> 01:06:03,569
He might ask me to give him
a cheese slicer from the sink.

983
01:06:03,736 --> 01:06:05,135
Do not believe her.

984
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:08,652
Sometimes it irritates me
that Teemu doesn't help me -

985
01:06:08,856 --> 01:06:11,529
as much as other men
help -

986
01:06:11,696 --> 01:06:14,574
with the children and household chores.

987
01:06:14,736 --> 01:06:18,524
If Teemu needs to
do something unpleasant -

988
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:20,812
cancel an order or anything -

989
01:06:21,096 --> 01:06:23,052
he always asked Paavo to do it.

990
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:27,005
He has always had difficulty
to do unpleasant things.

991
01:06:27,176 --> 01:06:30,168
He has become accustomed to
someone else taking care of them.

992
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:34,967
Paavo or mother
and now it has been me.

993
01:06:35,136 --> 01:06:38,208
Or some friend.

994
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:42,005
He has trusted buddies
who fix things for him.

995
01:06:42,176 --> 01:06:45,213
Teemu would not
sit on a jetty alone -

996
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,934
and stare out to sea.

997
01:06:47,096 --> 01:06:50,054
He lives by his friends.

998
01:06:51,016 --> 01:06:55,328
Teemu has had so
many friends during his life.

999
01:06:55,536 --> 01:07:01,566
He has known Pumu and Haba
since childhood.

1000
01:07:01,736 --> 01:07:05,729
He is still good friends with
Keijo and Waltteri -

1001
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,694
and the other guys from Jokerit.

1002
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:14,734
I and my brother's buddies
have always been welcome.

1003
01:07:15,056 --> 01:07:17,854
We offer food, drink and shelter.

1004
01:07:18,216 --> 01:07:22,926
Sometimes our home is
like a Gypsy camp.

1005
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:26,970
Our friends are like
family members.

1006
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:33,368
Teemu was a little boy
when we started working together.

1007
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:38,855
If I have any problems,
I always call lmmu.

1008
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:42,452
He always helps me.
Whatever it is.

1009
01:07:42,776 --> 01:07:45,529
Teemu said that you are his best friend.

1010
01:07:49,896 --> 01:07:51,295
Yes.

1011
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:56,086
It's true.
Teemu is my best friend, too.

1012
01:07:56,536 --> 01:08:00,085
He's probably
a dictator at home.

1013
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:02,645
What he says goes.

1014
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:06,406
He ​​is trying to convince everyone else too:

1015
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,126
"Don't listen to your wives.
Do as you please."

1016
01:08:10,896 --> 01:08:16,334
We call him Dr. Phil
because he's so eager -

1017
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:21,968
to meddle with
other people's relationships.

1018
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:24,605
He can be damn annoying -

1019
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:29,207
because he is always late.

1020
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:33,291
He's always the last one on the bus.

1021
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:37,648
Teemu always came last
and he always ran to the bus.

1022
01:08:38,096 --> 01:08:42,135
Many times we just drove off
and let him run after the bus -

1023
01:08:42,296 --> 01:08:44,207
a few hundred meters.

1024
01:08:44,376 --> 01:08:46,094
I told him:

1025
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:49,532
"If you miss the fucking helicopter
I won't wait for you."

1026
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:52,290
"I've been waiting for you
so damn many times."

1027
01:08:52,456 --> 01:08:54,287
That time he was 10 minutes early.

1028
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:57,294
You were on a game trip.
- Game trip?

1029
01:08:57,456 --> 01:08:59,014
I missed you.

1030
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:07,605
Will you take a nap there?
You'll be sweating soon.

1031
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,368
I am totally exhausted.

1032
01:09:09,616 --> 01:09:16,328
Every family has their problems, of course.

1033
01:09:16,576 --> 01:09:20,125
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1034
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:22,770
They can talk about things.

1035
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:26,326
The most important thing is that the
resolve their conflicts with love.

1036
01:09:26,736 --> 01:09:30,126
When you're in a car with me
I am responsible for you.

1037
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:34,008
What if a drunk driver
runs right into us -

1038
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:36,212
and you don't wear a seat belt.

1039
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:40,206
Your parents would ask me
why you didn't have a seat belt on.

1040
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:42,008
"He didn't wanna."

1041
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:44,890
You won't go to the party.
- Yes.

1042
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:50,853
He needs a punishment.
- He must learn.

1043
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:53,570
Leevi is like Teemu
when he was little.

1044
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:56,534
He is mischievous
and not very obedient.

1045
01:09:56,696 --> 01:10:00,132
Show a picture of the girl.
Is she so hot -

1046
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,094
you want to sacrifice
this much for her?

1047
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:08,325
Teemu gets angry
when I want to be out late.

1048
01:10:09,016 --> 01:10:10,768
That's our biggest problem.

1049
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:15,205
What kind of parent is Teemu?

1050
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:16,975
Soft.

1051
01:10:19,736 --> 01:10:21,294
Too soft.

1052
01:10:21,496 --> 01:10:25,045
So now you get to go to the party?
- Yes, this time.

1053
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:29,093
Treat others as you want to be treated.

1054
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:31,969
It is the main principle in our family.

1055
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,771
Hey! Where's my coffee?

1056
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:37,455
Wifey!

1057
01:10:40,056 --> 01:10:43,765
Where's my coffee?
- A Moment.

1058
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:45,928
Bad service here.

1059
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,293
After years of training...

1060
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:56,495
Here is the gentleman's coffee
in a special cup.

1061
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:59,251
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1062
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:06,047
Sirpa ! Delicious coffee.

1063
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:10,610
Is it delicious?
- Yes.

1064
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:16,333
It's been brewed
with love and passion.

1065
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,775
Honestly.
- Hey...

1066
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,210
It's gonna be white?
- Yes.

1067
01:11:30,376 --> 01:11:32,492
The bar is gonna be warm wood.

1068
01:11:32,696 --> 01:11:36,689
I just purchased a restaurant
from Laguna Beach -

1069
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:39,416
with some buddies.

1070
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:44,491
It will be a nice bonus.

1071
01:11:44,896 --> 01:11:47,808
We are currently renovating.

1072
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:55,925
I want to be in
real estate business.

1073
01:11:56,096 --> 01:12:03,047
I would also like to be
in some kind of car business.

1074
01:12:03,216 --> 01:12:09,086
I also want to play through
America's top 100 golf courses.

1075
01:12:09,256 --> 01:12:11,212
It will probably take several years.

1076
01:12:11,616 --> 01:12:15,734
Ducks let me decide for myself
what I want to do.

1077
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:20,607
I don't want a job
where I have to travel a lot.

1078
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:23,336
That's why I won't become a coach.

1079
01:12:24,456 --> 01:12:28,335
I'll have many hobbies
and other things to do -

1080
01:12:28,536 --> 01:12:33,291
but I don't think I can find
the same passion for something else -

1081
01:12:33,456 --> 01:12:35,128
than I have for hockey.

1082
01:12:36,736 --> 01:12:39,455
Teemu is strapped in
and ready to go.

1083
01:12:41,216 --> 01:12:42,968
Ready? Now.

1084
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:50,531
7.3 g! Great job!

1085
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:53,768
My father has always had a lot of toys.

1086
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:56,491
It came perhaps from there.

1087
01:12:56,736 --> 01:12:59,409
Cars have always been a
very important hobby for me.

1088
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:02,374
My first car was a
big old American one.

1089
01:13:02,536 --> 01:13:07,405
He bought this '61 Lincoln
when he got a professional contract.

1090
01:13:07,736 --> 01:13:10,773
They've accumulated since then.

1091
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:15,015
If I get a good offer,
I buy the car.

1092
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:17,013
It was a fun meeting.

1093
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:20,486
Jari Kurri, Teppo Numminen
and Teemu were there.

1094
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,614
We went to eat hamburgers.

1095
01:13:23,056 --> 01:13:26,731
They ordered classic cars
before they ordered burgers.

1096
01:13:26,896 --> 01:13:29,774
It was easier to choose a car
than a burger.

1097
01:13:29,976 --> 01:13:32,444
Teemu drove here a lot.

1098
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:36,052
He trained at drifting and stuff.

1099
01:13:36,536 --> 01:13:39,687
We drove around in the evenings.

1100
01:13:40,776 --> 01:13:43,415
It was great to drive in the evenings -

1101
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,925
because you saw if someone came.

1102
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:48,327
It was safer that way.

1103
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:53,889
We have been cautious
not to do anything stupid.

1104
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:59,495
I removed
driver's seat backrest -

1105
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:03,331
so I could sit back
because I had plaster on my leg.

1106
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:09,092
I used my crutch
for gas

1107
01:14:09,776 --> 01:14:13,132
and my right foot for the clutch.

1108
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:18,570
We drove off to a
snow-filled ditch.

1109
01:14:19,176 --> 01:14:22,373
I couldn't push the car back to the road -

1110
01:14:22,536 --> 01:14:24,333
and neither could Sirpa.

1111
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:27,488
We called our friend Jorkka
who fetched us.

1112
01:14:27,656 --> 01:14:31,410
I told him that
Sirpa had driven into the ditch.

1113
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:35,967
It took him a year to get
that I had been driving.

1114
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:38,445
If you watch him
for a day or two -

1115
01:14:38,616 --> 01:14:41,608
you will see that he is
completely insane.

1116
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:45,771
The roads are better
and the rain ended.

1117
01:14:45,936 --> 01:14:47,654
Now I've got a race feeling.

1118
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,604
One of my best friends,
Kaide Eklund, began rallying.

1119
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:56,375
I sat in the car
a few times in training.

1120
01:14:56,776 --> 01:14:58,846
It was awesome.

1121
01:14:59,176 --> 01:15:01,815
Our contracts forbid
this kind of stuff.

1122
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:06,367
There is a three page  list of
forbidden things.

1123
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:13,205
So I competed under a false name,
Teukka Salama.

1124
01:15:13,536 --> 01:15:17,814
My first car was a Ford Escort RS2000
.

1125
01:15:18,176 --> 01:15:23,853
Next year I rented a
Mitsubishi Galant for a race.

1126
01:15:24,016 --> 01:15:27,247
Then we bought a
Mitsubishi Lancer Group N -

1127
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:30,965
and in Jyväskylä, we finished a
race for the first time.

1128
01:15:31,136 --> 01:15:36,449
Then Marcus Grönholm gave
us his Toyota Corolla WRC.

1129
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,971
We could run it at 200 km / h
in Ouninpohja.

1130
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:43,606
I drove up the hill
and only saw the sky behind it.

1131
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:46,529
The co-driver said "slow down" -

1132
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:50,815
which I did,
but we still flew high.

1133
01:15:50,976 --> 01:15:55,367
The front wheels hit the ground first
and the back end just bounced.

1134
01:15:55,536 --> 01:15:57,811
We drove on the front wheels
for 10 to15 meters.

1135
01:15:57,976 --> 01:16:01,366
Luckily, I had the wheels straight.
Otherwise we would have been in the ditch.

1136
01:16:01,616 --> 01:16:05,768
The public prosecutor may bring charges
against Teemu Selanne for his car accident.

1137
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:11,051
Kalervo Kummola loves rally
and has often been a co-driver.

1138
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:14,652
It is our common hobby.

1139
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:18,934
Pekka Huolman called and told
that he would go and train -

1140
01:16:19,696 --> 01:16:22,688
on a closed road near lkaalinen.

1141
01:16:22,856 --> 01:16:27,134
Team Europe had
organized training days.

1142
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:31,687
I asked if Raimo Helminen
and his son wanted to come.

1143
01:16:31,856 --> 01:16:35,053
There were five people in my car.

1144
01:16:35,536 --> 01:16:39,449
We were told to stop the
training after nine at night.

1145
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:41,208
It was ten to nine.

1146
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,293
I said we'll go now.

1147
01:16:43,456 --> 01:16:46,766
I wanted to drive the course
both ways once more.

1148
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,248
He wanted to run first
so he didn't have to eat dust.

1149
01:16:51,776 --> 01:16:54,927
He would wait for us
before he turned back.

1150
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:58,173
I had a friend with me.

1151
01:16:58,336 --> 01:17:04,127
We drove to the other end in the normal rally style.

1152
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:08,286
I turned and started
to wait Kalervo.

1153
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:11,369
It was three or four to nine -

1154
01:17:11,576 --> 01:17:13,692
so I thought that he probably won't come.

1155
01:17:13,856 --> 01:17:15,608
I was going to run slowly.

1156
01:17:15,776 --> 01:17:19,246
My friend said how good the traction was.

1157
01:17:19,496 --> 01:17:21,214
I showed him -

1158
01:17:21,376 --> 01:17:26,734
how good the grip was
and how powerful the brakes were.

1159
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:29,968
Teemu was so enthusiastic -

1160
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:35,207
that he forgot our agreement.

1161
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,573
I totally forgot
that Kalervo was coming.

1162
01:17:38,856 --> 01:17:40,528
There was a small crest.

1163
01:17:40,696 --> 01:17:43,574
Normally I would have run
at approximately 150 km / h

1164
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:46,927
It was the only place
for three kilometers -

1165
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:50,406
where you could not see
the oncoming traffic.

1166
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:55,412
The car jumps about 20 meters high there.

1167
01:17:55,776 --> 01:17:58,529
There are three jumps on the route.

1168
01:17:58,696 --> 01:18:04,054
I was under the biggest one
when Teemu came flying.

1169
01:18:04,216 --> 01:18:06,013
When the car took off -

1170
01:18:06,176 --> 01:18:08,610
I saw Kalervo's car 30 meters away.

1171
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,807
The only thing I remember -

1172
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:15,492
was a windshield with the text
"Toyota Corolla".

1173
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:19,735
When we landed
there was nothing I could do.

1174
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:25,887
I think I saved us
by turning the car sideways.

1175
01:18:26,496 --> 01:18:30,091
My car flipped over twice
and ended up in the woods.

1176
01:18:30,616 --> 01:18:32,846
Kalervos car stopped quickly -

1177
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,172
but the blast was a lot
harder for them.

1178
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,974
The car caught fire.

1179
01:18:37,256 --> 01:18:39,247
I had time to think:

1180
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:42,772
"Did I survive the crash
to burn to death?"

1181
01:18:42,976 --> 01:18:47,015
I jumped out to
check out Kalervo's car.

1182
01:18:47,216 --> 01:18:49,013
There were five people in it.

1183
01:18:49,176 --> 01:18:51,815
Everyone seemed relatively okay.

1184
01:18:52,696 --> 01:18:55,369
Everyone was in shock.

1185
01:18:55,576 --> 01:19:00,491
I lost my heel
and broke my arms.

1186
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:05,011
Raimo Helminen
got internal injuries.

1187
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,846
The recovery took all winter.

1188
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:11,496
My brother-in-law broke his knee.

1189
01:19:11,656 --> 01:19:17,492
I realized what I had done
and collapsed on the ground.

1190
01:19:18,976 --> 01:19:20,728
I nearly fainted.

1191
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:23,774
Teemu also contacted the Heavenly Father then.

1192
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:28,811
We had a guardian angel
because nothing worse happened.

1193
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:33,973
Given the circumstances,
we got off pretty lightly.

1194
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:38,773
I was in a wheelchair for 3 1/2 months.

1195
01:19:39,616 --> 01:19:45,009
I had nightmares and woke
up sweating long afterwards.

1196
01:19:45,336 --> 01:19:47,406
Everything was my fault.

1197
01:19:47,656 --> 01:19:49,931
I drove, it was my responsibility.

1198
01:19:50,336 --> 01:19:53,089
After that, I didn't want
to go rallying again.

1199
01:20:01,456 --> 01:20:05,210
One day when I was a rookie
I went to our physiotherapist.

1200
01:20:06,256 --> 01:20:09,726
I said I was in little pain
and asked what we should do.

1201
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:11,568
He was having a bad day.

1202
01:20:11,816 --> 01:20:16,014
He ​​had already received a couple of guys -

1203
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:18,326
complaining about their problems.

1204
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:22,091
He was annoyed and took me
a little farther away. He said:

1205
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:24,531
"Fucking rookie -

1206
01:20:24,896 --> 01:20:29,447
First thing you have to learn in this
league is playing with the pain!"

1207
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,208
I was like this...

1208
01:20:31,376 --> 01:20:35,210
I once took a puck here
and it broke in three places.

1209
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:37,686
I still have three metal plates.

1210
01:20:37,856 --> 01:20:41,405
Here I got a fracture.
It was hit by a slap shot.

1211
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:44,688
I broke the tibia and fibula
simultaneously.

1212
01:20:44,856 --> 01:20:47,245
Once I tore my Achilles tendon.

1213
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,686
Here I had two fractures.

1214
01:20:49,856 --> 01:20:54,088
My left knee has been operated
on six or seven times.

1215
01:20:54,256 --> 01:20:58,249
The first thing I'll do
after quitting playing -

1216
01:20:58,976 --> 01:21:02,855
is having a knee surgery.
I'll get a prosthesis.

1217
01:21:03,176 --> 01:21:06,407
The tibia will be sort of  cut off -

1218
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:10,775
and this turned
ten degrees outside.

1219
01:21:11,216 --> 01:21:13,605
The bones will be aligned again.

1220
01:21:13,816 --> 01:21:16,171
Tennis and golf are so important to me-

1221
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,925
that if I can't do them
I'll lose a part of me.

1222
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:33,573
If I had had to quit after
the year in Colorado -

1223
01:21:33,736 --> 01:21:37,046
I would probably be a little bitter.

1224
01:21:37,496 --> 01:21:39,566
I was a free agent again.

1225
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:42,887
I was considering
my options, staying in San Jose -

1226
01:21:43,136 --> 01:21:47,254
or moving to
a new address.

1227
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:52,373
Paul Kariya phoned me.
His contract had also ended.

1228
01:21:52,696 --> 01:21:56,530
He had some quarrel
with Anaheim -

1229
01:21:56,856 --> 01:21:59,768
and he definitely wanted
to leave Ducks.

1230
01:22:00,096 --> 01:22:02,087
We ended up in Colorado.

1231
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:05,248
Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg
were there.

1232
01:22:05,496 --> 01:22:07,373
Rob Blake and the rest of the gang.

1233
01:22:07,936 --> 01:22:09,927
Expectations were sky-high.

1234
01:22:10,496 --> 01:22:13,249
People congratulated us for
getting the Cup in advance.

1235
01:22:13,656 --> 01:22:16,489
Paul and Teemu found themselves -

1236
01:22:16,656 --> 01:22:18,248
unrestricted.

1237
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,691
It will be a long year.
- Yes.

1238
01:22:20,896 --> 01:22:23,729
Two players came here together.

1239
01:22:23,896 --> 01:22:27,252
When the initiative did not come from the team -

1240
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:32,052
some people didn't like the idea.

1241
01:22:32,216 --> 01:22:37,006
They had barely welcomed us
-

1242
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:40,532
when they reminded us of
that we had not won anything yet.

1243
01:22:43,816 --> 01:22:45,534
Things started fine.

1244
01:22:45,696 --> 01:22:48,529
We played five games really well.

1245
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,891
Then Paul got a wrist fracture.

1246
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,611
He was gone for four months.

1247
01:22:53,856 --> 01:22:56,973
Then something happened with the coach.

1248
01:22:57,336 --> 01:23:00,248
Although we never quarreled  -

1249
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:03,567
I was placed on the third line.

1250
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:07,291
I wondered what was going on.

1251
01:23:07,536 --> 01:23:10,334
Sometimes I played
on the fourth line.

1252
01:23:10,496 --> 01:23:16,014
Sometimes I played great
and was the 1st star of the night -

1253
01:23:17,096 --> 01:23:19,246
even though I was  on the third line.

1254
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,408
At the next training
I ended up on the fourth line.

1255
01:23:22,576 --> 01:23:24,373
Around Christmas Sakic said-

1256
01:23:24,536 --> 01:23:28,290
it was incredible and that
he would have left already.

1257
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:34,015
Teemu called me
after an away game and said,

1258
01:23:34,336 --> 01:23:37,692
"My knee is in such shape
that if I were a race horse -

1259
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,653
I would be sausages already."

1260
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:44,535
That was my only
bad season.

1261
01:23:45,296 --> 01:23:49,494
Media had not had the chance
to write something negative -

1262
01:23:49,896 --> 01:23:52,694
about my career or my game before it.

1263
01:23:53,536 --> 01:23:56,608
A journalist wrote
I'm like cancer -

1264
01:23:56,776 --> 01:23:59,609
causing
bad atmosphere in the team.

1265
01:23:59,776 --> 01:24:01,971
I wrote a
comment in the newspaper -

1266
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:04,286
that after the NHL season -

1267
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,890
first time
during Teemu's career -

1268
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:11,328
it's not certain if he would be chosen
to the World Championships team.

1269
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:14,209
I listed Colorado's problems.

1270
01:24:14,376 --> 01:24:17,209
I had a source on the inside.

1271
01:24:17,376 --> 01:24:19,253
Teemu denies everything even today.

1272
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:22,806
If they're printing the truth
then it's okay.

1273
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,691
You must live with it.

1274
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:30,287
Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg
sitting on a bus -

1275
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:32,253
heading to the airport.

1276
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,976
Teemu,
who had played eight minutes -

1277
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:38,446
delayed the whole team.
Such trifles.

1278
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:42,808
I have never understood
why people go so overboard.

1279
01:24:43,296 --> 01:24:44,775
He was pissed.

1280
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:48,246
I did not know that such a
nice man could be so angry.

1281
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,850
But he had the balls
enough to talk to me.

1282
01:24:51,016 --> 01:24:53,052
I told straight up what I thought.

1283
01:24:53,616 --> 01:24:57,450
We met at SM-liiga's gala,
in the toilet.

1284
01:24:57,816 --> 01:25:01,365
I had forgotten the whole thing,
but Teemu hadn't.

1285
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:07,004
Later he apologized.

1286
01:25:07,176 --> 01:25:11,135
He said it was
one of his biggest mistakes.

1287
01:25:11,696 --> 01:25:15,405
I accepted his apology.

1288
01:25:15,576 --> 01:25:17,487
If you piss off a star -

1289
01:25:17,656 --> 01:25:20,295
you don't get
even the nice stories.

1290
01:25:20,456 --> 01:25:24,131
There is a song about
not wanting to replace a single day.

1291
01:25:24,296 --> 01:25:26,571
I wanted to replace
the whole year.

1292
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:29,734
<i> Will Mattias Norstrom get a penalty? </ i>

1293
01:25:29,896 --> 01:25:31,648
<i> Or will it be Selanne? </ i>

1294
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:34,366
<i> Selanne, for interference. </ I>

1295
01:25:36,376 --> 01:25:38,367
<i> Incredible! </ i>

1296
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:48,371
The WC in Finland in 2003 was probably
the hardest tournament for Teemu.

1297
01:25:49,016 --> 01:25:54,409
I have never played in another game
that turned around so fast.

1298
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,005
<i> Niinimaa's pass in front
of the net! </ i>

1299
01:25:57,176 --> 01:26:00,213
I have never
experienced anything similar.

1300
01:26:01,056 --> 01:26:02,774
It felt like a...

1301
01:26:02,936 --> 01:26:07,691
... Earthquake,
the entire arena rocked.

1302
01:26:08,056 --> 01:26:09,489
We were leading 5 to 1.

1303
01:26:09,696 --> 01:26:12,335
Then something happened.
I don't know what.

1304
01:26:12,496 --> 01:26:16,250
<i> Norstrom shoots. </ I>
<i> Does it bounce in? Yes, it does! </ I>

1305
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:22,332
It felt like you could hear
if someone whispered on the top row.

1306
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:28,846
The fans panicked
when it was 5 to 4.

1307
01:26:29,056 --> 01:26:30,774
The crowd went silent.

1308
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:36,651
Some players simply gave up.

1309
01:26:37,296 --> 01:26:41,050
Sweden were lucky as usual.

1310
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:44,811
<i> He sails completely freely around the goal. </ I>

1311
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:48,365
<i> Incredible! </ I>

1312
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,089
It became 6 to 5.

1313
01:26:50,336 --> 01:26:54,124
Then we were goners.
It was horrible.

1314
01:26:58,176 --> 01:27:04,126
<i> Sweden win </ i>
<i> after an incredible game. </ I>

1315
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:06,885
<i> Finns on the bench look pale. </ I>

1316
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,648
When the game was over -

1317
01:27:08,816 --> 01:27:11,728
I was out of the arena
in two minutes.

1318
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:15,246
<i> Selanne scored the 5th goal for Finland. </ I>

1319
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:19,013
Is it never Teemu's time to win?

1320
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:29,367
SELÄNNE AND KURRI'S AGENT
DON BAIZLEY HAS DIED

1321
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:33,655
I met Don during Christmas
and at the beginning of the season -

1322
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:35,932
and he seemed to be well.

1323
01:27:36,096 --> 01:27:38,405
He was positive as always.

1324
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:42,450
He didn't want
the doctors to tell -

1325
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:44,891
what kind of chances he had.

1326
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:47,695
He ​​would fight as long as he could.

1327
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:50,046
He was a caring man.

1328
01:27:50,216 --> 01:27:52,013
He was never greedy.

1329
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:57,649
He knew me fairly well
even before I played in the NHL.

1330
01:27:58,176 --> 01:28:02,010
When I started getting salary
he always said:

1331
01:28:02,256 --> 01:28:06,090
"Save the money. Don't buy the cars."

1332
01:28:06,256 --> 01:28:09,931
When I bought a car
I kept it a secret.

1333
01:28:10,736 --> 01:28:13,170
If he had asked
I would had confessed.

1334
01:28:16,176 --> 01:28:20,488
His positive attitude
and joy were unbelievable.

1335
01:28:20,776 --> 01:28:24,371
He was an example to us all.

1336
01:28:40,056 --> 01:28:43,685
The World Cup was played
before the lockout.

1337
01:28:43,896 --> 01:28:50,210
I didn't want to play there, because
I couldn't play at my own level.

1338
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:52,287
But it was nice.

1339
01:28:52,456 --> 01:28:55,050
We got silver
and came close to winning.

1340
01:28:55,216 --> 01:28:58,970
After the World Cup I had a knee operation
and I decided -

1341
01:28:59,256 --> 01:29:05,013
that if the knee won't be as good
as it was at its best -

1342
01:29:05,176 --> 01:29:07,167
I won't play a single game.

1343
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:12,854
Don Baizley said that
Teemu's career was at stake.

1344
01:29:13,016 --> 01:29:17,214
There was talk in the teams -

1345
01:29:17,376 --> 01:29:20,015
that he can't play
in the NHL anymore.

1346
01:29:20,176 --> 01:29:24,613
It was a challenge
as we so nicely say nowadays.

1347
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:29,691
An injury is the worst way
to end a sporting career.

1348
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,245
Both menisci were torn.

1349
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:38,366
The knees were very badly  worn.

1350
01:29:39,136 --> 01:29:44,369
The patella was in wrong position.

1351
01:29:45,536 --> 01:29:50,769
We had to a complete renovation.
A year of rehabilitation.

1352
01:29:50,936 --> 01:29:54,645
Ismo, my surgeon,
gave my knee two years.

1353
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,689
He said I could play
for two more years.

1354
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:03,295
That was eight years ago.

1355
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:08,365
The surgery gave me
in some ways a new career.

1356
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:13,530
Has the knee been stiff?
- A little.

1357
01:30:14,896 --> 01:30:16,568
This will sting a bit.

1358
01:30:16,736 --> 01:30:18,931
Is Ismo the only one
giving you these shots?

1359
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:20,688
Team doctors also do it.

1360
01:30:20,856 --> 01:30:24,644
It took 1 1/2 years before
the knee worked painlessly.

1361
01:30:24,816 --> 01:30:26,454
That happened one day.

1362
01:30:26,616 --> 01:30:29,892
It was incredible.
I did not hurt anywhere.

1363
01:30:30,056 --> 01:30:33,446
I knew that everything would be fine.

1364
01:30:34,216 --> 01:30:38,255
My agent phoned Brian Burke, who
was the general manager at the time -

1365
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:41,806
and said Teemu
wants to come back to Anaheim.

1366
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:44,012
He asked if it was possible.

1367
01:30:44,976 --> 01:30:47,888
Burke said the team can't afford me.

1368
01:30:48,056 --> 01:30:51,253
A few weeks later
Brian called up Don -

1369
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:53,811
and said that they have some money now.

1370
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:57,730
I signed on real cheap.

1371
01:30:58,456 --> 01:31:00,606
I said immediately that I will sign.

1372
01:31:00,776 --> 01:31:04,655
It was fun to get back
with the fans and everything.

1373
01:31:04,816 --> 01:31:06,693
I was also healthy.

1374
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:09,610
I felt as good
as during my first year.

1375
01:31:09,776 --> 01:31:12,051
In the conference finals -

1376
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:15,686
We played against Edmonton
and lost the series 4 to 1.

1377
01:31:15,856 --> 01:31:17,847
We got better all the time.

1378
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:22,089
It showed how good a
team we could become.

1379
01:31:22,256 --> 01:31:23,974
After the last match -

1380
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:26,650
I said to the guys:
"Next year, remember -

1381
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:28,647
how disappointed we were."

1382
01:31:29,376 --> 01:31:32,527
We could go even further.

1383
01:31:37,656 --> 01:31:40,011
Brian Burke said to me:

1384
01:31:41,816 --> 01:31:45,331
"I know exactly what you're worth."

1385
01:31:45,896 --> 01:31:51,971
He ​​promised me that if I took this salary -

1386
01:31:52,656 --> 01:31:56,535
he would use
the difference -

1387
01:31:56,696 --> 01:32:01,565
about three million dollars -

1388
01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:08,329
to acquire a player who could
help us win the Stanley Cup.

1389
01:32:09,216 --> 01:32:12,367
I remember it well.
It was my birthday.

1390
01:32:12,576 --> 01:32:17,331
I got a call.
They had acquired Chris Pronger.

1391
01:32:17,856 --> 01:32:22,691
Too bad no one filmed me.
My smile was quite wide.

1392
01:32:22,856 --> 01:32:27,452
I knew he was the missing link
we didn't have last year.

1393
01:32:27,736 --> 01:32:29,374
After the Stanley Cup Finals -

1394
01:32:29,616 --> 01:32:32,335
I was invited
to Anaheim's dressing room.

1395
01:32:32,496 --> 01:32:36,045
Older players, like
Scott Niedermayer, were on their way out -

1396
01:32:36,216 --> 01:32:38,252
in suits.

1397
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:41,448
Teemu had all the equipment
and tied skates -

1398
01:32:41,616 --> 01:32:43,527
2 1/2 hours after the game.

1399
01:32:43,696 --> 01:32:46,494
It was the only year
we had started well.

1400
01:32:46,656 --> 01:32:50,285
We hadn't lost a game
after 17 or 18 games.

1401
01:32:50,536 --> 01:32:53,687
It was a good start.

1402
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:56,575
Play offs are fun for us players.

1403
01:32:56,816 --> 01:32:59,569
Each shift,
each hit -

1404
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:02,773
and each time you
throw yourself in front of the puck...

1405
01:33:02,976 --> 01:33:06,446
Everything affects everything.
Little things decide the outcome.

1406
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:33,327
During the Finals -

1407
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:37,605
we had 12 guys queuing
up for the doctor.

1408
01:33:37,896 --> 01:33:44,165
We got Toradol injections that remove
almost any pain whatsoever.

1409
01:33:44,456 --> 01:33:48,051
Without it, I think none of us
could have played.

1410
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,174
An incredible feeling.

1411
01:34:27,336 --> 01:34:30,772
I've been waiting for
to win something big for 15 years.

1412
01:34:33,176 --> 01:34:36,407
Sometimes I thought
that this would never happen.

1413
01:34:36,576 --> 01:34:38,294
That's why this is so important.

1414
01:34:38,456 --> 01:34:42,415
I have been close to winning the Olympic gold,
the World Championships the World Cup -

1415
01:34:44,576 --> 01:34:46,089
but it hasn't happened.

1416
01:34:46,256 --> 01:34:49,726
Now I have won the biggest trophy
a hockey player can win.

1417
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:54,013
I always wanted to quit on top.

1418
01:34:54,336 --> 01:34:57,567
Stanley Cup crowns my career.

1419
01:34:57,816 --> 01:35:00,011
I think I've earned this finale.

1420
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:19,693
SUMMER 2007, FlNLAND

1421
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:37,135
Hi.

1422
01:35:43,536 --> 01:35:45,492
Is this for me?
- Yes.

1423
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:48,124
And this also.
- Thanks!

1424
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,926
Veeti wrote "Anaheim".

1425
01:35:53,896 --> 01:35:55,295
It's pretty big, isn't it?

1426
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:59,927
How has your summer been?
- Pretty bad.

1427
01:36:00,096 --> 01:36:02,291
Yeah, the weather has also been bad.

1428
01:36:02,496 --> 01:36:06,045
Teemu sent this picture
after his rookie season in Winnipeg.

1429
01:36:06,216 --> 01:36:08,446
I have it on the wall at home.

1430
01:36:08,816 --> 01:36:11,808
If you look at this picture -

1431
01:36:11,976 --> 01:36:17,528
that was 2007 -

1432
01:36:18,496 --> 01:36:22,011
a lot has happened
between taking these.

1433
01:36:22,216 --> 01:36:26,334
I'll always treasure them.

1434
01:36:26,856 --> 01:36:30,974
These will hang on my wall
as long as I live.

1435
01:36:37,096 --> 01:36:38,893
When I won the Stanley Cup -

1436
01:36:39,056 --> 01:36:42,571
I was totally sure
that my career was over.

1437
01:36:42,736 --> 01:36:45,296
There is no better way to end
-

1438
01:36:45,456 --> 01:36:47,287
than a championship -

1439
01:36:47,536 --> 01:36:50,175
especially
a Stanley Cup championship.

1440
01:36:50,336 --> 01:36:53,931
I didn't think
I'd find the motivation -

1441
01:36:54,096 --> 01:36:58,055
to work hard
and torture myself every Friday -

1442
01:36:58,216 --> 01:37:01,094
by running
in the forests of Hila.

1443
01:37:01,456 --> 01:37:04,766
I had achieved
what I had dreamed and fantasized about -

1444
01:37:04,936 --> 01:37:06,767
since I was a small boy.

1445
01:37:07,616 --> 01:37:10,972
I didn't think I could
find the motivation for a comeback.

1446
01:37:11,136 --> 01:37:13,047
I thought
I had done my share.

1447
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,776
We returned to Anaheim
after the summer.

1448
01:37:15,976 --> 01:37:20,174
I was a normal family man
and drove the boys to training.

1449
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,486
I played golf during the days.

1450
01:37:23,896 --> 01:37:27,411
Until the boys wanted to go and watch hockey.

1451
01:37:27,976 --> 01:37:29,932
We went to a couple of games.

1452
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:34,248
I looked around and thought:
"That guy missed that chance."

1453
01:37:34,416 --> 01:37:36,054
"I would have scored."

1454
01:37:36,216 --> 01:37:41,973
Scott Niedermayer, who also
was about to end his career -

1455
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:45,694
called and asked if I wanted to skate.

1456
01:37:45,856 --> 01:37:48,290
I didn't even know
where my equipment was.

1457
01:37:48,456 --> 01:37:50,651
I didn't know
where I had that stuff.

1458
01:37:51,336 --> 01:37:53,327
I said I could come.

1459
01:37:53,536 --> 01:37:55,925
I would see if it was still fun.

1460
01:37:58,576 --> 01:38:01,409
I went
and thought it was stupid.

1461
01:38:01,736 --> 01:38:03,408
"I quit."

1462
01:38:04,136 --> 01:38:10,211
A few weeks later
an old teammate called -

1463
01:38:10,376 --> 01:38:12,844
and asked if I would like
play for fun.

1464
01:38:13,176 --> 01:38:15,485
A beer league game.

1465
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:18,648
We would play
and drink a few beers afterwards.

1466
01:38:18,816 --> 01:38:20,534
I said, "Sure!"

1467
01:38:20,696 --> 01:38:23,893
All of a sudden, it was great fun.

1468
01:38:24,696 --> 01:38:30,487
I thought about it for a while
and spoke with my family.

1469
01:38:31,536 --> 01:38:36,052
Then I decided
to play again.

1470
01:38:36,296 --> 01:38:40,767
I've been thinking about the
highlight of Teemu's career.

1471
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:43,685
I want to have a broader perspective.

1472
01:38:43,856 --> 01:38:45,687
It's not the 76 goals.

1473
01:38:46,056 --> 01:38:47,728
Not his natural talent.

1474
01:38:47,896 --> 01:38:50,330
Not that he is such nice and happy guy.

1475
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:53,886
We are speaking about
incredibly tough top-level sports.

1476
01:38:54,056 --> 01:38:56,854
I think the biggest
thing is that he -

1477
01:38:57,096 --> 01:39:00,247
after getting
all the money in the world -

1478
01:39:00,576 --> 01:39:02,806
and after all the prizes -

1479
01:39:03,096 --> 01:39:04,973
even after the Stanley Cup -

1480
01:39:05,136 --> 01:39:07,127
and all he got from the sport -

1481
01:39:07,296 --> 01:39:10,572
aged 36 or 37 -

1482
01:39:10,896 --> 01:39:15,208
decides to do
a new proper attempt to win.

1483
01:39:16,376 --> 01:39:17,889
Now!

1484
01:39:19,456 --> 01:39:20,855
Now!

1485
01:39:22,536 --> 01:39:23,935
One more time!

1486
01:39:24,096 --> 01:39:25,734
When you see the X-ray picture -

1487
01:39:25,896 --> 01:39:29,252
it's hard to believe he has played
with that knee in a long time.

1488
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:35,933
When you have to train the same things
in a new way -

1489
01:39:36,376 --> 01:39:40,085
training will be diverse as it needs to.

1490
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:42,571
If you can't run
you can cycle.

1491
01:39:46,576 --> 01:39:48,373
I want to play in the NHL.

1492
01:39:48,536 --> 01:39:51,733
I have to focus on
that I will, too.

1493
01:39:53,496 --> 01:39:56,727
When I train with Teemu
I notice -

1494
01:39:56,976 --> 01:40:00,446
how much it requires
to get to that level -

1495
01:40:00,976 --> 01:40:03,410
, and how he also trains
during summers.

1496
01:40:05,496 --> 01:40:09,569
My Friday workout
when I torture myself -

1497
01:40:09,736 --> 01:40:13,524
is the only workout
I don't like.

1498
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:18,372
But sometimes you have to
stretch your limits.

1499
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:23,805
It's amazing how good
 a shape he's in.

1500
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:28,891
And he doesn't get winded
and bend over on his stick.

1501
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,492
At his age he's the best
athlete in the world.

1502
01:40:32,656 --> 01:40:38,208
He's playing at 42 20 minutes a night
against the best players in the world+.

1503
01:40:38,376 --> 01:40:42,733
A big lifestyle change
and new training methods.

1504
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:46,451
He made an incredible comeback
straight to the top.

1505
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:51,970
An older player must lose weight.
You have to get your weight down.

1506
01:40:52,136 --> 01:40:56,527
I've noticed he's slowly letting his weight get
lower so he can be as fast as he was.

1507
01:40:56,696 --> 01:41:00,291
Only now Teemu has
found his limits.

1508
01:41:00,616 --> 01:41:05,007
The most difficult thing in sports
is finding your maximum potential.

1509
01:41:05,216 --> 01:41:07,013
Teemu has done that now.

1510
01:41:07,256 --> 01:41:14,253
That's why I admire him
ten times more now than ever before.

1511
01:41:23,776 --> 01:41:29,214
The evolution stops when one is
satisfied. That thought has brought me here.

1512
01:41:33,456 --> 01:41:36,766
It's been a long time since I was
playing here last time.

1513
01:41:36,936 --> 01:41:39,655
This is something special.

1514
01:41:39,816 --> 01:41:46,415
This city and people here have been
supporting me all these 20 years.

1515
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,969
That's why this is so special for me.

1516
01:41:50,136 --> 01:41:53,845
Too bad We are here for only one day.

1517
01:42:04,736 --> 01:42:06,772
TEEMU WE FORGIVE YOU. COME HOME.

1518
01:42:07,856 --> 01:42:09,653
<i> Tonight we are saluting him

1519
01:42:09,816 --> 01:42:15,732
<i> for his amazing career </ i>
<i> and his unquivering passion for our city. </ I>

1520
01:42:26,856 --> 01:42:30,451
Teemu got to have an emotional farewell
15 years late.

1521
01:42:38,656 --> 01:42:42,171
I am only one of millions of dads -

1522
01:42:42,376 --> 01:42:45,573
who have taken their boys
to training and games.

1523
01:42:46,096 --> 01:42:49,611
Teemu wouldn't be
an elite hockey player -

1524
01:42:49,936 --> 01:42:51,733
without dad.

1525
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:59,207
This necklace has everything
that is important in my life.

1526
01:42:59,456 --> 01:43:05,133
A hockey club, of course.
A golf club.

1527
01:43:05,776 --> 01:43:09,132
The heart symbolizes love of course.

1528
01:43:09,376 --> 01:43:11,970
A four-leaf clover -

1529
01:43:12,256 --> 01:43:19,685
and a cross I got when I
was confirmed as a 15-year-old.

1530
01:43:20,336 --> 01:43:24,807
I've weared the cross
ever since.

1531
01:43:28,656 --> 01:43:31,853
When previously asked about
what's most important in life -

1532
01:43:32,016 --> 01:43:34,484
he always answered being healthy.

1533
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:39,125
But after he began visiting
Children's Hospital -

1534
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:43,130
and saw how happy
little patients could be -

1535
01:43:43,296 --> 01:43:46,971
he has started to say that the
main thing is to be happy.

1536
01:43:55,607 --> 01:43:57,006
When the crew first asked -

1537
01:43:57,087 --> 01:43:58,884
if they could make a movie about me
I replied, "Absolutely not."

1538
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:00,366
But later I changed my mind.

1539
01:44:00,447 --> 01:44:02,244
I wanted to make a film that can
inspire people to believe -

1540
01:44:02,327 --> 01:44:03,885
dreams can be fulfilled
through hard work.

1541
01:44:03,967 --> 01:44:05,480
Now I also want to thank all the people
-

1542
01:44:05,567 --> 01:44:07,080
who made my dream possible.
Teemu Selanne.
