Michael Bluth and his

at the courthouse...

00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,570
to discuss George
Sr. 's upcoming trial.

9

Do not ask me how I did it...

10
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,241
they offered
us a plea bargain.

11

Really? There's a chance we

Absolutely, and
I say we take it...

- Great. What's the offer?

I just got it yesterday.

what this is, it

Up until last

what's your last name?

163
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,205
- Cute story...
- Cutestory?

164
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,542
Yes. Chareth Cutestory.

165
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:40,129
- That's an interesting name.
- Is it?

166
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:43,299
So here's the
test that I failed.

167
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:46,010
Oh, okay. Yeah, I see
the problem right away.

168
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,012
You, uh... You got
all the answers wrong.

169
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,014
You know you,
you even got your

170
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:51,932
name wrong here.
It says, "S. Fünke."

171
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,059
Yeah, well, see, what
they want you to do...

172
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,185
is put an "S" if you're

173
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,645
single, an "M"
if you're married.

174
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,522
I mean, most of
us are all single,

175
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,315
but it's a whole
government thing, so...

176
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,984
Yeah. Okay. The
first thing you want to

177
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,694
do when you're
dealing with fractions...

178
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,028
Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?

179
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:06,238
Yeah. So I'm gonna go, okay?

180
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,365
So just fill in
all the right answers

181
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,409
here, and I'll see
where I went wrong.

182
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,411
And you're getting
paid for this right?

183
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:13,912
There was talk of ice cream,

184
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,372
but not exactly on my terms.

185
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:16,790
Wow! Where did
you get all that?

186
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:18,208
Do you have a
job or something?

187
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:21,295
No, but you do.

188
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,588
Now, look. Don't feel guilty.

189
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:26,133
I don't really need
tutoring anyways, okay?

190
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,718
- Enjoy the 200 bucks.
- Oh,

191
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,261
there... there's six 20s here.

192
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,848
- That's right.
- Right.

193
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,391
[Narrator]
After an evening of

194
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,268
drinking, Michael,
being the sensible one...

195
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,186
offered to give
Maggie a ride home.

196
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,314
Oh-ho! { Giggling]

197
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:46,444
[Narrator] The next

198
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,863
morning,
Michael was wondering...

199
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:50,282
how to end his
first one-night stand.

200
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,201
- Coffee?
- Hi. Yes,

201
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,619
please. Thank
you. That's great.

202
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,163
But you know what? I
am going to have to read

203
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:59,666
that plea soon, okay?
'Cause it's a big case.

204
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,835
But I promise
later I will call...

205
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,586
[Narrator]
Michael struggled to

206
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,380
follow Gob's
instruction tojust walk away.

207
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:08,299
I'll... I'll... I'll
call, okay? All right?

208
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,844
- Hey. Who's this?
- Oh, that's Justice.

209
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,138
- Hi, Justice.
- Hi, Justice.

210
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,306
Is he as
handsome as he smells?

211
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,851
I didn't... I didn't
know that you had a dog.

212
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,727
- How else am I gonna get to

213
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:21,521
work?
- You  ride a dog to work?

214
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:25,775
{ Chuckles] You are
funny. Let me see that smile.

215
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,735
- Well, it's tough with your

216
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,571
hands in the  way.
- { Laughing]

217
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:32,073
- Say when.
- Okay.

218
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,703
And suddenly,
Michael recalled some

219
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:38,538
non sequiturs
from the night before.

220
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,873
So, tell me something
personal about yourself.

221
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,126
Uh, well, I have an

222
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,211
irreversible case of
ocular retinoblastoma.

223
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,422
Hey. I thought we
said no more law talk.

224
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,549
I really can't
see anybody right now.

225
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:52,260
Oh, well, I
can't see anybody ever.

226
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:56,264
- I'm blind.
- I'm wasted.

227
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:58,641
[Narrator] Michael
realized that the woman he

228
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,893
was attempting to
never see again was blind...

229
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:03,104
and he was
overcome with guilt.

230
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,189
When... can we go out again?

231
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,274
- Really

232
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,900
I thought you
were, like, just into

233
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,443
this one-night
stand kind of thing.

234
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,237
Come on. I took
a blind woman home

235
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,030
with no intention
of dating her again?

236
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:15,074
- Please!
- { Guffaws]

237
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:22,164
[Narrator] George
Sr. was continuing

238
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,083
to exploit his
relationship with Cindi.

239
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,586
What... What evidence
does the government have...

240
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,005
on old wise
George, by the way?

241
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,549
- Oh, I hate it when you

242
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,050
call yourself old!
- { Laughs]

243
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:35,928
- You're new to me!
- Oh, that's... that's nice.

244
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,515
Do they have
a... a file or tapes?

245
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,934
Oh, what's the
use? You're married.

246
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,060
Yeah. Let me ask you...

247
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,103
- We'll never be together

248
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:45,563
- Let me ask  you a question.
-

249
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,189
Let's just go back
to what we do best.

250
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,400
- Okay.
- Tweak me.

251
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,902
- George!
- Lucille!

252
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,862
Hi. Uh, this is
not what it looks like.

253
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,447
It looks like
you're tweaking her

254
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,991
nipples through
a chain-link fence.

255
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,867
- Yep. Yeah,  that's it.
- Is this

256
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,703
why you wanted
to fight this thing?

257
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,287
So you could run off with

258
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,747
this great redwood of a whore?

259
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,917
Listen to me.
She is a fan of mine.

260
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,128
She has seen everything I've

261
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,255
done. You
understand? Everything.

262
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,257
Well, so have I...

263
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,551
and I'm not going to
put up with it anymore.

264
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:16,677
Okay.

265
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,554
- You'll  be
hearing from Barry

266
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:21,557
All right. Hon? Honey? Hon?

267
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:23,725
Oh, God. I'm a home-wrecker.

268
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:24,810
- Oh, no

269
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,603
I never wanted
to  be that person.

270
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:27,688
- No, no

271
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,232
No. No, Cindi, it's... Cindi?

272
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,484
[Narrator]
Michael came home upset

273
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,695
that his
one-night stand wasn't over.

274
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,655
You should have
stayed with me last night.

275
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:38,949
You could have
seen me get some

276
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:41,118
major action
from a major blonde...

277
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,411
who just majored in marine

278
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,870
biology, if you
know what I mean.

279
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,330
I don't know what you mean. I

280
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:46,748
can't imagine what that means.

281
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,250
- I actually had a pretty

282
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,793
interesting  night myself.
- Really?

283
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,419
What'd you do,  read the plea?

284
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,504
- No,

285
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:53,588
didn't have a chance to.

286
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:54,673
I went home with someone.

287
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:56,299
What's wrong with her?

288
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,009
- Nothing's wrong with her

289
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,054
- She's blind.
- Are you serious?

290
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,556
I didn't know at
the time. And now I've

291
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,976
got to take her and
her dog to the park.

292
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,060
You've got work to do.

293
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,269
You've got to read that plea.

294
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,021
I know. That's
what I was trying to do

295
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:11,815
last night when you
put me up to all this.

296
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:13,775
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

297
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,276
I told you to walk away. I

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,736
told you to give a fake name.

299
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,738
I did. Thanks very much. I'm

300
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:20,698
Chareth
Cutestory, a pirate lawyer.

301
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,700
- It was  airtight.
- Boy, you had to

302
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,661
work hard to bag
this blind girl, huh?

303
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:26,246
- I certainly
can't take advantage of

304
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,539
her now, knowing  what I know.

305
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:28,623
- What? No

306
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,959
Michael, you can! Don't you...

307
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,502
You've just
won the gold medal

308
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,045
at the sexual
Special Olympics!

309
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,172
She can't ever
find you again.

310
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,174
Don't you see
that you're so lucky?

311
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,801
- God! How do you not s...
-

312
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,386
What's the matter with you?

313
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,429
- Didn't you "bag"
some woman you're never

314
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,390
going to see again?
- Well, I screwed up.

315
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,809
I broke a couple of
my own rules last night.

316
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:49,811
She knows that
I'm Gob Bluth...

317
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:52,730
and we got
married and I just...

318
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,650
- What?
- Well, she was a darer.

319
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,110
She's one of those girls who

320
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:58,528
just dares you to do things.

321
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,155
- You married her?
- I needed a dare!

322
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,365
[Narrator] What had started

323
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,574
as an innocent flirtation...

324
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:06,202
had turned into a series
of escalating challenges.

325
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,580
Unfortunately, the
evening was draining...

326
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,290
and the one thing
they never dared each

327
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,000
other to do was
consummate the marriage.

328
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,503
Well, guess it's
time to seal the deal.

329
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,004
Oh, wait! What time is it?

330
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:18,422
Oh, God! "Seal the deal."

331
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:21,050
My seal deal! I
gotta get to Sea Land.

332
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,593
I'm selling five of their

333
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,136
sickest seals to
a third-world zoo.

334
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,138
- Did you say  seals?
- Yes! I told

335
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,015
you four hours
ago, I sell seals!

336
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,017
God! Do you ever
listen to what I say?

337
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,435
I'm sorry I
don't memorize every

338
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,937
word that comes
out of your mouth.

339
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,563
Sometimes I just like to

340
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,148
think... think my thoughts.

341
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:38,692
We'll talk about
this when I get home.

342
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:40,903
It was hot.

343
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,531
Boy, the lengths you'll
go to sleep with a woman.

344
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,074
Believe me, we didn't do any

345
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,534
sleeping. I
had sex last night.

346
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,494
[Narrator] But
he  really didn't.

347
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,578
- Yes, I did

348
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:51,872
And later, Michael
arrived for his date.

349
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:53,916
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry that I'm late.

350
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,584
- I thought I smelled you

351
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,169
coming.
- Mm. Yeah, here I am.

352
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,129
I thought so.
Did you smell him?

353
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,714
- Did you smell the handsome

354
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:02,174
man, Justice?
- "Handsome."

355
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,592
- You don't have any evidence

356
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,052
of handsome.
-  Well, that's true.

357
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:07,429
But I can feel handsome.

358
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:08,514
Mmm.

359
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,015
- That feels
handsomey. { Chuckles

360
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,100
Mmm.

361
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,018
- That feels
handsomey. { Chuckles

362
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,020
So you didn't get a
case of"I just had a

363
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,939
one-night stand
with a blind girl"-itus?

364
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,233
No, of course not.
One-night stand? Please!

365
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,235
This is our second
date now. And I wanna see...

366
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:24,071
And I wanna see you
again tonight, so, um...

367
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,489
if it's a one-night

368
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,865
stand, I'm not
very good at it.

369
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:30,160
But now, listen, aren't
you busy with the trial?

370
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,037
Um, yes, of course. I'm very,

371
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,872
very busy. But
not too busy for you.

372
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,874
Not too busy for a
little walk right now maybe.

373
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,876
I'll be your Seeing
Eye dog. What do you think?

374
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:38,960
Okay?

375
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,046
- Oh. Should  we
leaveJustice here

376
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:44,674
Um, yes. He'll be
fine, won't you, boy? Huh?

377
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:48,428
Justice, stay.! Stay.!

378
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:51,098
Describe this to me, Chareth.

379
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:53,600
Describe to me how
beautiful the park is.

380
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,728
Oh, I wish you could
see it. It's just beautiful.

381
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,106
There's an elderly
couple walking hand in hand.

382
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,108
They're having
a  wonderful time.

383
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,193
- Yeah

384
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,654
"Already
served, not to exceed

385
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:08,073
six years but no
less than three..."

386
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:11,993
Uh, three years is
what I give them...

387
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,703
and then one of
them dies and the

388
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,288
other one is
not too far behind.

389
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:17,082
I can smell right through

390
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:18,708
you, Chareth. You're reading.

391
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,960
Leash your
dog, you... { Beeps]

392
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,421
- Uh, yes.
- { Chuckles] Yeah.

393
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:25,048
[Narrator] And
George Sr. was working

394
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,674
on a roadside
beautification effort...

395
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,468
brokered by
Warden Stefan Gentles.

396
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,887
- Inmate Bluth.
- Yes, sir?

397
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,847
I want you to
know that last night...

398
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,766
I watched a very impressive

399
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,559
videotape of the
title Caged Wisdom.

400
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,561
I was struck by the dual

401
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,480
life of the spiritual man.

402
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:42,982
And I did very much enjoy the

403
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,443
blooper bonus
footage at the end. { Laughs]

404
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,903
Well, you know, I almost did

405
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,571
strangle myself on
my own prayer shawl.

406
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:50,740
A self-choking for the ages.

407
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:52,408
- There's a Shasta can there

408
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,993
you seemed to  have missed.
- Okay.

409
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:55,203
- [Narrator] Moments later,

410
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:56,746
Cindi arrived.
-  Thank you, Warden.

411
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:59,207
George! I had to see you.

412
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,877
I'm sorry I left
before. I just felt so awful.

413
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,213
But I kept thinking about us.

414
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,215
- Yes.
- About our future.

415
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:08,508
- Yes, l...
- And I know

416
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:09,717
for a fact we can have one.

417
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,969
Okay. What
evidence do they have on me?

418
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,679
You keep talking
about a fact? You

419
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,306
keep saying, "I
know for a fact."

420
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,892
- What fact?
- Faith.

421
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:22,188
I have faith my
prayers will free you.

422
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,232
- Faith is not a fact!
- Oh, yes, it is.

423
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,985
You said so
yourself in Caged Wisdom.

424
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,780
[Narrator] George Sr.
had said "Faith is a fact."

425
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,698
Unfortunately, it was in the

426
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:34,492
Caged Wisdom
blooper bonus footage.

427
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,953
Faith is a fact.
No. Faith is a facet.

428
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:41,207
I almost said faith is
a fact. { Wheezy Laugh]

429
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,210
I am going to
trial because you don't

430
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,087
understand what a
blooper reel is? Guard!

431
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,631
[Narrator] Back at the high

432
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,257
school, George
Michael ran into Maeby.

433
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:52,259
I got an "A." Check it out.

434
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,220
Great job. Take
some more money.

435
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:55,804
Look. I gotta go.
I'm going to this

436
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:57,348
fund-raiser for
a sick girl, okay?

437
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,475
[Narrator] This rang
false to George Michael...

438
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:00,976
who knew that fund-raisers,

439
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,353
a passion ofher mother's...

440
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,647
were something
that Maeby would avoid.

441
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,732
And later, at
the courthouse...

442
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,568
- Good afternoon.
- Thank God.

443
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:11,195
So did you read the plea?

444
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,696
We've got
minutes here, not hours.

445
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,365
I did read it. Most of
it. Um, I definitely...

446
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,367
definitely read
this, uh... the

447
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,328
first part of this
first, uh, section.

448
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,914
- Uh, no. Did not read it.
- Oh, come on, Michael.

449
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,916
How many times are
you going to screw up...

450
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,375
before the
rest of this family

451
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,835
sees you for
the screwup you are?

452
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm not the lawyer. All

453
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,213
right? Why didn't you read it?

454
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,298
Excuse me. I got busy
with my other clients.

455
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,466
- What other clients?
- He

456
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:33,842
doesn't know
about the divorce?

457
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:36,470
- It's an annulment.
- Oh, I looked into that too.

458
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,305
You can only get
an annulment if you

459
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,389
haven't consummated

460
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,474
the marriage first.

461
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,602
Well, I guess I'll
just stay married then...

462
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:46,063
because we all know that

463
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,398
I closed that deal, right?

464
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,358
[Narrator] But
he really didn't.

465
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,027
He was talking
about  my divorce.

466
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,111
- Your what

467
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:55,071
You and Dad are
getting divorced?

468
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,364
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

469
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,574
No one is fighting over you.

470
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,202
And don't worry about
Barry reading the plea.

471
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:02,245
We'll let your
father rot in prison.

472
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,289
Take the plea.
We're taking the plea!

473
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,999
We're going to
trial, you're going to

474
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,709
lose, and you're
going to stay in there.

475
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:11,254
- That's enough, Mom.
- For him? Nothing's enough.

476
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,131
You'd think a
man locked up in

477
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,883
prison would be
able to abstain.

478
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,220
Your father, with
his disgusting tweaking!

479
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:20,513
I couldn't breast-feed any of

480
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:21,765
you kids because of that man!

481
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:22,891
- Aww!
- Shh.

482
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,976
They still look fabulous.

483
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,519
Lucille, for
God's sakes. She was an

484
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:28,480
informant. She was
working for the government.

485
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,023
The only thing I was pumping

486
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,483
her for was
information, honey.

487
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,109
An informant.
Dad, are you crazy?

488
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,736
You're gonna
blow this whole case.

489
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,863
It's blown. It's
over. It's dead.

490
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,907
Take the plea.
Get me out there.

491
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,366
Lets take the plea, okay?

492
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,743
Look. It's so nice and thick.

493
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:45,413
Oh, George, I should
have never doubted you.

494
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:46,956
Even when you slept with my

495
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,458
sister, it was
for a good reason.

496
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,335
Got her to stop
drinking, didn't it?

497
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:51,544
All right, listen. This is

498
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,712
all getting a little crazy.

499
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,297
We cannot accept
their conditions if

500
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,007
we don't know what
their conditions are.

501
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,384
Do you wanna read it?

502
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,095
Uh, no. It is thick.
Why don't we just take it?

503
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,513
- I could kiss
you on the... {

504
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:03,890
Beeps]
- Well, let's... What?

505
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,141
[Narrator] And so the family

506
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,350
gathered in the courtroom...

507
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,352
to announce their decision.

508
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,314
[Man] All rise. The
court is now in session.

509
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,274
The Honorable
Lionel Ping presiding.

510
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:15,276
Oh, we've got Ping again.

511
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,695
Please be seated.

512
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:20,740
The prosecution
has offered a plea?

513
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:25,202
- We have, Your Honor.
- We've got Lizer.

514
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,371
[Narrator] Yes,
Maggie was the most

515
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,498
feared prosecutor in
all of Orange County.

516
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,043
And, therefore,
I would like to

517
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:34,545
bring your
attention to Exhibit A.

518
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,005
[Narrator] Not
because she was

519
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,381
a particularly adept lawyer...

520
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:39,133
but because she
won the sympathy

521
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,843
not only of
thejury and thejudge...

522
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:46,515
And was that man in
the room, not you, Doctor?

523
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,310
but often times, the
defendants themselves.

524
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,896
l... I was in that room.

525
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,148
Is the defense
ready to respond?

526
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:55,566
- What are you  hiding from?
- {

527

Whispering] You've
got to call this off.

You gotta get more time. Get

529
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,154
more time. She can smell me.

530
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,239
She smells everything.

531
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:05,743
- Objection!
- What?

532
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,245
We haven't read it.

533
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:09,455
- It's very long, Your

534
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,748
Honor.
- { Whispers] Sit down!

535
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,416
We haven't read
it. We're gonna

536
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,001
get to it. I'm
gonna start right now.

537
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,627
That's the blind
chick you slept with?

538
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,212
That's the blind
chick you slept with?

539
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,339
Michael, you're in
bed with the prosecution?

540
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,966
It's genius. You can get

541
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,468
all the information we need.

542
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:23,969
Wait a minute.
How do we know it's

543
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,637
not a trap? Maybe
she's setting you up.

544
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,347
It's not a setup,
okay? She gave me her

545
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:29,141
real name. She said
that she was a lawyer.

546
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:30,267
I'm the one that lied to

547
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,476
her. I gotta go talk to her.

548
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,561
No!

549
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,688
- No, Michael!  You
can save this family

550
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,649
Please! Do the
right thing here.

551
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,693
String this blind
girl along so that Dad

552
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,653
doesn't have to pay
his debt to society.

553
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,739
The solution to all
our problems is staring

554
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,782
you right in the face
and it can't even see you.

555

- I gotta go talk to her.
- { Sighs]

Yeah, I better
get back to the wife.

I think I'm
going to take a scenic

drive down to
the City of Industry.

[Narrator] And George

00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,295
Michael went to
the fund-raiser...

561
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,297
for the sick student
Maeby had mentioned...

562
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,299
but was surprised
not to see Maeby there.

563
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,885
We have been blessed
to have in our midst a

564
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,387
child who has shown us
the meaning of courage.

565
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,974
Now let's show her
the meaning of charity.

566
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,894
Please
welcome... Surely Fünke!

567

[Narrator] And that's when

568
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,146
George Michael realized...

569
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,315
Maeby had been
making money by

570
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:20,442
pretending to be
two twin girls...

571

Maeby?

572
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:25,280
- One of whom was ill.

- Oh. Hey.

were going to be my

- Yeah?  Oh, you're working?

580
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:41,171
Yeah, I got a break. I

581

prepared, thanks to you.

to do this anymore,

gonna help me so

much.

Listen, I know I
shouldn't do this, but...

absolutely
everything we've got.
