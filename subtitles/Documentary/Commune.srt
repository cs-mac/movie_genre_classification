1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,040
Hello. Is it Eric? Erik Moller, yes.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Condolences. Now, it does not.

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,800
Anna Moller. Yes, you know it as well.

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Shall we?

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,480
So here we are again. It is some years ago?

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,560
We have not spoken together since I was 22.

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,760
I've never been allowed to meet him.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,040
I wrote 900,000, but we need up to a million if some buyers leader.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,480
I do not millionaires? And.

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,040
They had made a brand new kitchen, just before he died.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I can see that.

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,080
Your father looked like it was in the family.

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,280
He can forget. For a million.

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,000
I do not know anything your finances. It must not talk too loudly about.

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,360
Just get it launched. Getting rid of it.

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Bleach.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,600
Not? A million. Yes ...

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,160
Man disappears from each other in such a big house.

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,880
Is it documented? There are plenty of studies.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,280
The difference between living together or not is that you can see and hear each other.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,640
Or are you a little person to stay small, Erik.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
An architect must live in a big house.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
I am not an architect that way. Why do you keep it?

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,040
I am a teacher, and it disappears from each other in the big houses.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,880
It's also quite peg to spend so much money to stay.

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,800
It is then a part of it. 450 square meters.

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,240
It's too big. Final, period.

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,960
Freya ... Freya, come. We gotta try something. Are you following?

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,440
We must find the furthest away.

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Are you mad that far down. Sit down.

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,240
Should we close the door? That we agreed. It is us first.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
So high you can not? Are you ready?

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,440
No, wait a minute.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
No mom. It's cheating. No.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just a little.

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
Okay.

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,600
(Whistles)

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,080
(Erik whistles)

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
We can easily hear you. It is then a completely ridiculous play.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,320
It's true what mom says. See if you can find me. Bye bye.

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,120
Where did he go? Sheep! Just because you lost.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,080
Sheep? Where did you go? Erik?

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is he agreed to, we sleep here? Yes, that is just in the night.

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,200
Wake me when you get home, right? Jo.

46
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Kiss.

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
I love you. I love you too.

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Hello. Hello.

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,680
... After several years of terrorism, hijackings, killings and kidnappings.

50
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
This is mind control

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,360
where people are being subjected to interrogation and intelligence control.

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,880
Now for news in brief. The ratio of LO top and the Social Democratic Party

53
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,560
is now so bad that LO's president threatens to terminate the partnership.

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,760
Beach Road. Here came my childhood.

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,560
We just can not afford to be here. Not even to greet someone.

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,600
Her er poletter.

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,240
She needs to Østerbro Lilleskole. I know very well where I should of.

58
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,080
Anna Moller! An autograph? Now go with you. We are busy.

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,160
I have a pen.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
There's harbor. Kæft, a tennis court.

61
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
Come on. Here I have spent many years. Are you insane.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,960
Do you remember Torben? He was professional. Ham, I played with.

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,920
On the other side. You and Torben?

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Lob.

65
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,840
Hey! I!

66
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,640
It is yacht club. We had our dinghy up here. An old trapeze dinghy.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,040
If we lived here, then you could play tennis.

68
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,920
Then you could go down here and sail. Honey, we do not have the money for it.

69
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,160
Take my panties off.

70
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
Ah!

71
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,640
Wow. Yes.

72
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,320
Sol ... Sex ...

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
So the sun.

74
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,080
I've double-checked the numbers. Do not be just above the articles.

75
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,960
Pardon. Do not you just? Thanks. I've double-checked the numbers.

76
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,600
The 570 kronor a month for heat is too much.

77
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,920
We can not afford to live in this house. It is also too large.

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,360
We will call you as just some more. We can call Ditte and Ole.

79
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,120
No, we do not. I know what you want, Anna.

80
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,840
I will not stay in something collective. I get tired just at the thought.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,640
I am also too old. I've called Ole.

82
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm bored, Erik. Something needs to happen.

83
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Not? You talk all the time.

84
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,360
You're so cute when you do that, but it's as though I've heard it all before.

85
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,480
Now.

86
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,760
I need to hear some others say something soon.

87
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,960
Otherwise I become insane.

88
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,720
This huge, fabulous house must then be filled with amazing people.

89
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,800
What for some people? Ole.

90
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Ole is very interested. He has not had it so good for long.

91
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Ole's nothing amazing human being.

92
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,960
You love when Ole. Yes, as a friend to watch football with.

93
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,680
Try to imagine what would happen. It is exciting.

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,920
Can one be allowed to sleep on it? Come on, old man.

95
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,000
What the hell, there's servants? It was good you could come.

96
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,640
This is where you grew up, Erik? Yes I am.

97
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,280
So I can better understand you are a bit worldly.

98
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,520
Yes, it's a big house. And orangery and all, what?

99
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
Nice to see you. You look good. You too.

100
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,400
What's in the bags? My clothes in one and then ...

101
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,680
And leftist literature? She is not so stupid, what?

102
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,880
You are also skidesød. Do I get there numbers?

103
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,240
Or I may be sticking together in this company?

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,520
It is a job interview it here. It can as well call it.

105
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,880
How are you? I have it as well, Anna. Thanks.

106
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
Ah ...

107
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,360
I've been a little out of a galaxy. I have damn.

108
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,040
Now. Did Marianne? Mm.

109
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,920
Yes, she progressed with a singing teacher. The high C, we called him.

110
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,640
There was nothing but skim milk in pencil, she was on.

111
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm damn sorry.

112
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,760
It's damn funny idea to stay with you.

113
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,280
And I love you the suit. Not Frejsen?

114
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,880
But you, Erik, in a collective? Reach. Do you have any money?

115
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,240
I got you. I forgot what we were talking about.

116
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,160
Money are we talking about.

117
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,920
We will do something great together. Well it here then can be huge.

118
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,600
The rents are slightly deropad. We will find out.

119
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
Are you aware that I have seen your father passing out of temper again? What?

120
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,760
Over in Bellahøj Badet. And so, I caught you, Erik. Do you remember that?

121
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,720
I do so again, because I'm your friend, Erik.

122
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,400
There I got the job. Did you feel it, Frejsen what?

123
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,320
What the hell are you laughing?

124
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,200
I must call some others too. We must also.

125
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,560
What about Ditte and Steffen? She has been an associate professor.

126
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,560
It's too fancy for me.

127
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,840
Is it Ditte Johansen, you think? But then there's this.

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,960
No! Yes Yes. It's just me, here.

129
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,360
Ole? Ditte Johansen, it's her? Yes, she is a violation bitch.

130
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,520
We just go from the start, and then we mark where it is Done.

131
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,800
Should not we call someone else? You may know some others.

132
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,560
We mark completely hard. It will not be a problem.

133
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,840
We mark completely. We mark completely from the start.

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,080
Have you made some rules of the house?

135
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,600
Should I? The fact is slightly below ... So ...

136
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,520
Yes. They are a little under preparation.

137
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Yeah, you could say that. They are somewhat incomplete remains.

138
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Can you talk a little bit about them, perhaps? Yes.

139
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Uh, yes, they are ...

140
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,200
Have you made them or not? We have not made any yet.

141
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,760
There must be some house rules. Yes Yes.

142
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,680
We would like to help with it.

143
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,720
Let me just add that the rent probably is right at the high end.

144
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,280
Because of the house conditions. It is not a problem.

145
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,520
It's so long since I've seen you.

146
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,000
Honey, you can not say your name? What?

147
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,040
It is Vilads. He is six years. Hello, Vilads. Hello.

148
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,400
He has no heart, so he takes it a little quiet sometimes.

149
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,240
Okay. Oh no, it sounds serious. I die when I am nine years.

150
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
Do such know? We dont know.

151
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,840
He gets much of the sentence. The girls love it.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Such! They gave him only a few years.

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,240
But there are some things he should try first.

154
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,920
Thats how it should be.

155
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,760
How old is she? How old are you, Freya?

156
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,880
I am 14 14? Do you think she's cute?

157
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,680
I will just nine years.

158
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,520
He is fast. I've probably soon something with heart.

159
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,080
Well, what do you do?

160
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,840
Voting right? It makes man.

161
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,200
I am damn ... I'm for. Me too.

162
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
So do I. Me too.

163
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,720
Are you also? Well then it's a reality.

164
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,720
Have not you got a beer for Steffen? Jo.

165
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,520
Beer? I really want to ask for a beer.

166
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,280
It will be damn cozy. Welcome to.

167
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
Now, it's Mona tomorrow.

168
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
Do you speak our language?

169
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
(latter)

170
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
I try on it.

171
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,800
What are you living on Allon?

172
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,640
Uh, different jobs.

173
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,760
I ask because the rent is at the high end here ??

174
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,200
we have all been made aware of.

175
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,640
Do you earn ... earns money?

176
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,120
So, he speaks Danish, Mona. Not?

177
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,920
I do not understand what he says. I get it to stick together.

178
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,440
What do you say? He makes it to hang together.

179
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,560
Steff says you work a little here and so you work a little there.

180
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,760
Then I thought ... Why change constantly work?

181
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,200
It is almost always odd jobs. Yes.

182
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,400
Do you like it?

183
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,120
I imagine things I would rather do.

184
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,000
What, for example? What would you like to hear?

185
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,560
I will not stomp around in it all the time ??

186
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,480
but I get the feeling you do not voluntarily switch between jobs?

187
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,560
It can simply sense?

188
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Yes I can.

189
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
It makes me really quite curious.

190
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,840
That makes him curious. What are your future plans?

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,160
What would you like?

192
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,960
In plan ...

193
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,320
I will arrive. What?

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,280
What? You will arrive?

195
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,680
I will arrive. Yes.

196
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,320
Arrive? What the hell is that for an answer?

197
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,520
Why do you vocally? Will not you please answer?

198
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,400
I have asked you some questions, and those you can answer.

199
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Why would you like to stay with us?

200
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,480
I assume you are the boss here?

201
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
No, I'm not the boss.

202
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,080
This is a collective! Here we shared the dishes! There is no boss here!

203
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Here we shared the dishes! Can you understand that?

204
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,040
Can you understand that? Erik!

205
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,280
What? So you stop.

206
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,720
Breathe. I draw since the weather all the time.

207
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,520
Well so sorry!

208
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,040
It always happens to me. What do you say?

209
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,160
It always happens to him. That people are irritated with me.

210
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,600
It is my charisma. It is his charisma.

211
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,800
It was nice meeting you. No ...

212
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Come on, dammit. Do not answer him that way.

213
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,080
I tell him that rents are at the high end.

214
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,720
I have since asked all about. He stands and cries?

215
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,920
I can not talk to a man standing and crying.

216
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
Allon?

217
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm sorry. It did not mean.

218
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,920
No, it's fine. In choosing the right.

219
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,080
I do not have any money. Forget the money.

220
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,480
We will figure it out. I ... I vote for Allon.

221
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,840
And. And.

222
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,640
He has no money. Welcome.

223
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Welcome, Allon. Come on in.

224
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
(Cars bumping)

225
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,640
Then you fucking come on the polished floors.

226
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,960
I have not seen the design before. Is it a dairy construction?

227
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,880
Like you, Mona.

228
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,320
So you put the house to the other. Are you sure you want that road?

229
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,040
Yes, I'm sure. Fucking Good! Well, Erik!

230
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,800
Lovely! You make just seven copies.

231
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,440
So, Vilads, now you should damn officially with Ole.

232
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,480
Try to feel how cold my ass is.

233
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,240
(Loud talk)

234
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,920
But, uh ... Anna? Tax? Anna?

235
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Anna? What?

236
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,040
I got a great idea today. How to integrate the harbor.

237
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,280
She trenches and gizmos on him all the time.

238
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,400
What did you say? Pardon. I think I've cracked the nut.

239
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,680
I have thought of a good idea. A fun idea?

240
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,600
On how to integrate the quay at the port facility.

241
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,280
You have a lot more heat. You are much more charismatic.

242
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,800
Here you go. A completely with no. Good morning.

243
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,720
Have a good time. Have a good day, Ole.

244
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,960
Good morning. Hey darling.

245
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,280
Take care, all. Hello. Hello.

246
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,280
Hi.

247
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,400
Put the guitar and came up.

248
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,160
Not something to be leaking. Jesper, close the door as the last man.

249
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,120
So let's get a little specific to your ... What did you call it?

250
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Grade. Marks of, yes.

251
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,400
Train your last submission based on tepees?

252
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Mm.
(latter)

253
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,880
No, but it might be very funny. Teepees. Why tepees, Jesper?

254
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,360
A tipi is a removable space, which can be placed in different contexts ??

255
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,440
and has the potential for variation and reciprocity in world of dreams.

256
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,760
Just as with the tribes ... I'm sorry, what some dreams?

257
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,400
All sorts of dreams. Dreams must be free. That I feel is important.

258
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,240
Have dreams anything with architecture to do at all? Do you feel it?

259
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,320
Your dreams in your project has absolutely nothing architecture to do.

260
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,960
It contains no vision of how people can live together.

261
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,560
Why should I listen to this nonsense?

262
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,000
Why do I need 35 minutes to hear about your experiences in Peru?

263
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,880
And then your notes on some music, something flute work of some kind.

264
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,240
This is interesting for one person, Jesper. Can you guess who it is?

265
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,560
(Knocking on door) Yes?

266
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
I just came in.

267
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,520
I want to hear your reasons for being so violent in your appearance.

268
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,480
So violent in my appearance? Well, Jesper him, yes.

269
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,920
Do you know him? Yes.

270
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,240
You know him. That in itself I think can be quite unbearable.

271
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,920
You probably do not humiliate him? The humiliation he himself stood for.

272
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,440
Han er and fæhoved. In grønskolling og and fæhoved.

273
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,680
What can I do for you?

274
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,360
I must borrow a cigaret? You must get one.

275
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,840
What's your name?

276
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,840
My name is Emma. I am third year.

277
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,040
And you go in my ... Yes.

278
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,840
Hm.

279
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,320
Excellent, Emma, ​​third year. What will you?

280
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,240
In addition to defending your friend? Talk about my project.

281
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,560
Fine. Well, let's find a day when we can do it.

282
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,840
So I think we need to say on Tuesday. The canteen, for some lunch?

283
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,760
What about now a fag?

284
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,360
It's ... We can as well. It is also an option.

285
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,240
I have not so damned much time. I need to catch a bus.

286
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Reach. Exciting, is not it?

287
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,440
Jo. Do not you think well, we can reach it anyway?

288
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,360
I've looked a lot on Le Corbusier's modular system ??

289
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,040
and his view of human needs.

290
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
(Snore)

291
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,880
It seems you are not exciting?

292
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,680
You have already read so much about modular systems and Le Plan Voisin, ??

293
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
you do not have any independent attitude to it.

294
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,520
Find something else. How old are you?

295
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Why do you ask?

296
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,840
What excites you?

297
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
I do not know. What you find out.

298
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,280
Do you have a view of Nyhavn? It is Nyhavn.

299
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,960
It is the view. If you lean way forward, you can see Kongens Nytorv.

300
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Lovely.

301
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
And.

302
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,880
The Copenhagen Squad.

303
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,720
I danced there when you were a student? Yes. Did not you know?

304
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,760
You can swear, I did, but it's fucking long time ago.

305
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,760
You may.

306
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,960
Do like what?

307
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Give me a kiss.

308
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,160
I see who you are.

309
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
And him I like.

310
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,120
Vil have and the wine knell? Ja.

311
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,080
I write in my essay that the end product of anarchy is order.

312
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,520
Anarchism dictates just that no man rules over another.

313
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,280
Do we have an agenda? Yes. "How are we" Round.

314
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
I get a sinking feeling when I wake up ??

315
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,680
in this fantastic house with all of you fools running around.

316
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,840
And I think that I actually have my family now.

317
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
Anna, how did we do it?

318
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,840
Well I'm happy. I am happy with you.

319
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,120
Bravo! Beautifully.

320
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,360
We've talked a little about that one must be able to fold if you will not vote.

321
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,280
Vilads, what should you say? Bum.

322
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,880
So join one himself neutral. Or pas. Is it that? The write down, not?

323
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,480
We have something we'd like to. It's actually you, Mona.

324
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,960
There has been little traffic in and out of the house.

325
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,400
A lot of traffic on the land register. Yes, once in the store.

326
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,320
We would like to know how many men you really see?

327
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,960
What?

328
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,040
We want to just find out how much it is, you pay for?

329
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,120
Is it one or is it all this bunch of men in and out of doors?

330
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not stingy with my body, and you know it too well, Ole.

331
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,200
You know it, Ole? Well, did you not, Steffen.

332
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
It is many years ago!

333
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,240
Steff how we have it with you? Well, uh ... We have it then ...

334
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,640
No, it's you, right? How are you?

335
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,760
Well, uh ... You can write that I feel good 90% of the time.

336
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,880
90%? Now. It is then very.

337
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,960
Allon how we have it with you? I feel good.

338
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,800
Although you have not paid the deposit? I knew you'd bring that up!

339
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,040
When I find a job, so you get all my money!

340
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,400
You live in a huge house with a lovely garden ...

341
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,280
If you think I can contribute something, so I move just again!

342
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,400
Now he sits and howls again. Should I call your mother down in Oh oh?

343
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,800
Erik, what about you? How are you?

344
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Erik?

345
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,920
What? How are you, Eric?

346
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,560
How I am? Well I have it as well.

347
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,800
I'm fine. Yes yes. Fine.

348
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,240
So ...

349
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes, but it's hard to get it to accommodate it all.

350
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,680
I sketch and I outlines.

351
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
I try to keep it simple, but make it more complicated ??

352
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,960
so it loses the clarity. It was so clear in her head.

353
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,280
It was clear in a sketch. The one I showed you yesterday?

354
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,600
You collect all the Ministry's functions in one prismatic form.

355
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,840
As a living sculpture in the middle of the city.

356
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,640
So, on the day it is a building full of movement and life, right?

357
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,200
But at night it's more a quiet lantern, which is located in havneløbet.

358
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,080
It's your idea. What you need to stick to.

359
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,280
It can be really impressive and at the same time sensual.

360
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,320
Not? Jo. You are so smart.

361
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,160
I miss you. I miss you when we're not together.

362
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,760
I miss you too.

363
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,040
Always.

364
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,280
(Singing "A Child is Born in Bethlehem")

365
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,480
Look at that. It's a bit small, it there, right?

366
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,440
No, over there, man. There is damn a really nice, little one.

367
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,280
I do not think we should take. No, it is so fine there.

368
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
In addition to her mother. What about this?

369
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,440
No ... Why, Mona?

370
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,280
I do not think you should save it.

371
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,200
It is so beautiful here. You can see that, right?

372
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,120
Will you be sorry, what? I saver does not in any tree, right?

373
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,960
(Singing "Now it's Christmas again")

374
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,000
Vent, stop! Vilads!

375
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,360
Vilads fall! He draws breath?

376
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,880
Vilads? What happens? Call an ambulance!

377
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,680
He is not breathing! We need to get him out of the car!

378
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,600
Vilads!

379
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,840
Come now!

380
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,240
No, we're not family. You gotta understand ??

381
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,840
that it is important for us to know how he feels.

382
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,600
So, they are completely closed. Let me just talk.

383
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,240
Good evening, whom am I talking?

384
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,520
You talk with Anna Moller. Ask me to the doctor on the ward.

385
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm waiting.

386
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,360
She sounded good enough curt.

387
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,840
And.

388
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,760
But you can probably understand, that we live with Vilads.

389
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,520
We live in the collective. The kind you have not heard about.

390
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,360
I do not understand your procedure. If I lived in a nuclear family, ??

391
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,680
I would have had better rights?

392
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,640
What if it was my cousin? It is Vilads.

393
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,440
They come out in the car now. It does not matter.

394
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,240
Hello, brother Vilads. Just beware.

395
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,080
What did they say? At the heart rhythm to normal.

396
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,360
It swings the little, right? No, my boy? You swing.

397
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,440
Should we not have gifts? Jo!

398
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,120
Not dancing. We dance no more. We dance no more.

399
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,080
Not, thank you. I'll take one.

400
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:13,360
Yes we shall. Where is there still here. Here are just wonderful, Ole, what?

401
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,360
(Footsteps)

402
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,840
(running water)

403
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,800
Hello. Hello.

404
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,600
Who are you? I live here.

405
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,080
Now. I Troed, In all along was up Oles Odegaard?

406
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,440
I did not want. And we practice a piece in my school.

407
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,240
Who are you? I am visiting.

408
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,640
With whom?

409
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,720
At Erik.

410
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,640
I was actually also on the way home.

411
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,640
(the phone is ringing)

412
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,320
Hello.
 Hi, it's mom.

413
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
Hello, mother.
 Am I disturbing you?

414
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,880
Lay you and rested a little?
 No, I just got home.

415
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,200
Went well with the samples?
 Mm.

416
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,840
You can just call if you like. I have the house to yourself.

417
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,080
We have the absolutely fantastic. It's too bad you could not come up with.

418
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,440
I have put money for you on the table for spring rolls.

419
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
He Erik of?

420
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,880
No, I'm home alone.
 We need to put a boat in the water.

421
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,720
I must run. Father has come home.

422
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,360
Okay, honey. Greet him.
 Hello.

423
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,600
Hello Freja.

424
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,320
Hi.

425
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000
What ... Should not you sleep with Sille?

426
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,440
I have spoken with the mother that it was okay to be home alone.

427
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,160
Yes, yes, it is indeed. It's more ... I ...

428
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,240
I follow just Emma, ​​right? Yes. Hello.

429
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes, it was not meant. What do you mean?

430
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,200
I know you well can figure out what's been going on here.

431
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,080
It was not supposed to ... She should not have been here.

432
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,800
I'll talk to mother. Do you need it?

433
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,760
Is not it best to leave it? I do not think it is.

434
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,640
It's ... I think it works unhealthy to lie about such things.

435
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,560
I just do not want that happening.

436
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,200
I see another girl. Or I have seen another girl.

437
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,960
What do you say?

438
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,160
Yes, I have been with a few times.

439
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,480
I have not made those competition presentations, as I said.

440
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,320
Reach. I'm sorry.

441
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,680
It was not planned. It was ... It just happened.

442
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,120
Is it serious?

443
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It must be, otherwise you do not then tell me.

444
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,240
Yes I believe.

445
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,920
Is she beautiful? It should she be.

446
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,640
Yes she is. Uh, students.

447
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,240
So she must be really young. Yes, she is young.

448
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,280
 Tredjeårs.
 Hold da op.

449
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,320
Do you go away from me?

450
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,320
No, I'm not going anywhere. Well.

451
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,040
But we'll have to find out the rooms in a way, right?

452
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,040
Yes Yes of course. It is clear that we must figure out how.

453
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Freja know. Why?

454
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,160
Because I told happen there. Now.

455
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Because Emma ... It's her. Her name is Emma ... was over here.

456
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,680
I did not know Freja was here. I thought she was over at Sille.

457
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,120
Now ...

458
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
But I ... It was when we were on tour.

459
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,880
In here, actually. Here?

460
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,400
You do not make it easy for me, Erik. No.

461
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,560
But I think we should find out.

462
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,080
Good night.

463
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,520
Good night. I love you.

464
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,080
I love you too.

465
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,880
Freja. Do you love him? Who?

466
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,160
Johannes.

467
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,360
No.

468
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,480
Is the helmet? He can just take it away if it is.

469
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,040
I go down and talk to him for you.

470
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,520
See you. Ses lose.

471
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,480
Freja? Freya, what are you doing? Nothing. See you.

472
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,240
Freya, he is too old!

473
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,480
What are you doing?

474
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,000
How long have you been following me?

475
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,280
Can not you talk?

476
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,240
I think you are too young to be out at night.

477
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Pardon.

478
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,840
Well, then came in.

479
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,680
Just remember to take off your shoes and wipe them right of also.

480
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,720
You can simply turn off the lamp and then begin to undress.

481
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
(He groans)

482
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,960
How about the portrait of Pol Pot?

483
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,680
I may well use 15 seconds?

484
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,200
Anna's birthday and she is well and it is today

485
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,840
Anna's birthday and she has the today

486
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,960
and look here what we all drink will

487
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,600
It will!
 look here how we drink will

488
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,800
boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy

489
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,600
Violently. When should I? Yes, it was really violent.

490
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,480
How old are you going to be? Congratulations.

491
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,680
You stay well. You have a great connective tissue and a firm butt.

492
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,200
I was 43 when I went into menopause. You should be happy.

493
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,240
Now with that presentation to the portrait of Pol Pot, I think ...

494
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,080
Eight ... I'm ready.

495
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,440
Seven, six, ??

496
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,840
five, four, three, ??

497
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,520
To, en.

498
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
TV newspaper. Good evening.

499
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,920
I need to see what you have found until today.

500
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,600
No! No, where is him. Is that you, Kirsten?

501
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,160
We just wanted to make sure that you were celebrating.

502
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,400
There are lots of people. Congratulations.

503
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,400
Congratulations Congratulations.

504
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,000
Hi.

505
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,240
The others are waiting. Do we just see you at home?

506
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,200
Should not we be together us three little?

507
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,920
How did my husband that? I have not seen you for weeks.

508
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,760
You look tired. I'm fine.

509
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,400
We live in the school, so it's very. Yes, that's clear.

510
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,160
But anyway, I ... yes.

511
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,240
I miss you.

512
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,640
I do actually. That I will not say, but I do.

513
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,040
Yes, you may say. I can not live without you two.

514
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,720
But it is not. I also need to find something else to live.

515
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,680
We have a daughter together.

516
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,680
She's there, right? But ...

517
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,120
I am bloody completely confused.

518
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,240
I think you should do what you have to do.

519
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,120
What feels right. Things come in phases.

520
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,560
You do not know what happens the next few months.

521
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,680
We can not stay on a floor. At one school, under a desk.

522
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,920
We have since done. It was kinda romantic.

523
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,000
It was after all an apartment. What did your brother it?

524
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,720
We must find another place to stay. I love her damn. I do.

525
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,760
If she can not ... be a little bit with us?

526
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,960
Jo ... so, yes ... It ...

527
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,960
Perhaps. I do not fucking.

528
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,400
It makes Mads and Kirsten too. I know.

529
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,080
But she can not stay with us. Not, but stay and stay.

530
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,720
Right now we live together anyway in a way.

531
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,840
There must also be room for you. That's what it's all about.

532
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,640
Take her. Take her out, and then we find out.

533
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,160
Freja. We are leaving now.

534
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,720
What about Dad? He is also, I think.

535
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,960
Take my cigarettes. Do we have an agenda?

536
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,400
We start with "How's it." Allon how we have it with you?

537
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,600
Yes, I have a little problem. I've lost some things.

538
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
(Steffen laughs)

539
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,360
What have you lost? My brown jacket.

540
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,680
Yes, and one LP with the French chansons.

541
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,520
And then the sheath to my guitar. Yes.

542
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,760
What happened to those things? What happened to them?

543
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,560
But you burned them, Ole. You're an asshole.

544
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,360
When things flowing, people did not need them, and then they burned.

545
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,560
So Allon feel good, since he has no other problems.

546
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,760
I do not have any problems. Anna!

547
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Anna!

548
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,720
There are house meeting!

549
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
Ølregnskabet has proceeded in coke.

550
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,960
You do not set lines. We've looked at it.

551
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
Did you not a line for me? A, right?

552
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,040
That's what I got. I also put my strokes.

553
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,920
Hello.

554
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,800
There are drinking more beer than is being put dashes.

555
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,520
Hello.

556
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,880
Hello. Hello.

557
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,440
It's Emma. Hello.

558
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,200
You seem skidesød. Hi, I'm Ditte.

559
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,480
Hello. Emma. Oh, she's fine, what?

560
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,000
Steffen. Nice to meet you.

561
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,400
You too.

562
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,240
Holy shit. Allon.

563
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,640
You look like a French love story. It will not allow you to see.

564
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,280
We had just started a house meeting. I am Ole. I'm the flock leader.

565
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,480
He's not. Yes, come, Ole.

566
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,040
We were doing a ølregnskab. My name is Mona.

567
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,040
I suggest a beer amnesty. What?

568
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,280
Where remember assen exceptionally go in and cover the deficit in the beer crate.

569
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,600
So those of us who do not drink beer, pays?

570
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,600
It's gone completely bananas, so ...

571
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,520
Yes. Well, then it is adopted.

572
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,680
We start afresh on Monday. This is how we do here.

573
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,080
So you remember to put the dashes. Yes, now stop it.

574
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,280
Next point, it's you, Emma. Yes.

575
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,840
Erik and you've paired some time by now, ??

576
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,840
and now, Erik has expressed a wish that you move into the collective.

577
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,920
So, Emma ... what are you for?

578
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,280
Me? Mm.

579
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,440
I am ... No, whew, it's hard. Yes.

580
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,800
The next I was not.

581
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,120
How old are you? I am 24.

582
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,000
Alright.

583
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,760
I went on Eric's course for the Rational architecture.

584
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,480
It must be so careful.

585
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,760
It is a very interesting course. Are you here only for Eric's sake?

586
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,520
Or is the whole idea of ​​living here in a collective appealing to you?

587
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,360
Now it's Eric, I'm in love. I would just make me finish.

588
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,680
I've been looking forward to meeting you. You too.

589
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,800
Reach. But Anna, we've been through ølregnskabet.

590
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,000
And it went well. No, it did not.

591
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,320
Then there is a proposal to Emma as a possible tenant, ??

592
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,040
and then Steffen talk about his dishwasher.

593
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,800
Got something to the agenda? No.

594
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,000
There is continued.

595
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,000
Possible tenant? Yes.

596
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,360
Now. Anna, what do we have talked about.

597
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,360
You suggested it yourself. I have said that we should discuss it today.

598
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:43,000
I have not understood as concrete. I said she could be there a little.

599
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,200
But it sounds as otherwise exciting. That's what you have suggested, is not it?

600
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,120
Yes, it might. Sorry, I've been a little busy.

601
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm sorry, Emma. It is fine.

602
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,600
I actually do not know that we will vote on a possible tenant, ??

603
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,280
if we do not have the same opportunities for it.

604
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,480
It is fine. It is just me. I did not know it was now.

605
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,760
You just have not seen it. That is not for me.

606
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,440
That is how things are, so let's just move on.

607
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,640
Maybe Anna did not want to understand it. It can be difficult.

608
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,200
What are you trying to say? I think it can be difficult.

609
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,160
I do not understand anything. I'll get a couple of beers.

610
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,480
Should we continue with the point? We will vote on it.

611
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,320
Should we not vote on Emma's occupation?

612
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,960
No, now we are voting damn right about whether we vote on it.

613
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,080
How many think we should continue the conversation and then proceed to vote?

614
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,760
Well, as we continue the conversation before we proceed to the vote.

615
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,400
That, I thought I had done. Well, I just go again.

616
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,640
It's not you, that makes it hard.

617
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,800
It was nice meeting you, but it's a conversation I need without me.

618
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,680
I follow you right out.

619
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,520
Hi. Hello Emma.

620
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,440
Clearly minus points that she goes. Plus Point, I think.

621
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,560
It's fucking dignity. I think like this about it.

622
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:31,160
Emma is part of Erik now, and Erik is an inseparable part of this house.

623
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:37,080
If we suppress it, we betray the basic idea of ​​living in a commune.

624
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,320
Not, I think damn, she's cute. You know her really well.

625
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,120
It would be easier if it was a new person who came with two women.

626
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,080
Coming in and had two women. That would be fine.

627
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Yes, in theory, right? So it's fine for me too, but that is ...

628
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,800
Anna, that is. When I see you like that, do it for evil.

629
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,000
I would like to give it a try.

630
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,320
I think it must be possible for anyone to stay here.

631
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,560
I can also understand that Erik has fallen for Emma.

632
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,800
I am not naive. I know that ...

633
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,120
... That people have that kind of needs, let's see what happens.

634
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,000
Well good, then determines the well matter? We are damn just have to vote.

635
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:36,280
Is there anyone who has anything against that Emma move into a probationary period?

636
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,520
Mona, come now. I ...

637
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,520
I vote bum. Fine. One two three four five.

638
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,480
The community is not prepared to accept Emma as anything other than a guest.

639
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,600
So it's you, Steffen. The dishwasher?

640
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,200
I have looked at a copy from Mrs Flint, and she is waiting for us ??

641
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,320
in order that we can buy her.

642
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,120
Take some dishwashing with.

643
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,400
Is not it great? It is HUGE.

644
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,760
Steffen, I just think ... I like to do the dishes.

645
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,000
But there is just so much hassle.

646
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,280
Come back again. We're going to ...

647
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,000
Come back again. Now?

648
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,520
Come back in and sit down. We're heading over to Mrs Flint.

649
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,080
Come back in and sit down.

650
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,520
Come back in and sit down. I thought we were finished now.

651
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,640
How long do you need to pack up and find another place to stay?

652
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,800
How long do you need to pack up and find another place to stay?

653
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,840
This is my house. I've lived here since I was a boy.

654
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,080
I will not dictate how I should live my life. This is my house!

655
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,840
You gave the house to the community! Getting there papers on it?

656
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,880
It is technically Eric's house. Why did no paper on it?

657
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,120
Only half of you have paid your share!

658
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,880
I and Anna pay every penny for this!

659
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,560
So, are you still the boss now. It may well be that I'm the boss.

660
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,240
What you do not get involved in! Do what I say!

661
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,520
Find another place to stay! This is my house!

662
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,720
Be quiet, Ole! Be quiet, Allon! Listen to what I say!

663
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,080
I'm tired of your shit, so I need to find another place to stay!

664
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,320
I need to pack your things and find some other, I can decide over!

665
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,760
I do not want to anymore! I do not want to anymore! I do not want to anymore!

666
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,280
I feel bad ... Now he faints.

667
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,880
No! No, no, no!

668
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,480
Take just some water, Mona. Erik, Erik, Erik?

669
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,240
So ...

670
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,920
Here is some water. We find out, Eric.

671
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,200
I do not want this anymore. Then we damn right ...

672
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,840
Sit right down, friends.

673
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,360
We do. I do not want this anymore.

674
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Hey.

675
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,600
Hi.

676
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,800
Are you going to the party? Oh.

677
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,400
I will just nine years. Well, it was not so much.

678
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,600
Tell me, do you know where the others are?

679
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,120
Should we fuck?

680
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,400
What do you say? What do you say?

681
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,880
Not, I think right, we should wait a bit.

682
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,480
Hello Freja. I'm here a little early, but your father come with moving loaded.

683
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,040
Now. Is your mother home?

684
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,960
Yes, she's up on top.

685
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,000
Will you follow me up there? I would like to say a proper hello.

686
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,600
Well, she's not here. I believe she is gone.

687
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,800
I just go back down. Do you? Reach.

688
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,560
Hello. Hello.

689
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,200
Sorry, I would have taken properly against you.

690
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,160
Thanks. Freja has just followed me up here.

691
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,800
Reach. I'm going out and shopping. Yes.

692
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,480
It is me who is cooking tonight. Do you want to?

693
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,200
And buy into? Yes, I would like this.

694
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,280
Yes. Well.

695
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,320
Not? Ja.

696
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,520
Then we descend to our butcher.

697
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,240
It comes to charm him, you get a good price.

698
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,240
He is to fold for beautiful ladies.

699
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,120
Such. Thank you. Should I wear it? I get the gold.

700
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,080
We know Ole completely from the old days. He was the first person I called.

701
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,560
Reach. That has Erik not told. No.

702
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,960
I've always had a secret dream to live with Ole.

703
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,520
I can understand that.

704
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,280
You have brown eyes. Yes.

705
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,280
You have blue.

706
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,480
Have I even suggested that you should move in.

707
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,880
 Ja, det var han glad for.
 Ja.

708
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,040
I imagine after all that we can be here all three.

709
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,680
I think after all that Erik should just be allowed to ...

710
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,640
To pursue his feelings, right? I am very grateful.

711
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,280
So, if you do not think it will be uncomfortable.

712
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,880
Do tell. I think it will be exciting.

713
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,200
I've also been looking forward to meeting you. I've seen you on screen.

714
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,760
And and ...

715
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,880
You have such a good insight when reading up.

716
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,400
Do you think so? That was sweet said. I've been there for many years.

717
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,600
Yes, I remember you from when I was quite small.

718
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,920
Now ...

719
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,720
It is also good to Anna. It is Anna who made it.

720
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,240
It tastes really good. Give your son some more gravy.

721
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,720
I am opposed to unlock the door. I think that too.

722
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,560
Do you have a schedule? We have a meal plan, right?

723
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,920
If you have to, then man. Where is the silly.

724
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,040
It is rare, it is so beautiful here.

725
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,240
When someone something about locks? Lock?

726
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,080
It may be, Steffen know. There is no one who knows anything?

727
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,640
We need to turn up in Miss Jensen.

728
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,920
Now be careful. When you're in heat?

729
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,760
(Sexlyde)

730
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,840
Hello. I'm going home to Sille and eat.

731
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Want something to eat? The hair is set up to shenanigans.

732
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,440
I'm going home to Sille and eat. I'm just going home to Sille.

733
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,120
You will be completely red. Is he just as red in the face?

734
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,960
Now I think I am a little strict. You must not listen to them.

735
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,480
What time are you home? I am leaving now.

736
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
That is so sweet.

737
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,880
Come here.

738
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,120
Although the Vietnam War is over rising tensions.

739
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,480
Attempting to avoid war between Vietnam and Cambodia are stranded.

740
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,800
A new war is fact.

741
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,120
Try to hear. We are up to 17.48 now.

742
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,480
If you must have a live guest in, then I think max. 2.40.

743
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,040
It's almost breakfast. We have a deadline.

744
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,880
The main story, we provide a proper peel. Cambodia.

745
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,560
If Cambodia is ... That's fine.

746
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,080
How many dead children should be in the feature?

747
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,000
Do not show the dead children. Death toll of millions.

748
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,560
Millions? Yes, when this is over.

749
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,840
Then we take the worst pictures from, and then we say three minutes.

750
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,600
Last we had something down there, there was seer storm.

751
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,480
It was as though.

752
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,040
I would be happy 3:30, then we are up at 27.42.

753
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,440
(Groans)

754
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,000
(Is cry)

755
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,800
Is there something wrong? I do not know exactly what is happening.

756
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,360
You must have some wine. I have something stronger in my bag.

757
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,000
This so.

758
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,040
We have a good time. Yes, it is fine.

759
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,920
I take it yourself. Yes.

760
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,440
We have plenty of time.

761
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,040
It will be fine. Yes.

762
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,800
There was once a king ... who made a terrible experiment.

763
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,240
Where he took 60 newborns and gave them food and so on ??

764
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,160
but half of them were not to be touched by any man.

765
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:29,200
So no physical contact in any way ever.

766
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:36,280
But otherwise they were just as much sleep and food and vitamins as the others.

767
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,440
What happened? Yes?

768
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,920
They died.

769
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,720
Should not he have a hug? We must be touched!

770
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,280
Up to father.

771
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
We are ready now.

772
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,440
Ti, ni, ??

773
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,880
eight, seven ...

774
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,880
... Sex ...

775
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,040
Five ... ...

776
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,160
... fire ...

777
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,600
... Three ...

778
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,720
... to ...

779
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,560
I can not.

780
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,360
Get straight Anna out. We Preben takes his place. You'll fix Preben.

781
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,920
I can not.

782
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
Come on.

783
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,200
Come on with the sign.

784
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,080
I'm going to DR.

785
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,760
You've got the message? It is I, like have.

786
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:01,320
It will not have to, Leif. You do not feel good for the moment.

787
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,960
Yes, but that is ... It has been on the road awhile.

788
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,280
Do not take me off. It is you do not.

789
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,520
So, the decision is taken. You can not do that.

790
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,800
You must not decide on my life that way.

791
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,320
I do not decide anything. You have no right to take me out!

792
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:29,720
Calm. Breathe deeply into your stomach, and look deep into yourself.

793
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,960
Drop it there. You have some problems.

794
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,480
I can easily do it here. I'm a professional. You know that.

795
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,320
You need to do something else.

796
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,720
You must be doing something good for yourself and make some common things.

797
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,520
Take to India, talk with Sai Baba. Do not talk to me like that!

798
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,320
I've been here for so many years and you will not speak to me like that!

799
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
(Groans)

800
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,200
Will not you give me Vilads' plate?

801
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,960
Yes sorry. Where's Erik?

802
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,640
At the school. He works late. Do you want chicken, Freya?

803
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,360
I would also like to have a little. I usually have that glass.

804
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,840
Thank you. Hey darling.

805
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Hi Anna.

806
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,440
Hi.

807
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,840
There is little food, if you want.

808
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,360
May I ... Yes go ahead.

809
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,560
Where have you been?

810
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,080
Where have you been, baby?

811
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,760
What do you mean? I have been at work.

812
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,840
I have not seen you for several days.

813
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,040
You have some sand on hand. Have you hit you?

814
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,800
What do you care?

815
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,320
What? Pardon.

816
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,000
How are you?

817
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,720
I have not seen you on the screen.

818
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,800
Now.

819
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,160
I go to work, and she then goes to school ??

820
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,280
but apart from that, I do very much the same.

821
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:47,680
We get up in the morning, and we eat at the table ??

822
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,400
and we drink some wine and go to bed ...

823
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,520
... With Erik.

824
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,040
What do you say?

825
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,480
No, it's not that way. This has of course not been long.

826
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,320
Only in my small, stupid, stupid, old head.

827
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,960
No.

828
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,480
I lie in my bed alone, but apart from that, we do the same.

829
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,080
I should probably also soon have some children?

830
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,800
Nej, I'm not pregnant. Now.

831
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,800
I by the, that ye all the time ... Or I could hear the ...

832
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,480
That the whole time ... All the time what?

833
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,320
Located and ... Do you listen at their door, sweetheart?

834
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,800
No, I have come just to stand a little too close to the door.

835
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:15,440
You should not do. No, that's wrong.

836
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,040
You should not do.

837
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,080
Anna, are you sad? Oh.

838
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,840
I dream very much for the time. You know, like half asleep.

839
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,920
I dream for example, that ...

840
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,960
That he goes on up the stairs.

841
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,080
While you sleep, so you do not notice it.

842
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,920
Who? Erik.

843
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:07,240
Maybe then you know it well. But you accept it in your sleep.

844
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,480
He goes on up the stairs ??

845
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,240
determined with such a firm grip on the handrail.

846
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,480
He opens the door to my room ...

847
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,640
And he moves certainly in the dark.

848
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:35,120
He knows how to take me, he knows my body.

849
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,160
And he knows that ...

850
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:45,080
... That he will keep me hard onto such a very specific way.

851
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,800
And it takes just three minutes, I'll come.

852
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,120
Take your plate, Vilads. Go up, eat, Vilads.

853
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:09,360
More would not take. Just once in a while.

854
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:16,120
If you ask Emma about it? What?

855
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,920
If you ask Emma, ​​you also have to go to bed with Erik?

856
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
And.

857
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,960
Yes, but it was only a dream.

858
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,920
Well, it was just a dream.

859
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,400
Lovely food. Yes.

860
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,680
Is there more chicken in the kitchen? No, there is what is.

861
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,200
I could eat a piece of.

862
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,880
Hello. Hello.

863
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,320
What now? Erik, can not we just talk?

864
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:26,200
Honey, I have all really busy. It must wait.

865
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,760
Fine, we take it now.

866
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:37,440
Sit right down. Where have I done now by the fags?

867
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,440
How are you? Come on.

868
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,160
Anna is going crazy. You must do something.

869
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,680
Well I have not time for hell. I have not time.

870
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,880
I have a competition, I will deliver.

871
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,040
I do not want to be a teacher and can not take care of woman problems.

872
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,520
Can Ditte not talk to her? It is the idea of ​​the whole collective.

873
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,440
Man back each other up. It is what is the idea of ​​it.

874
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,200
Can Ditte not talk to her? I am the last person who can fix it.

875
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,160
Erik, I have been together for 15 years.

876
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,040
So I understand, she breaks.

877
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,600
She is completely out of it. She is very unhappy.

878
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,080
She can not imagine living without you.

879
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,440
It is different for women.

880
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,680
I listen to your problems all the time. Incessantly.

881
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,520
I sit in a hole in my own house and trying to work out ??

882
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:46,200
but I must relate to some women's problems all the time.

883
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,400
I can not! Where the hell ... I have to work.

884
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,200
When should I work? When should I sleep?

885
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,440
There is nothing, I get peace. When should I work?

886
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,000
Take it easy. Hell!

887
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:39,880
Now, how we have it in ... Steffen, nej.

888
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,440
It was as much relevant. That's fine, Anna.

889
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,520
It should probably go.

890
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,040
Okay. It works damn, as though that things have run a little off track.

891
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:09,040
And I work incredibly sad, and it's fucking sad, simply.

892
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,760
I think we should hold a meeting. I think we should find the book forward.

893
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,720
Let's just get cleaned out a little.

894
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,240
If you would like the house to be, ??

895
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,040
then we find out which one of you must remain, I think.

896
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:05,040
Otherwise we are second on. It's also nice enough.

897
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,760
That is certainly not? Jo.

898
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,880
We are voting on who should move? Yes, well, then we do it.

899
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,720
We take a round, right? Mona?

900
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,400
No I will not ...

901
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,520
Companies. Bum.

902
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,000
Steffen. Also bum.

903
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,280
Bum. Yes, boom.

904
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,680
Well all ... Then comes we are not on.

905
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,920
No, we do not. Because it is you who must solve it here.

906
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,920
We can not fucking voice one in which we love, dammit.

907
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,920
You have to solve it themselves. That's what we're trying to say to you.

908
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,280
So you must find out what you two or three.

909
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:08,040
Hi Anna. Hello Erik.

910
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,960
Yes ... so we reached so far.

911
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,600
And.

912
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,520
Would you like to move?

913
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,160
No.

914
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,360
What about you, Erik? Would you move?

915
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,640
No. No, I will not move.

916
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,200
I do not think there is anyone to be moving at all.

917
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,920
I also want to stay with my daughter here ??

918
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,760
as long as possible.

919
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,640
I would also like to.

920
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,200
And what do you say, Freya? What?

921
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,720
You are perhaps the that this means the most to.

922
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:19,000
It should Freja as not decide. For now quiet. Let her say anything.

923
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,920
What do you say? It is irresponsible.

924
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,720
Who is irresponsible? You shut me completely out.

925
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,400
You will not touch me. You will not touch my skin!

926
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:34,640
Let however be screaming like that. You can not figure it out here!

927
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,640
Who was it who would do this?

928
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,000
Sit down now, and stop shouting.

929
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,080
Fun now.

930
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:50,240
Erik, dammit. It solves nothing that you yell at each other.

931
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,760
It was you who wanted it here. It is your fault.

932
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,800
I would like to just say something.

933
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,080
I've never seen someone be so sad that mom is right now.

934
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,960
Mom, I think this place destroy you.

935
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:16,120
You are not yourself anymore. I can see that.

936
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,800
It's actually quite terrible.

937
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:29,000
So I think you need to move. As quickly as you can.

938
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,600
Well, I think you can.

939
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,400
Mom, I think well, you can handle it.

940
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,560
Freja, honey. She just went.

941
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,040
Freja ...

942
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,600
Freja?

943
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,760
Freja?

944
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,000
We can just do it quietly.

945
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,240
Do what? Burn her stuff.

946
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,520
Mom, come on! Mother! Please do not!

947
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,920
Be here now!

948
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,560
I burn it just! Mom, we love it!

949
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,720
(Anna screams)

950
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,640
So ...

951
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,600
So, Mom. So ...

952
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,640
It should probably go. It should probably go. So ...

953
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,680
It should probably go. So ...

954
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,680
So ...

955
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,320
It should probably go. So ...

956
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,560
I would like to say sorry, Freya.

957
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,480
You have helped me. What you need to know.

958
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,840
Travelling so?

959
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,640
Yes, but only for a few weeks. I gotta just find something to stay in.

960
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,400
I love you.

961
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,760
Come on.

962
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,720
Ole! What are you doing?

963
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,120
Have you seen?

964
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,440
It is a dishwasher. Allon bought it.

965
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,320
Where did you get the money to go?

966
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,080
What is it? A dishwasher.

967
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,440
What, then, Ole? I'm not interested in it.

968
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,680
Why do the machines come and take over?

969
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,760
Ej, Allon.

970
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,920
You are cold as an icicle and churlish.

971
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,200
Then you can wash your shit up yourself.

972
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,240
Hey darling. Hello Freja.

973
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:07,080
Sorry, we're late. You may damn well say.

974
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,680
Peter. Sid ned.

975
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,040
What the hell, you've got lady on, Freya?

976
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,360
She is damn skidesød, man.

977
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,840
Now stop it, then, Ole.

978
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,160
Pardon. I am joking.

979
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,640
I think so ... What do you think?

980
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,600
It is a lovely dish. Allon, sorry. I love you.

981
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,200
Stop it. Come here, sorry.

982
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,360
I love you!

983
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,320
If you read the newspaper, you will experience exactly ??

984
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,640
how love disappears in the world ??

985
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,280
and a new and exciting time begins.

986
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:30,160
Perhaps that is precisely why Vilads have found a better place to be.

987
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,040
Vilads could only live in the time of love.

988
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,320
Peter is waiting for me. I am leaving now.

989
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,200
Now.

990
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,000
So feel good, darling. Hi there.

991
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,800
See you. Hello.

992
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,200
See you later? No, I'm leaving now.

993
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,080
Vi her. Ja. Hej.

994
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,240
Hello Emma. It was really beautiful, I think.

995
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,600
(Erik crying)

996
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,160
Sorry Sorry.

997
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,560
That's fine, Erik.

998
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,120
Hi.

999
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:12,400
Try to take them here.

1000
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,800
What is it?

1001
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,040
Peter.

1002
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,480
I love you.

1003
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,880
Her.

1004
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:24,160
Then the damn thing to have legs to walk on the gallop pretzel.

1005
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:33,400
Why do not we just send a small, friendly thought up to Vilads?

1006
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,960
Bowl.

1007
01:47:05,400 --> 01:43:35,960
