1
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,800
The year was 1972.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
June, 1972.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,560
A small party of us left Television
Centre in London in a minibus.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,180
We were heading for this marvellous
West Yorkshire countryside.

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:38,600
In the bus, was the director
Jimmy Gilbert, three actors -
Michael Bates, Bill Owen

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,840
and Peter Sallis,
a small very crew...

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,460
But what we did have
was an absolutely wonderful script.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,860
I read the script in bed.
I got about halfway through

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,680
and I rang Jimmy Gilbert.
"What do you think?" he said.

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
I said, "It's pure gold.
Count me in!"

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
It happens sometimes
in an actor's life,

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,080
if you're very, very lucky,

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
that something special turns up.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,640
When I read Last Of The Summer
Wine, I thought, "This is IT."

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,240
He's still calling for me
in broad daylight!
Say he doesn't belong to you,

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,760
you're just looking after him
for somebody!

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,360
I was at home, watching a series
called The Misfit -
a show which was a drama,

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,280
but with comedy undertones.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,160
I thought the phrasing of the
writing, and the whole style of it,

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,560
was worth pursuing. The writer
was a guy I'd never met, Roy Clarke.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,080
When Duncan invited me
to come and see him,

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,140
and would I be interested
in having a crack at sitcom,

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,240
the answer was... I nearly bit
his fingers off! Yeah, sure,
I wanted to have a go at sitcom.

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,460
The BBC seemed to have
in their mind, at that time,

25
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:16,300
an idea that they had a requirement
for a series, a comedy series,
based around three old men.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,820
'For a long time,
I struggled with this idea

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,480
'to try and get some enthusiasm
about it, and I had none.
I had none at all, really,'

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,060
until almost at the point
of turning it down,

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,920
it occurred to me

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,740
that if these three old men
were totally free,

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,260
they had no responsibilities,

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,140
no ties, they each lived alone,

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,140
they were...

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,340
unmarried or widows,

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,720
they were unemployed or retired,

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,160
'therefore,
they were able to wander about

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,540
'in the same way
that young adolescents can do.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,760
'That pulled it out of the fire for
me. I saw these, not as old people,

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,080
'just kids that happened
to have got a bit older.'

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,000
Your left-hand oar! Your left-hand
oar! Starboard, do you mind?!

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,920
'Because this story
was going to be about older people,

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,700
'I wanted to emphasise
that summer was still around.

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,960
'It might be the last of summer,
but it was still summer
as far as they were concerned.'

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,040
And so that's why I called it
Last Of The Summer Wine -

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,180
to emphasise the summer
as against the autumn.

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,240
And it was never well received.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,860
It was taken for granted that
I'd change it. It'd be a working
title, till we got a better one.

48
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,740
One of the alternatives
was The Library Mob

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,600
because, in the first series,

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,840
they used to visit their library
and sit in the reading room,

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
leafing through the newspapers
and chatting.

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,160
He's been useless all his life!
You only say that cos it's true.

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,720
As kids, WE'd go for a swim and HE'd
go for a dip in his mam's handbag!

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,840
There weren't nowt in it, though.
We was poor.

55
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,100
We can see how far you've come(!)
It's our family tradition.

56
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,460
It used to be a tradition here, if
you were hungry, you could knock on
any door and, without hesitation,

57
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,200
they'd slam it right in your face!

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Fortunately, it was abandoned...
just before the show went on air.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,500
We reverted to
Last Of The Summer Wine.

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,040
After we'd done the pilot,

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,700
I had a deputation
of the three actors who said,

62
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,680
"We don't think this is going
to work as Last Of The Summer Wine.
Nobody will remember it."

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,620
The characters came fairly easily
with Compo coming first,

64
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,120
because Compo was a composite of...

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,700
of people I knew
in my own environment,

66
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,500
'in my own area,
who lived that totally feckless,
but quite cheerful, existence.

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,060
'Always wore wellies!'

68
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,300
Having got him,
then it made obvious sense

69
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,940
to go straight to his opposite,

70
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,860
'who was regimented,

71
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,540
'straight up and down,

72
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,700
'authoritarian.

73
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,220
'So you got the two extremes...'

74
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,760
Now you wait here.

75
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,680
It's not only me City & Guilds,
it's the social chasm between us.

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Hey, Cyril! Give us a fag.
I'll give you a sniff of me socks!

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,600
'..which left a nice slot for Clegg
in the middle,

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,520
'who'd take the blows
and balance the three out.'

79
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,160
'I wanted Peter Sallis for Clegg
from the word one, if he was free.'

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,220
I'd written it
very much with Peter in mind.

81
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,100
The other two,

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,260
I had no fixed ideas about

83
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,880
and left it to Jimmy Gilbert.

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,600
I thought that
Bill Owen would be right

85
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,680
because I'd seen him
play a Compo-like character

86
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,220
in a play with Spike Milligan
called Oblomov.

87
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,380
I'd seen him in Davie Storey's play,
The Contractor,
where he played a tough northerner.

88
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,940
Putting the two together
and having seen him in comedy,
he seemed to be the perfect casting.

89
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,980
This went down like a lead balloon,

90
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,240
because I was raised on film

91
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,780
and I remembered Bill
in all his films,

92
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,660
always the cockney airman,

93
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,580
the cockney AC2, or whatever,

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,760
and I couldn't see Bill as Compo.

95
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,700
Oh, hello, sir.
Hello, Sergeant.

96
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,340
Sorry about making a clot of myself.

97
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,360
What do you mean? That landing? Ta.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,120
I've seen worse! Old Bill Thompson
was my pilot till he bought it.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,980
He did some real shakers.
Broke every bone!

100
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,680
It's only when I saw Bill on screen

101
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,320
that I realised what
a wonderful physical clown Bill is.

102
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,400
His movements...

103
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,600
when he does odd walks.

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,560
Bill is magical, physically.

105
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,320
'There's no question about it.'

106
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,780
The next one I met was Peter Sallis.

107
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,140
I hadn't seen him since we were
at drama school together, at RADA,
20 years before.

108
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,140
When I saw him coming in with this
rather battered jacket on, and
a cardigan and ill-fitting trousers,

109
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,420
I thought, "Poor old Peter.
He's down on his luck."

110
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,780
But as he left, he said, "I think
this would do for Clegg, don't you?"

111
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,480
Well, it was a suit
that I'd had for...donkey's years.

112
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,280
I was very fond of it.

113
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,220
But I thought,
"Yes, this would do for Clegg."

114
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,840
It was a sort of
library-lounger's suit.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Anyway, what I didn't realise
was that was that it was going to
run, the programme, for 20 years!

116
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,060
And after about 20 years,
the suit was falling to pieces.

117
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,180
What the BBC wardrobe department
did, which was cunning of them,

118
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,060
was that they took a small amount
of the cloth to a local mill

119
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,280
and they asked them to run them up
a whole roll of the stuff,
which they did.

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,680
So they were able to make me a new
suit and one or two other suits,

121
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,500
just in case they were
needed by the, um, stand-ins.

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,020
I felt it should be
in a small market town,

123
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,080
surrounded by beautiful countryside,

124
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,260
and preferably with valleys.

125
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,040
I was speaking to Barry Took
about this

126
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,560
and he said,
"Why don't you try Holmfirth?"

127
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,360
I went there
when I was a young comic. It sounds
exactly what you're looking for.

128
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,240
I rang up Roy and went to Holmfirth.
We stood on the hill, looked down
on the town and said, "That's it!"

129
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,720
And that was it.

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,040
When it first appeared on
the screens, as a situation comedy,

131
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,220
Last Of The Summer Wine
was something of a breakthrough,

132
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,300
in visual terms, for a sitcom.

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,880
Certainly, it wasn't studio-bound.

134
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,900
You did get outside.
You got outside with a purpose.

135
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,900
You saw that scenery and,
from the beginning,

136
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,680
that's been a major element,
I think, in its success.

137
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:25,363
'When Michael Bates sadly died,

138
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:28,743
'Brian Wilde was brought in

139
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:33,743
'to play a modified character
and put the series back on track.'

140
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:38,823
The view. The grandeur.
The valley spreading out beneath us,

141
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:42,903
lacking only one thing
which we are going to supply.

142
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:51,743
I don't think that's all that funny!
Come on! I know you're there!

143
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:56,983
Right! God knows - I try to
raise the tone of our activities!

144
00:10:56,983 --> 00:11:00,563
Who introduced you to astronomy?
..Right!

145
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:06,703
Who brought you out here one night
and taught you how to navigate
by the stars

146
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:09,323
And had to get a taxi back
from Clayhidon?

147
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:11,863
Well, I'd just finished Porridge

148
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:15,703
and they asked me
to be in Last Of The Summer Wine.

149
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:20,503
I said I'd love to read the scripts.
They sent them and I read them.

150
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:24,323
They were quite different
to anything I'd read.

151
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,983
Foggy was a lovely character.

152
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:31,023
He was different to Mr Barraclough,
who dithered.

153
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,603
Foggy was positive.
Positively incompetent!

154
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,843
Steady there...

155
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,463
Easy...

156
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,803
Sneaky old Napoleon!

157
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,383
Ow!

158
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:05,563
We were very delighted,
may I say even proud,

159
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:12,243
when we read in the press that
the Queen's favourite TV programme
was Last Of The Summer Wine.

160
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:15,603
This brought back memories to me...

161
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,603
of Foggy with illusions

162
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:21,963
as the royal corgi walker

163
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:25,283
to Her Majesty, the Queen!

164
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:28,703
And, one day, it's going to happen.

165
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:32,743
The phone's going to ring
and it's going to be THEM.

166
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:36,003
Them?!
The royal corgis.

167
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:39,023
On the telephone?!

168
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:43,843
Not in person, no.
You know what that means?

169
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,163
Sharp teeth in the ankles?

170
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:51,863
It means the royal warrant!
"By appointment" on our letterheads.

171
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:55,603
In with a chance of the OBE!
I like it!

172
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:59,103
WC Dewhurst, OBE...

173
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:04,723
Mr WC Dewhurst, OBE...
Sir Walter Dewhurst,

174
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,663
OBE.

175
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:13,223
Of course, privately amongst the
Household, I'll be known as Foggy.

176
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:17,683
"Has Foggy come back
with the corgis yet?" "No, ma'am."

177
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:20,823
"They've never been so healthy!"

178
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:29,543
When Brian Wilde chose to
leave the series, Michael Aldridge
joined us, happily,

179
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:33,683
and played Seymour and, again,
put us straight back on track.

180
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:40,063
The door remains closed to
strange voices, even when they are
in possession of the codeword.

181
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:43,943
The reason is, of course,
that a person's voice print

182
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:47,443
is as distinctive
as a set of fingerprints.

183
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:52,763
This genius little beauty
which simple justice

184
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:57,323
demands should make a bob or two.

185
00:13:57,323 --> 00:14:02,243
It is programmed to obey the
commands of his master's voice only.

186
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:07,063
I don't care who stands shouting
at this door, it'll never answer.

187
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,403
Codfingers!

188
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,063
You have to
get the pitch exactly right!

189
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,423
Codfingers!

190
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:21,583
HE VARIES THE PITCH
Codfingers! ..Codfingers!
..Codfingers!

191
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,183
C-od-fin-gers...

192
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:26,063
Codfingers!

193
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,903
Codfingers!

194
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:30,463
It's me, you stupid door!

195
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:36,843
One of the great reasons
for the change of direction
in Last Of The Summer Wine

196
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:42,443
from less film to more film was
the arrival, many years ago now,

197
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:46,463
of the still current producer,
Alan Bell.

198
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:49,103
Alan is, by instinct,

199
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:52,323
a film man

200
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:56,643
and quietly behind the scenes,
whether we realised it or not,

201
00:14:56,643 --> 00:15:00,703
the moment he arrived,
we moved towards more film.

202
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:07,303
When we were doing
Uncle Of The Bride, the episode
that introduced Michael Aldridge -

203
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:10,023
he played the uncle -

204
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:16,703
we had the scene where we were
leaving his house and going
to the church for the wedding.

205
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:19,583
Everything was ready. The house

206
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,143
'and the lovely pond beside it,

207
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:28,923
'the car with the camera mounted
on it, and I was to be driving.'
Put her in reverse!

208
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:33,123
Unfortunately,
Peter got a little over-excited.

209
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:38,103
It was probably the thrill of it
all. Or he forgot what he was doing!

210
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:44,983
He put his foot hard down on that
accelerator and we backed, boy,
right into the middle of that pond!

211
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:47,523
The car began to sink.

212
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:52,603
The water was coming in all through
the doors and we were sinking.

213
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:56,103
Then a voice was heard
from the director.

214
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,883
"Save the camera!"

215
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:02,463
I replied.
I can't tell you what I said.

216
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,063
The BBC don't allow it.

217
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,683
Even then, when we got on the shore,

218
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:12,863
he said, "That was wonderful!
We'll do it again in a long shot."

219
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:19,483
He turned to us. We weren't there.
We were in our caravan.
He got the shot, but not with us.

220
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:24,063
Here we go, then.
ENGINE REVVES

221
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:30,023
BUBBLING

222
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,643
Well, you said reverse...

223
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:42,283
Hi. This, you see,
is the inside of the cafe,

224
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:46,323
where we've had many an incident
with the tin tray.

225
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:51,763
Like the other sets, it's been made
in the film studios at Shepperton.

226
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:57,663
It's through this that I used to
keep my eye on the customers.

227
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,183
See they behaved themselves!

228
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:07,643
It's in here I played
many a romantic scene with
that marvellous actor, John Comer.

229
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:11,443
Do you remember?
He played my husband, Sid.

230
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:13,963
Open it carefully!
I am!

231
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:18,343
I don't want it scratching before we
start. You started already!

232
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:20,883
You can't dig in with a screwdriver!

233
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:24,746
Pass me something sharp -
like your tongue!

234
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:28,666
Will it work? In my experience of
technology, it doesn't always work.

235
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,466
I thought that were men.

236
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:35,206
First electricity, then electronics.

237
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:38,466
My Barry's most accomplished
on his mobile.

238
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:42,166
There's no need to tell everybody!

239
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,966
We established a pattern first,
I think, of, in odd episodes,

240
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:52,466
having a guest character appear
as a one-off and then disappear.

241
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:55,406
And this worked very well.

242
00:17:55,406 --> 00:18:00,586
But some come and are so attractive
you're reluctant to let them go.

243
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:03,226
'For instance, Thora Hird.'

244
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,726
Start the engine.

245
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,906
Clutch down.
Clutch down.

246
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:14,886
Into first gear.
Into first gear...
GEARS CRUNCH

247
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:22,566
Final check in the mirror.
The mirror...

248
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:26,446
Handbrake off,
clutch out and gently accelerate.

249
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:30,906
Handbrake off, clutch out
and gently accelerate...

250
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:34,626
ENGINE ROARS AND GEARS CRUNCH

251
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:42,026
Sometimes, she does that...

252
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:45,286
ENGINE ROARS

253
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:48,386
Sometimes, she does that!

254
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:54,626
I still look at her on screen
and think of the Thora
I sat in the cinemas watching,

255
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,246
or the theatres watching,

256
00:18:57,246 --> 00:19:00,786
and it's a great,
warm feeling for me

257
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:07,386
to think I closed that circle
between being a fan and being
involved with a professional.

258
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,946
It's been a great pleasure.

259
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:13,946
The funny thing about it
is when I'm stopped in the street,

260
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,606
it's always about something simple.

261
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:21,326
You know without me telling you.
People laugh at things THEY do.

262
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,166
And when I put newspapers down
for Wesley to step on,

263
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,646
the number of women who stop me
in places like food stores

264
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:34,106
and say, "When you put the papers
down! I did that as a child."

265
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,546
Did you want me?

266
00:19:55,486 --> 00:20:00,506
Alan Bell, our producer-director,
was very clever. Very lucky.

267
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:07,086
He managed to get
hold of Gordon Wharmby, who was
a wonderful character actor,

268
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:11,406
to play the part of Wesley Pegden,
who was married to Edie.

269
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:15,446
Between the two of them,
that is Wesley and Edie,

270
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:20,026
they gave us some interesting
insights into marital bliss.

271
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:22,646
What are you looking at?

272
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:26,486
I am just making sure that,
under all that grime,

273
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:29,026
I am not talking to a stranger!

274
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,606
I'm busy. What is it?

275
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,626
When are you going to
fix that dripping tap?

276
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,226
I fixed it first thing this morning.

277
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:43,266
Now you're acting like a stranger!

278
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:49,886
I've got to go. I'm onto something
up at the shed. It'll be terrific.
Don't forget where you live!

279
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:56,066
I shan't forget.
It's the only house in the street
with paper on the floor(!)

280
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:12,486
Everyone will remember Thora Hird's
scenes in Last Of The Summer Wine

281
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:17,126
as some of the funniest. I'll
remember her as a fine professional.

282
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:22,166
Michael Aldridge, for family
reasons, had to leave the programme

283
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,206
and we were lucky
to get Brian Wilde to come back

284
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:31,426
and get us involved
in some more Foggy escapades.

285
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:35,966
Are we ready, then?

286
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:38,486
Ready!
I think so.

287
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:42,266
I told you I'd get us out.
..We're ready.

288
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,886
Off you go!

289
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,786
Oh, Howard...

290
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:09,346
Oh, Marina...

291
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:14,086
Oh, 'eck!

292
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,886
What I particularly like

293
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:32,766
is the development
of this eternal triangle,

294
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:37,826
because, hopefully, the way that
we play it doesn't make it tacky.

295
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:44,406
It could be tacky,
but the director makes sure it isn't
because we play it for comedy.

296
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,446
Everybody knows that Howard's
not going to do anything.

297
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:52,566
But what I like, as Pearl,
is just knowing enough

298
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:56,346
to present him
with just that little threat.

299
00:22:56,346 --> 00:23:00,166
I didn't know Norman Clegg
was one for the women!

300
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,686
It's always a surprise, isn't it,
who's a one for the women?

301
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:09,446
I keep telling you, love.
I don't know how the note got there.

302
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:12,826
I think it was planted on me.
Mmm...

303
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,546
I must have enemies.

304
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:20,006
There's me, for a start.

305
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,446
One of the exciting things

306
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,126
about each year's
batch of new scripts

307
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:34,066
is to find out
where Howard and Marina will meet.

308
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,266
We do meet in some wonderful places.

309
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:39,626
Ah! A-ah!

310
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:44,466
'There was one episode where
Compo had a home-made submarine...'

311
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:51,606
It's so difficult to find places

312
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,986
where you can REALLY be alone.

313
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:57,166
I know.

314
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:01,466
I think you've cracked it here,
Howard.

315
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,146
I have, haven't I?

316
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,746
Sheer genius...

317
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:12,026
If only we had a bigger boat!

318
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,326
If only...

319
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:19,146
Still, as long as we are alone...

320
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:25,346
My God!

321
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:28,446
It's Pearl in a submarine!

322
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:38,146
I was delighted to be asked
to do a Christmas show.

323
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,766
The following year, I did another.

324
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,866
Two years later, I was thrilled
when they said, "Would you be
a permanent character?"

325
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,946
Two years later, I was thrilled
when they said, "Would you be
a permanent character?"

326
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:49,486
'And it's such fun to be in.'

327
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:53,066
Time-wasters!
"Could they have a look round?"

328
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:59,106
"Course," I said,
but it's a different game
when you charge a shilling!

329
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:05,826
You'd think you were asking
for the earth! I suppose
you'd all like a nice cup of tea?

330
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:08,946
ALL: Oh, aye!
That'll be 10p each!

331
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:19,286
One of the problems we had

332
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:24,286
was finding the right location
for Auntie Wainwright's shop.

333
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:28,526
We were lucky. We stumbled
on just the right thing.

334
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:32,826
It was a period shop
and looked absolutely right.

335
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:36,406
And so we filmed it,
and it was great.

336
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:40,566
Unfortunately,
when we came back a year later...

337
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,486
..it was somebody's house!

338
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:50,066
But our inventive designer,
Stefan Paxi, solved the problem.

339
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:54,686
He simply built a facade of a shop

340
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,486
and bolted it
onto the front of the house.

341
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:04,866
For obvious reasons,
the camera can't show you
what is actually inside the house.

342
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:07,466
Since I came to this programme,

343
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:11,606
I've met so many people
I've admired for so many years.

344
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:17,386
And one, in particular is... He's
dear Danny O'Dea who plays Eli.

345
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:21,086
He creases me every time
he opens his mouth!

346
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:23,266
Eli!

347
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,386
Listen.
What's up?

348
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:32,646
Lend us a quid.
No problem!

349
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:35,346
No problem at all...

350
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:39,026
Ely!

351
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,586
CRASHING

352
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:53,486
They want to put something
round these holes!

353
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,266
The contribution of the music
to the series...

354
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,886
..has got to be recognised.

355
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:07,426
Firstly, it's got to be recognised
what a ground-breaker this was

356
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,826
at its time, 25 years ago.

357
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:13,766
Sitcom music was funny music,

358
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:19,186
more or less declaring, "Watch me,
this is going to be funny."

359
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:26,126
Who'd have expected the beautiful
melody that Ronnie came up with
for Last Of The Summer Wine?

360
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:29,686
MUSIC:
"Last Of The Summer Wine"

361
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:49,666
'And with the larger orchestra,
the Summer Wine theme

362
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:53,506
'was given
an extraterrestrial feel.'

363
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,766
Me brakes have gone!
Help!

364
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,926
Ah!
Ohh...

365
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:22,646
Welcome to Earth!

366
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:33,606
It makes you wonder
what sort of planet they come from!

367
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,486
Stars appearing in the series

368
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:39,526
for the odd episode -

369
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:43,846
very satisfying.
Very pleasurable for me,

370
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:47,166
in terms of people like Ron Moody.

371
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,806
I wasn't in the business

372
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:55,086
when I saw Oliver and that
wonderful performance as Fagin.

373
00:28:56,166 --> 00:29:01,166
Then, it's almost the completion
of a little dream

374
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:06,226
when you see someone like Ron Moody
appearing in a major part,

375
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:11,266
even if it's only in one episode,
it's very pleasurable.

376
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:14,026
I have this weak heart.

377
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:17,226
Weak heart?!

378
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:20,226
Yes, I'm afraid my life is dated,

379
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:24,826
circumscribed by the palpitations
of a faulty ticker.

380
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:30,926
I have the satisfaction
of knowing that I overstrained it
in the service of humanity,

381
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:35,586
but you can understand why I
couldn't risk hunting for treasure.

382
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:38,146
I couldn't stand the excitement.

383
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:42,266
What about the barmaid?

384
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:46,686
It wasn't like that.

385
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:50,406
The good woman merely reminded me
of the lady...

386
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:53,146
who was once my wife.

387
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,426
LOUD SNORT

388
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,226
RESOUNDING CHORDS

389
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:43,726
When Alan Bell said, "Cut!",
which is the end of the scene,

390
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:47,786
and he rushed over,
"Are you all right, Norman?"

391
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:51,946
I looked up at him,
"Yeah, I think... Course I am!"

392
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:56,026
Sometimes you do hurt yourself,
but I think of the money
and I'm all right!

393
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:04,730
Just before I started filming,
I picked up a minor ailment
which would stop me filming.

394
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,750
They had to recast
and I suggested Frank Thornton.

395
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:15,730
I remember Alan Bell was talking
to me on the phone. I was in
the kitchen. I can see it all now.

396
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,570
He said, "It's a great pity about
Brian Wilde having to leave us,

397
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,470
"but we've managed
to get Frank Thornton."

398
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,130
And I said, "Spot on!"

399
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,810
Stay calm! I'm on my way.

400
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,390
If there are any smokers down there,
this is not a good time!

401
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,730
Just stay there!
I'm coming down no-o-ow!

402
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,690
Oops!

403
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,850
Is this yours?!

404
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,950
I was only due
to make about six episodes

405
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,790
as a sort of temporary stand-in
for Brian.

406
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,870
But due to the fragmented nature of
filming - a bit here, a bit there -

407
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,390
and problems
with Brian's availability,

408
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,570
it was impossible for him to come
back and I made all 11 episodes.

409
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,590
Leave this with me.
I can handle policemen.

410
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,210
In two minutes,
they'll be asking for autographs.

411
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,430
Now, then, constables.
It's your lucky day.

412
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,450
How often do you meet
Truly of the Yard?

413
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,650
Thou made a big impression there(!)

414
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,770
They've been up all night.
They're in a bad mood.

415
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,310
I have been invited to go back.

416
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,590
Perhaps one day I will. I'm relieved
not to have to climb those hills!

417
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,870
'In 1999, when we were filming
the millennium special,
we were in France.'

418
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,490
What's this, then?
Your coffee.

419
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,030
I ordered a drink, not a bath!

420
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,570
Where's the basin?

421
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,970
'Bill confided in me that he wasn't
feeling very well.'

422
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,010
And when we got back to England,

423
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,330
I insisted that he get in touch
with a specialist, which he did.

424
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,690
And, sadly, he was diagnosed
to have terminal cancer.

425
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,510
Bill wanted to finish filming.
He wouldn't give up.

426
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,030
We only got him
for the location scenes

427
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,590
shot in Yorkshire.

428
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:37,710
We then had the problem
of having £1.5 million-worth
of unfinished programming,

429
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,510
so I was forced to take liberties
with the script, put doubles in

430
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:48,210
and take scenes of Bill that were
shot earlier and electronically
drop them into the finished films.

431
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,990
I think we got away with it.
I don't think anyone noticed.

432
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:56,210
We were able to see Bill
in his final performance.

433
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,210
MUSIC: Final notes of "Taps"

434
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,990
Those of us who were connected
with the programme, most of us,

435
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:30,930
thought that that was the end
of Last Of The Summer Wine.

436
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:36,050
And then, quite extraordinarily,
Roy Clarke, our author,

437
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,030
wrote,
in the passage of three weeks,

438
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,690
three episodes

439
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,730
which he called
Elegy For Fallen Wellies.

440
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,930
They were the most touching,

441
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,630
the most moving,

442
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,550
most hilarious programmes

443
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,270
that I've ever seen on television!

444
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,370
# ..Start by admitting
From cardle to tomb

445
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,750
# It isn't that long a stay

446
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,450
# Life is a cabaret, old chum

447
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,450
# Only a cabaret, old chum

448
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,310
# And I love

449
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:29,250
# A cabare-e-e-et! #

450
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,670
Once again, gals. From the top!

451
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,090
'Nora in fishnet tights

452
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,690
'had proved too much for Compo.'

453
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,830
I wonder what put the smile
on his face.
Never you mind!

454
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,970
'The final scene with 200 pairs
of painter's overalls

455
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,550
'broke all records for letters
from viewers to the BBC...' There!

456
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,150
'..saying how touched they were.'

457
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,150
See ya, Compo.

458
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,230
Bill Owen had made Compo into
one of TV's most popular characters.

459
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,250
I thought, "How can they
replace the irreplaceable

460
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,710
No-one would have accepted
another actor playing Compo,

461
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:29,230
but Alan and Roy
came up with the idea
of having Bill's real-life son Tom

462
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,970
playing Compo's long-lost son Tom.

463
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,510
I'm looking for
a Mr William Simmonite.

464
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,990
Now's your chance. Tell him.

465
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,550
Father!

466
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,250
Oh, no! Not me!

467
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,930
'The problem was solved!
We had a link with dear old Bill.'

468
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,470
I recognise the ears!

469
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,690
Daddy!

470
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,410
I'm not your daddy.
I'm a retired policeman!

471
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,130
Some years ago, Stephen Lewis
joined for one episode

472
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,970
to play a man in hospital,

473
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,730
but he was so well liked
that it was decided, eventually,

474
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,810
to keep him on as a regular.

475
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,950
'He's provided hours
and hours of unsmiling pleasure.'

476
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,910
I want you to judge the performance.
See if you can see the lips moving.

477
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,270
My name is Waldo. A funny thing
happened on the way to the kennel.

478
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,070
What are you waiting for?

479
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:42,430
To hear what the funny thing was
on the way to the kennel.

480
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,150
I haven't written it yet!
Did my lips move?

481
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,030
Yes! He was moving his lips
all the time.

482
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,750
Not him, me!
Did you see MY lips move?

483
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,870
I wasn't watching your lips.
HE was the one that was speaking!

484
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,850
And a few years earlier, Billy
Hardcastle had joined our company.

485
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:11,150
'Billy Hardcastle,
distant relative of Robin Hood,
played by Keith Clifford.'

486
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,250
It will penetrate steel, will this.

487
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:23,290
I'm really going to enjoy this.
Somebody keep that sheriff quiet!

488
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,030
On my sitcoms, even though now

489
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,550
we do Summer Wine
entirely all on film,

490
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:47,810
we still show that finished film
to an invited audience

491
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,890
and we record their laughter.

492
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:58,830
The BBC go to
some considerable trouble to ensure
the audience have a good night out.

493
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:03,170
# U make my life complete
V means you're VERY sweet

494
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,310
# W-X-Y-Z... #

495
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:10,190
I don't like to see the shows going
out without hearing any laughter.

496
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,870
It alters the atmosphere
completely.

497
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,710
I don't want canned laughter, but
I don't want no laughter at all.

498
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,870
I enjoyed it. People don't think it
is for young people. I think it is.

499
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:30,390
It's the best show on the air!
Worth the licence fee.

500
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,370
Wonderful. It really was...
Wonderful!

501
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,050
And what of the future?

502
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:44,310
Who would have thought that we
would have happened upon a Chinese
electrical engineer from Hull?!

503
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,690
What's your name?
It's on the van.

504
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,670
Electrical?!
Entwistle!

505
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,470
Don't think I'm being nosey,
just because I am,

506
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,010
but how come
you've got a name like Entwistle?

507
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:05,110
I changed my name, didn't I?
From McIntyre. I was forever
being mistaken for a Scot!

508
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,830
What are you, then?
A Yorkshireman, what else?!

509
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,010
TRANSLATION:

510
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,550
Now I will interpret.

511
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,090
I am delighted to be doing
Last Of The Summer Wine.

512
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,150
And what of poor old Nora Batty?

513
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,510
She never thought
she'd wake up one morning

514
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,350
and find an Alvin living next door
to her in Compo's old house.

515
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,150
What's he smiling at?
You do me good, love.

516
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:00,230
Reminds me I used to be married to
one of them. Can't believe me luck!

517
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,370
I have watched
Last Of The Summer Wine,

518
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,830
man and boy, for 30 years.

519
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:13,630
It is a great pleasure and privilege
to be asked to join the company,

520
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,290
because many of the actors
are old colleagues and friends.

521
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,530
But I have to tell you
that for many years I had
a dragon of a wife called Mildred.

522
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:31,830
It is with great trepidation that
I am going to have to face up to
an even bigger dragon in Nora Batty.

523
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,870
Just in time for tea, ladies!
You'll have us all on fire.

524
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,670
I don't think you'd burn,
old asbestos breeches!

525
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,190
If it begins to slide,

526
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,590
then it wants burying peacefully,
with great fondness,

527
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,250
but if the audience
is still out there,

528
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,750
I'd love to do another one.

529
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,010
