1
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,265
That's right.

2
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,597
New York.

3
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,066
It's 1958.

4
00:00:44,874 --> 00:00:47,536
Anyway, for a few more minutes it is.

5
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:51,708
Come midnight, it's going to be 1959.

6
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,780
A whole other feeling.

7
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,375
The New Year.

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,482
The future.

9
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,748
Old Daddy Earth fixing to start
one more trip around the sun.

10
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,792
Everybody hoping this ride round
be a little more giddy...

11
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,121
...a little more gay.

12
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:14,394
All over town, champagne corks
is a-popping.

13
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:20,138
Over in the Waldorf, the big shots is
dancing to the strains of Guy Lombardo.

14
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:26,572
In Times Square, the little folks is watching
and waiting for that big ball to drop.

15
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,846
They're all trying to catch hold
of one moment of time...

16
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:33,979
...to be able to say:

17
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,055
"Right now! This is it!

18
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,018
"I got it!"

19
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:42,322
Of course, by then it'll be past.

20
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,593
But they're all happy...

21
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,460
...everybody having a good time.

22
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,163
Well, almost everybody.

23
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:54,636
There's a few lost souls
floating around out there.

24
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,308
Now, if y'all ain't from the city...

25
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:02,342
...we got something here
called "the rat race."

26
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:07,617
Got a way of chewing folks up
so that they don't want no celebrating...

27
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,924
...don't want no cheering up.

28
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,625
Don't care nothing about no New Year's.

29
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:14,924
Out of hope...

30
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,563
...out of rope...

31
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,996
...out of time.

32
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,727
This here is Norville Barnes.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,608
That office he's stepping out of...

34
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:28,872
...is the office of the president
of Hudsucker Industries.

35
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:30,977
That's his office.

36
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,075
How'd he get so high?

37
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:37,110
And why's he feeling so low?

38
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,685
Is he really going to do it?

39
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:44,690
Is Norville really going
to jelly up the sidewalk?

40
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:47,829
Well, the future...

41
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,993
...that's something you can
never tell about.

42
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:53,430
But the past...

43
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:57,499
...that's another story.

44
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,476
So in the third quarter
we saw no signs of weakening.

45
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:26,044
We're up 18% over last year's
third-quarter gross...

46
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,746
...and that, needless to say,
is a new record.

47
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:33,319
Our competition continues to flag
and we continue to take up the slack.

48
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,425
Market shares in most divisions
is increasing...

49
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:39,559
...and we have opened
seven new regional offices.

50
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,492
Our international division...

51
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:45,803
...is also showing vigorous signs of upward
movement for the last six months...

52
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:49,173
...and we're looking
at some exciting things in R&D.

53
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:32,810
Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me
about sub-franchising.

54
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,355
We're making so much money
in sub-franchising...

55
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,052
...it isn't even funny.

56
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,558
Our nominees and assigns continue
to multiply and expand...

57
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,328
...extending our influence nationally
and abroad.

58
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,936
Our owned and operateds are performing...

59
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:51,235
...far beyond our expectations
both here and abroad.

60
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:53,968
And the Federal Tax Act of 1958...

61
00:06:54,143 --> 00:06:57,909
...is giving us a swell write-off
on our plant and heavies.

62
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:27,106
And our last debenture issue
was this year's fastest seller.

63
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:30,111
So, third quarter and year-to-date...

64
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,442
...we have set a new record in sales,
a new record in gross...

65
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:37,145
...a new record in pre-tax earnings...

66
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:40,254
...a new record in after-tax profits...

67
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,425
...and our stock has split twice
in the past year.

68
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:44,885
In short...

69
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,031
...we're loaded.

70
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,343
Mr. Hudsucker?

71
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,385
It's a pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.

72
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,854
He could've opened the window.

73
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,798
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way.

74
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,462
Why? Why did he do it?
Everything was going so well.

75
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:46,206
What am I, a headshrinker?
Maybe the man was unhappy.

76
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,138
He didn't look unhappy.

77
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,269
- He didn't look rich.
- He was never an easy man to figure out.

78
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,443
He built this company with his bare hands.

79
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,315
Every step he took was a step up...

80
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:01,253
...except, of course, this last one.

81
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,291
He was a swell fella...

82
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:08,029
...but when the president, chairman
and owner of 87% of the stock...

83
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,223
...drops...

84
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:10,991
...44 floors--

85
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:11,829
45.

86
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,232
Counting the mezzanine.

87
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:16,166
Then the company, too, has a problem.
Stillson!

88
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,001
What exactly is the disposition
of Waring's stock?

89
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,508
As you know...

90
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,842
...Hud left no will and no family.

91
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:28,008
The company bylaws are quite clear
in that event.

92
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:31,520
"His entire portfolio will be converted
into common stock...

93
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:36,021
"...and will be sold over the counter
as of the first of the fiscal year...

94
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,218
- "...following his demise."
- Meaning?

95
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:42,291
Meaning simply that Waring's stock
and control of the company...

96
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:45,526
...will be made available
to the public January 1st.

97
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,759
Do you mean to say...

98
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:52,533
...that any slob in a smelly T-shirt
will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?

99
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,968
The company bylaws are quite clear.

100
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,069
My God! You're animals!

101
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:01,412
How can you discuss his stock
when the man has just leapt 45 floors?

102
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,348
44.

103
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,045
Not counting the mezzanine.

104
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,280
Quit showboating.

105
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:07,788
The man is gone. The question now
is whether we'll let...

106
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,883
...John Q. Public waltz in here
and buy our company.

107
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,019
What are you suggesting?

108
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:16,087
Certainly we can't afford
to buy a controlling interest.

109
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,458
Not while the stock is this strong.

110
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:21,902
How soon before Hud's paper
hits the market?

111
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:22,801
January 1st.

112
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,271
- Thirty days.
- Four weeks.

113
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,308
- A month at the most.
- One month...

114
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,672
...to make the blue-chip investment
of the century...

115
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,974
...look like a round-trip ticket
on the Titanic.

116
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:33,776
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.

117
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:35,350
Long live the Hud!

118
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,509
We depress the stock.

119
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:39,315
- To the point where we can buy 50%.
- 51%.

120
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:40,753
Not counting the mezzanine.

121
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:41,790
It could work.

122
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:43,324
- It should work.
- It would work.

123
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,087
It's working already.

124
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:49,264
Waring Hudsucker is abstract art
on Madison Avenue.

125
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:54,835
What we need now is a new president
who will inspire panic in the stockholder.

126
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,437
- A puppet!
- A proxy!

127
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:57,494
A pawn!

128
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,135
Some jerk...

129
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:03,642
...we can really push around.

130
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:09,345
You punch in at 8:30 every a.m.,
at 7:30 a.m. following a business holiday...

131
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,511
...unless it's a Monday, then it's 8:00.

132
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:15,182
- Punch in late and they dock you.
- This goes to seven! Urgent.

133
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:18,954
Incoming articles get a voucher.
Outgoing articles provide a voucher.

134
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,462
Move any article without a voucher,
they dock you!

135
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,964
Take this up to the secretarial pool
on three! ASAP!

136
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,695
Letter-size, a green voucher!
Folder-size, a yellow voucher!

137
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,361
Parcel-size, a maroon voucher!

138
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,496
This is for Morgatross! Chop-chop!

139
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:32,803
Wrong color voucher and they dock you!

140
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,144
6-7-8-7-0-4-9-Alpha-6!

141
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:39,573
That is your employee number!
It will not be repeated!

142
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:42,273
Without it, you can't cash your paycheck.

143
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,080
All right! This goes up to 27!

144
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:47,122
Return a waiver!
Do not return without a signed waiver!

145
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:51,319
Inter-office mail is code 37!
Intra-office mail is 37-3.

146
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:53,757
Outside mail is 3-37.

147
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,693
Code it wrong and they dock you!

148
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:58,631
I was supposed to have this on 28
ten minutes ago!

149
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:03,564
This has been your orientation.
Is there anything you do not understand?

150
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:07,264
If you have not been fully orientated,
you must file a complaint!

151
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:10,312
File a faulty complaint, and they dock you!

152
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:16,840
Kloppitt.

153
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,920
Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt, Kloppitt....

154
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,456
Max Kloppitt.

155
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,753
"Max Kloppitt, Jr."

156
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:35,599
What do you do when the envelope
is too big for the slot?

157
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:39,203
If you fold them, they fire you.

158
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,968
I usually throw them out.

159
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:51,041
Just got hired today.

160
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,451
Terrific.

161
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:54,244
Entry level.

162
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:58,382
But...

163
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,494
...I got big ideas.

164
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,527
I'm sure you do.

165
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,226
For instance...

166
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,629
...look at this sweet baby.

167
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:12,062
I developed it myself.

168
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,575
Yes, sirree, this is my ticket upstairs.

169
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,680
You know, for kids.

170
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:21,638
Terrific.

171
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,743
So, you see. I won't be working
in the mail room long.

172
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,755
No, I don't guess you will be.

173
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,583
How long've you been here?

174
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:31,921
Forty-eight years.

175
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,760
Next year they move me up to parcels...

176
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:37,195
...if I'm lucky.

177
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,335
Attention Hudsucker employees:

178
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,570
We regretfully announce
that at 30 seconds after the hour of noon...

179
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,936
...Hudsucker time...

180
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,671
...Waring Hudsucker, Founder, President...

181
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:52,880
...and Chairman of the Board
of Hudsucker Industries...

182
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:54,438
...merged with the infinite.

183
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,218
To mark this occasion of corporate loss...

184
00:15:57,286 --> 00:16:01,416
...we ask that all employees observe
a moment of silent contemplation.

185
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,521
Thank you for your kind attention.

186
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,725
This moment has been duly noted
on your timecards...

187
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,067
...and will be deducted from your pay.
That is all.

188
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:21,637
Blue letter!

189
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,970
Blue letter!

190
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,808
They're bringing a blue letter!

191
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:00,380
It's a blue letter.

192
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,445
Top, top level.

193
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,586
Confidential communication
between the brass.

194
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:07,954
Usually bad news.

195
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,757
They hate blue letters upstairs.

196
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:15,987
Hate them.

197
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:16,895
You!

198
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:18,866
Yeah, you! Barnes!

199
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:20,697
You don't look busy!

200
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,329
Think you can handle a blue letter?

201
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:28,035
This letter was sent this morning
by the big man himself, Waring Hudsucker!

202
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:31,872
It's addressed to Sid Mussburger,
Hudsucker's right-hand man!

203
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,537
It's a blue letter!

204
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:36,974
That means you got to put it right
in Mussburger's hands.

205
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,417
No secretaries! No receptionists!

206
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:41,885
No colleagues! No excuses!

207
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,052
Mussburger!

208
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:50,125
Hi! My name's Buzz, I got the fuzz,
I make the elevator do what she does.

209
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,127
Hang it up to dry.

210
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,134
- What's your pleasure?
- Forty-four.

211
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:57,238
Forty-four, the top-brass floor.
Say, buddy...

212
00:17:57,406 --> 00:18:01,172
...what takes 50 years to get to
the top floor and 30 seconds to get down?

213
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,674
Waring Hudsucker! You get it, buddy?

214
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:07,345
Say, buddy! Mr. Kline, up to nine.
Mrs. Dell, Personnel.

215
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,417
- Mr. Levin, 37.
- Thirty-six.

216
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:10,577
Walk down!

217
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:12,415
Ladies and gentlemen,
please step to the rear.

218
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:14,581
Here comes the gargantuan Mr. Grier.

219
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,258
Buddy, who's the most liquid businessman
on the street?

220
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:21,660
Waring Hudsucker.

221
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:25,960
When is the sidewalk fully dressed?
When it's wearing Hudsucker!

222
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,203
You get it?

223
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,728
It's a pun, a knee-slapper,
a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary....

224
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,307
Is that a blue letter?

225
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,539
Why didn't you tell a guy? Hold on, folks,
we're express to the top floor!

226
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:54,259
Good luck, buddy.

227
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,861
You'll need it.

228
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:13,474
Mr. Mussburger's office?

229
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,863
Hello.

230
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,173
Do you have an appointment?

231
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,870
Shall we look in the book?

232
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,949
- We don't seem to be in the book.
- I wouldn't be.

233
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,748
If we had an appointment,
we'd be in the book.

234
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:29,517
I have this....

235
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,354
Oh, here it is.

236
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:38,121
Gambotz?

237
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:40,262
Harry Gambotz?

238
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:43,063
No, too risky.
He's green but he's not slow.

239
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:45,664
Who is he?

240
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:48,875
No, I want an imbecile,
not a cipher, or you'd have the job.

241
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:53,144
They moved him to grommets and O-rings.

242
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,614
He's doing pretty well.

243
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,679
No, not McClanahan.

244
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:01,714
He bungled the Teleyard merger
so he's got something to prove.

245
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,286
Who let you in?

246
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:07,052
Atwater? Tremendous.
Except I just fired him last week.

247
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:08,923
Mr. Mussburger...

248
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,022
...Mr. Bumstead's waiting downstairs.

249
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,328
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

250
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:14,528
Spit it out!

251
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:19,005
Maybe you're
the company's biggest moron.

252
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,903
We can't use Morris. Been here too long.
He's a nice guy with too many friends.

253
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,004
In fact, why don't you fire him?
Scratch that, I'll fire him.

254
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:28,071
Make it fast. Fast!

255
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,551
Mr. Bumstead is growing restless.

256
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,087
Tell him I'll be right there.
Give him a magazine.

257
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,645
What are you, a mute?

258
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:37,722
How's the stock?

259
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:39,919
Bad? Well, it's not bad enough.

260
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:41,755
Listen, chump.

261
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,028
Either you find me a ding-dong or tender
your key to the executive washroom.

262
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:48,967
That goes double for you, pal.
Earclay? Oodgay!

263
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,109
This better be good. I'm in a bad mood.

264
00:21:57,212 --> 00:22:00,670
Sir, I've got something for you
from the mail room, but first...

265
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:05,777
...if I could take a minute of your very
valuable time to show you something...

266
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,948
...I've been working on
for the past two or three years.

267
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,764
You know, for kids.

268
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,568
It's perfect for Hudsucker,
not that I'm any great genius.

269
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:25,800
They say inspiration is 99% perspiration
and in my case it's at least twice that...

270
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:28,900
- ...but I've got to tell you, sir--
- Wait a minute!

271
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:14,683
Sit down, son.

272
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:18,581
Go ahead.

273
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,587
Try it on.

274
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:36,474
Put your feet up.

275
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,404
Go ahead.

276
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:46,052
Let's get to know one another, shall we?

277
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,183
Let's chat...

278
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:53,585
...man-to-man.

279
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,234
You're from the basement, aren't you?

280
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,464
And weren't blessed with much...

281
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:09,871
...education?

282
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:12,576
Well, I am a college graduate.

283
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,641
But you did not excel in your studies.

284
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,650
Well, I made the dean's list...

285
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,245
...at the Muncie College
of Business Administration.

286
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:25,421
And your friends called you "jerk,"
didn't they?

287
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:28,017
"Dope?"

288
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:29,027
"Dipstick?"

289
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:30,587
"Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

290
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:31,927
Not even behind your back?

291
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,594
They voted me "Most Likely to Succeed."

292
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,863
You're fired.

293
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:41,472
Get your feet off my desk,
get out of my office.

294
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,704
Leave your apron in the locker room.

295
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,268
Oh, my God!

296
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,783
The Bumstead contracts. I've been
working on that deal for four years!

297
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,044
Get out of here! I'll take care of it!

298
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:56,119
You could have destroyed
the most sensitive document of my career.

299
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:58,716
Mr. Bumstead is threatening to leave.

300
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,158
I'm on my way down.

301
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:03,720
We need the first page of the contract
retyped with copies going to Legal.

302
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:05,356
Yes, Mr. Mussburger.

303
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,795
Out! Out of the office!

304
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:14,802
Down three points?

305
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:17,310
That's encouraging. How about New York?

306
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,311
Not that way, through the door!

307
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:23,712
It'll take three hours to retype
the Bumstead contracts.

308
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:24,911
Where are you going?

309
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:26,681
Get out! Stop that!

310
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:28,580
Mr. Bumstead's threatening to leave.

311
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:31,182
Not the whole contract, just the first page.

312
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:33,552
I'll be there. Give him another magazine.

313
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:36,290
- He says he'll leave.
- I said I'll be there!

314
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:40,994
Up on your feet! We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

315
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:43,234
- My leg is on fire!
- No assumptions!

316
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:47,002
It's early yet. Just let me know
where we stand at the closing bell.

317
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,681
Oh, my God, the Bumstead contracts!

318
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,116
No magazines! No coffee!

319
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:10,856
Mussburger! I want to see Mussburger!
Or did he jump out a window too?

320
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:15,562
Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger, I got you!
I got you by your pants.

321
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:19,405
Pants?

322
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:27,915
Mr. Mussburger, I'm gonna give
your pants a nice double stitch.

323
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:32,114
It'll make them real strong
and you're going to look real sharp.

324
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:35,513
No. Single stitch is fine.

325
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:38,056
But the double stitch lasts forever.

326
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,854
Why on earth would I want
a double stitch?

327
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:44,598
To pad your account.

328
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,558
Single stitch is fine.

329
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:53,999
Damn!

330
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:03,948
What the heck! Mr. Mussburger
is such a nice man...

331
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,913
...I'm going to give him
a double stitch anyway.

332
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:11,356
That's some strong stitch, you bet!

333
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,893
"The Einstein of Enterprise."

334
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:02,425
"The Edison of Industry."

335
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:05,866
"The Billion-Dollar Cranium!"

336
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,300
"Idea Man!"

337
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,478
And not one of you has given me
a story on him!

338
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:15,277
Bunch of lamebrains!

339
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,412
Facts, figures, charts.
They never sold a newspaper!

340
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,554
I read this morning's Argus
and let me tell you something:

341
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,214
I'd wrap a fish in it!

342
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,917
I'd use it as kindling!

343
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:28,395
I'd train my poodle on it if he wasn't
a French poodle and partial to Paris Soir.

344
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:31,430
But I wouldn't pay a nickel
to read the thing!

345
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:33,558
Come on, Chief, give us a break.

346
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,262
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

347
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,165
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

348
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:42,242
Wait for a coconut to drop.
File a story on it.

349
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:45,876
It'd be more of a grabber than your piece
on the county grain surplus!

350
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,438
The human angle!
That's what sells papers!

351
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:52,275
We need a front page with a heart
and the Idea Man can put it there!

352
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:53,820
If we had more access--

353
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:56,379
If a frog had wings
it wouldn't bump it's ass hopping.

354
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:58,516
I don't want excuses, I want results!

355
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:01,589
What makes the Idea Man tick?
Where's he from?

356
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:05,291
I want to know everything about him!
Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?

357
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:07,425
Everybody has parents.

358
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:09,263
All right, how many?

359
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:12,635
How about it, Parkinson?
You've been awfully quiet.

360
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,042
Still waters run deep.

361
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,635
Only thing deep with Parkinson
are the holes in his ears.

362
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:20,340
Yes! Idea Man!

363
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:24,213
What are his hopes and dreams,
his desires and aspirations?

364
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,215
Does he think all the time
or a certain portion of the day?

365
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:30,849
How tall is he? Where does he sleep?
What does he have for breakfast?

366
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:33,155
Does he put jam on his toast
or doesn't he?

367
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:35,287
If not, why not and since when?

368
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:37,286
Well?

369
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,157
You're useless.

370
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:42,164
Yes. Idea Man.

371
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:43,826
"Creator."

372
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:44,963
"Innovator."

373
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,571
"Cerebrator."

374
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:48,300
Fake!

375
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:50,968
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

376
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:52,569
- Phony?
- As a $3 bill.

377
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,308
- Says who?
- Says me, Amy Archer!

378
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:56,714
Why is he an Idea Man?
Because Hudsucker says so?

379
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:59,412
What are his ideas?
Why can't anyone interview him?

380
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,580
Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer.

381
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,414
Again? You're on.

382
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:06,426
Look at the mug on this guy.

383
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:09,657
The jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead,
the idiotic grin.

384
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:11,631
He has a face only a mother could love...

385
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:14,023
...on payday.

386
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,238
The only story here is
how this guy made a monkey out of you.

387
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:19,933
Like it or not, I'm still editor of this rag.

388
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:23,202
I thought you were writing,
"J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?"

389
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,509
- I filed it yesterday. Nice tie, Earl.
- Well, do a follow-up.

390
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:28,673
"Hoover: Crimebuster or Pantywaist?"

391
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,981
The rest of you mugs get some brains
and get me that Idea Man story!

392
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:34,849
He's the bunk.

393
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:42,827
I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

394
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,391
Say, buddy, where'd you get the new duds?

395
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:50,403
Say, buddy, how did Old Bucketbutt
like his blue letter?

396
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:54,135
Did he bust a gut? Did he die?
Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger.

397
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,641
Lobby, we haven't got all day.

398
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,473
Right away, Mr. Mussburger.

399
00:31:57,612 --> 00:31:59,671
How're you this fine morning, sir?

400
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:02,814
It's been a pleasure serving you today, sir.

401
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:05,546
It's been a pleasure serving you too, buddy.

402
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,417
Shouldn't we be a little concerned
with the downward spiral of our stock...

403
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,855
...these past few days?

404
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:13,587
You're the expert,
but at the Muncie College of Business--

405
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,390
Relax, it's only natural...

406
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:19,090
...in a period of transition for
the more timid element to run for cover.

407
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:22,864
Like I said, you're the expert
but do you remember the plan I outlined...

408
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:26,100
...the day I set fire to your....
The day I was promoted?

409
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:30,671
I do remember and I was impressed.
But that's all forgotten now.

410
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,041
Thank you, Sid.

411
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:38,444
The reason I mention it is it requires
such a small capital investment....

412
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,784
- There's a huge potential profit...
- Damn it, where's my car?

413
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:44,882
...given the demographics boom
of the burgeoning middle-class.

414
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:49,020
So if you agree, I'd like to bounce the idea
off a few people at lunch.

415
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,086
Sure.

416
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:54,199
Tell whoever you want.
I'd like to hear about it at some point too.

417
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:04,875
I got gas, Benny.

418
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:07,845
Tell me about it.

419
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:10,546
No kidding, Benny. I got gas.

420
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:12,853
You get the special?

421
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:14,347
Far from it.

422
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,621
Enter the dame.

423
00:33:20,395 --> 00:33:22,386
There's one in every story.

424
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:25,591
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.

425
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,800
Twenty bucks says not here,
she don't find one.

426
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:31,065
She's looking for her mark.

427
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,333
She finds him.

428
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,069
She sits down and orders...

429
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,742
...a light lunch.

430
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,474
How will she pay for this lunch?

431
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:42,712
She looks through her purse.

432
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:44,041
No money.

433
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,214
The mark notices.

434
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,350
He's not noticing, Benny.

435
00:33:49,424 --> 00:33:50,857
Maybe he's wise.

436
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:52,749
He don't look wise.

437
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,157
Plan two.

438
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,294
Here come the waterworks.

439
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,692
- Yellowstone.
- Old Faithful.

440
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:02,633
Hello, Niagara.

441
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:04,231
He notices.

442
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:05,704
She's distressed.

443
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,373
He's concerned.

444
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,035
She explains her predicament.

445
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:11,400
And....

446
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,105
Enter the light lunch.

447
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,376
She's got other problems, of course.

448
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:19,352
There's illness in the family.

449
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:22,688
- Her mother needs an operation.
- Urgently.

450
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:24,518
- Adenoids.
- No, Benny.

451
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,293
Lumbago.

452
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:30,394
That gag's got whiskers on it.

453
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:33,158
He ain't biting, Benny.

454
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:36,067
- She's losing him, Lou.
- Maybe he's wise.

455
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:38,399
He don't look wise.

456
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,737
- How does she pull this out?
- He's getting away.

457
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:43,367
She better think fast.

458
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,042
She isn't.

459
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,812
She is!

460
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:49,280
She's good, Benny.

461
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,407
She's damn good, Lou.

462
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:54,880
Can I get you boys anything else?

463
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:58,351
Bromo.

464
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,320
Bromo.

465
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:06,062
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.
It was just that horrible elevator boy!

466
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:09,228
I can't say how much I appreciate
your listening to my story.

467
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:13,740
I'm lucky to find someone in this bustling
city with a stout heart and a ready ear.

468
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:16,606
There I was, travelling
through this great country.

469
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:19,043
Some I met were kind to me,
others exceedingly cruel.

470
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:21,513
Traveling by motor bus, rail,
even by thumb....

471
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:22,981
The couch, please.

472
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:26,518
Hoarding every dollar, counting
every nickel, pinching every penny.

473
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:29,483
It's been a long road leading
to the coffee shop downstairs.

474
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:32,924
Not that I'd trade a day, an hour,
a moment of it for anything.

475
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,853
I don't know what came over me.

476
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,227
I guess it was the shock of eating
after so long...

477
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,664
...without the enzymes kicking in
after so long....

478
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:47,433
Then you couldn't possibly know
what it is to be tired and hungry.

479
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:48,666
Hungry, anyway.

480
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:51,871
I don't want to bore you with details
of my life. It's not happy.

481
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:54,380
Suffice to say I'm jobless,
but not for want of trying.

482
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:58,077
I'm friendless, with no one to take care
of me and had you not come along...

483
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,848
- ...exactly when you did....
- I, myself--

484
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,956
I arrived in town not ten days ago...

485
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:06,221
...full of dreams, anxious to make my way
in the world...

486
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:09,092
...a little naive perhaps,
but armed with determination...

487
00:36:09,163 --> 00:36:11,791
...a solid work ethic,
and an indomitable belief in the future...

488
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,766
- I, myself--
- ...only to have that belief...

489
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:17,167
...that unsullied optimism, dashed against
the marble of the workplace.

490
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:20,297
Such is life. Seek and ye shall find.
Work and ye shall prosper.

491
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:22,035
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

492
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:24,475
Seek and ye shall find,
work and ye shall prosper.

493
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:27,309
These were the watchwords,
the ethos of my education...

494
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:28,871
...the values instilled in me...

495
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,283
...while I was growing up in a town
you've probably never heard of.

496
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,014
- Mind if I join you?
- Be my guest.

497
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:36,147
A town you've probably never heard of...

498
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,091
...a dusty crossroads of which
you've probably never heard.

499
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:43,257
Excuse me. Executive washroom.

500
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:47,694
Are you all right?

501
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,672
Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king?

502
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:57,036
Is the a la king repeating on you?

503
00:36:57,545 --> 00:37:00,139
No, I'm fine. You were saying?

504
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:05,984
Values, watchwords, tender years.

505
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:09,115
A little town you've probably
never heard of:

506
00:37:09,924 --> 00:37:11,255
Muncie, Indiana.

507
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:13,523
You're from Muncie?

508
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:15,684
Why, yes.

509
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:17,859
Do you know it?

510
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:39,716
"Fight on
Fight on, dear old Muncie

511
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:44,390
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

512
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:48,461
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

513
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:52,625
"Once the Munce is done with...

514
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,891
"...you.

515
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:01,238
"Go...

516
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:02,874
"Go...

517
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:04,641
"...Eagles!

518
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:05,804
"...Eagles!"

519
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,483
A Muncie girl!
What do you know about that?

520
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:16,985
I'm going to cancel the rest
of my appointments for today...

521
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:19,024
...and get you a job right here at Hud.

522
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:20,651
Oh, no! Really--

523
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,420
Don't bother to thank me. It's easy.
I know where a vacancy just came up.

524
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:25,623
Mailroom.

525
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,064
Good afternoon, this is Norville Barnes.

526
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:32,594
Barnes! Where the hell have you been?
Where's my voucher?

527
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:35,165
I'm not sure.

528
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:38,176
I need that voucher!
I told you a week ago it was important!

529
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,209
I'm president of the company now.

530
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:44,774
I don't care if you're president
of the company!

531
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,012
I need the voucher now!

532
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,449
Why don't you work in here with me?

533
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,058
Are you familiar with
the mimeograph machine?

534
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:57,587
Well, of course. I went
to the Muncie Secretarial Polytechnic.

535
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,833
A Muncie girl! Can you beat that?

536
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:03,530
I just don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Barnes.

537
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:04,662
Please, Norville.

538
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:07,330
Go, Eagles!

539
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:09,107
Go, Eagles!

540
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:14,180
"Once the Munce...."

541
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:15,948
Holy moly!

542
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,280
Is this guy from Chumpsville?
I even pulled the old mother routine.

543
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:20,047
Adenoids?

544
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:21,053
Lumbago.

545
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:23,247
That gag's got whiskers on it.

546
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:25,758
I'm telling you, the Hudsucker Board's
up to something.

547
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:28,795
What's a six-letter word
for an affliction of the hypothalamus?

548
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:31,991
It's a cinch. Goiter.
It's a cinch this guy isn't in on it.

549
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,090
She's right here.

550
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,397
How much time to make the late final?

551
00:39:36,237 --> 00:39:38,671
Hi, Chief, just the person
I wanted to apologize to.

552
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,001
About seven minutes.

553
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:42,335
I was all wet about your Idea Man.

554
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:47,437
Well, thanks for being so generous.
It is human and you are divine.

555
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,779
No, he's no faker.

556
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:53,684
He's a 100% real McCoy,
beware of imitations, genuine article.

557
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:57,354
The guy's a real moron,
as in a five-letter word for imbecile.

558
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,426
As pure a specimen as I've ever run across.

559
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:03,128
If I'm not an expert...

560
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,724
...then my name isn't Amy Archer
and I never won the Pulitzer.

561
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
In 1957.

562
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:12,162
My series on the reunited triplets.

563
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:15,373
Come down here, hammerhead,
and I'll show it to you!

564
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:18,435
What's a three-letter word
for a flightless bird?

565
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,843
Not now, I'm busy.

566
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:24,050
I said, "hammerhead" as in a ten-letter
word for a smug, bullying newspaper man.

567
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,015
Gnu. That's G-N-U.

568
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:29,647
Couldn't find the Empire State Building
with a compass, map and a guide.

569
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:30,485
Or emu?

570
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:34,289
That's just potatoes. Here's the gravy.
The chump really liked me.

571
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:37,295
- A Muncie girl!
- Better off falling for a rattlesnake.

572
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:40,059
This guy's just a patsy
and I'm gonna find out what for.

573
00:40:40,134 --> 00:40:44,571
There's a real story here, some kind
of plot, set-up.... Did I tell you?

574
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:46,572
- He didn't offer you money?
- A sawbuck!

575
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,665
Ten smackers! Let's grab a highball!

576
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:50,175
On Norville Barnes.

577
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,204
Copy!

578
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:24,134
Miss Smith, would you come in
and take a letter?

579
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,141
Of all the cockamamie....

580
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:32,281
Did you see the front page
of today's Manhattan Argus?

581
00:41:32,353 --> 00:41:36,517
I didn't bother to read the article.
I didn't think the picture did you justice.

582
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,681
The picture's fine.

583
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:41,284
It's what that knuckle-headed dame
wrote underneath.

584
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,892
Take this down.

585
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:45,564
Dear Miss Archer:

586
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:49,960
I call you "Miss" because you seem to have
missed the boat completely.

587
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,028
How would you know if I'm an imbecile...

588
00:41:52,106 --> 00:41:55,075
...when you didn't have the guts
to interview me man-to-man!

589
00:41:55,142 --> 00:41:56,734
Change "man-to-man" to "face-to-face."

590
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,246
No, change "face-to-face" to "eye-to-eye"
and "guts" to "common decency."

591
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:02,475
These wild speculations
about my intelligence...

592
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,882
...these preposterous inventions
would be better suited...

593
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:07,819
...for the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine.

594
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:10,580
If the editors of the Manhattan Argus
see fit...

595
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:15,027
...to publish the work of a disordered mind,
perhaps they will see fit to publish this.

596
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,255
But I doubt it.

597
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,323
I most seriously doubt it. I doubt also
you could find a home at Amazing Tales...

598
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:23,893
...a periodical which I have enjoyed
for many years. Sincerely...

599
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:25,432
...et cetera.

600
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,475
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

601
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,342
You know me, Amy, better than this dame.
Do you think I'm an imbecile?

602
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,053
Well, I'm sure I....

603
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:45,756
Tell the truth. I trust you.
I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

604
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:49,492
Oh, sure, you're biased.

605
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,420
You're a fellow Muncian.

606
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,060
But let me ask you a question:

607
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,666
Would an imbecile come up with this?

608
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:04,533
I designed it myself.

609
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,910
This sweet baby will put Hudsucker
right back on top.

610
00:43:11,652 --> 00:43:12,914
You know, for kids.

611
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,553
Why don't I just type this up?

612
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:21,627
That won't be necessary.
I shouldn't send it.

613
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:23,786
She's just doing her job, I guess.

614
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:26,491
I don't know, maybe she does deserve it.

615
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:30,127
Maybe she should have come in here
and faced you man-to-man.

616
00:43:30,204 --> 00:43:34,072
- She probably had a deadline.
- She still could've gotten your side...

617
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:35,703
...for the record.

618
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:38,472
It's done now. What's the use
of grousing about it?

619
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:41,647
Forget the letter,
I just had to blow off steam.

620
00:43:42,116 --> 00:43:44,209
She's probably just a little confused.

621
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:46,517
"Confused?"

622
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:49,954
Probably a fast-talking career gal,
thinks she's one of the boys.

623
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:51,924
Probably is, if you know what I mean.

624
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:54,586
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.

625
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:57,562
Probably suffers from one
of these complexes they have nowadays.

626
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:01,431
It's obvious. She's probably
very unattractive and bitter about it.

627
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:02,762
Is that it?

628
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:07,471
She probably dresses in men's clothing,
drinks with the guys at the local bar...

629
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:11,602
...hobnobs with some smooth-talking heel
reporter named Biff or Smoocher or--

630
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:12,441
Smitty.

631
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:15,038
Exactly. I bet she's ugly, real ugly.

632
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:17,549
Otherwise, why isn't her picture
next to her byline?

633
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:21,179
Maybe she puts her work
ahead of her personal appearance.

634
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:23,255
I bet that's what she tells herself.

635
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:26,554
But you and I know
she's a dried-up, bitter old maid.

636
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:29,919
How about we grab a little dinner
and a show after work?

637
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,897
I was thinking maybe The King and I?

638
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,364
How about Oklahoma?

639
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:37,126
You don't know a thing about that woman!

640
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:41,140
You don't know who she really is!
Only a numbskull thinks he knows things...

641
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:43,438
...about things he knows nothing about.

642
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:47,041
Say, what gives?

643
00:46:54,274 --> 00:46:57,835
The inventory of the Jacksonville facility
should be reduced...

644
00:46:58,011 --> 00:47:01,105
...by 15%. Memo from the desk
of Sidney J. Mussburger--

645
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,613
What are you doing, Miss Archer?

646
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:15,993
Who are you?
How did you know who I am?

647
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:21,932
I suspect Old Moses knows
just about everything...

648
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:24,903
...leastways if it concerns Hudsucker.

649
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,464
Who are you? What do you do here?

650
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:29,708
I keep the old circle turning.

651
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:32,338
This old clock needs plenty of care.

652
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:34,909
Time is money, Miss Archer.

653
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:38,380
Money drives that old global economy...

654
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:40,852
...and keeps Big Daddy Earth
spinning around.

655
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:43,650
See, without that capital formation--

656
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:47,823
You won't tell anyone about me, will you?

657
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:50,429
I don't tell no one nothing...

658
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:52,597
...unless they ask.

659
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,991
That just ain't Old Moses' way.

660
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,530
If you know everything about Hudsucker...

661
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:01,165
...tell me why the board decided
to make Norville Barnes president?

662
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:04,203
That even surprised Old Moses at first.

663
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,972
I didn't think the board was that smart.

664
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:07,979
"That smart?"

665
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:11,017
But then I figured it out.
They did it because...

666
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:14,918
...they figured young Norville for
an imbecile, like some other people I know.

667
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:18,585
Why on earth would the board
want a nitwit to be president?

668
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:22,886
Because they're little piglets.
They're trying to inspire panic...

669
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,966
...make that stock cheap so they can
snatch it all up for themselves.

670
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,658
But Norville's got some tricks
up his sleeve. He does.

671
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:32,772
"You know, for kids?"

672
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:37,439
Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

673
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:43,181
But I guess you don't really know him
any better than that board does, do you?

674
00:48:43,884 --> 00:48:44,816
Maybe I--

675
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:49,447
And only some kind of knuckle-head thinks
she knows things about things....

676
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,282
When she don't....

677
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,788
How'd that go?

678
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:56,825
Well, it's hardly the same.

679
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,360
You don't even know your own self.

680
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:03,294
You ain't exactly the genuine article,
are you, Miss Archer?

681
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:08,631
In connection with my job, sometimes
I have to go undercover, as it were.

682
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,232
I don't mean that.

683
00:49:10,577 --> 00:49:14,411
Why are you pretending to be
such a hard old sourpuss?

684
00:49:15,048 --> 00:49:17,175
Ain't going to never make you happy!

685
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:20,779
I'm happy enough.

686
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,625
I got gears to see to.

687
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,024
I'm plenty happy!

688
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:46,974
I can't print that!

689
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:50,847
Why not? It's true. The board's using him
to depress the stock and buy it cheap.

690
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:53,852
It's pure speculation!
They'd have my butt in a satchel!

691
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:56,345
They'll buy that stock--

692
00:49:56,423 --> 00:50:00,018
You don't know anything. They haven't
bought it. What are they waiting for?

693
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:00,787
I don't know.

694
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:03,227
Amy's hunches are usually pretty good.

695
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:06,060
You don't accuse somebody
of stock manipulation on a hunch!

696
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,034
Our readers aren't interested
in sensationalism, gossip...

697
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:10,467
...unsupported speculation!

698
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:13,529
Facts! Figures! Those are the tools
of the newspaper trade.

699
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,337
It's as if you're trying to take the heat
off him. Like you've gone soft on him.

700
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,572
Come on, Chief. That's a low blow.

701
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:22,410
Archer's not going to go gooey
for a corn-fed idiot.

702
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:25,918
I was out of line. But you're out of line
with this stock-swindle story.

703
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:28,580
Give me more of that
"moron from Sheboygan" stuff.

704
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:29,815
- Muncie.
- Whatever.

705
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,551
That's what sells newspapers!

706
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,321
I've got a harder story:
"The Sap From The City Desk!"

707
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:36,919
- Watch it!
- It's about a dim-witted editor who--

708
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:38,328
Easy, tough guy.

709
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:43,795
Does this suit look mannish to you?

710
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:46,031
Yeah, sure. Let's grab a highball.

711
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,065
Back off!

712
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:49,668
Smoocher!

713
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:53,707
What gives?

714
00:51:09,563 --> 00:51:12,555
A man of great managerial potency.

715
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,498
My husband is also a president.

716
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:19,002
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.
Do you know him?

717
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:21,399
Your companion is an ode!

718
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:24,203
A lyric! Are you betrothed?

719
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:26,836
Amy works in my office. She runs--

720
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:29,074
Oh, the folly of youth!

721
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:31,240
Those green remembered hills!

722
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:34,583
That bourn from which no traveler returns.

723
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:37,420
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney.

724
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:40,685
Though engaged at the time
to quelqu'un d'autre...

725
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:44,427
...my water-cooler romance
became a mad passion.

726
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:47,766
Un amour fou. Une folie a deux.

727
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:52,732
I'm brushing up on my French
with the most charming man...

728
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:56,469
- ...Pierre of 5th Avenue. Do you know him?
- Do you know him?

729
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:01,207
Sidney and I are planning a trip
to Paris and points continental.

730
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:05,711
Aren't we, dear?

731
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,386
Sure. I'd like to borrow Norville
for a while, if you don't mind.

732
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,619
Well, frankly, I....

733
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,724
You have a very charming wife, Mr.... Sid.

734
00:52:16,897 --> 00:52:18,194
So they tell me.

735
00:52:18,865 --> 00:52:22,062
Let me shepherd you
through some of the introductions here.

736
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:24,226
Try not to talk too much.

737
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:26,899
Some of our biggest stockholders are....

738
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:29,268
Scratch that. Say whatever you like.

739
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:32,140
Shake hands with
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

740
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:34,106
Glad to know you, Barnes.

741
00:52:34,481 --> 00:52:36,278
This is Zebulon Cardozo...

742
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:39,477
...one of Hudsucker's largest
and most loyal stockholders.

743
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:41,986
What's this I hear
about you being an imbecile?

744
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:43,716
What's ailing you, boy?

745
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:47,987
Last week, my stock was worth twice
what it is now. I think I'll sell...

746
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:52,122
...the whole kit and caboodle, boy,
unless I see a vast improvement.

747
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:55,093
What you've got here, son, is a range war!

748
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:59,136
You gonna have to circle our wagons
or I'm gonna get out of your wagon train.

749
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:02,902
No need for concern, sir.
It's only natural...

750
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:06,206
...in a period of transition for the more
timid elements to run for cover.

751
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:09,305
Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy!

752
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,076
You mind now and quit acting
like such an old grizzly.

753
00:53:13,286 --> 00:53:15,151
Step lively here, Norville.

754
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:18,886
I'm sorry, I thought maybe if I showed him
the long view--

755
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:21,957
And this is Thorstensen Finlandson...

756
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:24,959
...who heads a radical, splinter group
of disgruntled investors.

757
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:26,464
Pleased to meet you.

758
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:30,060
It might interest you to know I studied
a little Finnish in high school.

759
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:31,797
I hope I'm not too rusty.

760
00:53:39,546 --> 00:53:43,073
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
members of the Hudsucker Board...

761
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:47,381
...I give you the Rajah of Romance,
the Ministereo of Moonlight...

762
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:50,120
...the incredible, the unforgettable...

763
00:53:50,223 --> 00:53:53,158
...Mr. Vic Tenetta!

764
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:01,628
"Rajah." I like that.

765
00:54:44,711 --> 00:54:46,110
What happened?

766
00:54:47,547 --> 00:54:52,041
Nothing. Just the more timid investors
are no longer running for cover.

767
00:54:52,218 --> 00:54:53,344
Let me look.

768
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:55,318
Sid found me the ice pack.

769
00:54:55,388 --> 00:54:58,084
Let me hold it or you'll have a real shiner.

770
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:02,256
I guess people are pretty hot
over this imbecile story.

771
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:04,227
I'm sorry.

772
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:08,890
It's not your fault. You've the one person
standing by me through all this.

773
00:55:08,968 --> 00:55:11,766
Norville, there's something
I have to tell you.

774
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:13,797
You see...

775
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:16,442
...Im not really a secretary.

776
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,570
I know that, Amy.

777
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:19,634
You do?

778
00:55:19,846 --> 00:55:22,974
I understand you're not very skilled yet
in the secretarial arts...

779
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:26,177
...but I'll tell you a secret:
I'm not that skilled as president.

780
00:55:26,252 --> 00:55:29,688
- I know I put up a big front, but--
- I believe in you, Norville.

781
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:32,450
At least...

782
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:35,426
...I believe in your intentions.

783
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:39,120
I don't blame them, really.
I suppose I have made a mess of things.

784
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:42,030
Those folks have to protect
their investment.

785
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:43,694
Most of them are very nice people.

786
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,206
Listen, you can't trust people here
like you did in Muncie.

787
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:49,332
Certain people are--

788
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:53,368
Did you ever go to the top of Larson's
feed tower and look out over the town?

789
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:55,712
On Farm Route 17?

790
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:58,550
Oh, yes, in Muncie.

791
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:02,448
No, Vidalia. Farm Route 17.

792
00:56:04,157 --> 00:56:07,558
Seventeen. Yes, I....
Well, no, no. I never really--

793
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:13,128
The guys from the Varsity Squad
would bring their dates up there...

794
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,531
...to hold hands.

795
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:18,599
Of course, I never made Varsity.

796
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:23,104
There's a place I go now.

797
00:56:23,977 --> 00:56:27,003
Cutest little place near my apartment
in Greenwich Village.

798
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,048
It's called "Ann's 440."

799
00:56:29,382 --> 00:56:30,815
It's a beatnik bar.

800
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:32,317
- You don't say?
- Yes.

801
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:33,374
A beatnik bar.

802
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:36,980
You can get carrot juice or Italian coffee
and the people there...

803
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,319
Well, none of them quite fit in.

804
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:41,154
You'd love it.

805
00:56:41,661 --> 00:56:43,094
Come there with me.

806
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:46,463
There's a marathon poetry-reading
on New Year's Eve. I go every year.

807
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:48,797
- It's marvelous!
- Every year?

808
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:55,407
Well, this year, if it's good,
I plan to make it a tradition.

809
00:56:57,677 --> 00:56:59,611
My, it certainly is beautiful.

810
00:57:00,413 --> 00:57:01,937
The people...

811
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:03,939
...look like ants.

812
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:08,281
The Hindus, and the beatniks also,
say that...

813
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:11,619
...in our next lives some of us
will come back as ants.

814
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:16,255
Some will be butterflies, others will be
elephants or creatures of the sea.

815
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:17,896
What a beautiful thought.

816
00:57:18,064 --> 00:57:20,760
What do you think you were
in a previous life?

817
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:23,460
Oh, I don't know.

818
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,760
Maybe I was just...

819
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:30,336
...a fast-talking career gal
who thought she was one of the boys.

820
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:31,603
Oh, no, Amy.

821
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:34,745
Pardon me for saying so,
but I find that very far-fetched.

822
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:38,874
- There really is something I must tell you.
- That person would come back as a hog.

823
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:41,682
I find it more likely that you were...

824
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:44,080
...a gazelle...

825
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:48,687
...with long, graceful legs,
gamboling through the underbrush.

826
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,154
Perhaps we met once.

827
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:54,594
A chance encounter in a forest glade.

828
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,094
I must have been an antelope or an ibex.

829
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:03,867
The times we must've had
foraging together for sustenance...

830
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:07,405
...snorfling water
from a mountain stream...

831
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:11,576
...picking the grubs and burrs
from one another's coats.

832
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,882
Or perhaps we simply touched horns
briefly and went our separate ways.

833
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:22,821
Oh, I wish it were that simple, Norville.

834
00:58:24,264 --> 00:58:28,462
I wish I was still a gazelle
and you were an antelope...

835
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:30,666
...or an ibex.

836
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:36,902
Can I at least call you...

837
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,268
...deer?

838
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:42,540
You're funny.

839
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:45,880
Seriously, Amy, it's what
your beatnik friends call "karma."

840
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:46,949
Karma.

841
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,989
The great circle of life, death and rebirth.

842
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:53,853
I think I heard of that.
What goes around comes around.

843
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,487
That's it. A great wheel
that gives us all what we deserve.

844
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:02,096
I've go to show Sid and all the guys
I deserve their confidence.

845
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:04,636
Tomorrow's my big presentation
to the board.

846
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,368
Kiss me, Amy!

847
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:10,299
Kiss me once for luck.

848
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:12,973
Sure, Norville.

849
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,785
You know, for kids!

850
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:59,957
It has economy, simplicity, low
production cost, potential for mass appeal.

851
01:00:00,026 --> 01:00:02,324
All that spells out great profitability.

852
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:05,125
I had the boys at R&D
make this prototype...

853
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:07,166
...so our discussion
could have some focus...

854
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:11,135
...and to give you gentleman a firsthand
look at how exciting this gizmo is.

855
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:14,605
It's fun, healthy, good exercise,
and the kids'll love it.

856
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:17,801
We put a little sand inside
to make the experience more pleasant.

857
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:21,210
The great part is we don't have
to charge an arm and a leg.

858
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,717
- What if you tire before it's done?
- Does it have rules?

859
01:00:26,786 --> 01:00:28,947
- Can more than one play?
- Why is it a game?

860
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:30,614
- Is it a game?
- Will it break?

861
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,885
- It better break eventually.
- Is there an object?

862
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:35,621
- What if you tire before it's done?
- Does it have batteries?

863
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:38,562
- Could we charge extra for them?
- Is it safe for toddlers?

864
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:41,031
- How do you know you're finished?
- How does it stop?

865
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,728
- Is that a boy's model?
- Can a parent assemble it?

866
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:48,068
- What if you tire before it's done?
- Is there a larger model for the obese?

867
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:50,336
What the hell is it?

868
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,741
Well, it's....

869
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:56,640
Brilliant!

870
01:00:58,551 --> 01:00:59,643
Genius.

871
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,247
It's exactly what Hudsucker Industry needs
at this juncture.

872
01:01:05,158 --> 01:01:09,618
Even a blind man can tell you
there'll be an enormous demand for this...

873
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:12,155
...this....

874
01:01:13,066 --> 01:01:14,124
Congratulations.

875
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,725
You've outdone yourself.
You've reinvented the wheel.

876
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:19,772
I'll recommend to the board
that we proceed immediately...

877
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:22,839
...and that the...

878
01:01:24,577 --> 01:01:27,307
...dingus be mass-produced
with all deliberate speed.

879
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,477
Although, you realize...

880
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:31,211
...of course...

881
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,785
...as president...

882
01:01:36,122 --> 01:01:38,113
...the ultimate decision is yours.

883
01:01:39,325 --> 01:01:40,587
I'm for it.

884
01:02:29,342 --> 01:02:30,639
The Flying Doughnut!

885
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,076
- The Dancing Dingus!
- The Belly-Go-Round.

886
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:34,408
The Swingerina!

887
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,947
The Wacky Circumference!

888
01:02:36,015 --> 01:02:37,846
Uncle Midriff!

889
01:03:08,648 --> 01:03:10,445
- We need something short!
- Sharp!

890
01:03:10,516 --> 01:03:11,244
Snappy!

891
01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:13,785
- With a little jazz!
- The Shazzammeter!

892
01:03:13,853 --> 01:03:16,083
- The Hipster!
- The Daddy-O!

893
01:03:57,363 --> 01:03:59,058
- The Hoopsucker.
- The Hudswinger.

894
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:01,361
- The Hoopsucker!
- The Hudswinger!

895
01:04:01,434 --> 01:04:03,163
- The Hoopsucker!
- The Hudswinger!

896
01:04:31,264 --> 01:04:33,425
- Fellas!
- You got something?

897
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:36,897
I got something!

898
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:53,192
Rockwell News presents: Tidbits of Time.

899
01:07:53,566 --> 01:07:56,262
World news in pictures, we kid you not!

900
01:07:56,669 --> 01:07:59,900
As Old Man 1958 hobbles
towards his finish...

901
01:08:00,473 --> 01:08:02,907
...Barnes is the name
on every American lip.

902
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:06,602
Norville Barnes, young president
of Hudsucker Industries...

903
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:10,342
...a boy bred in the heartland,
but now the toast of New York.

904
01:08:10,816 --> 01:08:15,344
Barnes is the brainy inventor of America's
craziest craze: The Hula Hoop!

905
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:19,585
Reaping huge profits for his company
and winning the hearts...

906
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:22,417
...and hips of every youngster in America!

907
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:25,363
Did I say youngster?

908
01:08:25,598 --> 01:08:28,590
Here's Mom taking a break
from her household chores...

909
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:31,803
...and even Dad is swinging into the act!

910
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:38,240
Cards, letters, congratulations come
pouring in from Kankakee to Petaluma...

911
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:41,808
...including one very special
long-distance call.

912
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:44,015
He's on! He's on the line!

913
01:08:50,723 --> 01:08:52,987
Hello, Norville. This is the President.

914
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:56,951
I just wanted to congratulate you.
I'm very proud of you.

915
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:59,962
Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you.

916
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:02,892
The American people
are very proud of you.

917
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:12,967
How'd you come up with the idea
for the Hula Hoop?

918
01:09:13,345 --> 01:09:15,279
It was no great idea, really.

919
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:19,147
A thing like this takes a whole company
to put together. I'm grateful.

920
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,352
Did you have any idea
there'd be such a huge response?

921
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:25,515
Frankly, I don't think anybody
expected this much hoopla.

922
01:09:27,426 --> 01:09:30,862
"Hoopla on the Hula Hoop."
Can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?

923
01:09:30,996 --> 01:09:32,429
Sure, I guess.

924
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:35,498
Will you give yourself a nice, fat raise?

925
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:37,963
Come on, you guys.

926
01:09:45,578 --> 01:09:50,345
What scientific principle explains
the motion of this wheel of wonder?

927
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,577
The dingus is quite simple, really.

928
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:57,015
It operates on the same principles that
keep the earth spinning around the sun...

929
01:09:57,089 --> 01:10:01,583
...and that keeps you from flying off
the earth into the cold reaches of space...

930
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:04,219
...where you would die
like a miserable Schwein.

931
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:06,389
Yes, the principle is the same...

932
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:11,063
...except for the piece of grit
they put in to make the experience...

933
01:10:11,837 --> 01:10:12,997
...more pleasant.

934
01:10:13,072 --> 01:10:15,802
Yes, it's hula-hula everywhere!

935
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:18,638
From the parties of the Park Avenue
smart set...

936
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:25,477
...to sweethearts who want
to be married in the swing of things.

937
01:10:29,855 --> 01:10:33,222
Did the board consider you an "Idea Man"
when they promoted you?

938
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:36,853
I guess. I don't think they promoted me
because they thought I was a schmo.

939
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:40,228
What's the next big idea for you
and Hudsucker Industries?

940
01:10:40,299 --> 01:10:43,700
I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby
doesn't just come overnight.

941
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:48,035
Although, I'll tell you one thing:
I certainly didn't expect all this hoopla.

942
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:50,399
You can quote me on that.

943
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,247
Rumpus Magazine has called you
the most eligible bachelor of the year.

944
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,448
And society pages have been linking you
with fashion model Za-Za.

945
01:11:04,523 --> 01:11:08,550
There's no truth to the rumors.
We're just dear friends. Isn't that right?

946
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:20,000
How do you respond to the charges that
you're out of ideas? Have you run dry?

947
01:11:20,139 --> 01:11:24,098
Not at all. Just this week I came up
with several new sweet ideas.

948
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:28,913
A larger model Hula Hoop for the portly,
a battery option for the lazy or spastic.

949
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,414
A model with extra sand
for the hard-of-hearing.

950
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:33,144
I'm earning my keep.

951
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:35,880
Speaking of that,
do you expect to get a raise?

952
01:11:36,188 --> 01:11:40,249
By anyone's account I single-handedly
have saved Hudsucker Industries.

953
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:44,955
Our stock is worth more now than ever.
Yes, I expect to be compensated for that.

954
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,647
Pull yourself together, man.

955
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,186
Nobody told me!

956
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:11,418
You sold all our stock?

957
01:12:11,857 --> 01:12:13,449
We dumped the whole load.

958
01:12:13,525 --> 01:12:15,891
I had 20,000 shares!

959
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:18,323
I'd be a millionaire now!

960
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,489
Sure. We'd all be millionaires.

961
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,293
There's no point in looking back.

962
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:27,972
At the time, Stillson thought that dumping
our position would panic the market...

963
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,031
...further depress the stock.

964
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:33,836
Then we could buy it back and more,
of course, once it got cheap.

965
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:34,879
Cheap?

966
01:12:35,314 --> 01:12:37,214
It's never been more valuable!

967
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:40,413
And I'm ruined.

968
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:42,142
Ruined!

969
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:52,659
I'm getting off this merry-go-round!

970
01:13:02,775 --> 01:13:03,901
Plexiglass.

971
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,273
Had it installed last week.

972
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,887
So, the kid caught a wave.

973
01:13:23,595 --> 01:13:27,087
Right now, he and his dingus are on top.

974
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,428
Well, this too shall pass.

975
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:33,497
Myrtle J. Mussburger
did not raise her boy to go...

976
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:36,769
...knock-kneed at the first sign of adversity.

977
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:39,743
I say, we made this chump,
we can break him!

978
01:13:40,612 --> 01:13:43,410
I say, the higher he climbs,
the harder he drops!

979
01:13:45,284 --> 01:13:46,376
I say, yes...

980
01:13:47,286 --> 01:13:48,981
...the kid has a future...

981
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:51,651
...and in it...

982
01:13:52,624 --> 01:13:54,649
...I see shame, dishonor...

983
01:13:55,294 --> 01:13:57,091
...ignominy, disgrace.

984
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:03,296
The music plays, the wheel turns...

985
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,595
...and our spin ain't over yet.

986
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,321
For Pete's sakes, Norville!

987
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:35,599
Where have you been hiding?

988
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:39,100
Do you know what those nincompoops
in the boardroom are doing?

989
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:40,798
I wouldn't call them nincompoops.

990
01:14:40,873 --> 01:14:43,364
They're going to discharge 8%
of the workforce here!

991
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,411
In New York City alone,
that means 1,800 people out of work!

992
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:48,878
People with wives, children and families!

993
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:51,376
We're pruning away
some of the dead wood.

994
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:53,509
You mean you know about this?

995
01:14:53,585 --> 01:14:55,143
Know about it? Sure.

996
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,383
You think the board would do anything
without my authorization?

997
01:14:58,457 --> 01:14:59,924
It was my idea.

998
01:14:59,992 --> 01:15:01,323
- Your--
- Sure it was.

999
01:15:01,393 --> 01:15:04,328
We're in a period of transition.
Things have slowed down.

1000
01:15:04,396 --> 01:15:07,194
You're being awfully kind to yourself,
Norville Barnes.

1001
01:15:07,266 --> 01:15:10,702
You've slowed down, sitting up here
not doing a lick of work.

1002
01:15:11,236 --> 01:15:16,139
You haven't come up with an idea since
the Hoop and the reason is plain to see!

1003
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,733
You've forgotten what made your ideas
exciting to you.

1004
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,176
It wasn't for the fame and wealth....

1005
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,114
Would you get out of here?
You too, sisters, move it. Out!

1006
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:30,515
I've been watching you, even though
you've been trying to avoid me.

1007
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:31,383
Shut up!

1008
01:15:31,456 --> 01:15:33,754
Don't think I haven't noticed
how you've changed.

1009
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:35,622
I used to think you were a swell guy.

1010
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,753
To be honest,
I thought you were an imbecile.

1011
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:38,959
Shut up!

1012
01:15:39,031 --> 01:15:42,626
Then I figured out you were a swell guy.
A little slow maybe, but a swell guy.

1013
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:46,159
Maybe you're not so slow
but you're not so swell either.

1014
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:48,468
Looks like you're an imbecile, after all.
Shut up!

1015
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:52,610
You haven't talked to me for a week
and now I'm going to say my piece.

1016
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:54,703
Look, I've never been...

1017
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:58,275
...dumped by a fella before,
and that hurts...

1018
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,517
...but what really hurts is watching you
out-run your soul!

1019
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:03,987
Chasing after money and ease
and the respect of a board...

1020
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:06,422
...that wouldn't give you the time of day...

1021
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:07,458
...if you....

1022
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,459
Worked in a watch factory?

1023
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:12,394
Shut up! Exactly.

1024
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:17,192
Norville, don't you remember
how you used to feel about the Hoop?

1025
01:16:17,769 --> 01:16:21,364
You told me you'd bring a smile
to the hips of everyone in America...

1026
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,408
...regardless of race, creed or color.

1027
01:16:23,475 --> 01:16:27,104
Finally, there'd be a thingamajig
that would bring everyone together...

1028
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:29,511
...even if it kept them apart spatially.

1029
01:16:29,948 --> 01:16:31,040
"You know...

1030
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:32,574
"...for kids."

1031
01:16:33,452 --> 01:16:34,441
Your words...

1032
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:36,680
...not mine.

1033
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:39,717
I used to love Norville Barnes.

1034
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:42,157
Yes, love him...

1035
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:46,921
...when he was just a swell kid
with hot ideas who was in over his head.

1036
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,964
Now your head's too big to be in over!

1037
01:16:50,102 --> 01:16:52,002
Consider this my resignation.

1038
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:54,772
Effective immediately!

1039
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,617
Buddy, buddy.

1040
01:18:17,522 --> 01:18:18,546
Buddy.

1041
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:20,822
Oh, buddy.

1042
01:18:30,602 --> 01:18:31,933
Buddy. You busy?

1043
01:18:33,772 --> 01:18:37,230
Looks like you nodded off there, buddy.
Say, you got a minute?

1044
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:42,211
Is this important?

1045
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,579
I think so. It's this little idea
I've been working on.

1046
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:48,346
You see, I don't intend
to be an elevator boy forever.

1047
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,012
Take a look at this sweet baby!

1048
01:18:50,088 --> 01:18:52,522
Get it? Incredibly convenient, isn't it?

1049
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:54,182
You know, for drinks?

1050
01:18:54,392 --> 01:18:58,351
This is how it works. It's got these ridges
on the side that give it its whammy.

1051
01:18:58,463 --> 01:19:02,126
You don't have to drink like this.
You can drink like this.

1052
01:19:02,234 --> 01:19:04,532
I call it the "Buzz-Sucker."
You get it, buddy?

1053
01:19:04,603 --> 01:19:08,471
People are dying for this and
we won't have to charge an arm and a leg.

1054
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,768
Wait a minute.

1055
01:19:25,123 --> 01:19:26,112
This...

1056
01:19:29,227 --> 01:19:30,387
...is worthless!

1057
01:19:30,695 --> 01:19:31,787
But, buddy!

1058
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:35,065
This is the most idiotic thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1059
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:37,465
Nobody wants a hair-brained product
like this.

1060
01:19:37,536 --> 01:19:38,662
You see, Buzz...

1061
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:40,830
...it lacks the creative spark...

1062
01:19:41,173 --> 01:19:44,199
...the unalloyed genius
that made something like, say...

1063
01:19:45,043 --> 01:19:46,738
...the Hula Hoop such a success.

1064
01:19:46,812 --> 01:19:49,280
How dare you barge in here
and take up my valuable time!

1065
01:19:49,347 --> 01:19:50,746
I've got a company to run!

1066
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,985
I can't have every deadbeat
on the payroll pestering me...

1067
01:19:56,054 --> 01:19:57,783
...with their idiotic brainwaves.

1068
01:19:57,856 --> 01:19:59,084
I'm sorry, buddy.

1069
01:19:59,157 --> 01:20:00,385
An example must be made!

1070
01:20:00,859 --> 01:20:02,292
What do you mean?

1071
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:04,588
You're fired!

1072
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:07,423
Is that plain enough for you?

1073
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,170
Oh, buddy!

1074
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,601
And don't call me "buddy"!

1075
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:21,436
Oh, please, sir! This job running
the elevator, it's all I got!

1076
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,939
It's okay if you don't like the Buzz-Sucker!

1077
01:20:24,015 --> 01:20:26,813
Just let me keep my job,
I'm praying to you!

1078
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:29,017
Get out of my office!

1079
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:30,818
Get up! Up!

1080
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,517
We don't crawl here
at Hudsucker Industries!

1081
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:37,491
I'm sorry, sir!

1082
01:20:37,662 --> 01:20:38,822
I'm sorry!

1083
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:54,778
Thank you, Aloysius.

1084
01:20:59,885 --> 01:21:01,045
This is...

1085
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:03,912
...useful.

1086
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,306
I'm sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine
at Riverdale's really murder.

1087
01:21:27,579 --> 01:21:30,480
It's a tough course. A real lollapalooza.

1088
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:33,245
Sit down, son.

1089
01:21:36,621 --> 01:21:40,717
I thought the boardroom would be
a swell place to chat undisturbed.

1090
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,227
Seems we've got some security problems
here at the Hud.

1091
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:47,262
You don't say.

1092
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:51,666
Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother you with it,
but this is embarrassing.

1093
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:55,199
It concerns you directly.

1094
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:58,100
- How's that?
- It's not serious in itself.

1095
01:21:58,777 --> 01:22:01,541
Some elevator boy that you'd fired
came to me...

1096
01:22:02,147 --> 01:22:05,947
...claiming that you'd stolen
the idea for the dingus.

1097
01:22:06,284 --> 01:22:07,979
You'd stolen it from him.

1098
01:22:11,122 --> 01:22:13,556
- Maybe I was a little rough on him--
- Forget it.

1099
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:17,254
You don't have to explain to me.
He's a little person. He's nothing.

1100
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:18,887
Fire whoever you want.

1101
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:22,696
No, the problem is...

1102
01:22:23,335 --> 01:22:24,666
...who you hired.

1103
01:22:25,136 --> 01:22:26,228
That dame.

1104
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,263
A spy, as it turns out.

1105
01:22:29,207 --> 01:22:31,971
She must have gotten
to that elevator schnook...

1106
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,871
...and her paper is going to town.

1107
01:22:35,981 --> 01:22:40,384
Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story,
but the Argus won't play ball.

1108
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:45,416
The problem the board will have is
you hired this woman...

1109
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:47,485
...and you kept her on...

1110
01:22:47,826 --> 01:22:50,351
...while she was making
a chump out of you.

1111
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:52,692
Serious error in judgement.

1112
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:55,789
Business is war, kid.

1113
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:59,426
Take no prisoners, give no second chances.

1114
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:05,742
When the board meets after New Year's...

1115
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:07,377
...your position....

1116
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,878
Looks like you're finished.

1117
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:13,675
Washed up.

1118
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:21,425
Fourteenth hole at Riverdale...

1119
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,351
...some use a mashie...

1120
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:25,085
...some use a niblick.

1121
01:23:26,064 --> 01:23:27,122
Niblick.

1122
01:23:27,699 --> 01:23:29,963
You get more loft, more backspin.

1123
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:35,999
That dame...

1124
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:39,841
...she got your throat pretty well slit.

1125
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,970
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1126
01:23:43,848 --> 01:23:46,316
You don't believe me,
ask Waring Hudsucker.

1127
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,951
Tough luck, kid.

1128
01:23:50,622 --> 01:23:52,317
You had a short climb up.

1129
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:54,982
It's a long way down.

1130
01:24:07,705 --> 01:24:11,266
- You can't print that!
- We are! She hits the streets tonight.

1131
01:24:12,243 --> 01:24:13,972
And she's dynamite!

1132
01:24:14,045 --> 01:24:18,175
But it's the bunk! Norville showed me his
design for the whatsit the day I met him.

1133
01:24:18,249 --> 01:24:21,047
Buzz couldn't have invented it.
Look at him, he's an imbecile.

1134
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,055
Aren't you a broken record?
Gunderson did design it. He's a prodigy.

1135
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,624
- Says who?
- You're not the only one with sources.

1136
01:24:27,692 --> 01:24:30,320
Smith has a senior source
on the Hud Board. Very senior.

1137
01:24:30,562 --> 01:24:32,792
I bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger.

1138
01:24:33,531 --> 01:24:36,193
You lost it. You gone soft,
by the looks of it.

1139
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:37,859
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1140
01:24:38,903 --> 01:24:40,234
- Muncie.
- Whatever!

1141
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:44,207
This story's hot and you're no longer
on top of it. It's the scoop of the century!

1142
01:24:44,275 --> 01:24:46,470
The other papers won't have this
till tomorrow!

1143
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:50,446
Allemeinisher Zeitung, Le Figaro
will be choking on our dust come morning.

1144
01:24:50,515 --> 01:24:53,951
You're fools, both of you!
You're being used, don't you see?

1145
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:57,220
Take a break. You worked hard on this.
You broke it for us.

1146
01:24:57,288 --> 01:24:59,722
But it's passed you by
and Smith's taking up the slack.

1147
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:03,324
You want slack...

1148
01:25:03,962 --> 01:25:05,293
...Ill give you slack!

1149
01:25:05,363 --> 01:25:09,800
You're not putting me out to pasture!
I quit! Consider this my resignation!

1150
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,661
Effective immediately!

1151
01:25:15,406 --> 01:25:16,395
Soft.

1152
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:27,273
So, tell me...

1153
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:30,380
...why do you feel this woman
betrayed you?

1154
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:34,315
What's the difference?

1155
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:37,156
The whole world, it seems, is against you?

1156
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,524
I don't know.

1157
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,393
Und the elevator boy...

1158
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:43,661
...Buzz, he too works against you?

1159
01:25:45,937 --> 01:25:46,961
Classic.

1160
01:25:47,338 --> 01:25:50,603
Patient displayed listlessness, apathy,
gloomy indifference...

1161
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:52,506
...und was blue und mopey.

1162
01:25:53,011 --> 01:25:56,640
When asked what the Rorschach stains
represented, patient replied:

1163
01:25:56,748 --> 01:26:00,809
"Nothing much. I don't know.
Just a blotch. Sure beats me."

1164
01:26:01,586 --> 01:26:04,817
Patient shows no ambition,
no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1165
01:26:05,523 --> 01:26:07,821
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop...

1166
01:26:08,193 --> 01:26:11,162
...that goes from the height
of delusional gaiety...

1167
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:13,026
...to the trough of despair.

1168
01:26:13,565 --> 01:26:16,363
He is now near,
but not yet at his lowest point.

1169
01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:21,205
When he reaches bottom, he may erupt
und pose a danger to himself...

1170
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:22,428
...and others.

1171
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,767
Diagnosis, Dr. Bromfenbrenner?

1172
01:26:25,009 --> 01:26:28,001
Patient is eine manic-depressive paranoid,
type B...

1173
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:29,976
...with acute schizoid tendencies.

1174
01:26:30,348 --> 01:26:32,111
So, patient is...?

1175
01:26:33,785 --> 01:26:34,843
Precisely.

1176
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Nuts!

1177
01:26:37,021 --> 01:26:38,249
Prescription?

1178
01:26:38,423 --> 01:26:40,391
Three things: Commitment...

1179
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:43,290
...electroconvulsive therapy...

1180
01:26:43,394 --> 01:26:45,862
...maintenance in eine secure facility.

1181
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,874
Yeah, he's a tall guy. A real mess.

1182
01:27:05,683 --> 01:27:09,244
Look, you better get down here.
He says he's a friend of yours.

1183
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,321
He didn't say.
But, man, is he from Squaresville.

1184
01:27:20,932 --> 01:27:22,297
I want a martini!

1185
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:25,334
It's New Year's Eve. I deserve a martini.

1186
01:27:25,737 --> 01:27:27,534
It's like I've been telling you--

1187
01:27:27,605 --> 01:27:29,766
I thought you served misfits here!

1188
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:32,399
That's a roger. But we don't sell alcohol.

1189
01:27:32,877 --> 01:27:35,345
What kind of bar doesn't serve martinis?

1190
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:39,107
It's a juice-and-coffee bar, man,
like I've been telling you.

1191
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:41,409
Right. So, I want...

1192
01:27:42,787 --> 01:27:43,981
...a martini.

1193
01:27:44,722 --> 01:27:47,782
I've had a martini in every bar
on the way down here.

1194
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:50,418
Martinis are for squares, man.

1195
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:55,228
What'd you call me, you beatnik son of a--

1196
01:28:01,339 --> 01:28:02,738
Look who's here:

1197
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:04,171
Amy Archer...

1198
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:06,103
...Prizeter Pule winner.

1199
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:09,042
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1200
01:28:09,981 --> 01:28:12,245
- Bar fella, I'd like...
- I'm sorry.

1201
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:14,349
...a martini, please.

1202
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:16,819
I tried to tell you so many times, I....

1203
01:28:18,256 --> 01:28:19,689
It's hard to admit...

1204
01:28:19,757 --> 01:28:21,588
...when you've been wrong.

1205
01:28:22,193 --> 01:28:23,660
If you could just...

1206
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:25,926
...find it in your heart...

1207
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:28,431
...to give me another chance.

1208
01:28:30,868 --> 01:28:33,359
"You take no prisoners,
give no second chances."

1209
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:36,305
Please, Norville!
Please give me one more chance!

1210
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,372
And yourself, too!

1211
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:40,374
We both deserve one.

1212
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:44,240
Just give us a second chance.
Together we can fight this thing.

1213
01:28:44,382 --> 01:28:48,512
I know the last story was a lie
and we can prove it. Release a statement!

1214
01:28:48,586 --> 01:28:51,555
- I can help you write it!
- What's the difference?

1215
01:28:52,256 --> 01:28:53,621
I'm all washed up.

1216
01:28:55,059 --> 01:28:56,048
Extinct.

1217
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:58,654
Homo sapiens sapicus.

1218
01:29:01,599 --> 01:29:03,692
That just about does it.

1219
01:29:04,669 --> 01:29:08,002
I've seen Norville Barnes,
the young man in a big hurry...

1220
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:11,704
...and I've seen Norville Barnes,
the self-important heel.

1221
01:29:12,043 --> 01:29:14,978
But I've never seen Norville Barnes,
the quitter...

1222
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,372
...and I don't like it.

1223
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:20,640
"Fight on

1224
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:24,186
"Fight on, dear old Muncie

1225
01:29:25,823 --> 01:29:28,986
"Fight on
Hoist the gold and blue

1226
01:29:30,461 --> 01:29:33,487
"You'll be tattered, torn and hurting

1227
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:37,857
"Once the Munce is done with you

1228
01:29:40,405 --> 01:29:41,997
"Go...

1229
01:29:42,106 --> 01:29:43,232
"...Eagles!"

1230
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:48,737
You can't surrender, Norville! Remember:

1231
01:29:49,447 --> 01:29:50,880
"Fight on

1232
01:29:51,149 --> 01:29:52,582
"Fight on

1233
01:29:52,683 --> 01:29:55,083
"Dear old Muncie

1234
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,985
"Fight on

01:29:57,054 --> 01:30:00,581
"Hoist the gold and blue

1236
01:30:01,692 --> 01:30:03,853
"You'll be tattered, torn...

1237
01:30:03,928 --> 01:30:05,919
"...and hurting..."

1238
01:30:07,732 --> 01:30:08,994
You lied to me.

1239
01:30:09,767 --> 01:30:11,428
How could you lie to me?

1240
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:14,560
You...

1241
01:30:15,273 --> 01:30:16,604
...a Muncie girl.

1242
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,374
But, Norville, I--

1243
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:23,304
"When you're dead, you stay dead!"

1244
01:30:23,915 --> 01:30:25,007
Just ask...

1245
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:26,811
...Waring Hudsucker!

1246
01:30:34,091 --> 01:30:35,558
Extra, extra!

1247
01:30:35,693 --> 01:30:37,490
New Year's Eve edition!

1248
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:39,996
Barnes' brain caught red-handed!

1249
01:30:40,131 --> 01:30:41,564
Ideas ersatz!

1250
01:30:42,033 --> 01:30:44,729
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1251
01:30:45,102 --> 01:30:47,229
Read all about it!

1252
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:51,739
New Year's Eve edition!
Man from Muncie a moron after all!

1253
01:30:51,909 --> 01:30:54,139
You're not so slow, but you're not so swell.

1254
01:30:54,212 --> 01:30:56,908
And it looks like you're an imbecile
after all.

1255
01:30:57,348 --> 01:30:59,714
But your friends called you "dope?"

1256
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:02,014
"Dipstick?" "Lamebrain?" "Schmo?"

1257
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:05,249
Please, buddy, running the elevator,
it's all I got.

1258
01:31:05,323 --> 01:31:07,450
Norville, you let me down.

1259
01:31:07,525 --> 01:31:12,019
You let Mrs. Eisenhower down.
You let the American people down.

1260
01:31:12,096 --> 01:31:14,656
And when you're dead, you stay dead.

1261
01:31:18,069 --> 01:31:20,264
The kid is screwy, it's official.

1262
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:24,640
The barred-window boys
are out looking for him now.

1263
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:26,939
We'll see how Wall Street likes the news...

1264
01:31:27,011 --> 01:31:30,412
...that the president of Hudsucker
is heading for the booby hatch.

1265
01:31:32,116 --> 01:31:34,778
When Doc Bromfenbrenner gets through
with him...

1266
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:37,220
...he'll need diapers and a dribble cup.

1267
01:31:39,657 --> 01:31:40,988
If that's all....

1268
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:43,021
Long live the Hud!

1269
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:54,335
Watch where you're--

1270
01:31:54,405 --> 01:31:56,032
Hiya, buddy!

1271
01:31:56,941 --> 01:31:59,136
Out on the town? Guess what?

1272
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:02,077
Mr.... Sid says I can have my old job back!

1273
01:32:02,146 --> 01:32:04,080
I deserve a second chance, he says.

1274
01:32:04,315 --> 01:32:05,111
He did?

1275
01:32:05,182 --> 01:32:07,616
Turns out he's not such a bad guy after all.

1276
01:32:08,185 --> 01:32:09,652
That's wonderful.

1277
01:32:10,154 --> 01:32:13,749
He said you stole that swell hoop idea
from me. What gives?

1278
01:32:13,925 --> 01:32:15,187
I would never--

1279
01:32:15,259 --> 01:32:17,090
Gee, that was a swell idea.

1280
01:32:17,929 --> 01:32:19,692
And Sid says you stoled it!

1281
01:32:20,164 --> 01:32:22,632
What are you waiting for? Pop him one!

1282
01:32:33,177 --> 01:32:34,906
He's that big-shot faker!

1283
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:36,810
That Wall Street fraud!

1284
01:32:36,914 --> 01:32:38,745
Nuttier than a fruitcake!

1285
01:32:40,117 --> 01:32:41,778
Somebody call the cops!

1286
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:15,646
Ring out the old, ring in the new!

1287
01:37:58,102 --> 01:38:00,764
Strictly speaking, I'm never supposed
to do this...

1288
01:38:00,838 --> 01:38:02,829
...but have you got a better idea?

1289
01:39:10,975 --> 01:39:13,341
Love that tune. How you doing, kid?

1290
01:39:14,411 --> 01:39:15,742
Mr. Hudsucker?

1291
01:39:16,947 --> 01:39:19,745
How do you like that thing?
They're all wearing them upstairs.

1292
01:39:19,817 --> 01:39:20,909
It's a fad.

1293
01:39:21,151 --> 01:39:22,209
Anyway...

1294
01:39:22,686 --> 01:39:24,176
...I see you've been having some...

1295
01:39:24,254 --> 01:39:25,846
...problems with the board.

1296
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:28,550
I guess Sidney's been putting
the screws to you, Norman.

1297
01:39:29,026 --> 01:39:30,254
Norville.

1298
01:39:30,627 --> 01:39:33,858
Say what you like about his ethics,
he's a balls-to-the-wall businessman.

1299
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:37,230
Beat you any way he can.
Straight for the jugular. Very effective.

1300
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:40,532
Any particular reason you didn't give him
my blue letter?

1301
01:39:40,637 --> 01:39:44,198
Norman, just a dying man's last words
and wishes, no big deal.

1302
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:47,167
I must've mislaid it.

1303
01:39:47,244 --> 01:39:50,179
It's in your apron pocket,
right where you left it.

1304
01:39:50,647 --> 01:39:51,636
Imbecile.

1305
01:39:51,782 --> 01:39:54,808
Failure to deliver a blue letter
is grounds for dismissal.

1306
01:39:56,387 --> 01:39:59,447
It's New Year's. I'm not going to add
to your woes.

1307
01:39:59,556 --> 01:40:01,990
Want to read it?
You might learn something.

1308
01:40:02,426 --> 01:40:04,986
Might keep you from jumping
out of any more windows.

1309
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:14,064
"Blue letter from the desk
of Waring Hudsucker...

I will retain fond--"

"Of the years you and I have spent--"

1316
01:40:30,654 --> 01:40:34,090
Standard resignation boilerplate.
Go down to the second paragraph.

1317
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,194
"You will no doubt be wondering
why I've decided...

"I have foolishly played the great man...

1324
01:40:58,649 --> 01:41:02,085
"...and watched my life become more
and more empty as a result.

01:41:07,491 --> 01:41:10,392
"Yes, I loved a woman once, Sid,
as you well know.

"A beautiful, vibrant lady...

1329
01:41:12,896 --> 01:41:16,957
"...and angel who, in her wisdom,
saw fit to choose you instead of I."

1330
01:41:24,374 --> 01:41:25,636
Skip this part.

The New Year.

1369
01:44:52,983 --> 01:44:57,420
When he learned that Norville owned
the company, Sidney was upset at first.

1370
01:44:57,888 --> 01:45:00,686
It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner
was there...

1371
01:45:01,725 --> 01:45:05,126
...because he was able to keep Sidney
from harming himself.

1372
01:45:05,562 --> 01:45:09,589
He prescribed a long rest in the sana....
In the sanatory....

1373
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:11,298
In the booby hatch.

1374
01:45:12,469 --> 01:45:13,800
Now, Norville...

1375
01:45:14,471 --> 01:45:17,497
...he went on and ruled
with wisdom and compassion...

1376
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:21,507
...and started dreaming up
them exciting new ideas again.

1377
01:45:22,145 --> 01:45:23,578
You know, for kids.

1378
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:26,613
I had the boys down at R&D
throw together this prototype...

1379
01:45:26,683 --> 01:45:28,583
...so our discussion could have focus...

1380
01:45:28,652 --> 01:45:31,485
...and to give you gentlemen of the board
a firsthand look.

1381
01:45:36,927 --> 01:45:41,261
That's the story of how Norville Barnes
climbed way up...

1382
01:45:41,365 --> 01:45:44,198
...to the 44th floor
of the Hudsucker building...

1383
01:45:44,935 --> 01:45:48,928
...and then fell all the way down,
but didn't quite squish himself.

1384
01:45:49,973 --> 01:45:53,636
You know, they say there was a man
who jumped from the 45th floor.

1385
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:56,207
But that's another story.
