<i>Sieg heil!</i>

2
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,081
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

4
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,480
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,528
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

6
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,681
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,058
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

8
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,119
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.

9
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,618
To an American reporter...

10
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,623
...there is something very special
about the people of this city...

11
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,122
...this island, this nation.

12
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,125
Never in the long and stormy
history of Great Britain...

13
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,628
...have her fortunes been
as low as they are...

14
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,094
...in this spring of 1941.

15
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:25,689
Britain is fighting alone
for her very existence,...

16
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,199
...fighting desperately.

17
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,705
Yet her people remain
steadfast and unflinching.

18
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,705
Britain's allies have been
defeated one by one,...

19
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,207
...as the dark stain of Nazi conquest...

20
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,208
...spreads across the map of Europe.

21
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:42,737
In Africa, Rommel is giving
the Eighth Army a very bad time.

22
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,212
Greece has fallen.

23
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,182
And the <i>Luftwaffe</i> continues
to smash English cities.

24
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:51,084
<i>The worst news of all
comes from the North Atlantic,...</i>

25
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,588
<i>...where last month, German U-boats
and surface raiders...</i>

26
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,682
<i>...sank 600,000 tons of shipping.</i>

27
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,554
<i>In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.</i>

28
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,255
<i>This is the battle on which depends...</i>

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,298
<i>...the future course of the war...</i>

30
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:06,126
<i>...the future course of British history.</i>

31
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:13,694
<i>The battle of the North Atlantic
is fought at sea...</i>

32
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:17,434
<i>...but it is directed from
the admiralty, here in London.</i>

33
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,716
<i>Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building,...</i>

34
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,216
<i>...200 feet underground, is the War Room.</i>

35
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,708
<i>Here is the guiding brain
and central nervous system...</i>

36
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,186
<i>...of the British Navy,...</i>

37
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,687
<i>...The Operations Division.</i>

38
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:37,850
Robert.

39
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,015
Sir?

40
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,525
Take Captain Shepard's things...

41
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,356
...and put them in the office.

42
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,361
Aye, sir.

43
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,692
Thank you.

44
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,732
This, of course, is the message center...

45
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,200
...for incoming and outgoing signals.

46
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,238
These tubes lead to
the wireless room just down the hall.

47
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:59,242
- Oh, Shepard...
- Anything wrong?

48
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,707
That man's uniform.

49
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:03,143
Oh. We're quite informal here
about some things.

50
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,679
You'll find it's much different...

51
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,181
...from the bridge of a ship at sea.

52
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,680
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes. It has to be that way.

53
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,185
Shepard, this is Commander Richards...

54
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,686
...the duty plot officer.

55
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:16,187
Captain Shepard is
the new director of operations.

56
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,689
How do you do?

57
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,692
Don't let me interrupt your meal.

58
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,693
Captain Shepard,
Second Officer Anne Davis.

59
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,695
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.

60
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,196
How do you do, sir?

61
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,697
<i>How do you do?</i>

62
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,197
Be nice to her, Shepard.

63
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,699
If she ever got angry and walked out,
we'd lose the war.

64
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,861
Really?

65
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,405
<i>Seriously, you can depend on
this young lady.</i>

66
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,405
I've done it more times
than I care to admit.

67
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,202
Anne, be a darling, will you...

68
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:41,276
...and get your plot report in
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,775
<i>We mustn't be late...</i>

70
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,277
<i>...for Jimmy's party tonight.</i>

71
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,710
<i>Right-oh.</i>

72
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,214
I suppose I should shed a few tears...

73
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,713
...at leaving this place,...

74
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,216
...but quite honestly, I've hated the job.

75
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,946
Too much responsibility,
too much strain.

76
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,716
I'm getting a command at sea.

77
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,220
That's what I've always wanted.

78
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,220
Congratulations.

79
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,223
I hope you find one...

80
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,657
...that doesn't involve too much strain.

81
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:04,660
The point is, it's a different kind of strain.

82
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,663
If a man's going to serve in the navy,...

83
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,665
...he ought to serve at sea...

84
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,631
...unless, of course,
it's a man like yourself...

85
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,292
...who's already seen a lot of action.

86
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,337
He should still serve at sea.

87
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,838
Yes. Well, I'd better get along.

88
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,338
I'll say good-bye now...

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,668
...unless you have any questions.

90
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,675
I don't think so, thank you. Good luck.

91
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,733
Thank you.

92
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,229
We thought we might be of some
assistance, sir,...

93
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,237
...not knowing your way around yet, sir.

94
00:06:57,305 --> 00:07:00,741
Is there anything I can do for you?

95
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,832
Yes, there is something you can do.

96
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,174
A few moments ago I saw a rating
enter the War Room...

97
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,679
...without his jumper.

98
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:10,704
From now on, everyone
will be properly dressed at all times.

99
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,718
I cannot have officers
eating sandwiches on duty...

100
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:15,217
<i>...Commander Richards, under any circumstances.</i>

101
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,219
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

102
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,688
Excuse me, sir.

103
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,020
I think you should know
that Commander Richards...

104
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,556
...stood two watches without relief and...

105
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,058
I'm sure Commander Richards...

106
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,153
...doesn't need an interpreter,
Miss Davis.

107
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,220
I was also surprised
to hear a Wren officer...

108
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,630
...addressed by her Christian name.

109
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,395
<i>To me, this kind of informality...</i>

110
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,993
...is both irregular and inexcusable.

111
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,195
<i>Come in!</i>

112
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,241
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

113
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,706
Priority signal.

114
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,242
Thank you.

115
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,247
Huh. Excuse me.

116
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,281
<i>Come in.</i>

117
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,450
Oh, Shepard.

118
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,960
You know the assistant chief
of naval staff.

119
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,429
Yes, indeed, sir. Very well.

120
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,954
How are you,Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.

121
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,432
Thank you. I have a signal here...

122
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,469
...sent from our naval attache in Stockholm.

123
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,470
He reports two large German warships...

124
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,937
...steaming through the Kattegat.

125
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,438
What ships are they?

126
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,940
He doesn't say.

127
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,975
Do you think it might be the <i>Bismarck?</i>

128
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,441
It's possible, sir.

129
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,502
She's just completed
three months' training...

130
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,945
...in the Baltic.

131
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,515
They couldn't pick a better time
to break out, could they?

132
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,516
With this Crete business
going on,...

133
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,983
...and our convoys scattered all over.

134
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,521
I have a nasty hunch
that's the idea, sir.

135
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:39,986
I hope for once you're wrong.

136
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,523
We can't afford to have
that monster on the loose.

137
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,422
Look what <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> did to us.

138
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,992
22 ships sunk... 115,000 tons.

139
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,029
All in two months.

140
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,531
And they don't have anything like
<i>Bismarck's</i> fire power.

141
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,021
She could stand off and sink
every ship in a convoy...

142
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,535
...without ever coming under fire.

143
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,901
Shepard, get on to
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

144
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,438
Tell him we're not sure,...

145
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,938
...but we're very much concerned.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,439
Say we'll let him have...

147
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,804
...every scrap of information we get.

148
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,068
Aye-aye, sir.

149
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,337
<i>Oh, and, Shepard.</i>

150
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,436
I wish you'd prepare
your recommendations...

151
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:11,809
...in case it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

152
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,439
Very good, sir.

153
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,382
Pretty rough assignment...

154
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,214
...for a new man on the job.

155
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,948
I'm not worried about Shepard.

156
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,954
He's one of the ablest men
in the service.

157
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,957
I'm also told he's as cold
as a witch's heart.

158
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,959
That's may be a slight exaggeration, sir.

159
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,960
I want a man who's cold.

160
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,963
I'd like a man with no heart at all,...

161
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,123
...no soul,...

162
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,631
...just an enormous brain.

163
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,667
The battle of the North Atlantic...

164
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,135
...is a grim business.

165
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,468
It won't be won
by charm and personality.

166
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,471
We've had too much of that here.

167
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,972
I've known Shepard for years.

168
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,065
We've served together before.
He was different then.

169
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,972
Any particular reason for the change?

170
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,978
I suspect there are many reasons, sir.

171
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,980
Reasons of a personal nature.

172
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,481
Oh. I see.

173
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:58,483
<i>Well, how are we going to
get the information...</i>

174
00:09:58,586 --> 00:09:59,985
<i>...on those two ships?</i>

175
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,487
We have an agent in southern Norway, sir...

176
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,987
Better get in touch with him.

177
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,525
We don't want to get in touch
with him directly.
It's much too dangerous.

178
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,527
And there isn't time to go
through Zurich or Stockholm.

179
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,361
In this case,
you'll have to make direct contact.

180
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,128
Sir, this man is
in Nazi-occupied territory.

181
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,032
I realize that.

182
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:24,403
All the same, we must get
in touch with him immediately.

183
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,838
Aye-aye, sir.

184
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:09,047
<i>The enemy ships
were sighted coming out of the Baltic...</i>

185
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,058
<i>...obviously heading out to sea,...</i>

186
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,560
...obviously not in the service
of the king.

187
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:17,054
Now, what have we got over here
at Scapa Flow?

188
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,565
Battleships <i>King George V,
Prince of Wales,...</i>

189
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,033
...battle cruiser <i>Hood,...</i>

190
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,534
...and a few cruisers and destroyers.

191
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,231
The rest of the fleet's
out on convoy escort.

192
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,272
It's from Admiral Cunningham, sir.

193
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,274
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating.

194
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:33,368
German airborne troops
have captured Maleme Airfield."

195
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:39,072
Why is it we never get
our bad medicine in small doses?

196
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,548
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout...

197
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,016
...in the North Atlantic.

198
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,077
Cunningham and his fleet
busy down here in Crete.

199
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,553
Sommerville's got his hands full...

200
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,090
...trying to reinforce Malta
with Force H.

201
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,592
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>
are up here at Brest ready to
come out again.

202
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,593
We must keep them covered.

203
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,094
And 16 convoys to guard,...

204
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,098
...scattered all over the Atlantic.

205
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:01,497
If we had a hundred more ships,...

206
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,999
...we still wouldn't have enough.

207
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,162
<i>Sir, we've just had a signal...</i>

208
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,999
...from our agent in Norway.

209
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,538
The message is incomplete.

210
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:12,508
"Sighted two enemy ships
off Kristiansand at 0335
sailing due west,...

211
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,508
...Cruiser <i>Prinz Eugen</i> and..."

212
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,011
The transmission stopped
abruptly at that point, sir.

213
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,514
Did you try to get him back?

214
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:23,015
Yes, sir. No further contact.

215
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,019
Where is Kristiansand?

216
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,519
Off here, sir.

217
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,020
Southern tip of Norway.

218
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,091
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

219
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,557
I don't think this man...

220
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,559
...would have transmitted
in the circumstances...

221
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,562
...if it hadn't been something
really important.

222
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,065
Then we'll proceed on the assumption...

223
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,598
...that it's <i>Bismarck.</i>

224
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,227
May I suggest we put
Coastal Command to work...

225
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,669
...on air reconnaissance?

226
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,068
<i>By all means.
Everything from Bergen southwards.</i>

227
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,571
Tell them to photograph
everything that looks suspicious.

228
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:53,575
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief
at Scapa Flow.

229
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,075
<i>Aye-aye, sir.</i>

230
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,614
Excuse me, sir.

231
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,515
First Sea Lord on the line, sir.

232
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,215
Commander-in-Chief, sir.

233
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,722
Hello, Jack. How are you?

234
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,019
<i>I'm fine.</i>

235
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,525
Those two German ships...

236
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,027
...were sighted off southern Norway
at 0335.

237
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,528
One is the <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

238
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:21,031
...and we're not sure about the other.

239
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,532
<i>Do you think it's...</i>

240
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,534
I suggest you proceed
on the worst possible assumption...

241
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,037
...that it's <i>Bismarck</i>
and she's trying to breaking out.

242
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,699
I may be wrong, but I can't think
of anything worse at the moment.

243
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,900
I agree. We can't let that ship
get loose in the Atlantic.

244
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,534
<i>I'll come to immediate notice
for steam, sir.</i>

245
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,238
All right. Good-bye.

246
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,548
We're directed to assume
that it's <i>Bismarck...</i>

247
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,049
...accompanied by <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

248
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,549
...and that they're attempting to...

249
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,552
...break out into the convoy lanes.

250
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,055
Now, gentlemen, they'd have
four available passages,...

251
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,487
...wouldn't they?

252
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,046
<i>Here's the Denmark Strait,...</i>

253
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,058
<i>...the passage south of Iceland,...</i>

254
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,559
<i>...the Faeroes-Shetland Passage,...</i>

255
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,563
<i>...and the Fair Island Channel...</i>

256
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,029
<i>...between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.</i>

257
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,894
<i>Anyone care to place a bet?<i>

258
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,991
What about the Iceland-Faeroes
Channel?

259
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,933
Not too near our bases,
and a plenty a room to maneuver.

260
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,505
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?

261
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:13,371
Fair Island Channel,
is only a few hundred miles.

262
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:15,533
Much too close to our air patrol.

263
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:20,069
You're of no help to me, gentlemen.
All you're saying is
it could be any one of the four.

264
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:22,081
Actually, of course,
you're perfectly right.

265
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,548
And I'm afraid somehow or other...

266
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,584
...we've got to guard them all.

267
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,586
Have we any idea
where they are now, sir?

268
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,053
Nothing definite.

269
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,556
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command...

270
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,591
...that they're still carrying out a search.

271
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,058
<i>Aye-aye, sir.</i>

272
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,326
Looks like two cruisers.

273
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,329
That's what the pilot said.

274
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,330
One's a cruiser, all right.

275
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,331
The other one's...

276
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,832
...<i>Bismarck.</i>

277
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,459
<i>Bismarck's</i> been located in Norway.

278
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:29,763
Definitely identified.

279
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,326
<i>Bismarck's</i> in Grimstad Fjord.

280
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,838
They want us to send
everything we've got.

281
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,499
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.

282
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:38,841
- How was it?
- No luck. Nothing.

283
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,343
Visibility down to nil.

284
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,346
Cloud down to 200 feet, sir.

285
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,348
You can't get a bombing run
in weather like that.

286
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,349
We came in as low as we could,
200 feet along the fjord here.

287
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,343
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?

288
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,852
O.G.62, sir.

289
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
Right.

290
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,892
Now, Miss Davis, take the <i>Arethusa...</i>

291
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,892
<i>...from O.G.62,...</i>

292
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,327
<i>...and put her with the Home Fleet.</i>

293
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,330
<i>Good.</i>

294
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,332
<i>Now take the <i>Victorious...</i></i>

295
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,336
<i>...from that convoy forming
up in the Clyde... W.S.8.B....</i>

296
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,837
<i>...and put her with the Home Fleet.</i>

297
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,839
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.

298
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,340
Director of Operations.

299
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,842
No, I'm sorry.
We still have no information.

300
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:22,343
Well, the weather's closed in
over there...

301
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,940
...and the aircraft can't see a thing.

302
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,177
Yes, as soon... as soon as I hear, right.

303
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,185
Right. I will.

304
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,188
Now...

305
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,191
...take the <i>Repulse</i> from W.S.8.B...

306
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,955
...and put her with the Home Fleet.

307
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,696
<i>Right.</i>

308
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,699
<i>Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?</i>

309
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,928
Yes, sir, but I wouldn't give much
for the convoy.

310
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,233
<i>You do recall that's a troop convoy,...</i>

311
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,430
<i>...don't you, sir?</i>

312
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:55,563
Yes, I do.

313
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,732
They've got a long way to go...

314
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,742
...round the cape to the Middle East.

315
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,140
This leaves them
with almost no protection at all, sir.

316
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,677
I'm quite aware of the circumstances,
Miss Davis.

317
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,442
In my opinion this is a risk
we have to take.

318
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,541
We have to take, sir?

319
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,481
<i>Well, Shepard.</i>

320
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,985
What do you have in mind?

321
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:16,182
I think we must reinforce
the Home Fleet, sir.

322
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,690
We can't expect them to patrol everything
from here to Greenland...

323
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,692
...with what they've got now.

324
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,193
Well, where do we get the ships?

325
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,696
We'd have to take ships from other duty.

326
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,698
It would involve some risk.

327
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,097
We could take <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse</i> off escort duty.

328
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,762
<i>That would give the Commander-in-Chief
an aircraft carrier...</i>

329
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,305
...and another battle cruiser.

330
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,737
What convoy were they covering?

331
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,240
The W.8.S.B., sailing
from the Clyde tomorrow.

332
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,744
It's a large troop convoy, sir...
20,000 men.

333
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,906
We'd be exposing them to
a long and dangerous voyage...

334
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,504
...without proper escort.

335
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,743
Is that what you're recommending?

336
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,250
Yes, sir.

337
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,378
You're willing to gamble
the lives of 20,000 men?

338
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,923
I think there's a difference...

339
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,957
...between a gamble and a calculated risk.

340
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,726
Good for you, Shepard.

341
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,887
<i>Of course, I realize it's...</i>

342
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,897
It's not an easy decision to make.

343
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,696
The important ones never are.

344
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,200
All right, go ahead...

345
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,703
...and detach those two ships
from the convoy.

346
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,206
Inform Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

347
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,705
Aye-aye, sir.

348
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,211
They're giving us <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse.</i>

349
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,213
Now we can send <i>Hood</i>
and <i>Prince of Wales</i> out...

350
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,715
...to support the patrols
in the Greenland area.

351
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:33,719
I want them ready to sail
within an hour.

352
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,219
Yes, sir. The <i>Prince of Wales</i>
has civilian workers aboard.

353
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,722
They're making adjustments
to the gun turrets.

354
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,226
If they finish on time, have them put
ashore. If not, they'll sail with the ship.

355
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,725
Aye-aye, sir.

356
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,228
As far as the rest of the fleet concerned,...

357
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:48,230
...we'll wait here for definite information.

358
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,232
I suppose my nerves
can stand it if yours can.

359
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,234
I've just talked to Captain Shepard in London.

360
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,735
He says the visibility over the coast of Norway...

361
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,237
...is absolutely nil.

362
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,239
She may still be there.
She may have sailed.

363
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,933
What's the latest forecast?

364
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,736
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, sir.

365
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,243
It looks like two days
of very thick weather.

366
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,318
The weather report is
very good, Admiral.

367
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,318
Two days of heavy overcast.

368
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,355
<i>Good news, is it not so, Captain?</i>

369
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,856
It is, sir.

370
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,289
<i>Thank you, Bernhardt.</i>

371
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,298
We have a most interesting
chess game here, Lindemann.

372
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,300
The important moves
this time are at the opening.

373
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:37,304
To break out into the Atlantic
will not be easy, sir.

374
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,805
Yes, but we have the advantage,...

375
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,671
...because they do not know
what we are going to do.

376
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,299
We can move out immediately...

377
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,810
...or we can hide for a while...

378
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,312
...under this beautiful overcast.

379
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,316
Also, we have a choice
of four different exits.

380
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,317
Group North has suggested
the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.

381
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,819
You're not forgetting that, sir?

382
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,320
We have to take orders from Group North.

383
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,256
We do not have to take suggestions.

384
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,758
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,759
Lindemann, we have
a great opportunity here.

386
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,160
<i>I do not intend to let Group North...</i>

387
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,392
<i>...or anyone else lose it for me.</i>

388
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,762
There can be great glory in this voyage.

389
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,267
Glory for the Third Reich.

390
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,304
Glory for us!

391
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,203
For you, sir.
You are the fleet commander.

392
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,764
I will see that you are not forgotten.

393
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,776
I was forgotten after the last war.

394
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:28,777
Until the fuehrer came to power,...

395
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,780
...I got no recognition, no promotion.

396
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,280
I was ignored,...

397
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,282
...just as Germany was ignored.

398
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,784
The world only remembers the winners,
Lindemann.

399
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,786
We must make sure this time...

400
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,584
...that it will remember us.

401
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,886
I am sure it will.

402
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,790
<i>How soon can you get under way?</i>

403
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,794
I can have steam in half an hour, sir.

404
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,558
Captain, I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

405
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,065
- Very well, sir.
- Signal <i>Prinz Eugen.</i>

406
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,530
Very well, sir.

407
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:34,299
Sir, it's a signal from
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

408
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,800
An aircraft from Hatston's
got through to Grimstad.

409
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,300
There's nothing there now, sir.

410
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:39,802
Well, they've sailed.

411
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,805
At least we know that much.

412
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,806
Now we can get moving.

413
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,760
Position of all convoys, sir.

414
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:11,920
Thank you.

415
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:15,762
All we can do now is wait
and see what happens.

416
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,768
That's the worst part
of our job... The waiting.

417
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,272
You have a son
in the service, haven't you?

418
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,931
Yes, sir. He's at Gibraltar.

419
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,270
He's an air gunner in the <i>Ark Royal.</i>

420
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,775
I bet you're glad...

421
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:32,301
...he won't be mixed up
in this <i>Bismarck</i> show.

422
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,778
Why should I be glad?

423
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,782
If you were, you wouldn't admit it,
would you? Even to me.

424
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,284
He's serving with a fleet.
He must take his chance
like everybody else.

425
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,476
I see.

426
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,816
There's an air vice marshal
coming in later...

427
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,322
...to help out on reconnaissance.

428
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
- Give him a briefing, will you?
- Very good, sir.

429
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,489
You wanted to speak to the crew,
Captain?

430
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,996
- They've been alerted.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,555
<i>Achtung!</i>

432
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,332
Captain Lindemann.

433
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,834
With your permission,...

434
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,268
...I would like to address
the ship's company.

435
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:04,771
As you wish, sir.

436
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,932
Thank you.

437
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,776
Officers and men of the <i>Bismarck,...</i>

438
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,609
...this is the fleet commander.

439
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,081
<i>I can now tell you that
we are going out into the North Atlantic...</i>

440
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,447
<i>...to attack the British convoy system.</i>

441
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,452
We are going to sink their ships...

442
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,612
...until they no longer dare
to let them sail.

443
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:27,419
<i>It's true we are only two ships,...</i>

444
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:31,291
...but the world has never seen such ships.

445
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,794
You are sailing in the largest,...

446
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,457
...the most powerful battleship afloat,...

447
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,965
<i>...superior to anything
in the British Navy.</i>

448
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,729
<i>We are faster,...</i>

449
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,703
<i>...we are unsinkable, and we are German!</i>

450
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,205
<i>You cadet officers,...</i>

451
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,298
<i>...you were selected by
the highest authority...</i>

452
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,898
<i>...to make this voyage.</i>

453
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,409
<i>When you return to the fleet,...</i>

454
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:54,605
<i>...you will have many
inspiring stories to tell,...</i>

455
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,307
...stories of German sea power,...

456
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,283
...stories of Nazi victory!

457
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,253
To all of you, I say this...

458
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,755
...never forget that you are Germans,...

459
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,587
...never forget that you are Nazis!

460
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:13,259
Heil Hitler!

461
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,727
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

462
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,795
In the center, the main plot.

463
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,801
What's that?

464
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,304
Another convoy, sir.

465
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:26,804
Fine. Carry on.

466
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,306
Now, sir,...

467
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:31,810
...over here, we have the <i>Hood</i>
and the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

468
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:34,811
They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago.

469
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,814
Here we have the <i>Repulse,...</i>

470
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,315
...the aircraft carrier <i>Victorious,...</i>

471
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,316
...and the <i>King George V.</i>

472
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:45,047
They've been steaming
for approximately 18 hours.

473
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,816
<i>In this area,...</i>

474
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,050
<i>...the cruisers <i>Arethusa,
Manchester, Birmingham.</i></i>

475
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,819
<i>In the Denmark Strait,...</i>

476
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,827
<i>...the cruisers <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk.</i></i>

477
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,828
<i>As you can see, sir,...</i>

478
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:59,196
<i>...our cruiser screen is
spread out much too thinly.</i>

479
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,757
Now, if your people
would get into the air...

480
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,268
Can't fly reconnaissance missions
in weather like this.

481
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,702
We realize that, of course, sir.

482
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:09,205
<i>We must assume that the <i>Bismarck,...</i></i>

483
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,708
<i>...in company with the <i>Prinz Eugen,...</i></i>

484
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,767
<i>...is going to attempt a breakthrough...</i>

485
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:15,276
<i>...to the North Atlantic.</i>

486
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,778
<i>But we don't know where...</i>

487
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,781
<i>...and we don't know when.</i>

488
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,783
<i>If it's here...</i>

489
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,282
<i>...or here...</i>

490
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,784
<i>...then the <i>Repulse,</i> and the <i>Victorious...</i></i>

491
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:28,289
<i>...and the <i>K.G. V</i> will have to do the job.</i>

492
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,789
<i>If it's here in the Denmark Strait,...</i>

493
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,292
<i>...then the <i>Hood</i> and the <i>Prince of Wales...</i></i>

494
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,657
<i>...will have to go after her.</i>

495
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,787
<i>I should think they could handle it very nicely.</i>

496
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:41,300
Well, sir, <i>Hood's</i> a great ship.
So is the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

497
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,300
But she's fresh from the builder's yard.

498
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,800
No training for her crew.

499
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,805
In fact, in this emergency, she had
to put to sea with some of
the contractor's workmen still on board.

500
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,365
The <i>Bismarck's</i> a tough proposition
for any two ships.

501
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:53,875
Excuse me, gentlemen.

502
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,310
The First Sea Lord can see you now.

503
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,312
- Oh, good. Thank you very much, Shepard.
- A pleasure, sir.

504
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:00,845
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

505
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,281
<i>Right, sir.</i>

506
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,284
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

507
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,285
Commander Richards, who's your relief?

508
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:07,786
Dexter, sir.

509
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,289
He's late, isn't he?

510
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,290
A little. I don't mind, sir.

511
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:14,793
Well, I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

512
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,309
<i>My dearest Tom...</i>

513
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,311
<i>Come in.</i>

514
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,316
Thought you might like a cup of tea, sir,...

515
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,045
...long as you're not going to take any rest.

516
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,349
What are you doing here, Miss Davis?
I thought you're off duty.

517
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,321
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu.

518
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,823
I'm just filling in.

519
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:55,827
Oh, thank you. Would you file that
for me, please?

520
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,328
<i>There's an air raid going on up top.</i>

521
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,829
A Bad one?

522
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:01,831
No, not very.

523
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,766
Won't your family be worried about you?

524
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,267
I have no family here.

525
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,270
My father lives in Canada now.

526
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:12,774
I thought that surely you must
be married or something.

527
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,934
No, sir. Nothing at all.

528
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:16,442
Doesn't that seem a little odd,...

529
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,569
...if you don't mind my saying so?

530
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,581
I was going to be married last year,...

531
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:23,206
...but... It didn't work out.

532
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:24,648
His fault or yours?

533
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:26,150
He was at Dunkirk...

534
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,153
...and he was listed as missing in action.

535
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,655
It was just a year ago.

536
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,020
A year ago next week.

537
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:37,793
He was a rather wonderful man,...

538
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,319
...not brilliant or dashing
or anything like that,...

539
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,832
...but just rather wonderful.

540
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,735
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,330
I think it helps to
talk about these things,...

542
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,841
...don't you, sir?

543
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:58,344
No, I don't. As a matter of fact
I don't think it helps at all.

544
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,844
Getting emotional about things...

545
00:28:59,913 --> 00:29:01,346
...is a peacetime luxury.

546
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:03,279
In wartime, it's much too painful.

547
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,282
You can't turn off your emotions...

548
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,284
...just because there's a war on.

549
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,786
You can't do anything
about your feelings.

550
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,114
Yes, you can.

551
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,451
Director of Operations.

552
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,287
Tell you why I called, Jonathan.

553
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:16,791
Dexter's here in my office...

554
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,849
...and he has rather a special problem.

555
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:21,293
<i>I understand you've given him
extra duty.</i>

556
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:24,299
That's correct. I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

557
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:27,300
It seems that his girl is an army nurse...

558
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,495
...and she's got orders to sail
tomorrow night from Portsmouth.

559
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady
is going overseas,...

560
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,305
...but that's beside the point.

561
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:35,807
<i>Can't you make an exception?</i>

562
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,309
I'm not prepared to make an exception
for this officer...

563
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,809
...or any other,...

564
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:42,812
<i>...certainly not for reasons
of personal convenience.</i>

565
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,576
<i>Well, it's very simple, sir,...</i>

566
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,345
...either you have discipline
or you haven't.

567
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,749
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.

568
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,310
Thank you, sir.

569
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,321
By the way, Jonathan,...

570
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,824
...there's a fleet commander
aboard the <i>Bismarck.</i>

571
00:29:56,892 --> 00:30:00,182
Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.

572
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:01,659
Lutjens.

573
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,163
<i>You know this man?</i>

574
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:04,664
Yes, sir, I do.

575
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:07,667
One of his cruisers sank my ship.

576
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:12,171
<i>Oh. Then you'll have a special interest
in him.</i>

577
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:23,202
Commander Richards,
have a bunk made up in my office.

578
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,373
Yes, sir.

579
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,712
I want the latest report
on all shipping...

580
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,217
...in the North Atlantic...
Enemy, friendly, neutral.

581
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,218
Is there any air reconnaissance yet over this area?

582
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,719
No. The weather's still too bad.

583
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,222
You show two cruisers
in the Denmark Strait.

584
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,722
Is <i>Suffolk</i> back on station?

585
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,726
We assume she is,
but we don't know for certain.

586
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,226
She's quiet as a tomb.

587
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,739
Alter course to 1-9-0.

588
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,296
<i>Starboard 15.</i>

589
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,069
Starboard 15, sir.

590
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:02,010
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

591
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:03,841
Bloody fool!

592
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,183
This blasted fog.

593
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,686
It's like looking into a cake of ice.

594
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,188
I can't see a thing.

595
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,689
If you see something out there,...

596
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,690
...it will have 15-inch guns on it.

597
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,693
A solid foot of armour plate,
that's what the <i>Bismarck's</i> got.

598
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,193
Who said so?

599
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,695
The gunnery officer, that's who.

600
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:28,199
He said for all the good our guns'd do,
we might as well throw crumpets at her.

601
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,703
I wish someone would
throw a crumpet at me.

602
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,502
Ship bearing green 4-5!

603
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,737
<i>Two ships bearing green 4-5!</i>

604
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:46,077
Hard aport! Full ahead both!

605
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,115
Hard aport. Full ahead both, sir.

606
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,719
Shall we follow them, sir?

607
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,325
Steady on 1-3-0.

608
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,363
<i>Steady on 1-3-0!</i>

609
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,863
- Yeoman.
- Sir.

610
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,695
Make to admiralty. "<i>Bismarck</i> and cruiser sighted.

611
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,701
Course... south.

612
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,202
My position..."
Give latitude and longitude.

613
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,702
Get that off immediately...

614
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:17,706
...in case we run into trouble.

615
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,035
Aye-aye, sir.

616
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:20,040
Check radar.

617
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:22,201
Check your radar plot.

618
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,212
Enemy report from <i>Suffolk,</i> sir.

619
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,214
They've found her.

620
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,216
Picked her up in the Denmark Strait.

621
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,683
<i>Bismarck</i> and a heavy cruiser.

622
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,719
66-45 north...

623
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,720
...26 west.

624
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,723
There, gentlemen.

625
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,224
Course southwest.

626
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,724
Now things are looking up.

627
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,227
- Tell the First Sea Lord immediately.
- Aye-aye, sir.

628
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:48,731
Good job we've got
some heavy stuff in the area.

629
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,232
Richards, let me have
an intercepting course...

630
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,234
...for <i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

631
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,235
Sir, this one's from the <i>Norfolk.</i>

632
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:56,735
<i>Norfolk's</i> there, too, sir.

633
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:58,238
She's with <i>Suffolk.</i>

634
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,740
They're shadowing
in thick fog, using radar.

635
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:02,673
I hope that radar
works better than usual.

636
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:05,302
If she turned on them,
she could blow them both
out of the water.

637
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,676
No. Lutjens is too clever for that.

638
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,181
He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers...

639
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,682
...than stop to sink them.

640
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,981
Course to intercept <i>Bismarck</i>
is 3-1-0.

641
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,486
That would bring <i>Hood</i> in contact...

642
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,853
<i>...just about... There.</i>

643
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,357
<i>Just about here, sir.</i>

644
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,688
<i>The intercepting course
is 3-1-0 degrees.</i>

645
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,853
<i>At full speed, we should make contact
at 0300.</i>

646
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:29,193
I don't want to engage him
until daylight.

647
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:33,201
Give me a course and speed
to intercept at dawn.

648
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,701
Aye-aye, sir.

649
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,203
At 27 knots... Course 2-9-5,...

650
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,705
...we should meet them at first light.

651
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:42,207
We'll proceed on that course
at that speed.

652
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:44,743
- Pass the word to <i>Prince of Wales.</i>
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Anything further, sir?

653
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:52,247
Signal from flag, sir.

654
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:54,784
Speed... 27 knots.

655
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:56,251
200 revolutions.

656
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,253
Admiral's intentions follow, sir.

657
00:33:58,322 --> 00:33:59,755
Very good.

658
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:01,255
Wilson, tell the captain...

659
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:03,189
...we've gone onto 27 knots.

660
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,692
Also, the admiral's
sending his intentions.

661
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,196
Oh, Wilson, how are the civilian workers
enjoying themselves?

662
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:13,064
They're loving every moment of it, sir.

663
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,691
I'll tell you one thing...

664
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,202
...I'm not sleeping in one of these
bloody hammocks.

665
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,703
Make a note, Walter...

666
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,205
...to speak to the captain.

667
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:22,206
We'll have double beds put in.

668
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,708
Oh, very funny.
Well, I reckon it's a diabolical liberty.

669
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:27,210
I never even had a chance
to phone my wife to say what was happening.

670
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:29,711
They were afraid
she might not let you go.

671
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,215
Imagine what she thinks I'm up to.

672
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:33,715
Pity she's wrong, isn't it?

673
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:35,216
She'll never believe this.

674
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,717
Where are we going?

675
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:41,052
We picked up speed.
What's that for in the middle of the night?

676
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,487
Captain speaking.

677
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:45,219
<i>Bismarck</i> has been sighted
in Denmark Strait.

678
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,751
She's on her way out into the Atlantic.

679
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,388
<i>And we plan to tackle her
about dawn tomorrow morning.</i>

680
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,263
<i>You'll be going to action stations...</i>

681
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,393
<i>...shortly after midnight,
so get all the rest you can.</i>

682
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,369
<i>I'm confident tomorrow is
going to be a big day for us.</i>

683
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:01,929
<i>Good luck and good shooting.</i>

684
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,169
They can't do this to me. I'm
in a reserved occupation.

685
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:10,179
I never thought
a thing like this would happen.

686
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:13,182
Fancy me fighting Germans
on the high seas.

687
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,185
Here, lad. You ever been in
a battle before?

688
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,684
Yeah, hundreds of times.

689
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:20,186
Don't hardly give it a thought any more.

690
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,227
Latest plot report, sir.

691
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,729
<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i> still in contact.

692
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,732
<i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales...</i>

693
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,733
...are estimated 120 miles from <i>Bismarck.</i>

694
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,235
Should be quite a show tomorrow morning.

695
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,237
I know where I'd rather be.

696
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,568
Excuse me, sir.

697
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:48,243
What a time for Shepard to take over.

698
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:51,246
I hope he's getting
all the help he needs.

699
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:56,478
Help, sir? I didn't think
he needed any help.

700
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,280
Captain Shepard is
a very old friend of mine, Miss Davis.

701
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:03,482
You would be quite wrong
if you judged him too harshly.

702
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:06,992
He had his ship
blown from under him
last year up in Norway.

703
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:09,721
This job here means promotion for him...

704
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,730
...but he can't wait to get another ship.

705
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,731
As long as I've known him,
only two things matter to him.

706
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,858
His family and the sea.

707
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,958
I didn't know he had any family, sir.

708
00:36:19,036 --> 00:36:22,733
His son is an air gunner
serving in the <i>Ark Royal.</i>

709
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,240
He and the boy are terribly close.

710
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,741
And his wife?

711
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:30,539
He hasn't spoken about her,
and I haven't asked.

712
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:33,547
Signal from Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

713
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:36,242
"<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i>
will continue shadowing tonight.

714
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:37,750
They will make no attempt
to engage the enemy."

715
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:40,753
Right. Make to <i>Hood</i>
and <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

716
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:43,754
"If enemy maintains present
course and speed,...

717
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:47,759
...you should make contact
approximately 0510."

718
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:50,919
Right, sir.

719
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,428
And, Dexter.

720
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:53,928
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

721
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,432
Add to that... "Good luck".

722
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:57,932
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

723
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm not strong enough
for this sort of thing.

724
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,242
Besides, I've got flat feet.

725
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,742
Ah, shut up, Henry.

726
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,245
If we're gonna fight the <i>Bismarck,...</i>

727
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:14,745
...I'm gonna check "Y" turret.

728
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,749
Yeah, and we'd better check that turbine.
Come on, Henry.

729
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:18,249
Anyway, I always get seasick.

730
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,419
<i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales...</i>

731
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,919
...are somewhere in here.

732
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:24,749
<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk...</i>

733
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:28,259
...report <i>Bismarck</i> and <i>Prinz Eugen</i> here.

734
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,759
If so, we shouldn't have long to wait.

735
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,227
It should be getting light up there now.

736
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:34,854
Signal from <i>Suffolk,</i> sir.

737
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:37,263
"Have sighted <i>Hood</i> and
<i>Prince of Wales</i> bearing southeast.

738
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:38,594
Distance... 15 miles."

739
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,259
That means they've made it.

740
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,269
Good old <i>Hood,</i> she'll get them.

741
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:50,275
<i>Breach open!
Come on, hurry up!</i>

742
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,536
<i>Come on, everyone!</i>

743
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:15,353
Right gun shell!

744
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,239
Right gun shell!

745
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,245
Right gun, first half charge!

746
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,245
Right gun, second half charge!

747
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:56,286
Bridge.

748
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:58,298
Smoke bearing green 4-0, sir.

749
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,799
<i>Bismarck</i> and cruiser...

750
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,299
...bearing green 4-0,...

751
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:04,565
<i>...about 12 miles.</i>

752
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:06,229
<i>Closing fast.</i>

753
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,746
Those are not cruisers.
They are battleships.

754
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,747
Captain, open fire on the leading ship.

755
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,750
Target leading ship!

756
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,250
Stand by to open fire!

757
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,751
<i>Target leading ship!</i>

758
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,252
<i>Stand by to open fire!</i>

759
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,810
<i>Hard aport.</i>

760
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:33,758
Open fire when you in range.

761
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:35,261
Concentrate on <i>Bismarck.</i>

762
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:36,761
Aye-aye, sir.

763
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:39,764
- Let me know when you're ready
to engage guns and then we'll turn.
- Aye-aye, sir.

764
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,269
- Tell <i>Prince of Wales</i> to open
fire when she's in range.
- Aye-aye, sir.

765
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,398
Hard astarboard!

766
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:56,743
Shoot!

767
00:39:58,514 --> 00:40:01,176
Range... 25,000. Bearing... 300.

768
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,242
All turrets ready to open fire, sir.

769
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,646
Open fire.

770
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:09,917
Fire!

771
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:16,355
Fire!

772
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,694
That was too close for comfort.

773
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:26,395
Turn 20 degrees to starboard, Captain.

774
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:28,494
Shoot!

775
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,032
Fire!

776
00:40:57,328 --> 00:40:59,091
Unbelievable.

777
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,697
Blimey.

778
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,200
What happened?

779
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,237
<i>The <i>Hood's</i> gone.</i>

780
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,173
Good God.

781
00:41:14,242 --> 00:41:15,675
Yeoman.

782
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,176
Yes, sir?

783
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:20,179
Make to admiralty from <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

784
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:23,181
Tell them... Tell them
the <i>Hood</i> has blown up.

785
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:24,682
Aye-aye, sir.

786
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,015
Starboard 15.

787
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,349
Starboard 15, sir.

788
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,513
<i>Starboard 15.</i>

789
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,185
Signal from <i>Prince of Wales,</i> sir.

790
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,194
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

791
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,531
It says... HMS <i>Hood</i> has blown up.

792
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:49,202
<i>Bring it here.</i>

793
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:53,865
Signal from <i>Suffolk,</i> sir.

794
00:41:58,778 --> 00:42:00,211
Johnson.

795
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:06,150
"<i>Hood</i> sunk.

796
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:09,152
<i>Prince of Wales</i>
and <i>Bismarck</i> exchanging fire."

797
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,752
Fire!

798
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:29,036
Shoot.

799
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,105
Port 20!

800
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:49,282
Tell the engine room to give me
everything they've got.

801
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:50,285
<i>Course 2-4-0.</i>

802
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:53,145
Very good. Course 2-4-0.

803
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:56,889
Fire!

804
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,178
Give me a hand!

805
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:29,184
Hard aport. Steer 1-5-0.

806
00:43:30,753 --> 00:43:32,243
Make smoke.

807
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:43,195
She's badly damaged, sir.

808
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,856
She's turning away and making smoke.

809
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,962
Do you want to pursue?

810
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,005
No. We have more important work to do.

811
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,506
Hold your course.

812
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:58,007
Steady on present course.

813
00:43:58,075 --> 00:43:59,508
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

814
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,510
Captain, congratulations.

815
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:04,944
It's a great moment for the German Navy.

816
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:06,447
Yes, Lindemann...

817
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,950
...and for the two of us.

818
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,963
This morning, HMS <i>Hood,...</i>

819
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:29,228
...largest British warship,
was sunk by the...

820
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:48,482
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.

821
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,986
This island, which is
no stranger to bad tidings,...

822
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:53,986
...received news today that HMS <i>Hood,...</i>

823
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:56,487
...the largest warship in the British fleet...

824
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,491
...and pride of the British Navy,...

825
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:00,685
...has been sunk by the German
battleship <i>Bismarck.</i>

826
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:03,922
From the <i>Hood's</i>
complement of 1,500 men,...

827
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:05,428
...there were three survivors.

828
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,929
In the same engagement...

829
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:09,933
...the battleship <i>Prince of Wales</i>
was badly damaged.

830
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,436
Two British capital ships
have been put out of commission...

831
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,937
...and the most powerful
battleship in the world...

832
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,438
...is now loose on the high seas.

833
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,443
It remains to be seen
whether the British Navy...

834
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,944
...has the capability
at this crucial moment...

835
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:25,945
...of concentrating enough sea power...

836
00:45:26,012 --> 00:45:27,946
...to deal with the situation.

837
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,950
There is undoubtedly great
rejoicing in Berlin tonight...

838
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,645
...and also on the <i>Bismarck.</i>

839
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,984
Here's to the ship, Lindemann,...

840
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:37,988
...and here's to us.

841
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:42,492
We have beaten the best they have.

842
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,993
Do you realize that?

843
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:44,993
Yes, sir.

844
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:47,496
They will never stop us, not now.

845
00:45:47,563 --> 00:45:49,497
You wanted the damage control report, sir.

846
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:50,999
What is it?

847
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:54,002
We received one hit,
forward on the port side,...

848
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:55,502
...over number two fuel tank.

849
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,003
We're losing a little oil.

850
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,163
Anything serious?

851
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,004
No, sir. I would say
the damage is very slight.

852
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:03,600
<i>However, I recommend we put about
and have it repaired.</i>

853
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,875
Put about? You mean go home?

854
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:11,143
Yes, sir. We could refuel
at the same time.

855
00:46:11,216 --> 00:46:12,945
Are you mad?

856
00:46:13,018 --> 00:46:16,476
We have fought our way out
into the Atlantic.

857
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:19,979
This is no time to turn
and run for home.

858
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,457
We wouldn't be running.

859
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:23,460
We've won a tremendous victory.

860
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,859
But it's not the victory that was ordered.

861
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:28,954
You haven't been close
to the high command, Lindemann.

862
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:30,965
Do you know what will happen...

863
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,968
...when Admiral Raeder
reports the sinking of the <i>Hood?</i>

864
00:46:34,035 --> 00:46:35,468
The fuehrer will smile...

865
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:37,471
...and everyone else will smile,...

866
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,472
...and then, a few moments later,...

867
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,974
...he'll turn to Raeder with a scowl.

868
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,634
"What about the convoys, Raeder?

869
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,404
Have they sunk any convoys?"

870
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:47,969
There will still be
plenty of convoys, sir,...

871
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:49,308
...after we make repairs.

872
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,474
Is your ship unmaneuverable, Captain?

873
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,485
Are the guns damaged?
Anything out of action?

874
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:55,985
No, sir.

875
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:57,987
Then we will push forward...

876
00:46:58,054 --> 00:46:59,988
...as instructed by the high command.

877
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:01,991
But surely the fuehrer must realize...

878
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:05,926
Are you now going to tell the fuehrer
what he must realize?

879
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:06,926
No, sir.

880
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:08,428
Then do not tell me.

881
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:09,929
For the time being,...

882
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,431
...we will hold our present
course and speed.

883
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,762
Yes, sir.

884
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,461
There will be no further
statement to the press...

885
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:17,969
- ...not for the present.
- Aye-aye, sir.

886
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,472
Make a signal to admiral
commanding First Cruiser Squadron.

887
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,474
"<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i>
must maintain contact...

888
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,974
...with the <i>Bismarck...</i>

889
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:25,977
...so that Home Fleet can intercept.

890
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,979
Continue shadowing as long
as you have fuel to do so."

891
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,479
Excuse me, sir.

892
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,981
This is <i>Bismarck's</i> latest
position, course, and speed.

893
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,985
Send it to the C-in-C,
Home Fleet, right away.

894
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,485
<i>Now, Shepard.</i>

895
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,487
At its present speed, sir,...

896
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:42,284
<i>...the Home Fleet cannot make
contact with <i>Bismarck...</i>

897
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,484
<i>...until tomorrow,...</i>

898
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:46,652
<i>...and then only if she maintains
her present course.</i>

899
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:48,285
<i>What if she doesn't maintain her present course?</i>

900
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,490
That's it exactly, sir.
They won't make contact at all.

901
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,499
Prime minister for you, sir.

902
00:47:58,403 --> 00:47:59,995
First Sea Lord here.

903
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,505
<i>Now, First Sea Lord,...</i>

904
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,439
<i>...I want to make it unmistakably clear...</i>

905
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:06,942
<i>...that there is absolutely nothing
as vital...</i>

906
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,445
<i>...to the nation at this moment...</i>

907
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,242
<i>...as the destruction of the <i>Bismarck.</i></i>

908
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:14,442
<i>You are authorized to employ...</i>

909
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
<i>...any means at your disposal,...</i>

910
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,948
<i>...regardless of risk...</i>

911
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,320
<i>...and regardless of the price
that must be paid.</i>

912
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:27,452
<i>This is a battle
we cannot afford to lose.</i>

913
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:28,960
I understand, sir.

914
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:31,963
<i>I don't care how you do it.</i>

915
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,964
<i>You must sink the <i>Bismarck.</i></i>

916
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:35,466
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

917
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:36,966
Thank you, sir.

918
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,974
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?

919
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,475
In my opinion, sir,...

920
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,478
...we cannot leave this entirely
to the Home Fleet.

921
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,979
We must reach out and pull in...

922
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:55,016
...everything we can lay our hands on.

923
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,017
I've ordered <i>Rodney</i> to leave her convoy.

924
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,018
She was the last available ship.

925
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,020
I don't suggest this lightly, sir.

926
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,453
Down here, at Gibraltar, we've Force H.

927
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,957
<i>Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal.</i>

928
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,959
We can't strip the Western Mediterranean...

929
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,961
...with this Crete business going on.

930
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:11,462
Perhaps if we left <i>Ark Royal</i> down there...

931
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:13,963
...and sent the other two out.

932
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:15,557
No, sir.

933
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,466
We may need <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft.

934
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,969
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

935
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:22,972
It's taking a serious risk.

936
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,473
I know Shepard has weighed
that very carefully.

937
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,634
In view of what the prime minister said,...

938
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,769
...we don't seem to have much choice.

939
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,473
Well, I may be able
to argue with you two,...

940
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:35,981
...but I can't quarrel
with the prime minister.

941
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,483
Order Force H to sail
at the earliest possible moment.

942
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:38,984
Aye-aye, sir.

943
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:47,152
Johnson.

944
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,317
Smith.

945
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:51,486
It's not for you, boy.

946
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:52,995
Stratton.

947
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:54,496
Singer.

948
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:55,997
Shepard.

949
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,500
Oh, thanks.

950
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:58,499
Thompson.

951
00:49:58,568 --> 00:50:00,001
- <i>Thompson, where are you?</i>
- <i>That's me.</i>

952
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,502
<i>My dearest Tom,...</i>

953
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,004
<i>...I'm really much too tired to write,...</i>

954
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:07,007
<i>...but I think of you so very often...</i>

955
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:08,508
<i>...that I'm always afraid...</i>

956
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,511
<i>...there may be things
I will forget to mention.</i>

957
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,011
Marvelous. No letter again.

958
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,514
Where are we off to this time?
That's what I'd like to know.

959
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:17,015
Tom, is it true...

960
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,018
...your father is director of operations?

961
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,518
I'm afraid it is.

962
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:23,020
- He's got a nerve, moving us out of Gibraltar.
- Just when we get fixed up with some girls.

963
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,852
Why don't you tell him we don't want to go to sea.

964
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:27,357
It's my fault, really.

965
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,485
I thought you blokes would like
a couple months in England.

966
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,528
- England?
- You're kidding?

967
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,928
Not at all. You see, my girl's in London.
That's what gave me the idea.

968
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:38,297
You mean to say
you asked your father if...

969
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,563
They wouldn't dare. Well, not in wartime.

970
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:43,069
Go on. Your father would do the same for you.

971
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:44,570
<i>This is the captain.</i>

972
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:47,402
<i>I thought you'd be interested to know...</i>

973
00:50:47,475 --> 00:50:50,672
...we shall be operating in
the Atlantic for a while.

974
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,577
We've got orders to go
after the <i>Bismarck.</i>

975
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:55,510
- No! No! Boys!
- Grab him!

976
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:08,524
If <i>Bismarck</i> holds her
present course and speed,...

977
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:11,026
...when's the earliest we can engage her?

978
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:14,028
Nine o'clock tomorrow morning, sir,
at best possible speed.

979
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:17,030
If <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>
can keep track of her,...

980
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,033
...they can guide us in.

981
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,534
Suppose <i>Bismarck</i> gives them the slip?

982
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,537
If she shakes off those cruisers
during the night,...

983
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,970
...if we lose contact,
we may never get hold of her again.

984
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,032
She's got the weather on her side, sir.

985
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:31,543
Looks very bad for tonight.

986
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,544
We've got to try and slow her down
before nightfall.

987
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,547
Sommers, do you think <i>Victorious</i>
could launch an air strike?

988
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:39,048
She's supposed to get
her deck landing training.

989
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:42,552
Most of her pilots
have never flown off a carrier.

990
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:46,055
I'm afraid they'll have to
start their training now.

991
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:47,554
Detach <i>Victorious</i> from the fleet.

992
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:50,057
Tell her to close <i>Bismarck</i> at 30 knots.

993
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:52,059
She's to launch an air strike...

994
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:54,061
- ...when she's gets within 100 miles of the enemy.
- Aye-aye, sir.

995
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,561
That's all, gentlemen.

996
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,502
Signal <i>Prinz Eugen</i> that
she is to proceed on her course...

997
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:07,004
- ...and make for Brest.
- Yes, sir.

998
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:09,506
We will keep the enemy cruisers occupied...

999
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:12,510
...until <i>Prinz Eugen</i> is out of sight.

1000
00:52:12,577 --> 00:52:15,011
All right, Captain,
you can make your turn.

1001
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:16,512
- Hard aport.
- <i>Hard aport, sir.</i>

1002
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,639
Stand by to open fire.

1003
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:35,062
Radar plot, range decreasing.

1004
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:37,062
Decreasing very rapidly.

1005
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,064
Range down to 22,000 yards.

1006
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:41,565
She's doubled back on us, sir!

1007
00:52:41,634 --> 00:52:43,067
There she is, sir!

1008
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:51,403
<i>Hard aport. Full ahead both.</i>

1009
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:52,568
<i>Hard aport!</i>

1010
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:56,070
<i>Make smoke.</i>

1011
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:58,169
<i>Make smoke. Full ahead both.</i>

1012
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:04,314
Signal to <i>Prinz Eugen.</i>

1013
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:06,319
"Good-bye and good hunting."

1014
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:07,820
That's all, Becker.

1015
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:09,321
Very good, sir.

1016
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:10,822
Cease fire, Captain.

1017
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:11,823
Cease fire.

1018
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:13,325
<i>Cease fire, sir.</i>

1019
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:14,826
Signal to Group West.

1020
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:17,328
"<i>Prinz Eugen</i> successfully detached...

1021
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,829
...and proceeding independently.

1022
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:22,833
Have been unable
to shake off enemy cruisers...

1023
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:24,334
...because of radar.

1024
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,336
Will attempt to break away
during the night."

1025
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,837
Thank you, Mueller.

1026
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,338
Very good, sir.

1027
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:31,839
All right, Captain,...

1028
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,842
...you may resume your original course.

1029
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,842
Starboard 20.

1030
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:35,842
<i>Starboard 20.</i>

1031
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,344
Starboard 20.

1032
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,214
<i>Contact!</i>

1033
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,511
There she is... Starboard beam.

1034
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,910
Hard astarboard!

1035
00:55:30,837 --> 00:55:32,304
What is it?

1036
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:40,935
All right.

1037
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,244
One hit on the port bow, sir.

1038
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:44,747
<i>What is the damage?</i>

1039
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:46,749
Very slight, sir, and no one wounded.

1040
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:49,752
We will have the damage
repaired in a few hours.

1041
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:51,753
That is good. That is good.

1042
00:55:51,854 --> 00:55:53,253
- Lindemann.
- Yes, sir.

1043
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:54,755
If there were submarines in this area,...

1044
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:56,758
...we would zigzag, wouldn't we?

1045
00:55:56,859 --> 00:55:58,258
Of course, sir.

1046
00:55:58,361 --> 00:56:00,261
And the cruisers following us...

1047
00:56:00,362 --> 00:56:02,762
...would be obliged to do the same.

1048
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,262
Yes, sir, but I would...

1049
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:07,766
Captain, I want you to set
a zigzag pattern.

1050
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,768
Hold speed at 20 knots.

1051
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,268
In exactly two hours...

1052
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,271
...we shall stop zigzagging...

1053
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:15,272
...and proceed at full speed...

1054
00:56:15,374 --> 00:56:17,274
...in whatever direction
we're headed.

1055
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,277
We will be out of radar range...

1056
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,778
...before they realize they have lost us.

1057
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,785
This hit <i>Victorious</i> claims...

1058
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,787
...it hasn't slowed <i>Bismarck</i> down at all.

1059
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:35,287
I know, sir. She's been zigzagging now...

1060
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,290
...for more than two hours.

1061
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,223
That's odd.

1062
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,227
She must know we haven't...

1063
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:42,229
...any submarines in the area.

1064
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:45,231
I wonder if <i>Victorious</i>
can get off another strike tonight.

1065
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:47,232
I'm afraid not. It's too dark now.

1066
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,735
Signal from <i>Norfolk,</i> sir.

1067
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:51,736
Yes? What is it?

1068
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:54,238
Sir, they've... They've lost
contact with <i>Bismarck.</i>

1069
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:06,248
This is London.
Over 24 hours have passed...

1070
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:10,274
...since the battleship <i>Bismarck</i>
destroyed HMS <i>Hood.</i>

1071
00:57:10,352 --> 00:57:12,752
It is reported that the British
have attacked the <i>Bismarck...</i>

1072
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:14,755
...with aircraft from a carrier,...

1073
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:17,757
...but Berlin says the attack
was beaten off successfully.

1074
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:20,760
Berlin adds that <i>Bismarck</i>
was able subsequently...

1075
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,294
...to shake off the surface vessels
pursuing her.

1076
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,455
The German battleship has survived...

1077
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:28,624
...the heaviest guns and ships
in the British Navy,...

1078
00:57:28,701 --> 00:57:30,794
...and the gloomy speculation now is...

1079
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:33,803
...that the British Navy
may have trouble finding her,...

1080
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,304
...let alone destroying her.

1081
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,273
Of one thing we can be sure...

1082
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:41,072
...the lights will burn late
in the admiralty tonight.

1083
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,238
This is her last known position,...

1084
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:45,779
...and this...

1085
00:57:47,982 --> 00:57:49,415
...her farthest on.

1086
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:53,443
That means she has to be
somewhere inside that circle.

1087
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,752
In this sector, search aircraft
from <i>Victorious.</i>

1088
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,291
To the south and west,...

1089
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:02,294
...the cruisers <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk.</i>

1090
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:03,795
That leaves two possibilities.

1091
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:06,297
Either she's broken back to Germany...

1092
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,424
...or she's headed for
one of the French ports.

1093
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,303
Now, Miss Davis.

1094
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:16,305
If you were <i>Bismarck,</i> what would you do?

1095
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,308
Well, I suppose I'm not very brave.

1096
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:21,309
I'd head for home, sir.

1097
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:24,312
And a very sensible thing to do, too.

1098
00:58:24,345 --> 00:58:27,109
Plenty of fuel, good repair facilities,...

1099
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:29,114
...complete protection.

1100
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:31,185
But not Lutjens...

1101
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,719
...or any other German fleet commander.

1102
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:34,742
Why not?

1103
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,755
Because in Nazi Germany, he'd lose face.

1104
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:39,687
I've fought these people before.

1105
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:42,728
They have to prove
their superiority every day.

1106
00:58:42,761 --> 00:58:44,729
That's their one tremendous weakness.

1107
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:45,694
<i>Sir.</i>

1108
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:46,730
Yes?

1109
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,730
Signal from the Commander-in-Chief.

1110
00:58:48,765 --> 00:58:51,233
"<i>King George V</i> running short of fuel.

1111
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,565
Can't maintain full speed much longer."

1112
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:01,774
Supposing she is heading
for a French port.

1113
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,275
It won't be long...

1114
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:05,777
...before she gets
friendly submarine support...

1115
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,278
...and complete air cover.

1116
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,280
Too late to stop her then.

1117
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,781
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> at Brest.

1118
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,285
Supposing <i>Bismarck</i> joins up with them...

1119
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:18,288
...and all three of them
decide to come out together.

1120
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,947
What then?

1121
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,226
<i>What's the trouble?</i>

1122
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,726
He just collapsed, sir.

1123
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,729
- I think he's got a temperature.
- Take him in the office.

1124
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,789
Why is this man on duty if he's sick?

1125
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:32,298
I don't know, sir.
He didn't report sick.

1126
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,800
Ring the sick bay and get someone over here.

1127
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,963
Aye-aye, sir.
<i>Simms, take over.</i>

1128
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:40,239
All right. Leave him here.

1129
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:41,740
Aye-aye, sir.

1130
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:42,798
Sorry about this, sir.

1131
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:45,710
If you had a temperature,
why the devil didn't you report sick?

1132
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:47,245
I'm sorry, sir.

1133
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:50,714
I didn't want to miss anything.

1134
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,216
All right, Brown.

1135
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,219
We'll get you along to the sick bay.

1136
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:57,982
If anything happens, I'll let you know.

1137
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,521
Thank you, sir.

1138
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:02,024
What time is it, Miss Davis?

1139
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:03,526
About 6:30, sir.

1140
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,027
Morning or evening?

1141
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,028
It's a very fine morning,

1142
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,031
and I think you should
go on up and take a short walk.

1143
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,033
You haven't been outside
for five days.

1144
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,264
Take down this message
for Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

1145
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:19,271
"Our interpretation
of best available information...

1146
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:22,273
...indicates <i>Bismarck</i>
heading for the coast of France."

1147
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:24,003
Proceed accordingly.

1148
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:27,273
Excuse me, sir, but do you have to
stick your neck out quite so far?

1149
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:30,280
I'm afraid that goes with the job.

1150
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,281
Make to admiral commanding Force H.

1151
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:33,782
"Proceed to intercept <i>Bismarck...</i>

1152
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:36,285
...on assumption she's headed for Brest.

1153
01:00:36,353 --> 01:00:39,254
Suggest search by aircraft
from <i>Ark Royal.</i>"

1154
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:42,791
Your son is in <i>Ark Royal,</i> isn't he, sir?

1155
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,281
Yes, yes. Yes, he is.

1156
01:00:44,327 --> 01:00:46,795
Get that off immediately,
will you?

1157
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,260
<i>Come in.</i>

1158
01:01:28,328 --> 01:01:30,228
Come in, Miss Davis.

1159
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,229
Signal for you, sir.

1160
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,730
<i>Thank you.</i>

1161
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:42,170
<i>This is a report on the
<i>Ark Royal's</i> air search.</i>

1162
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,173
They haven't found a thing.

1163
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,673
Better tell Captain Shepard.

1164
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,971
Yes, sir.

1165
01:01:47,044 --> 01:01:49,171
Also, two of <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft...

1166
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:51,179
...failed to return to the carrier.

1167
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:54,181
No need to tell him that,
I should think it can't do any good.

1168
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,707
By the way, how would you like
a trip to America?

1169
01:01:57,752 --> 01:01:59,117
America, sir?

1170
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,814
The admiralty's sending a mission
to discuss a master plot for convoys.

1171
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:04,413
Two regular officers and a Wren officer.

1172
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,685
The board picked you as first choice.

1173
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,250
It sounds very exciting.

1174
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,886
There will be no change, of course...

1175
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:13,397
...until this <i>Bismarck</i> thing is settled,
then talk to Captain Shepard.

1176
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,592
Aye-aye, sir. And thank you very much.

1177
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:19,694
Yes, it would have to be
long-range aircraft,...

1178
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,362
...Catalinas, I should think.

1179
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,701
Yes, that's right. Call me back.

1180
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,899
<i>Shepard.</i>

1181
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,065
Sir?

1182
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,235
It seems to me our forces
are very heavily committed...

1183
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,245
...to a single course of action.

1184
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:33,804
Is that based on the definite knowledge
that <i>Bismarck...</i>

1185
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:35,745
...is headed for a French port?

1186
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:38,614
On definite knowledge?
No, sir.

1187
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:40,687
It's based on my summing up...

1188
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,345
...of the general situation.

1189
01:02:42,422 --> 01:02:45,186
I felt it was a decision
that had to be made.

1190
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:47,225
I hope you're right, Shepard.

1191
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:49,523
I hope to God you're right.

1192
01:02:49,628 --> 01:02:51,687
A report from <i>Ark Royal,</i> sir.

1193
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:53,229
They haven't found anything.

1194
01:02:53,264 --> 01:02:54,731
All right.

1195
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:56,732
Are you off now, Miss Davis?

1196
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,235
Yes, sir. My watch ends at seven o'clock.

1197
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,238
I seem to have a devil of a lot of work
to do.

1198
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:04,239
Do you think you could stay an hour
and help me out?

1199
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:06,241
Of course, sir. I have a dinner date,...

1200
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:08,242
...but that's not until nine o'clock.

1201
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,244
Good. Let me have the latest
information...

1202
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,246
...on the available of aircraft
in Force H.

1203
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:13,746
Aye-aye, sir.

1204
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,248
"Coastal command will activate
two crossover air patrols.

1205
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:19,251
The northern-most will cover
possible enemy courses...

1206
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,253
...from Brest to La Rochelle.

1207
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,745
The southern-most
will cover La Rochelle
to Cape Finisterre."

1208
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:27,758
Good. Now, if you'll coordinate that
with Coastal Command,...

1209
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,761
...I'll get on with the business
of Force H...

1210
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:33,262
...then you can run along
and enjoy your dinner date.

1211
01:03:33,297 --> 01:03:36,266
What, at half past one in the morning, sir?

1212
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:38,061
Oh, I'm sorry.

1213
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,499
I had no idea what time it was.

1214
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:42,434
By the way, Miss Davis.

1215
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:44,404
I'd like to make arrangements...

1216
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:46,599
...for you to work with me full-time,...

1217
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:48,505
...if you think you could face it.

1218
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,510
What I had in mind...

1219
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,240
...was to make you off your
present duties and make you my assistant.

1220
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:56,908
I appreciate you thinking of me, sir.

1221
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:00,246
I need someone who's intelligent
and dependable.

1222
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,412
Quite honestly, someone like yourself.

1223
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:05,251
Well... What do you say?

1224
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:08,324
I don't know quite what to say, sir.

1225
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:11,326
I... I'd make an effort not to be so rude...

1226
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,124
...as I have been in the past,...

1227
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,130
...if that's what's bothering you.

1228
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,131
It isn't anything like that.

1229
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:20,462
If you want to say no,
please say so.

1230
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:22,131
Well, you see...

1231
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,299
Director of Operations.

1232
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,366
One moment, please, sir.

1233
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:36,643
It's Captain Farnum... Casualty Section.

1234
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:03,768
Hello, Richard. Yes?

1235
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,929
What sort of bad news?

1236
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:15,278
Is there no other information?

1237
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,780
I see.

1238
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,284
Yes. I appreciate your telling me.

1239
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,944
Thank you, Richard.

1240
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:36,790
My son's missing.

1241
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,228
His plane ran out of fuel...

1242
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,926
...and failed to return.

1243
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,229
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1244
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:45,236
There's a good chance...

1245
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,237
...he'll be picked up.

1246
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:49,033
You were picked up.

1247
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,768
When I got out of hospital,...

1248
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:55,301
...all I could think about
was getting back to London.

1249
01:05:55,345 --> 01:05:57,973
I wanted to see my wife.

1250
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,379
I took a taxi from Waterloo.

1251
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:03,782
As I drove into Welbeck Place,...

1252
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:06,787
...everything looked so familiar.

1253
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:11,315
Every house was just as I remembered it.

1254
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,953
Every house except mine.

1255
01:06:17,363 --> 01:06:20,821
There was a large
black hole in the ground...

1256
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,800
...where my house had been.

1257
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:26,269
Uh... Where my wife had been?

1258
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:35,275
I didn't think it was possible
to feel such pain.

1259
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:38,312
I know.

1260
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,474
I've been through it myself, and I know.

1261
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,745
I swore that night I'd never again...

1262
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:47,788
...get emotionally attached
to a human being...

1263
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:50,289
...as long as I lived...

1264
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:53,292
...but I made one mistake.

1265
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:55,293
I forgot about...

1266
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:57,386
...I forgot about my son.

1267
01:06:57,496 --> 01:07:00,260
You can't avoid pain
by fencing yourself off.

1268
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:03,094
Sometimes you need
the help of other people...

1269
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,758
...more than anything else.

1270
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:08,202
But you have to let them get
close enough to help.

1271
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:10,272
I don't want any help.

1272
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:13,308
I found when I was deeply troubled...

1273
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:16,310
...that I needed people very badly.

1274
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:18,312
People want to be needed.

1275
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:19,938
I found that out, too.

1276
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:21,538
We're in business again.

1277
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:24,777
<i>Bismarck's</i> been spotted
by a Catalina flying boat,...

1278
01:07:24,852 --> 01:07:26,319
...headed for Brest.

1279
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:28,343
Your hunch was right, sir.

1280
01:07:28,387 --> 01:07:29,854
Excuse me.

1281
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:31,856
Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me...

1282
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,858
...a new job, to be his assistant.

1283
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:36,052
I'd like very much to take it.

1284
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,219
<i>I hope you'll have no objection.</i>

1285
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:40,924
Jonathan, what have you
done to that girl?

1286
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,761
She's just been offered
a marvelous opportunity...

1287
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:46,130
...to go to America.
It means sure promotion.

1288
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:49,263
Now she's turning all that down
just to stay here with you.

1289
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,270
I don't understand it.

1290
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:55,775
Here's the situation.
The flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1291
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:57,777
and has been shadowing ever since...

1292
01:07:57,878 --> 01:07:59,140
...using cloud cover.

1293
01:07:59,213 --> 01:08:00,771
Jonathan.

1294
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,781
I'm sorry, sir.

1295
01:08:02,882 --> 01:08:04,782
You were saying...

1296
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,283
...the flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1297
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:09,286
and has been shadowing ever since...

1298
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:10,786
...using cloud cover.

1299
01:08:10,888 --> 01:08:13,118
<i>From time to time, <i>Bismarck</i> has put up...</i>

1300
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,953
<i>...very heavy anti-aircraft fire.</i>

1301
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,303
By now, the British know where we are.

1302
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,304
They'll send out everything they have.

1303
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:34,805
We can sink anything they send out.

1304
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:36,808
What was your latest fuel report?

1305
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,741
We've lost about 200 tons...

1306
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,745
...from the tanks that were damaged.

1307
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:42,246
We have 35 percent left.

1308
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:44,248
That is more than enough.

1309
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:46,249
I want to check the plot.

1310
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:48,750
- Becker.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep me informed about the fuel situation.

1311
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,176
I will, sir.

1312
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,586
I've requested air cover
from the <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1313
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:55,624
How soon can we expect
them to be with us?

1314
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,626
Shore-based aircraft can operate...

1315
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,128
...approximately that far
from the coast, sir.

1316
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,129
We will arrive at that point...

1317
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:03,596
...about dawn tomorrow.

1318
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:05,633
What about <i>King George</i> and <i>Rodney?</i>

1319
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,634
What is their position now?

1320
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:09,669
Based on reports from Group West,...

1321
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,136
...I have them plotted...

1322
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:13,673
...200 miles to the north of us, sir.

1323
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:15,138
That is good.

1324
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:17,675
They cannot possibly overtake us now.

1325
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:20,679
A day or so in Brest to make repairs...

1326
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:23,976
...and then we come out again
with our tanks full.

1327
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:28,644
Also, Lindemann... I have an idea.

1328
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:32,677
Suppose <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> came out with us.

1329
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:36,179
We would be the most powerful
fleet that ever sailed.

1330
01:09:36,224 --> 01:09:39,091
Nothing in the world could touch us.

1331
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:40,924
<i>Excuse me, sir. Personal signal...</i>

1332
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:42,587
...for the fleet commander.

1333
01:09:42,663 --> 01:09:44,096
Thank you, Mueller.

1334
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,101
"Best wishes on your birthday."

1335
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,602
Look.

1336
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:54,764
Adolf Hitler.

1337
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,109
This is a great honor.

1338
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:03,113
<i>Yes, please. Right.</i>

1339
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,113
Here are the fuel consumption reports...

1340
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,115
...for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney,</i> sir,...

1341
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:09,617
...as close as I can calculate them.

1342
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:11,620
- Don't look too good, do they?
- No, sir.

1343
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:14,178
They're 140 miles astern of <i>Bismarck.</i>

1344
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,225
<i>Can they steam at full speed
long enough to overtake her?</i>

1345
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,226
If they did, sir, they wouldn't
have enough fuel to get home.

1346
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:23,628
Sir.

1347
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,633
By daylight tomorrow, <i>Bismarck</i> will be...

1348
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:30,635
...in range of German air cover.

1349
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,637
They'll send out the whole <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1350
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:34,638
And a line of U-boats.

1351
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:37,140
We have to slow her down by tonight...

1352
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:39,072
...so Home Fleet can overtake her...

1353
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:41,075
...before she gets into friendly waters.

1354
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,578
Well, <i>Renown</i> and <i>Sheffield</i> can't do it.

1355
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:45,580
That leaves <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1356
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,583
Ten hours of daylight left.

1357
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,117
Call it nine and a half.

1358
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:54,121
There's time to get off
one air strike anyway.

1359
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,622
With luck, they might get off two.

1360
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,123
Yes, sir.

1361
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:01,126
We'd better get in touch with <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1362
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,101
Your torpedoes have been fitted
with the new magnetic exploders,...

1363
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:13,104
...so you should get very good results.

1364
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,763
You have <i>Bismarck's</i> position,...

1365
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:16,271
...course, and speed.

1366
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:19,570
She's now 24 miles away,
bearing 183 degrees.

1367
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,610
You can't mistake her.
She's all by herself,
so make your attack immediately.

1368
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,612
Oh, there's just one final word.

1369
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:26,614
The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern.

1370
01:11:26,647 --> 01:11:30,105
Unless you stop <i>Bismarck</i> today,
they'll never catch up her.

1371
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:33,243
<i>It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day.</i>

1372
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:51,532
The <i>Sheffield's</i> been detached
from the flagship, sir.

1373
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:54,537
She was ordered to close
<i>Bismarck</i> and shadow her.

1374
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:56,037
How long ago?

1375
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,038
This was sent an hour and a half ago, sir.

1376
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,539
An hour and a half?

1377
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,542
It wasn't decoded immediately, sir,...

1378
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,543
...because it wasn't addressed to us.

1379
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,545
We just happened to pick it up, sir.

1380
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,547
Our pilots have orders to attack...

1381
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,548
...any ship alone in that area.

1382
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:12,049
Send a message to all aircraft.

1383
01:12:12,117 --> 01:12:13,709
"Look out for <i>Sheffield.</i>"

1384
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,051
Send it in plain language
immediately.

1385
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,554
Aye-aye, sir.

1386
01:12:17,622 --> 01:12:19,988
Bit of a cockup somewhere.

1387
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,870
It's the <i>Bismarck,</i> all right!

1388
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,545
It's all right. They're ours... Swordfish.

1389
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,051
Sounds as if they're going to fly
right over us, sir.

1390
01:12:53,117 --> 01:12:55,551
They're using our position
to get their bearings.

1391
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,054
I can see them now, sir. There they are.

1392
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:01,112
They're attacking us!

1393
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,260
Full ahead both! Hard aport!

1394
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:08,956
All guns, hold your fire!

1395
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,893
Torpedo exploded
as it hit the water, sir.

1396
01:13:17,472 --> 01:13:18,962
There's another one.

1397
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:26,443
They're exploding short.
What's the matter?

1398
01:13:26,512 --> 01:13:28,639
It's those damn magnetic exploders.

1399
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,274
Here comes one that didn't explode, sir.

1400
01:13:35,352 --> 01:13:36,683
Hard astarboard.

1401
01:13:36,753 --> 01:13:38,118
<i>Hard astarboard.</i>

1402
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:47,784
That was the <i>Sheffield,</i> sir...
It just came through from the carrier.

1403
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:49,796
Signal the other aircraft.

1404
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:52,697
Tell them to break off the attack.

1405
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,290
Wheel amidships.

1406
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,800
<i>Wheel amidships, sir.</i>

1407
01:14:07,879 --> 01:14:10,313
We all feel the same
about what's happened...

1408
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,439
...so there's no point in discussing it.

1409
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:15,349
Let's just say we've learned
a very important lesson...

1410
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,851
...which may well prove
a blessing in disguise.

1411
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,514
All right, let's get on with the job.

1412
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,853
There's still enough light
for one more attack.

1413
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,687
Think you're up to it?

1414
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,726
Yes, but what about
those magnetic exploders?

1415
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:28,194
They're being changed at this moment.

1416
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,231
We'll go back to contact exploders on torpedoes.

1417
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,856
Keep your seats, gentlemen.

1418
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:38,131
I have a message here
from the Commander-in-Chief.

1419
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:41,297
"Unless the enemy's speed
has been reduced by midnight,...

1420
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:44,831
...<i>King George V</i> will
have to abandon the chase...

1421
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:46,842
...and turn back for refueling."

1422
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:49,846
There's no need to tell you
what that means.

1423
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:52,040
This is our last chance, gentlemen.

1424
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:55,811
I suggest you go below
and get something to eat.

1425
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,853
You'll be taking off at 1830.

1426
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:27,775
Skipper! Ship bearing green 4-5.

1427
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,380
This is it, boys! Come on, let's go!

1428
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:50,491
Hard astarboard!

1429
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:24,187
Where was that?

1430
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:26,190
The hit was on the amidships.
No serious damage, sir.

1431
01:16:26,258 --> 01:16:27,691
Thank you, Mueller.

1432
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,886
Tell damage control to keep us informed.

1433
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:38,298
Hard astarboard!

1434
01:17:00,118 --> 01:17:01,915
Hard aport!

1435
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,828
Captain.

1436
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,160
Hit in the steering compartment, sir.

1437
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,200
Put your rudder amidships.

1438
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,495
Rudder amidships.

1439
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:29,170
The rudder won't move, sir.

1440
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,815
<i>What ships are these?</i>

1441
01:17:39,884 --> 01:17:41,317
<i>The 4th Destroyer Flotilla, sir.</i>

1442
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:42,818
<i>They're getting close.</i>

1443
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:46,345
We picked up two
very peculiar reports
from Coastal Command...

1444
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:47,822
...following the attack by <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1445
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,858
The first one says,
"<i>Bismarck</i> circling."

1446
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,360
The second one reads,
"<i>Bismarck</i> heading nor-norwest."

1447
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:55,262
Nor-norwest?
But that's impossible, sir.

1448
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,766
<i>She'd be headed straight
for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney.</i></i>

1449
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,266
<i>Sounds like faulty identification.</i>

1450
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:01,767
<i>Wrong ship, most likely.</i>

1451
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,665
<i>Sir? Signal from <i>Sheffield.</i></i>

1452
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,329
They made contact with <i>Bismarck.</i>

1453
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:07,100
She's steering north at 10 knots.

1454
01:18:08,907 --> 01:18:10,340
That's incredible!

1455
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:11,841
It must be <i>Bismarck.</i>

1456
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,504
But what's she doing on that course...

1457
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:17,343
...and at a speed of 10 knots?

1458
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,882
Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet,...

1459
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:20,849
...and damaged.

1460
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,350
Propellers?

1461
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:23,850
Could be, sir.

1462
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,353
Or rudder, and can't maneuver.

1463
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:27,889
We've got a chance now, sir.

1464
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:29,891
I think we've got a chance.

1465
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:43,495
Yes.

1466
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,298
It's the <i>Bismarck,</i> all right.

1467
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:46,804
Yeoman?

1468
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:48,305
Sir?

1469
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:51,309
Make to <i>Solent.</i>
"Intend to attack with torpedoes.

1470
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,808
Ships turning to port.

1471
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,309
Firing range 4,000 yards."

1472
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:55,744
Aye-aye, sir.

1473
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:57,110
Bring on 30 knots.

1474
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,477
<i>300 revolutions.</i>

1475
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:01,812
<i>From Captain D, sir.</i>

1476
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:03,818
<i>"Speed 30 knots.</i>

1477
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:06,320
<i>Turning to port to fire torpedoes.</i>

1478
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:07,821
<i>Firing range 4,000 yards."</i>

1479
01:19:07,889 --> 01:19:10,449
Good! Then it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1480
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:17,364
Damage control.

1481
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:18,364
Damage control.

1482
01:19:18,431 --> 01:19:20,797
Damage control, sir.

1483
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,356
Captain speaking.

1484
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,902
I want a report on that rudder.

1485
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,904
The divers are down now.

1486
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,599
They'll be up in a moment, sir.

1487
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:39,345
Range 6,000 yards, sir.

1488
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,310
Yes.

1489
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:45,818
I see.

1490
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:48,321
It's impossible
to free the rudder, sir.

1491
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,822
It was jammed too badly
by the explosion.

1492
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,324
How early in the morning...

1493
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:55,827
...can you put a couple
of divers over the side?

1494
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,328
At first light, sir,...

1495
01:19:57,396 --> 01:19:59,830
...about five o'clock if the sea is not too rough.

1496
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:01,832
I do not care about the sea.

1497
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:04,333
I was thinking about the men, sir.

1498
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,834
Sir, from fleet commander.

1499
01:20:05,904 --> 01:20:07,337
Thank you.

1500
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,841
Ah.

1501
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,345
"Group West is sending out three
seagoing tugs.

1502
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,347
All submarines
in the area have been ordered...

1503
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,349
...to concentrate at this point."

1504
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:23,848
That is good.

1505
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,282
That is very good.

1506
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,881
Range 5,000.

1507
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,092
Attention all hands.

1508
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:36,854
Attention all hands.

1509
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:40,294
This is the fleet commander.

1510
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:41,797
We are having some difficulty...

1511
01:20:41,865 --> 01:20:44,459
...repairing the damage
to our steering gear,...

1512
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:48,333
...but I assure you
there is no cause for alarm.

1513
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:50,100
4,500 yards, sir.

1514
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:52,139
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1515
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:53,936
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1516
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,602
By morning, we will be in good hands.

1517
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,668
And if the British Home Fleet...

1518
01:20:58,712 --> 01:21:00,680
...should be foolish enough to appear,...

1519
01:21:00,714 --> 01:21:03,239
...they will be torpedoed by U-boats.

1520
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:05,284
<i>Meanwhile, let me remind you...</i>

1521
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,376
<i>...that our guns have not been damaged.</i>

1522
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:10,718
This is still the most
powerful ship afloat.

1523
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:15,224
I have in my hand a message...

1524
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,816
...addressed to the entire crew.

1525
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:19,987
<i>"All Germany is at your side.</i>

1526
01:21:20,063 --> 01:21:24,227
Your gallantry is
an inspiration to our people.

1527
01:21:24,299 --> 01:21:27,234
You will forever occupy
a place of honour...

1528
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:32,261
...in the history of the Third Reich."

1529
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,502
This message is signed by the fuehrer.

1530
01:21:35,575 --> 01:21:37,042
Range 4,000 yards, sir.

1531
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,204
Port 20, fire when the sights come on.

1532
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,183
Two enemy destroyers on port bow, sir.

1533
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,718
Alarm port.

1534
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:49,912
Alarm port, sir!

1535
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:00,361
Range 4,000, bearing 300 degrees.

1536
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,861
Guns ready port.

1537
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,363
<i>Guns ready port, sir.</i>

1538
01:22:03,431 --> 01:22:05,194
Illuminate with star shell.

1539
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:08,031
<i>Illuminate with star shell.</i>

1540
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,473
They've seen us!

1541
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,338
Now we're for it!

1542
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:19,707
20 degrees to go, sir.

1543
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:21,076
Fire!

1544
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,712
All torpedoes gone, sir.

1545
01:22:27,784 --> 01:22:30,252
Let's get out of here. Hard aport.

1546
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:31,481
Open fire main armament.

1547
01:22:39,394 --> 01:22:40,827
Torpedo hit amidship, sir.

1548
01:22:40,896 --> 01:22:42,727
Good man!

1549
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:43,785
Fire!

1550
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:54,933
She's got the <i>Solent.</i>

1551
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:56,702
Good shooting, Lindemann.

1552
01:22:56,774 --> 01:22:58,207
- Cease firing!
- <i>Cease firing!</i>

1553
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:01,711
One hit on the armor
near the forward boiling room.

1554
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,213
The damage can be repaired...

1555
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,544
...and it won't affect our speed, sir.

1556
01:23:05,615 --> 01:23:06,877
<i>Thank you.</i>

1557
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,144
That is good.

1558
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,220
Destroyers are still shadowing, sir.

1559
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,724
They have orders
to keep track of the <i>Bismarck...</i>

1560
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,224
...until the Home Fleet closes.

1561
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:20,225
They claim three hits with torpedoes.

1562
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:22,227
It hasn't even slowed her down.

1563
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,730
What about the reports
of enemy submarines?

1564
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:26,230
A.C.N.S. says these have been confirmed.

1565
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,731
I've notified the Commander-in-Chief.

1566
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,098
What is C-in-C doing about it?

1567
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:31,636
He hasn't altered his plans.

1568
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,637
I'd like to send him a signal...

1569
01:23:33,705 --> 01:23:34,967
...telling him to be careful,...

1570
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:36,370
...but I'm sure he'd resent it.

1571
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:39,998
Cigarette?

1572
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:41,406
No, thank you, sir.

1573
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:43,503
- I'll be here if you want me.
- Very good, sir.

1574
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,309
Shepard?

1575
01:23:45,381 --> 01:23:47,815
Sorry about your son.

1576
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:51,745
Yes, sir.

1577
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,025
<i>Captain Shepard, sir.</i>

1578
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,525
Hmm?

1579
01:24:01,593 --> 01:24:03,026
Excuse me, sir.

1580
01:24:03,096 --> 01:24:04,529
I took in an operational signal...

1581
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:06,531
...from one of the destroyers
shadowing the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1582
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:09,567
They picked up three flyers
in a rubber boat.

1583
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,034
It must have been over an hour ago, sir,...

1584
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,037
...so I couldn't get off in time.

1585
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,537
I heard about your son...

1586
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:17,539
...so I thought I'd tell you.

1587
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:20,041
It might not be him at all, sir,...

1588
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,076
...but you never know.

1589
01:24:22,143 --> 01:24:24,077
Thank you.

1590
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,080
Thank you very much.

1591
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,586
Oh, sir, A.C.N.S. has been calling you, sir.

1592
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,088
Says it's very urgent.

1593
01:24:57,606 --> 01:24:59,540
Assistant chief of staff, please.

1594
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:01,041
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1595
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,374
Hello, sir. Shepard here.

1596
01:25:05,446 --> 01:25:07,744
Jonathan, I've got
the most marvelous news.

1597
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:09,407
<i>Your son is alive and well.</i>

1598
01:25:09,482 --> 01:25:11,416
He's been picked up by a destroyer.

1599
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:15,052
<i>This is absolutely official.</i>

1600
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:17,555
<i>Farnum got the message half an hour ago.</i>

1601
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:21,555
Jonathan?

1602
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,923
Don't you understand, Jonathan?

1603
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:26,088
<i>Your son is alive and well.</i>

1604
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:33,691
What did he say, sir?

1605
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:35,133
He didn't say anything.

1606
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,199
Well, if you'll you excuse me, sir.

1607
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,566
Signal for Captain Shepard.

1608
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,067
I'll take it.

1609
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:15,567
It's from <i>King George V.</i>

1610
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:17,068
What is it?

1611
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,571
They've sighted <i>Bismarck,</i> sir.

1612
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,073
Oh! Here comes the main event.

1613
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,574
Urgent signal for you, sir.

1614
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,241
<i>Right gun load.</i>

1615
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,885
Right gun second half charge.

1616
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:39,514
<i>Right gun loading.</i>

1617
01:26:48,563 --> 01:26:51,498
How much fuel have we got left?

1618
01:26:51,565 --> 01:26:55,023
We shall have to
break off action in two hours, sir.

1619
01:26:57,604 --> 01:26:59,037
Main armament ready.

1620
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:01,164
<i>Enemy speed 10 knots.</i>

1621
01:27:01,241 --> 01:27:03,766
<i>Course 3-5-0, sir.</i>

1622
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,214
They outnumber us 2 to 1...

1623
01:27:12,282 --> 01:27:15,217
...and we can't do more than 10 knots.

1624
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:17,219
What are you saying, Captain?

1625
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:19,549
This is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1626
01:27:19,622 --> 01:27:22,056
<i>We still have all our guns...</i>

1627
01:27:22,124 --> 01:27:24,592
...and any moment now
the <i>Luftwaffe</i> will arrive.

1628
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:47,199
Open fire, Captain.

1629
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:48,539
Open fire.

1630
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:49,772
<i>Fire!</i>

1631
01:27:58,619 --> 01:27:59,847
Open fire!

1632
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:01,513
Shoot!

1633
01:28:03,758 --> 01:28:05,623
Fire!

1634
01:28:07,626 --> 01:28:08,991
Shoot!

1635
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:14,563
She's hit.

1636
01:28:14,632 --> 01:28:15,963
Good shooting, Captain.

1637
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,332
Shoot!

1638
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:35,607
Shoot!

1639
01:29:00,237 --> 01:29:02,432
Shoot!

1640
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:29,490
Aah!

1641
01:29:47,608 --> 01:29:49,542
<i>Signal from <i>King George V,</i> sir.</i>

1642
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,043
"<i>Bismarck</i> on fire amidships.

1643
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:53,545
Two of her turrets out of action."

1644
01:29:53,613 --> 01:29:55,171
All right.

1645
01:29:57,117 --> 01:30:00,575
I thought I'd be
cheering, sir, at this point,...

1646
01:30:00,618 --> 01:30:02,552
...but I'm afraid I can't.

1647
01:30:02,621 --> 01:30:05,488
<i>I know. It's always that way.</i>

1648
01:30:05,556 --> 01:30:07,615
Shoot!

1649
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,961
Hoffman, we have to flood
the forward magazines.

1650
01:30:22,036 --> 01:30:23,469
Get the men out.

1651
01:30:23,538 --> 01:30:25,472
They can't, sir.
They're trapped by the fire.

1652
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,974
There's too much
danger of blowing up. Flood them!

1653
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:29,474
What about the men?

1654
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:30,975
I gave an order, Hoffman!

1655
01:30:31,044 --> 01:30:32,477
Flood the forward magazines!

1656
01:30:33,879 --> 01:30:37,076
Flood the forward magazines!

1657
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,468
<i>Our fuel state is critical, sir.</i>

1658
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:03,469
Get closer. Get closer.

1659
01:31:03,502 --> 01:31:05,436
We've got to finish her now!

1660
01:31:05,505 --> 01:31:07,200
Shoot!

1661
01:31:15,547 --> 01:31:17,981
All the guns out of action...

1662
01:31:18,048 --> 01:31:19,481
...except "A" turret, sir.

1663
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:21,984
Where is your <i>Luftwaffe</i> now, sir?

1664
01:31:22,052 --> 01:31:23,485
I don't understand it.

1665
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:24,985
The fuehrer promised...

1666
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:26,487
...He promised to send help.

1667
01:31:28,558 --> 01:31:30,992
<i>They will be along any minute now.</i>

1668
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:32,491
You will see.

1669
01:31:49,508 --> 01:31:51,442
He was proud of that.

1670
01:31:57,415 --> 01:31:59,440
"Tomorrow, the world."

1671
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,449
He said that only yesterday.

1672
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:03,451
He was right.

1673
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,681
Heil Hitler.

1674
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,467
Sir, all the officers
on the bridge are dead.

1675
01:32:20,532 --> 01:32:23,968
I have to tell you
that all the guns are finished!

1676
01:32:26,537 --> 01:32:29,472
Finished? Tell the men to abandon ship!

1677
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,973
Abandon ship!

1678
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:32,634
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

1679
01:32:50,457 --> 01:32:54,450
<i>We've got her! She's finished!</i>

1680
01:32:54,526 --> 01:32:56,960
The <i>Dorsetshire</i> has joined us, sir.

1681
01:32:57,029 --> 01:32:59,361
Tell <i>Dorsetshire</i>
to finish her off with torpedoes.

1682
01:32:59,432 --> 01:33:00,865
<i>Aye-aye, sir.</i>

1683
01:33:00,933 --> 01:33:02,457
- Cease firing!
- <i>Cease firing!</i>

1684
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:00,502
She's going.

1685
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:02,014
- Yeoman.
- Sir?

1686
01:34:02,082 --> 01:34:05,051
Tell <i>Dorsetshire</i>
to stand by to pick up survivors.

1687
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,516
Aye-aye, sir.

1688
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:04,030
Jenkins?

1689
01:35:04,099 --> 01:35:05,532
Sir?

1690
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,033
Make to admiralty.
"<i>Bismarck</i> is sunk.

1691
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:08,535
Fleet is returning to Scapa Flow."

1692
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,535
Aye-aye, sir.

1693
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:17,541
Well, gentlemen...

1694
01:35:17,609 --> 01:35:19,304
...let's go home.

1695
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,553
Shepard?

1696
01:35:32,622 --> 01:35:34,055
Sir?

1697
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:37,560
The prime minister would like to see us
tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock.

1698
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:39,559
I assume you can make yourself
available.

1699
01:35:39,627 --> 01:35:40,992
Certainly, sir.

1700
01:35:41,062 --> 01:35:42,996
But why should he want to see me?

1701
01:35:43,065 --> 01:35:46,501
I don't know. He seems to think you
had something to do with this operation.

1702
01:35:46,567 --> 01:35:48,000
Thank you, sir.

1703
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:49,501
Well done, Jonathan.

1704
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:51,003
Thank you, sir.

1705
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:52,502
- Petty Officer Williams?
- Sir.

1706
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:55,006
Take a message for
Telegraphist Brown in the sick bay.

1707
01:35:55,074 --> 01:35:56,507
Tell him the <i>Bismarck's</i> been sunk.

1708
01:35:56,576 --> 01:35:58,009
Aye-aye, sir.

1709
01:35:58,075 --> 01:36:00,509
May I offer my congratulations, too,
sir?

1710
01:36:00,578 --> 01:36:02,011
Thank you.

1711
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,013
Uh, take a message.

1712
01:36:04,082 --> 01:36:06,516
"Request pleasure of the company...

1713
01:36:06,616 --> 01:36:08,049
...of Second Officer Anne Davis...

1714
01:36:08,117 --> 01:36:09,550
...at dinner."

1715
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,553
Accepted.

1716
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:15,055
Good. Now, I know you must be very tired,...

1717
01:36:15,123 --> 01:36:16,556
...and it's nearly nine o'clock,...

1718
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,058
...but how about tonight?

1719
01:36:18,126 --> 01:36:19,559
Right now.

1720
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:20,854
I'll get my things.

1721
01:36:39,143 --> 01:36:41,509
Great heavens.
It's nine o'clock in the morning,...

1722
01:36:41,577 --> 01:36:44,011
...and I asked you out to dinner.

1723
01:36:44,081 --> 01:36:47,050
We could always make it breakfast,
couldn't we?

1724
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:48,515
Why not?

1725
01:36:50,085 --> 01:36:52,019
You know, Harvey, these boys worry me.

1726
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:53,520
Four stripes on his arm...

1727
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:56,079
...and he don't even know
what time of day it is.
