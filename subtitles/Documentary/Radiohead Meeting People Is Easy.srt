2
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,277
Hey.

3
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,492
- Working on a Saturday, too?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,243
I'm sorry about the check last month.
I just...

5
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,747
- No worries, man. We're square.
- Thanks.

6
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,626
- Have a good weekend.
- Alright, bud. Take care.

7
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,507
Joanie?

8
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,848
John Jr.

9
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,994
Hello?

10
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,758
Surprise!

11
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,629
- God damn it!
- John.

12
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,218
What the...

13
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,473
- I'm sorry, just go to your room. Sorry, guys.
- It's okay, it's okay, guys.

14
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,434
Sorry.

15
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,900
Surprise.

16
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,984
I really don't want to talk about it.

17
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,236
You didn't sell the house, did you?

18
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,994
No, I didn't.

19
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,293
I did everything I could and
these people, they...

20
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,917
You know, they just got cold feet.

21
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,253
John, what are we gonna do?

22
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,337
Well, I'm gonna get another listing,
and then I'll sell that house.

23
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,929
And it'll be fine, just like
we always are.

24
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,136
Is that so?

25
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,019
- You know, Joanie, I wish that...
- What?

26
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,273
I wish you could put yourself
in my shoes for a minute

27
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,854
to see the kind of pressure
that I'm under.

28
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,112
You know, what I go through every day.

29
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,447
What is that gonna solve, John?

30
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,279
I'm doing everything I can. Okay?

31
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,784
- What if that's not enough?
- Well, it has to be.

32
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,797
I'm gonna take the kids out.

33
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,512
Honey, we can't afford it.

34
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,144
Air is still free, John,
last time I checked.

35
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,355
I'm taking them to the park.

36
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,318
Bye.

37
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,070
Hey, monkeys, let's go.
Let's go to the park.

38
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,884
Coming.

39
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,302
Yeah?

40
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,264
Name's Richie. My car stalled right
in front of your house.

41
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:08,397
Okay. What, you need to call AAA?
You need a phone?

42
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:14,784
Well, you know, you don't get a welcome
like that nowadays. But, no, no.

43
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,867
- Okay, well.
- Think maybe you can give me a push?

44
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,667
Yeah, let's do it.

45
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,040
Nice day, huh?

46
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,039
Sure is.

47
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,709
A day like today will make you forget
there's bad things in the world.

48
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,669
Yeah, it's a nice day.

49
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,016
The gas gets a little low in the carb
sometimes, like running on fumes.

50
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,681
The gas station's down that way.

51
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,765
Man, you should see this baby go.
Just smoke anything on the road.

52
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,352
- Yeah, just let me know when, alright?
- Alright. Push as hard as you can.

53
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,608
Yeah, just let me know when.

54
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,485
Ready?

55
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,151
- No.
- Ready?

56
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,864
Alright, yeah. Go on, push!

57
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,916
Yeah, I'm doing the best I can.
Give me a second.

58
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,370
Come on! Push as hard as you can.
You got some muscle on you, boy.

59
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,539
Okay, just tell me when.

60
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,133
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.

61
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,508
- Come on, push faster!
- What are you waiting for?

62
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,180
Push faster!

63
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,516
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.

64
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,396
Jesus, hey, you know what you're doing?

65
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,400
God fucking damn it!

66
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,944
Fuck!

67
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,329
What the fuck are you thinking?

68
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,251
I could teach you a few things about
common fucking courtesy.

69
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,172
- Is that right?
- Yeah, fucking leg, Jesus!

70
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,858
- Better get you to a hospital.
- I'm fine.

71
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,652
Don't look fine to me.

72
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,574
- Let me give you a hand.
- Man, I don't need any help.

73
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,614
I beg to differ.

74
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,282
- Come on. Easy does it.
- Fuck.

75
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,580
Look, I got you.

76
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,629
You and me, we're in this thing together.

77
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,681
I'm okay.

78
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,980
- Like riding on air, right?
- Yeah.

79
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,902
- That's what I'm saying.
- Easy, Ricky.

80
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,530
- Richie.
- Rich.

81
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,741
- Wow, you really got hurt.
- Yeah.

82
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,998
- It's all my fault.
- Not your fault.

83
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,996
- You're not blaming me?
- No.

84
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,453
Well, never would have happened if I
hadn't come knocking on your door.

85
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,335
Hey, listen, I wanted to help you. Okay?

86
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,795
What is it you do, if you
don't mind me asking?

87
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,423
I'm in real estate.

88
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,175
- Used to be.
- What do you mean "used to be"?

89
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,518
Hey, hey, but I bet you glad it happened,
alright?

90
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,436
It's "customer's always right." That sort
of shit don't suit a man like you.

91
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,233
It is a racket.

92
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,945
Everything's a racket.

93
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,112
Should I kick it in?

94
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,369
- I thought you said you were out of gas.
- No, no, no. I just said I stalled.

95
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,292
- Okay.
- Let me give her some juice.

96
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:03,338
Now that, my friend, is 450 cubic inches
of American metal.

97
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,467
Four 4-barrel carburettors
spitting mad fuel!

98
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,553
This bitch is a fuck beast!

99
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,186
Yeah, this baby can fly!

100
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,981
You're...watch it, watch it, watch it.

101
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,400
See this guy? This truck, man!

102
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,315
Fuck, watch out!

103
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,613
Who says American cars can't handle?

104
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,329
Those brakes can be a
little loose sometimes.

105
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,755
- Scary as hell.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,545
Look like you were having fun, though.

107
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,794
I don't know if fun's the word, but, yeah,

108
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,345
I guess I needed it a little more
than I thought I did.

109
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,345
- Think I didn't know that?
- Yeah?

110
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,933
There's a looker.

111
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,893
Yeah, she is.

112
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,065
Pity. She ain't got a clue.

113
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,610
Seems nice enough.

114
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,575
I don't know, baby.

115
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,072
Fill her up?

116
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,039
Stupid bitch.

117
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,296
What'd she do to you?

118
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,542
Chewing gum at work, that's
just fucking rude.

119
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,801
- Nice house you got there, John.
- Thanks.

120
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,007
Bet you got a nice-looking wife.

121
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,559
Maybe a couple of nice kids.

122
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,721
I say, you got kids?

123
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,977
Yeah. I got a girl and a boy.

124
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,860
Not me, John. Never cared much
for pets, either.

125
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,983
- So, how do you know my name?
- You told me.

126
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,489
Yeah?

127
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,200
Only needed 2 gallons.

128
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,381
- Got some ID?
- What for?

129
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,346
- It's just normal procedure.
- No, no, no. No, John. John, I got this.

130
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,928
So, what's the problem? You
don't like the way I look?

131
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,058
Hey, you know.

132
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,356
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

133
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,226
Pay my manager inside, sir.

134
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,005
You know what? You and me,

135
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,799
- We're a lot alike, you know?
- That so?

136
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,547
- Yeah, that's so.
- Yeah.

137
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,341
- You'll see. Just pay attention.
- Okay.

138
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,922
You'll find out what I'm saying.

139
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,933
Let me take care of this. I'll take you
straight to the hospital.

140
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,055
Got it.

141
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,441
- Everything go okay?
- All good.

142
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,735
Got the gas for free on account
of that cunt.

143
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,533
The hospital's the other way.

144
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,736
Yeah, you said yourself you're
not hurt that bad.

145
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,869
You know, man, I'm fine.
Just take me home.

146
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,792
Let me buy you a drink. It's the least I
could do for what I put you through.

147
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,211
It's the middle of the day.

148
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,544
Come on, you've been drinking already.
I can smell it. Scotch.

149
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,626
It's my drink. Come on, man,
one more won't kill you.

150
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,986
- So, you can't park there.
- I just did.

151
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,320
- You need a permit, that's the thing.
- You're hurt, right?

152
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,245
Ain't that the definition
of handicap spot?

153
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,031
Just act like a cripple.
We'll be alright.

154
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,459
Okay.

155
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,288
Where you going?

156
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,086
How about that drink?

157
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,714
If you don't want to have a drink with me,
all you got to do is say so.

158
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,671
- Look.
- You know...

159
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,475
I know, I can behave a little
strangely sometimes.

160
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,598
Just because I'm a little different
doesn't make me a bad guy.

161
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,142
I don't think you're a bad guy.
It's just...

162
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,649
I just gotta get home.
That's all. My wife.

163
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,060
Wife.

164
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,075
Careful.

165
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,288
The damn shitter's broken again.
Plumber's late as usual.

166
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,050
Yeah, I'm always waiting
for the muffin man.

167
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:40,549
Well, you just get your tight little trucker
ass on in here before I cream my shorts.

168
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,850
And that's a big 10-4.

169
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,513
- Sorry, hi.
- How can I help you?

170
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,099
May I borrow your phone? I just
gotta make a quick call.

171
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,650
Pay phone's at the bar.

172
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,321
Okay, well, it's...I just gotta
call my wife, it's local.

173
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,148
Pay phone's at the bar.

174
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,405
Okay, so, give me your cheapest phone,
I guess.

175
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,786
Last one. Cash or credit?

176
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,877
Look, I'm really sorry. I don't
have my wallet.

177
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,876
- If you just let me use the phone...
- Pay phone's at the bar.

178
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,092
Lady, I haven't seen a pay phone in years.

179
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,544
- I'm just trying to...
- Not my problem.

180
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,177
Okay, look, I'll just...

181
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,811
You know, Rhonda, for somebody
in the communications business,

182
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,362
I think you could afford to learn
a little common courtesy.

183
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,027
Fuck you.

184
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,534
- How's that for common courtesy?
- Alright.

185
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,536
Grow some balls.

186
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,225
Actually, I'd just like to use your phone,
if that's okay.

187
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,528
Jesus Christ!

188
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,781
- John. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Trevor.

189
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,614
I just need to use the phone. Sorry.

190
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,160
You look like hell.

191
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,451
Yeah, I've been better.

192
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,917
You know, listen, John, it wasn't
all my decision.

193
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,627
So, whose was it?

194
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,387
Corporate downsizing.

195
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,094
You just weren't pulling your weight.

196
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,733
Walk away, John, like you always do.

197
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,938
Come on, man.

198
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,815
Johnny, come on and have
a drink with us, man.

199
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,861
- My man. I knew you'd be back.
- Yeah.

200
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,908
There ain't no harm in being polite.

201
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,492
Don't worry about me.

202
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,576
You should worry about the fat ass across
the street at the phone store.

203
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,129
Yeah, or my jack-off boss who
just spilled a beer on me.

204
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,251
I'm fine, though.

205
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,754
You mean the bastard who canned you?
He's here?

206
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,587
Yeah, yeah, that's the very guy.
He's here.

207
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,303
He's holding court.

208
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,178
I say we go in there and kick
his head inside out.

209
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,931
I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
It's fine.

210
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,307
Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call...

211
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,477
Let me loan you a quarter.
It's the least I can do.

212
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,856
I'm fine. It's okay. Yeah,
my name's John Felton.

213
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,278
Hi, it's the Feltons. We're not home,
so leave a message.

214
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,907
You should never tell people you ain't
home on your answering machine.

215
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,074
Yeah?

216
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,245
So what exactly is your interest
in my business?

217
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,617
I'm just trying to help you out here.

218
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,998
That's what they're looking for. Suckers.

219
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,087
Well, thanks for the warning.

220
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,991
John?

221
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,580
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I'm just leaving.

222
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,498
Come on, one drink.

223
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,669
No, actually, I gotta call Joanie.
I need a ride. I gotta get home.

224
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,710
I can drive you home.

225
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,265
I just gotta use the pisser first.
I'll meet you outside.

226
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,634
Yeah, I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

227
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,058
- What? Taking a piss?
- No, that's not what I meant.

228
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,641
- John, it's just a ride home.
- Okay.

229
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,376
Gotcha.

230
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,172
You okay?

231
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,171
- Yeah.
- What's...

232
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,427
Could have sworn I parked
right around here.

233
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,601
- You don't know where you...
- There it is.

234
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,193
So, Tammy, are you okay to drive?

235
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,407
I'm a teensy bit wasted,
so maybe you'd better.

236
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,608
Thanks.

237
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,204
You know I broke up with Trevor
to be with you.

238
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,872
Yeah, and he fired me.

239
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,116
Is that what you care about?

240
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,043
Look, Tammy.

241
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,376
You know, what we did was wrong, okay?

242
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,378
- For who?
- My family.

243
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,209
Fucking cowards.

244
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,637
You know, that stupid fat ass wouldn't
let me make a phone call neither.

245
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,964
Said she didn't like the way I looked,

246
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,846
and she kept stuffing doughnuts
down her blabber box.

247
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,849
It looked like she'd been locked in
a doughnut shop her whole life.

248
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,975
Yeah.

249
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,729
Man gets his dream car towed by the pigs,

250
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,566
gets treated like a criminal
by an incompetent...

251
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,401
- Where's your common courtesy?
- Exactly.

252
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,824
- I should have listened to you.
- I know.

253
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,744
You tried to warn me about
these parking rules.

254
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,904
But what a car though, right?

255
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,499
Pure American muscle. You could
feel that power, right?

256
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,621
I sure did.

257
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,953
You feel it right between your legs.

258
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,796
- It's a muscle car.
- Is that so?

259
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,086
Yeah, that is so, Missy. Right, John?

260
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,089
- It's a great car, I'll give you that.
- You know what I'm talking about.

261
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,920
- John, you know this guy?
- Yeah, we...

262
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,677
I really, really hate to ask this,

263
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,633
because of everything we've
already been through,

264
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,219
but you think you can give me
a ride to the impound?

265
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,605
I don't think so, 'cause I gotta
get home and...

266
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,604
I gotta get home, too!

267
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,399
I'm just like you, John. I'm stranded.

268
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,855
- I don't even know where the impound is.
- I do!

269
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,692
I do! It's not far. Scout's honor.

270
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,657
See, it's not my car, and I gotta
take her home.

271
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,623
Name's Richie. I would
really appreciate it.

272
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,337
- Well, if John will vouch for you.
- Course he'll vouch for me!

273
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,883
- Right, John?
- Yeah, I mean, we met earlier...

274
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,007
- So, how do you two know each other?
- We work together.

275
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,805
- Work buddies?
- We work together.

276
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,019
- Wanna give him a ride?
- It's fine. We'll give you a ride.

277
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,310
Yeah, we'd better hurry. Looks like rain.

278
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,388
- So, we close?
- Think so.

279
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,227
You think so?

280
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,098
- Man, you even know where it is?
- Yeah.

281
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,441
'Cause we've been driving
for like a half hour,

282
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,519
and you just said it was a couple miles.

283
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,567
You're a slow driver, John.

284
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,361
Look, so,

285
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,987
- You two really work together?
- That's right.

286
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,868
John tell you he got fired today?

287
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,038
Canned, like a sardine.

288
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,792
Bet you didn't even tell your wife,
did you, John?

289
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,418
I told my wife.

290
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,128
The truth hurts.

291
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,051
Do you want me to pull over?
Would you like to walk?

292
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,800
Ain't your car. From what I could see,

293
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,972
Tammy here makes all the rules.

294
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,805
- Don't be a cocktease, baby.
- Hey.

295
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,512
Nothing like a pair of blue balls
to drive a man insane.

296
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,689
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

297
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,563
She made her own bed, John. That she did.

298
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:54,734
And what's that supposed to mean?

299
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,653
Well, honey, you dig a hole
in a man's life,

300
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,731
you can't expect not to be buried in it.

301
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,909
- What did you tell him, John?
- I didn't tell him anything.

302
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,616
Pull over. You're a piece of shit.

303
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,787
What is this guy doing?

304
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,748
Don't speed up, slow down.
Drive him crazy.

305
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,834
Man, would you shut up?
I'm gonna pull over.

306
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,041
You're a pussy, John. Can't stand up
for yourself.

307
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,468
- Just let me handle this, okay?
- Yeah, boss.

308
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,052
- Shit, goddamn!
- Bastard's wrecking my car, John!

309
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,725
I didn't do anything. I don't know
what this guy's...

310
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,097
You must have done something.

311
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,474
- Maybe he saw you leaving town.
- So what?

312
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,816
You said you picked a fight with that
fat ass in the phone store, right?

313
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,028
You want to fight, then fight!

314
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,649
What did you do to that woman back there?

315
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,486
Just gave her a piece of my mind.
Same as you. No different.

316
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,950
Except I didn't tuck it between my legs.

317
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,042
John, what are you doing? Slow down.
Just let him go.

318
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,470
- Write his plate down, he can't do that.
- That's the spirit.

319
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,644
- Let's rip his fucking throat out.
- Just let me handle it.

320
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,900
- That guy was trying to kill us, John.
- Just stay in the car.

321
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,697
Don't do something stupid.

322
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,616
Fuck's this guy's problem?

323
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,320
Hey! You could have killed us!

324
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,373
You ran us right off the road!

325
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,787
What the fuck?

326
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,288
You could have killed us, do you
understand that?

327
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,040
Wait, wait, stop the car! Let me out.

328
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,260
Look! I don't want any problems! It's
just that was really dangerous.

329
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,883
Saw you drive off after
you killed my girl.

330
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,804
Look, this is all a mistake.
Just take it easy.

331
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:47,972
Watch it!

332
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,889
Fuck.

333
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,896
Fucking bull's-eye!

334
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,655
Come on, get in the car.
Let's go. Come on.

335
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,156
You can't do anything for him now.
We killed him.

336
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,655
- We didn't do this. You did this!
- I saved your life.

337
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:16,744
We are in this together, John, like
I said, whether you like it or not.

338
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,874
Tammy, where's your phone?

339
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,085
It's in my bag.

340
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,462
He's alive, but just barely!

341
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,005
So, what do you owe him?

342
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,136
- It's not in here! Where's her phone?
- How would I know?

343
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,309
Because you took it out of her bag
when you were in the back seat!

344
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,352
- Now, where is it?
- You expect me to admit to that?

345
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,021
Hey, don't mistake my kindness
for weakness. I'm warning you!

346
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,144
Really?

347
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,105
What should I mistake it for?

348
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,163
I really smashed him.

349
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,955
Like a stupid fucking cockroach.

350
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,706
Come on, let's go. Come on!

351
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,753
We gotta find a phone.

352
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,481
We got nine murders, and I
don't even have a witness.

353
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,893
Somebody has to have seen something.

354
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,821
- Find me that somebody.
- Sir.

355
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,151
Found somebody.

356
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,202
John, turn here.

357
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,226
Hello? Is anyone home?

358
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,948
Fuck.

359
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,905
- Why don't you just kick it in?
- Just take it easy.

360
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,991
You're the one that said the guy
needs an ambulance.

361
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,498
Hello? Look, there's been an emergency,
a man's hurt very badly.

362
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,170
We need to use your phone.

363
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,470
Hello, is anyone home?

364
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,141
Hello?

365
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,497
Richie.

366
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,643
Is anybody home?

367
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,692
Look. It's half full. Help yourself.

368
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,862
It's called stealing.

369
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,283
It's called a drink.

370
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,238
Look, now, you do what you want.

371
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,541
I just want you to know, I'm
telling the police everything.

372
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,501
That's it.

373
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,478
Is there somebody home?

374
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,651
- Ma'am? Hello? Hello?
- Is this the police?

375
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,074
Look, there's been a terrible accident.

376
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,536
Sir, I would like for you to leave
the premises right now.

377
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,998
Listen, we need an ambulance. Highway 111,
20 miles east of town,

378
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,076
there's a guy dying on the road.

379
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,166
We do have a squad car on the way.

380
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,667
- Sir, sir, please identify yourself.
- My name's John Felton.

381
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,755
I'm fine, but there's a man dying
in the middle of 111.

382
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,680
Send an ambulance right...

383
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,445
Is anybody home?

384
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,446
Is anybody here?

385
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,585
Hello?

386
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,944
You're still here? Call the cops?

387
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,123
Is she okay?

388
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,285
She who?

389
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,331
There was a woman on the phone. Alright?

390
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,300
I heard the woman on the phone.
I know there's somebody here.

391
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,843
Is she okay?

392
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:05,518
You know, I bet your place is
a lot more tidy than this trap.

393
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,853
Maybe you could invite me over sometime.

394
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,444
Sure, why not? Yeah.

395
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:21,822
You know I would behave
like a guest in your house.

396
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,702
Maybe I could come over for dinner when
this is all over, and we can have a laugh.

397
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,121
Yeah, that sounds good.

398
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,208
"That sounds good, Richie.
Sure, yeah, come over."

399
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,629
- Look, don't talk down to me, John.
- I'm not. I'm not.

400
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,631
You'd better say what you mean

401
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,214
and stop barking out a bunch
of meaningless phrases.

402
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,516
I mean it. I do.

403
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,971
Okay, I mean it.

404
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,223
Alright? It's okay.

405
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,734
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Good.

406
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm gonna hold you to that.

407
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,236
No.

408
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,991
Listen, you'd be our guest. Okay?

409
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,576
Just please...

410
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,425
There's nothing you can do for her now.

411
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,562
You turned your back on things
your whole life, John.

412
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,771
One more time won't kill you. Will it?

413
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,780
Listen, you told me that there
was nobody in the house.

414
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,611
You knew better than that.

415
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,531
You gotta trust your own
best instincts, John.

416
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,533
If you don't, you're not gonna make it.

417
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,032
It's up to you.

418
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,823
- It's okay.
- What's going on?

419
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,322
It's alright. We're gonna get
out of here, alright?

420
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,658
Stick with me, okay? Okay.

421
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,290
I have a shotgun! And I know
how to use it.

422
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,253
Kid.

423
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,171
Don't do that!

424
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,750
Put it down, alright? We're
just trying to help.

425
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,590
Where's my grandma?

426
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,803
- She...
- Richie, don't.

427
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,851
- She ain't here.
- Back the fuck up!

428
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,021
She wanted me to tell you something.

429
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,643
- Richie.
- Something

430
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,858
she wanted you to know.

431
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,980
You see that field over there?

432
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,197
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance to run.

433
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,321
But your grandma wanted me to tell you

434
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,709
I'm gonna be coming after you. Get.

435
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,587
Richie, please, just stop. It's
not a game any more.

436
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,002
- Please, just...
- What makes you think so?

437
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,177
Please, I'm just asking you, that's all.
I'm just asking.

438
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,886
Okay.

439
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,934
- I'm sorry, please just...
- John, let's go. He's not gonna hurt us.

440
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,432
You think not?

441
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,192
I'm not afraid of you.

442
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,853
You ought to be.

443
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,530
Jesus, Tammy. Tammy.

444
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,731
Jesus.

445
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,566
Tammy.

446
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,739
Tammy. Tammy.

447
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,416
I bet she does things your wife
would never do.

448
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,415
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, what's your wife like, John?

449
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,383
If you don't tell me, I'll
find out for myself.

450
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,544
She means everything to me.

451
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,133
Right.

452
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,051
But I'm sure there's times you'd
like to kill her though, right?

453
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,226
No.

454
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,640
But I'd kill anybody that
tried to hurt her.

455
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,810
I understand that.

456
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,575
Things that I hate most are things that

457
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,154
resemble my own faults.

458
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,539
I hate bad manners.

459
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:43,916
I hate people that don't
give common courtesy.

460
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,917
Hypocrites and cowards.
That's all they are.

461
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,390
If you try anything, I will beat her

462
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,096
till she bleeds brains out of her eyes.
You understand?

463
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,524
Why don't you just let us go, alright?

464
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,439
We won't say a word. It'll be
like it never happened.

465
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,822
But it is happening, John.

466
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,818
It's happening right now.

467
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:21,784
Stop trying to figure me out.
I got my own ideas.

468
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,851
Tammy, you gotta get up right now.
You gotta get out of here, okay?

469
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,187
He's gonna try and kill that cop.
I gotta save him. Come on.

470
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,192
Here. Just go wait for me on this field.

471
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,274
Look, you just gotta keep moving
towards town, okay?

472
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,402
No, no, I don't want to leave you.

473
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,575
Look, you'll be faster without me, okay?

474
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,907
That's not what I mean.

475
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,377
Look, go, okay? Just go.

476
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,611
This used to be a nice neighborhood.

477
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,910
Nice dog, still.

478
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,333
Rich folks been acting all crazy lately.

479
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,078
Like they ain't never been broke before.

480
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,664
So, what else have we got on this guy?

481
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:37,302
Mr fucking Rogers is what we've got.
Good job, wife, two kids.

482
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,257
Real estate agent.

483
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,590
Real family man.

484
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:47,437
Well, being a real family man doesn't
automatically make you a nice guy.

485
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,811
43, I got another 28.

486
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,647
I guess not.

487
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,899
My name's John Felton. I'm fine,

488
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,656
but there's a man dying in the middle
of 111. Send an ambulance right...

489
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,330
- Is that his voice?
- Yes.

490
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,954
Do you mind?

491
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,544
Absolutely.

492
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,010
If you were guessing, where
do you think he's going?

493
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,138
Is there someone else he would turn to?

494
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,650
- Another woman?
- I apologize for asking.

495
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,319
I don't think so.

496
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,322
At least not any more.

497
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,738
Got a name? A phone number?

498
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,826
Sorry.

499
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:50,370
He left a bar with a young girl.
Brown hair. Busty.

500
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,539
Ring any bells?

501
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,708
If my husband was at a bar with
some slut with huge tits,

502
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,714
why would he call me collect
from a pay phone?

503
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,670
To spread the good news?

504
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,887
Does he generally drink in
the middle of the day?

505
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,680
No, not usually.

506
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,017
Sir, please be careful. Thank you.

507
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,894
Do you know someone who
would have picked him up?

508
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,734
All our friends are gone.

509
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:26,403
Fired, relocated or just up and quit.

510
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,244
Tough times. People losing everything.

511
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,121
Holding on by their teeth.

512
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,245
And that's why John and I stand together
to stay strong.

513
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,837
If nobody picked him up, why is his car
still in the driveway?

514
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,589
Wallet, cell phone, keys left
by the front door.

515
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,254
Glass of whiskey broken
on your kitchen floor?

516
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,723
You guys have an argument?

517
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,098
He was disappointed he didn't sell
a house today.

518
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,438
He ever hurt you

519
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,145
when he gets disappointed?

520
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:58,813
No.

521
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,281
You think he really killed those people?

522
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,609
Could have.

523
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,786
Do you need someplace to stay?

524
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,955
We have a beautiful home.

525
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,084
Do you think she's hiding something?

526
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,300
We could always look on the bright side.

527
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,131
She's ignorant?

528
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,680
People snap sometimes. No good reason.

529
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:36,306
You take your average, ordinary person and
rob him of everything he cares about.

530
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,682
Then, people snap.

531
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,507
So, now, you want my help.

532
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,015
Well, well, well, right back
where we started.

533
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:02,059
Except you look a little worse for wear,
if you don't mind me saying.

534
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,236
I got this instinct, John.

535
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:09,024
There's just no denying it. It's
a God-given attribute, really.

536
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,529
I am always right

537
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,408
when it comes to people who
are trying to do me harm.

538
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,408
- I'm not trying to harm you.
- Well, if you are,

539
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,035
I just want you to know,

540
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,213
you ain't seen nothing yet.

541
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:30,424
I know what you did. I know
you hurt those people.

542
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,597
The world hurts people, John.

543
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,096
I come in after the hurt.

544
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,222
All I do is kill people who
are already dead.

545
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,899
Come on. Get up.

546
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,609
Get up.

547
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,279
And no funny stuff this time, see?

548
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,448
'Cause I'll fill you full of holes, pal.

549
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,619
Now, there's a roadblock up ahead.

550
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,752
You're gonna drive through it,
just like you're one of them.

551
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,801
Get to driving.

552
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,655
Go back to the house. Talk to his wife.

553
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,662
What am I looking for exactly?

554
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,161
Just break her.

555
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,687
- This will never work.
- Course it will.

556
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,891
People like that just want to be fooled.
It's their nature.

557
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,359
Once you know that,
you can take anything you want from them.

558
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:14,524
- People like what?
- The herd, John. The herd.

559
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,696
Turn the siren on.

560
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,493
There's a barricade.

561
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,253
Stick your hand out the window and wave.

562
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,542
Do it.

563
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,881
Big grin on. Big, silly grin.

564
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,774
Just a bunch of cowards hiding behind
an army of badges and guns.

565
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,734
- It's not gonna work again.
- No, probably won't.

566
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,573
We're marked men. We can't
go on hiding forever.

567
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,610
- You ready to fight?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

568
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,782
I told you, John.

569
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,406
We're in this together, whether
you like it or not.

570
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,246
This is it for me. I'm finished.

571
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,755
Stop the car. Stop the fucking car!

572
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,429
You think you're better than me, that it?

573
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,308
I'm the only person that hadn't
given up on you, John.

574
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,426
Yeah?

575
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,433
That's why you got a gun
pointed at my face?

576
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,771
Take it from me! Be a fucking man!

577
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,321
John, what is it you really want?

578
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,466
Is it that hard for you to say
what you want?

579
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,422
Just say it.

580
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:07,432
I want you to leave me alone, okay?

581
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,812
Is that all?

582
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,151
- I want out of this car.
- Alright.

583
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,605
- Get out.
- So you shoot me in the back?

584
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,533
I could have killed you
100 times over today.

585
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,162
If you want to believe the lie,
then go on living your life.

586
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,825
The world is evil, John.

587
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,498
It's just plain evil.

588
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,630
That's the truth.

589
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,963
You done?

590
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,347
If you are.

591
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,816
How hard was that?

592
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,889
One more thing.

593
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,605
Remember you invited me to your house
to meet your wife?

594
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,559
I'll tell Joanie you said hi.

595
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,521
How do you know my wife's name?

596
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:44,404
Hope she cooks good. I do love
a good home-cooked meal.

597
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:46,948
Stop!

598
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,911
John Jr.

599
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:56,913
Not now.

600
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,418
You sure you don't want
to speak in private?

601
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,257
Is there some reason we should?

602
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,644
You know your husband got fired today?

603
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,765
No, I didn't.

604
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,645
But you do know he was having an affair?

605
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,656
I believe I said as much.

606
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,911
You're also aware you have a
life insurance policy on him?

607
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,782
And he's got one on me, too.

608
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,751
Ma'am...

609
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,132
You ever want your husband gone?

610
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,971
Excuse Mommy for one second.

611
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:53,302
You think you can walk into my home
and disrespect me and my family?

612
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,061
I will take you down so quick,

613
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,435
your undies will be strung around
your neck like a doily.

614
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,601
And if you think I'm going to
suddenly burst into tears

615
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,812
and tell you all my deepest,
darkest secrets,

616
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,488
well, then you're just lame-brained enough

617
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,074
to think that you know anything
about my family.

618
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,323
And God knows, from looking at you,

619
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:15,621
you don't have a clue about what
it means to be a good wife.

620
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,328
You're right. I don't know.

621
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,459
Don't placate me.

622
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,715
I will slap that smug look off
your face before you can get
your fat ass off my couch.

623
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:31,841
Now, I don't know how a functionally
retarded person got a police badge,

624
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,260
but unless you've come to arrest me,

625
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,845
you can waddle out of here
with the rest of the birds.

626
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,352
And make sure John gets home
safe and sound.

627
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,365
And go ahead and grab a Girl Scout cookie
on your way out.

628
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,204
They're fat free.

629
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,541
Just curious,

630
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,714
why'd you let your daughter listen
and cover your son's ears?

631
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:12,924
So she knows how to defend herself, and
he remembers how to speak to a lady.

632
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,401
Well, shit.

633
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,078
Excuse me.

634
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,763
Give me a hand! I need help!

635
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,898
I need some help please!

636
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,442
Come on, please, I need some help!
They're gonna kill my wife!

637
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,907
Come on, I need some help!
Do you understand that?

638
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,699
Freeze!

639
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,741
On the ground, hurry. Don't move,
don't move.

640
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,959
You are wasting time.

641
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,631
How's that?

642
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,975
This guy is gonna kill my family.
Do you get that?

643
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,432
- Richie?
- Yeah.

644
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,432
The black man in a suit with a fedora?

645
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:48,152
Driving an old muscle car in the suburbs
that no one else has seen?

646
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,482
Look, sir, you don't get it.

647
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,906
You've got to get somebody to my house
and get my family out of there!

648
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,570
My deputy was just at your house.
Your wife doesn't want to leave.

649
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,744
Sir...

650
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:03,918
- She doesn't understand what's going on.
- Understand what?

651
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:09,502
This guy, he can kill anyone. Okay?

652
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,133
Then, why didn't he kill you?

653
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,680
I don't know.

654
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,682
He wants something from me, alright?
I don't know what.

655
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,014
He was pretending like he was my friend.

656
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,689
Pretending?

657
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,027
Look, I'll do whatever you want, alright?

658
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,614
Just get somebody to my house
and get my family out.

659
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,779
- Tell the truth.
- Look, God...

660
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,031
I've been fucking telling you the truth!

661
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,489
I don't believe your truth.

662
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,703
Well, then, I should talk
to somebody else,

663
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,785
'cause you don't know what
the fuck's going on.

664
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,121
The witnesses all ID you and you alone.

665
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,207
He was following me.

666
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,214
Your house is being foreclosed.

667
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,552
Bank account's empty. Savings worthless.

668
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,642
You're past due on all your credit cards.

669
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,892
And you got fired from your job today.
What does that sound like to you?

670
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,227
Bad luck?

671
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,651
Sounds like motive to me.

672
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,030
I put myself in your shoes and, well,

673
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,909
can't say it makes any sense,

674
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,905
but sometimes a man just gives up.

675
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,747
Well, I have faith.

676
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,244
You're an unfortunate man.

677
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:32,748
Sir, do you honestly believe
that I made this all up?

678
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,508
You think I killed all those people
because I'm in debt

679
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,677
and I lost my fucking job?

680
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,880
Look, just find Tammy.

681
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,682
Turn left.

682
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,012
Him.

683
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,893
Definitely the guy.

684
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,271
I do get paid for this, right?

685
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,570
Straight forward.

686
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,283
It's like they can see me there.

687
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,240
Are you sure they can't see me?

688
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,955
- Get him out of here.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,791
Come on, you did great.

690
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,132
She ripped you a new one.

691
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,961
You knew I was gonna get it handed to me?

692
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,931
I also knew you were gonna get something.

693
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,476
She's having an affair.

694
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,645
Contractor working on the house.

695
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,983
- Building a pool.
- Pool guy?

696
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,815
Got him shitting bricks
in the holding cell.

697
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,658
- Anything smart come out of his mouth?
- Not a peep.

698
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,323
It's hard to tell what he's not guilty of.

699
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,782
Makes like a chicken. Then he clucks.

700
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:50,834
Keep on plucking.

701
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,968
You think he knew his wife was
screwing the pool guy?

702
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,357
Too bad.

703
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,356
Looks like a nice enough guy.

704
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,329
We don't see much of your type here.

705
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,007
Go figure.

706
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:42,211
Cup of Joe?

707
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,966
Hungry?

708
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,150
- Let me get the pork chops, please.
- Sure.

709
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,565
You want limas or fries with that?

710
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,147
I'd like both.

711
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,066
Hope you bread those chops nice.

712
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,245
Can I get extra gravy with that?

713
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:14,747
Yes, sir.

714
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,264
You got a problem?

715
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,770
You see this uniform?

716
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,946
Respect the uniform.

717
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:48,236
Or I'm gonna have to take something
from you that I can't give back.

718
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,195
You understand?

719
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,372
You know what your partner wants?

720
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,287
On the house, of course.

721
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,792
Come here, sweetheart.

722
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,802
Come on, come closer. Come on.

723
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,324
Suspect has been shot,
suspect has been shot.

724
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,072
I repeat, please send backup
and paramedics immediately.

725
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,424
John! Oh, my God.

726
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,009
- Who is this?
- Tammy Strate.

727
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,093
- Tammy?
- Yes.

728
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,268
Are you okay?

729
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,017
She corroborated everything he said,
Richie and all.

730
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,271
You, come with me.

731
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,611
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- It's not him.

732
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,613
Everything he said, she backs it up.

733
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,862
Doesn't mean it's true, goddamn it!

734
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,871
Local just reported 3 more murders, and
he said he shot and killed the perp.

735
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,197
Positive ID?

736
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:20,202
"Tall, thin black man" was the description
the officer gave on the radio.

737
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,045
Get over there now. I'll deal with this.

738
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,892
What is she doing here?

739
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,558
I'm just trying to help.

740
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:48,488
I think you've done enough
for this family.

741
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,238
We brought your wife as you requested.

742
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,664
I'm sorry.

743
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,092
Go say hi to Daddy.

744
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:23,102
Richie was just reported shot and killed
by an officer a few minutes ago.

745
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:27,903
Just to be safe, there will be
police officers at your house
for the next few days

746
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,405
until we complete our investigation.

747
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,775
What, to keep an eye on me?

748
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,448
My men will be protecting your family.

749
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,290
Maybe he was right, what he said
about you guys.

750
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,120
What's that?

751
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,460
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, ma'am.

752
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,421
You guys ready?

753
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,769
Sweetheart, come here.

754
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,316
That your doggie?

755
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,820
Show him to me.

756
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:14,982
Come closer.

757
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,324
Closer.

758
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,455
He a good dog?

759
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,503
He bites.

760
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,501
That's as good as anything, I guess.

761
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,497
They dump you out here all night, too?

762
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,050
No, no, I gotta go in and
talk to the old bag.

763
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,248
You kids done?

764
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,664
Just stop, I'm gonna get you.

765
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,588
Come on. Why don't you guys go up?
Come on.

766
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,215
I'll come tuck you in.

767
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,271
Is everything okay?

768
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,024
You must be Joanie.

769
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:25,281
Yes, come in. You're getting wet.

770
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,114
And who is that?

771
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:31,036
These are our 2 children. This is Sam,
and this is John Jr.

772
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,370
Say hello to the nice officer.

773
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,706
- Boy's name for a girl?
- Yes.

774
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,301
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

775
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,890
Okay.

776
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,561
Come in.

777
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,907
Where's the local cop that called it in?

778
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,500
This guy's a real cop.

779
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,128
- How do you know?
- Come on.

780
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,123
It's not Richie.

781
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,504
Police Academy, class of 1968.

782
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,431
Lieutenant.

783
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,854
Our guys in front of the house
are not picking up.

784
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:42,149
Scotch on the rocks, that's what
John drinks, too. Here you go.

785
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,368
Guys, let's go. Bed. Come on.

786
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,660
Hey, your dad's a hero. How about that?

787
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,336
Again?

788
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,462
I didn't know you boys
could drink on duty.

789
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,555
I won't tell if you don't.

790
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,905
You cooking something? Smells good.

791
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:27,869
Pork chops.

792
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,407
They're John's favorite. I thought
he might need a good meal.

793
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,248
John explain what happened?

794
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,544
No, no, but it's, you know, it's been
all over the news, so...

795
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,255
Hey, maybe you can sell the story
to the papers.

796
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,433
You know, people love
a good tale like that.

797
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:56,265
I would hate to profit off of somebody
else's tragedy, so...

798
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,610
That's why I'm here, actually.

799
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,792
You're making me nervous, Officer...

800
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,623
Stevens.

801
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,467
I should go check on the oven real quick.
Would you excuse me?

802
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,552
I'll be right back.

803
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,026
- Jesus Christ.
- What's wrong?

804
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,398
What is it?

805
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,703
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

806
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,511
Get up there and check on them right now.
Get up there, do it!

807
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,928
What are you worried about, John?
I was just up there with them.

808
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,605
- Joanie!
- I tucked them in myself.

809
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:48,274
Little angels, and you got two of them.

810
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,610
You are so lucky.

811
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,029
- They're okay.
- Stay there.

812
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,205
Just so you know, the police are out
there. Do you understand that?

813
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,633
You still underestimate me after
all we've been through.

814
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,969
Well, that's just plain dumb.

815
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:19,096
Question for you, John, is do you hate
me more than you love your family?

816
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,228
In the time it takes you to
go outside and get help,

817
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,805
I could destroy your whole family.

818
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,152
Listen, what is it that you want from us?

819
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:38,661
You invited me over for dinner,
to meet your wife. I'm here.

820
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,666
Now, treat me like a guest.

821
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,004
You know I'm not going
to let you harm them.

822
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,090
You know that?

823
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,633
So, you're gonna have to kill me.

824
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:56,178
I told you, I don't make deals.
I don't have to.

825
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,677
I'm giving you a choice, John.

826
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,426
That's more than I'm giving anyone else,

827
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,761
including your wife and kids.

828
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,600
- I told you to stay upstairs.
- What the hell is going on?

829
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,861
How about those pork chops, Joanie?
I'm starving.

830
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,110
I'm afraid I don't care for your tone.

831
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,991
Makes two of us.

832
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,038
Get out of my house. Now.

833
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:23,702
John?

834
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,544
Tell this person to get out of our house
and leave us alone, now.

835
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,002
John.

836
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,047
He's our guest, right?

837
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,719
Our guest.

838
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,635
We're gonna treat you that way.

839
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:42,807
Okay?

840
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,148
Again?

841
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,188
Help him.

842
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,710
Doesn't John do most of the cooking
around here?

843
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,591
- He likes to cook.
- Good thing, too,

844
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:23,091
'cause this is cooked badly.

845
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,391
Poorly. It's cooked poorly.

846
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,108
Could you sharpen this for me?
It's kind of dull.

847
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:44,078
- The knife's sharp enough.
- Not mine.

848
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,804
You remember the first time
you saw me today, John?

849
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,727
- At the front door?
- No. In your rearview mirror.

850
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,726
When I blasted by, you were sitting in
the driveway twiddling your thumbs,

851
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,728
thinking about your meaningless life.

852
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,810
You were talking to that guy who worked...

853
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,154
The guy who works on your house?

854
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,573
How do you think I know that?

855
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,824
'Cause you've been following me.

856
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:29,991
But why? Why would I follow you, John?

857
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:33,248
Come on. Put it together, John.

858
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:37,419
Put it together. Why did I knock
on your door today?

859
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,590
Perfect timing.

860
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,760
Joanie, get upstairs, get the kids
and get out of here!

861
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:46,307
Or better yet, sit down and listen
to what I have to say.

862
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:53,849
Now, John, why did I knock
on your door today?

863
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,861
Joanie, you want to tell him?

864
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,445
Why I knocked on your door today?

865
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:08,780
Or why the back door was left wide open?

866
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,207
Or why you took the kids and left
when he got home?

867
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,828
What is he talking about, John?

868
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,877
You both make me sick.

869
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:28,471
Sitting here like I'm the bad guy,
like I did something wrong.

870
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:37,058
- Tell him why, bitch!
- I have never seen you in my life!

871
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,901
Yeah, that's true.You did send
someone else to meet me.

872
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,327
- What's he talking about?
- I have no idea.

873
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:51,406
She does not love you, John.

874
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,369
She's a liar.

875
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,413
She's fucking someone else,
and she wants you dead!

876
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,254
- He's lying.
- She hired me to kill you.

877
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,591
I was supposed to drive you out in the
sticks, throw your body in a ditch...

878
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,013
- Oh, my God.
- But I didn't.

879
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,432
Because I saw something
in your eyes, John.

880
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:13,014
John, you can't believe this man.
You can't believe him.

881
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,936
She doesn't have the guts
to kill you herself.

882
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,021
- He's lying, you can't believe...
- I am no liar!

883
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,691
- I have no idea what he's talking about.
- John, you can vouch for me there.

884
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:20,767
No, you are lying!

885
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:24,113
I tell it the way I see it, and
I see it the way it is!

886
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,114
John, I love you.

887
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:27,859
That's right, kill her, John.

888
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,615
- John, I love you.
- Rip her fucking throat out!

889
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,704
Now, you got the instinct, just like me.

890
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:40,958
- Please don't do...
- Shut up!

891
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,382
Remember, she's cold-blooded.
Don't listen to her.

892
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,881
Don't listen to that bitch! Kill her!

893
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,211
- Kill that bitch!
- I love you!

894
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,478
Wait! Wait, stop! I'm not
going to hurt you.

895
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:00,641
Just give it to me.

896
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,394
Give it to me.

897
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,650
Come here, you motherfucker!

898
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,982
- Put it...
- You motherfucker!

899
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,156
Get out of here! Go!

900
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,627
Careful.

901
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,335
Jesus!

902
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:06,958
They're out back!

903
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,051
Watch my children.

904
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,417
Mr Felton.

905
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,924
We're gonna take your wife in
for more questioning.

906
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:39,641
On what evidence?

907
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,557
Your testimony, for starters.

908
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,264
Look...

909
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,604
I just told you what he said.
I didn't say I believed it.

910
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,654
What other explanation can you have?

911
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,954
She's my wife.

912
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,999
- What does he think he's doing?
- Something I never could.

913
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,379
Nice shot.

914
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,800
You know, smoking kills sperm cells.

915
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,467
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

916
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,351
Let's go get fat.

917
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:11,790
Everything's going to be okay,
isn't it, John?
