The live broadcast starts now.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,440
Come in everyone.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,640
- It's the nation's favourite food. - Yes, it is.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,540
(Yoon Min Soo is teaching people to sing better.)

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
That's it.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,550
- We are working together today. - Let's draw each other's portrait.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
- Do you mean a portrait? - Yes.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,180
(Yu Bin is getting a makeover from Jung Saem Mool.)

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
(The show starts now!)

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,740
(My Little Television)

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,380
(The day of MLT-20 live broadcast)

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,010
- Oh, my. - Hello.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,640
- Hello. - You know each other, right?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,740
- Yes, we've met. - Yes, we have met.

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,110
Well, you are not the type of person to say hello first.

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,540
Last week, I came last.

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,280
Why? It was because of Jo Young Gu, right?

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,340
Was it because I was away? I was in the United States.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,010
- Yes, I know. - You shouldn't have invited him on.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,210
- Anyway, for today's show... - Where's Seo Yu Ri?

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,180
- Did she go Suyuri? - Suyuri? You're funny.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,940
- Hello. - My goodness.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,240
Why are you so late?

24
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,440
It looks like she just came back from Suyuri.

25
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,110
(She quickly conceals her emotions.)

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,540
- Why do you keep doing that? - You came early.

27
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,640
- Were you sleeping somewhere? - I'm sorry I'm late.

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,040
Enough about me, let's talk about you Kim Gu Ra,

29
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,540
last week you tried to show...

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,210
the viewer something a little more highbrow...

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,850
- and it backfired. - Yes, I did.

32
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,380
Well, it was a difficult topic and...

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,940
Young Gu made it worse.

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,640
It was a nightmare, but today I'm going to do something more...

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,380
mainstream and accessable.

36
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Jung Saem Mool, this is your third appearance...

37
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,280
we are curious to know the identity of today's guest.

38
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,140
I do have a new guest coming on today.

39
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,310
Can't you tell us?

40
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,310
I can't tell you, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,010
It must be a very special guest.

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
Of course, it must be a very special person.

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,410
Does that mean Kim Hye Soo won't be coming on today?

44
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,040
She won't be coming on.

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,940
I really want to see Kim Hye Soo.

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
What do you want us to do about it?

47
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,740
Okay, I'm almost done.

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
- Do you know what it means? - We're ready.

49
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's go in.

50
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,540
(Who is the woman coming in with him?)

51
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
- Welcome. - Hello, Lee Mal Nyeon.

52
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,010
- Hello. - It's Yura.

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,540
He's Lee Mal Nyeon.

54
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,040
(Webtoon artist Lee Mal Nyeon and Girl's Day, Yura)

55
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,210
I am a webtoon artist, Lee Mal Nyeon.

56
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,210
I am Girl's Day member, Yura.

57
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,540
(Girl's Day debut six years ago in 2010.)

58
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,540
(They are a group that are both cute and sexy.)

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,210
(Yura gives energy to the group.)

60
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
(They will work together today.)

61
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,010
I think we should be looking at each other as we talk.

62
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,750
This feels like a formal interview.

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,340
Should I turn my chair a bit like this?

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
No, this is perfect.

65
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,250
Oh, really? Okay.

66
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,540
I just feel a little awkward.

67
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,410
I think we will be closer near the end of the show...

68
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,840
and when we feel comfortable that's when the show will end.

69
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,840
No, it's not going to end like that.

70
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,380
I am a professional singer...

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,250
but I like to draw in my spare time.

72
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,040
I thought it would be nice to show the viewers my hobby,

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
and that's why, I decided to be on today's show.

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,250
Please stay tuned to our channel.

75
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,640
Let's go!

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Let's go.

77
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
- Let's go. - Wow.

78
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
I've never done this gesture before.

79
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,240
(I've never done this gesture before.)

80
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,080
- Have you met her before? - Hello.

81
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,780
- Do you know who she is? - No, I don't.

82
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,180
I've seen you a few times before.

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,580
You told me last time you would take in me as your stepdaughter.

84
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,380
Did you really say that? Oh, goodness.

85
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,880
- I remember. - She is a member of Girl's Day.

86
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,180
That's right! She is a member of Girl's Day.

87
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
- Yes, she is. - My name is Yura.

88
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
- I know. - Welcome, Yura.

89
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,680
(A beautiful voice is coming from this waiting room.)

90
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Hello.

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
Hello.

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
It feels like I'm on my way to sing on "I Am a Singer".

93
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,280
(Yoon Min Soo, a singer with a soulful voice.)

94
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,080
Hello, I'm Yoon Min Soo from Vibe. Nice to meet you.

95
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,240
Most people still know me as Yoon Hu's father.

96
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,780
Older people still recognise me and greet me when they see me.

97
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,980
Yes, I'm mostly known as Yoon Hu's dad.

98
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Many people believe singing in the original key means you sing well.

99
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,880
But everyone has their own unique voice.

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
So I thought if I explained more about this,

101
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,340
the viewers would appreciate it.

102
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,080
Please stay tuned to my channel.

103
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,280
- There he is. - Hello.

104
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,080
- Welcome, Yoon Hu's dad. - Hello.

105
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,240
- Whose dad? - Is there anything that you know?

106
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,880
He's a singer.

107
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,180
- Yes, I'm a singer. - Are you really?

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,580
I'm the president of the Singers Association.

109
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,980
Haven't you heard of Vibe?

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,340
Haven't you heard of the song, "Drinking"?

111
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
- That was him? - Yes.

112
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,980
Former members of "Dad! Where Are We Going?", Ahn Jung Hwan and...

113
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,980
Kim Seong Ju, did a great job on our show last week.

114
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Do you feel more pressure because of them?

115
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,980
- I have my own area of expertise. - That's right.

116
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,180
You seem very calm, Yoon Min Soo.

117
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm very nervous right now.

118
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,280
Drink some soy sauce. It will help.

119
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,510
Did you say soy sauce?

120
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,540
He's the president of the Singers Association.

121
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,610
- Just imagine you're performing. - Yes, just enjoy it.

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,080
- Do you have anything more to say? - Yes, I do.

123
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,280
Goodness me, this is hard.

124
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,080
(Goodness me.)

125
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,680
We make a great team.

126
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
(Someone's knocking on the door.)

127
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,340
(A new guest shyly enters the room.)

128
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,440
- Welcome. - Hello.

129
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,740
(A rising star of Chungmuro, Han Ye Ri)

130
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,880
Hello, my name is Han Ye Ri and I'm an actress.

131
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,180
I starred in the films, "As One" and "Haemoo".

132
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
My name is Hong Mae.

133
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Hong Mae.

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
I also starred in the film "A Dramatic Night" last year.

135
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,580
Currently I'm acting in a popular drama, "Six Flying Dragons".

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,180
When I was a student of the Korea National University of Arts,

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,380
they were looking for dancers for a film.

138
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,680
So I volunteered for the part. That is how I first started acting.

139
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Now, here I am.

140
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,880
I want to show people that Korean dance can be...

141
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,180
fun. I want to help people understand more about...

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,550
Korean traditional dance and become proud of our heritage.

143
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,510
I also want to show people...

144
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,680
how passionate I am about Korean traditional dance.

145
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,050
You seem very calm. What's your real personality like?

146
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,380
I think I'm a very calm person.

147
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,380
What should I do? People might leave because I'm boring.

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,050
Please keep watching.

149
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,080
You're all dressed up in hanbok.

150
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,680
Is this related to what you're going to do today?

151
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,080
Yes, I'm here to teach the viewers about Korean dance.

152
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,240
- Do you remember Oh Jung Hae? - Yes, I do.

153
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,780
She starred in "Seopyeonje".

154
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,780
She reminds me of Oh Jung Hae. They are both good actresses, too.

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Thank you.

156
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
"Seopyeonje" is different.

157
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes, that film was about Korean traditional singing, not dancing.

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,980
- Well, they both wear hanbok. - I see.

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Thank you.

160
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,080
(Live broadcast starts in 25 minutes.)

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,510
(This is Han Ye Ri's room,)

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
(Han Ye Ri is warming up.)

163
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,080
(She can do Taekwondo too.)

164
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,680
(She leaves her room out of boredom and...)

165
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,580
(heads towards the Min Soo's room.)

166
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
This room feels like a recording studio.

167
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,080
(Next she visits Lee Mal Nyeon's room.)

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
(She visits their room.)

169
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,980
I wish I had a partner too!

170
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,410
Why don't you visit Kim Gu Ra's room?

171
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,880
(I don't want to!)

172
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,680
He might scold me if I do.

173
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
What kind of ramyun do you want?

174
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
(Kim Gu Ra is in charge of today's cooking channel.)

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,740
I'm very good at cooking ramyun.

176
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,180
Did you live in a boarding house?

177
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,180
If you want to enjoy the perfect ramyun,

178
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,280
you just need to follow the recipe.

179
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,880
The live broadcast hasn't even started. What's the rush?

180
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,780
By them time the live broadcast starts,

181
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,580
they can zoom in the ramyun while we're eating it.

182
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,510
Are you going to make a movie someday too?

183
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,640
Countdown for the beginning of live broadcast.

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,780
Take this.

185
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,340
In five,

186
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,780
- four, - Oh, goodness.

187
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
- three, - Hide your face.

188
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,780
and 2, 1.

189
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,080
MLT-20,

190
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,980
the live broadcast starts now.

191
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,180
(MLT-20, starting its transmission around the world)

192
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,440
(Yura and Lee Mal Nyeon's "Yoo and Nyeon")

193
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,880
Hello.

194
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,480
Hello.

195
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,880
Hi, everyone.

196
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,140
We are working together today.

197
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,480
It's an interesting combination, right?

198
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,780
I did mention once that it would be better...

199
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,680
- if Duk Dak E was my assistant. - Okay.

200
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm exhausted. I wish I had an assistant, so he can help me out.

201
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,680
- What I wanted was Duk Dak E. - Yes.

202
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,580
But they invited you instead.

203
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,880
- It feels like I'm your assistant. - Yes.

204
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,580
A viewer just wrote "Hello, Mal Dak E."

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,580
The name of our room, "You and Nyeon" is not a swear word.

206
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,880
- It's a combination of our names. - That's right.

207
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,880
- So in the Year of the Red Monkey, - Yes?

208
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,680
please watch "Yoo and Nyeon"!

209
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,140
"Yoo and Nyeon"!

210
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,040
(- Say something, Mal Nyeon. - Stay calm, Mal Nyeon.)

211
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,680
- Is that our catchphrase? - Yes, it is.

212
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,340
If you want to attract a large audience.

213
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,580
You need to do things like this. Let's do this together.

214
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
- Do you want me to say it? - Yes.

215
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,080
- Watch "Yoo and Nyeon". - "Yoo and Nyeon".

216
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,280
Every day is...

217
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,410
(Lee Mal Nyeon is now a member of an idol group now.)

218
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,580
Many people tell me that I have a strange laugh.

219
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,140
- Yes. - I think yours is strange too.

220
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,280
(They have something in common.)

221
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,780
Can I see one of your drawings before we start?

222
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,980
Of course, I brought my drawings with me today.

223
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Someone said, "I think she can draw better than him.",

224
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,980
"Lee Mal Nyeon lost." and so on.

225
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,180
I'm a professional, everyone. Please, show me your drawing.

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
- Here it is! - Wow!

227
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,980
This is a pencil drawing.

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Someone said, "Lee Mal Nyeon lost",

229
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,380
Another person wrote "Learn from her, Lee Mal Nyeon."

230
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,080
- This is an oil painting. - Wow.

231
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,980
Please don't write, "Yura is better than me."

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,880
We don't know yet. I can draw like this too. I could.

233
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,680
This is my latest painting.

234
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,240
Someone wrote, "She beats you for the third time."

235
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,480
I haven't shown my drawing to you yet. I can do this too.

236
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,080
- No one's on my side. - They're not on your side.

237
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,510
So for our first activity, I thought we could draw each other.

238
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,610
- We will draw our portraits? - Yes.

239
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,680
- I will draw you first. - Okay.

240
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
What is unique about Yura?

241
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,680
Yura the Explorer wrote, "Her nostrils". What about them?

242
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,680
- What about my nostrils? - For Yura says "Her cheekbones."

243
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,540
- What do you mean? - Her forehead?

244
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,280
Her cheekbones? Oh, I see.

245
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't have a strange face, right?

246
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Right, you don't.

247
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
(- Let's be honest. - Your nose will grow longer.)

248
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,580
Her face is fine.

249
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,240
Other than the cheekbones, what about her eyes?

250
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,080
I will start from drawing her eyes very big.

251
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,510
Don't mention my dark circles.

252
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,280
I do see something dark under your eyes.

253
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,150
It's true that my face gets chubbier when I smile.

254
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,880
It doesn't matter how much weight I lose.

255
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,240
Why are you adding dark circles?

256
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,080
- I see something under your eyes. - No, you don't.

257
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,080
- Okay, let's say it's your makeup. - Okay.

258
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Someone said, "Let's write a petition."

259
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,240
Let's stop teasing her.

260
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,980
Are you saying that because he's drawing me terribly?

261
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,580
They are asking, "Who are you drawing?"

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,180
- Are they asking who I'm drawing? - Yes.

263
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,650
What are you doing to my lips?

264
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,340
My lips are not dry.

265
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,780
Why are you drawing my lips like that?

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
I put lip balm on too.

267
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,880
I will make it look moist later.

268
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,780
Hold on. Is that my cheekbone?

269
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
People say it looks like Park Na Rae.

270
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,680
That's not true.

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
This is Yura.

272
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,880
- Could you add my double eyelids? - Double eyelids? Okay.

273
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,280
Of course, I can do that.

274
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,410
(Here you go.)

275
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
You're really mean.

276
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,480
(- It's plastic surgery gone wrong. - It looks like Yura.)

277
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,980
That does not look like me.

278
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,440
It's not like a reflection. Do I really look like that?

279
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,980
(They look the same.)

280
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
I won't talk to you anymore.

281
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm not that puffy today.

282
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,080
I will add eyelashes too.

283
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
(She's blushing.)

284
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,240
- My face feels hot. - It's almost done.

285
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,380
I lost my temper after I saw the drawing.

286
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,680
If you say something like that,

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,510
it will only inspire them to attack you more. Look at that.

288
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,880
Please don't say that you lost your temper.

289
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,180
What are you doing?

290
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,650
I'm done.

291
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,680
(Don't forget his signature mark.)

292
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,480
This means I didn't have enough time to draw.

293
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,780
He wrote my name in English.

294
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,780
Look at those emoticons.

295
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,680
They are just reacting to the drawing.

296
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,340
Can you give me a chance to fix this drawing?

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,780
- Okay. - Really?

298
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,180
Hold on, everyone.

299
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,780
- Where's the eraser? - Press "E" to erase.

300
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
- Is it this one? - Yes.

301
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,980
(She seems uncomfortable since it's her first time using a tablet.)

302
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,540
Is it working? Yes, press "E".

303
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
Press "B" is for the brush.

304
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,680
(I will make my face more oval.)

305
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,780
Is this what you wanted? It's worse!

306
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
It's funny though.

307
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,780
- That's really funny. - Please undo this for me.

308
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
No, that's it.

309
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,740
Now it's your turn to draw me.

310
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,680
(-Yura's face has been damaged. - It looks like a slice of pizza.)

311
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,680
You're really mean.

312
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,880
Why are you teasing me?

313
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,240
Hello, this is "Kim Gu Ra's True Story".

314
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,880
- Today, - Yes.

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,280
we're going to make ramyun. It's everyone's favourite.

316
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,510
We have invited a professional on our show today.

317
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,740
He's a ramyun mania.

318
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,510
- Please come in. - Welcome.

319
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,480
- Welcome, sir. - Hello.

320
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,680
Please welcome Cao Lu.

321
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,280
- Your ramyun delivery is here. - Wow!

322
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,880
Nice to meet you. Please introduce yourselves.

323
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,410
I'm Choi Yong Min a marketing manager at "P" Ramyun.

324
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,040
Oh, does the name of your company start with "P"?

325
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,980
- Yes. - I was right.

326
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
- How big is your market share? - Eight percent.

327
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,380
It's more than 10 percent.

328
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,410
- What's your rank? - There are four major companies.

329
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,880
- We are... - Fourth?

330
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,480
- I see. - Yes.

331
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,680
- Your company has caught up a lot. - Yes, they have.

332
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,980
- I like your Bibim noodles. - Right, it's delicious.

333
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,880
It's Cao Lu. You know Cao Lu, right?

334
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm Cao Lu from a girl group that start with "P".

335
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,180
(Really?)

336
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,680
- Oh, I know that group. - What group?

337
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,180
- What's her team? - We're both from group P!

338
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,980
- That's right. - Yes. Group P.

339
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,480
Oh, his company and her group have the same sound. I get it.

340
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,780
Cao Lu has brought some ramyun from China.

341
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,410
- Look at the variety. - Yes.

342
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,140
China uses noodle a lot in their cuisine.

343
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,580
I assumed ramyun would not be popular in China.

344
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,280
Am I right?

345
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,840
No, China consumes the most noodles in the world.

346
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,180
- Really? - China has a big population.

347
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
- Yes, of course. - So there's a big market.

348
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,280
China alone accounts for half the world's ramyun sales.

349
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,680
- Really? - Yes.

350
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,340
Roughly that's about 44 billion.

351
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,580
- Annually? - Wow.

352
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,380
- Korea eats 3.5 billion each year. - That's right.

353
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,110
- 3.5 billion? - They consume 10 times more ramyun.

354
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,580
- I see. So Cao Lu, - Yes.

355
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,280
is there a ramyun, that you'd like to recommend?

356
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,880
- Kimchi ramyun. - This is Korean.

357
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,880
- I want to eat that one. - Yes, kimchi ramyun.

358
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
- Can I have that one? - Later.

359
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,480
- This is also good. - This one?

360
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,980
- Can you cook this for us? - Sure.

361
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,240
- What is it? - It's gopchang ramyun.

362
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,880
The noodles are made out of sweet potato, not flour.

363
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,980
- I want to eat this. - I'll cook them both.

364
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
No don't do that, we can eat kimchi ramyun anytime.

365
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,680
- Please don't be upset. - Please don't.

366
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,380
- I don't want to eat the other one. - What else is there?

367
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,680
There's also abalone flavoured ramyun.

368
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,140
He's the head of the Korean Singers Association.

369
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,010
- He is? - Is she a singer?

370
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,210
Yes, she is.

371
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I pity you

372
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,680
Did you just say that to me?

373
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,880
(- She said she pities him. - He doesn't know what to say.)

374
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
Did you really just say that to me?

375
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,080
That's the lyrics to our song.

376
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,180
- Why don't you cook that for us? - Sure.

377
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,580
Some of you are asking about Jung Min.

378
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,780
- Take a look at these. - It says, "Cha Jang Geum".

379
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,180
(- She's super cute. - She came prepared.)

380
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,380
She came prepared today.

381
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,380
She's a deputy department head. I didn't know that.

382
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
(- That was funny. - Even his jokes are old.)

383
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,780
- Right. - So ramyun is a popular dish...

384
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,780
- all over the world. - That's right.

385
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,640
Which country consumes the most?

386
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,140
- That would be China. - I see.

387
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,380
- Whose in second place? - Indonesia.

388
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,940
- Indonesia. - It's because of their population.

389
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,880
- Of course. The population is... - 14 billion.

390
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,340
- It's a population of 100 million. - It's over a billion.

391
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,980
- No, they don't. - Are we talking about India?

392
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
- India has over a billion people. - Right.

393
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,010
- Aren't you the expert here? - You're the host. Help him out.

394
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Indonesia has less than a billion people.

395
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,480
- Vietnam and the United States. - Help him out.

396
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,380
- The United States? - They eat a lot of ramyun as well.

397
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,280
So how many bowls of ramyun do we consume every year?

398
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,180
- About 72 per person each year. - We're the highest in the world.

399
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
That's right.

400
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,680
Why do Koreans like ramyun so much?

401
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,280
- Because of how it tastes. - The flavour?

402
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,780
- Because it's a dish. - Yes.

403
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,980
So we don't enjoy dishes that aren't tasty.

404
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
Also, it's cheap.

405
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,180
- I see. - It's affordable.

406
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,140
- I see. - That's why people love it.

407
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,480
Can't you sound more like an expert?

408
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,980
Everything you've been saying...

409
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,580
is something we could have also said.

410
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,580
- This is quite the collection. - It's from Southeast Asia.

411
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,140
This is a stir-fry ramyun from India.

412
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,280
Isn't this too small? Is this it?

413
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,780
- It's the highest selling ramyun. - What's it called?

414
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,280
- Mie goreng. - I've heard of it before.

415
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
(- Is Cao Lu doing another show? - Does she have anyone to talk to?)

416
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,140
Mi goreng ramyun.

417
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,240
(- Who are they talking to? - Cao Lu looks like a maid.)

418
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,780
- It's not bad. - I agree.

419
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,110
- Do kids like it? - They do.

420
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,240
I see.

421
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,980
- Is it popular in the States? - Yes, it is.

422
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
(- She's scared of fire! - Look how adorable she is.)

423
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,740
I've never done this at home before.

424
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,240
These noodles are made from sweet potatoes,

425
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,380
so you should turn down the heat once the water comes to a boil.

426
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,940
If you heat it for too long,

427
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,780
the noodles will melt and get mushy.

428
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,180
(The gopchang ramyun is ready.)

429
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,380
- Here it is. - Is it already done?

430
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,280
- Yes, doesn't it smell nice? - Yes.

431
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,340
- It's glass noodles. - This is gopchang ramyun.

432
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,240
- It's one of my favourites. - It is?

433
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,640
- Oh, my. - What's wrong?

434
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,510
- Don't you like it? - I don't like the smell.

435
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,980
Right. Aren't you acting like a baby though?

436
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,380
Well, I am a baby.

437
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
(He only likes what kids like.)

438
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,740
They're saying, "I'm a baby, so I should wail."

439
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,140
- The smell is unique, I like it. - In China...

440
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,580
Can you order me a bowl of jajangmyun?

441
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,640
(Chinese ramyun are more pungent than Korean ramyun.)

442
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,640
The viewers are saying...

443
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,280
that you're Heungseon Daewongun when it comes to ramyun.

444
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,480
(He's satisfied.)

445
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,780
We must keep the pride of our ramyun.

446
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,180
Of course.

447
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,380
- He has a closed-door policy. - That sounds perfect.

448
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,040
(Heung Kook only wants to eat Korean ramyun.)

449
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,240
This Thai ramyun only needs hot water to be poured over it.

450
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
- Heung Kook, you're up. - No, I'm okay.

451
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
- Try it. - No, you go ahead.

452
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,680
- Just try it. - I can't stand the smell.

453
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,110
But still, you should try.

454
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,080
What's this smell? Is it from coriander?

455
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,480
You're smelling lime which is what is the smell in tom yum soup.

456
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,280
- Lime? - That's right.

457
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,880
I like tom yum soup and I like the smell.

458
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,280
- What's wrong? - It's just weird.

459
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,680
I've never tasted anything like this before.

460
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,780
- Let me try some. - I like tom yum soup.

461
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,080
- It doesn't smell so bad. - It's very good.

462
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,010
If we were living in the late Joseon Dynasty,

463
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,640
Heung Kook would be Heungseon Daewongun...

464
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,280
and I would be a modernist.

465
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
I would be part of the revolution like Kim Ok Gyun.

466
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,780
In terms of ramyun...

467
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
How could you sneeze on my face?

468
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,210
- I mean... - What is this?

469
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,980
You're the same.

470
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,680
(- It's a ramyun revolution. - Look at his nose.)

471
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,580
I'm sorry but I can't help it because of the smell.

472
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,140
I thought you said that you didn't mind the smell.

473
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,880
(I can't take it anymore.)

474
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,880
(Can I get a tissue?)

475
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,380
Give me that. Come on.

476
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,480
- Isn't it good? - It's good.

477
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,280
(Gu Ra is sweating.)

478
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,850
(- He's vomiting through his nose. - He's cleaning his nose.)

479
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,680
- What's wrong with you? - Give me some tissue.

480
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,510
("Saem Mool's Colourful Life")

481
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,680
Hello.

482
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,640
Thank you for coming once again back to...

483
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,780
"Saem Mool's Colourful Life".

484
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,880
Thank you for saying that I'm pretty.

485
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,040
(- You're pretty. - You are really pretty.)

486
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,740
I've been getting a lot of questions...

487
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,850
and most of them are about how to deal with a darker complexion.

488
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,080
So we'll be tackling that today.

489
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,980
I can't talk about...

490
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,380
darker complexions without mentioning retro.

491
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,080
It's this year's trend so I thought it would be nice...

492
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,040
to show you how to achieve a retro look.

493
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,280
Do you want to know who our guest is?

494
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,580
When you think of darker complexions, who comes to mind?

495
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,740
I see. So let's see if you're right.

496
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,140
Shall we ask her to come in? You can come in now.

497
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,380
(It's a member of Wonder Girls.)

498
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
- Ta-da! - Hello.

499
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,980
(She has a healthy and tanned skin.)

500
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,980
(She's the sexy idol rapper, Yu Bin.)

501
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,640
- All right! - Hi, I'm Yu Bin.

502
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,480
- The viewers are happy. - This is so fascinating!

503
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,480
Look! They love you.

504
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
They're excited to see you.

505
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,980
- I normally don't get nervous, - Okay.

506
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,380
but I did when I heard that you were my model today.

507
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,080
- I'm very nervous as well. - Really?

508
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,380
(I'm nervous too. What should I do?)

509
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,680
Did you see Gimi Writer's transformation last week?

510
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,240
- I made her look like you. - I saw it!

511
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,740
- I was so surprised. - You were?

512
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,210
Strike a pose like Yu Bin.

513
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
(She borrowed Yu Bin's clothes.)

514
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,040
You look so pretty. Okay, let's move on.

515
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,880
- Retro is so hot right now. - That's right.

516
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,680
My group is known for always bringing back the retro look...

517
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
and we were lucky that retro sexy is the hot trend.

518
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,480
Okay, so let's go ahead and show the viewers...

519
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
the secret to doing the retro look.

520
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,480
They're saying that you should brighten up my skin tone.

521
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,680
You're wrong. I don't have a drab skin tone.

522
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,280
- How could you say that? - You don't look drab.

523
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,480
First, I'm going to clear her face of any excess oil.

524
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,980
Yu Bin needs to use shades darker than number 25.

525
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,080
She has a darker skin.

526
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,380
You can get tanned easily right?

527
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,110
Yes. I can even get tanned in the winter...

528
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,580
- or sometimes by the stage lights. - That's right.

529
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,940
- I get tanned easily. - I know.

530
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,080
In the past, I couldn't find the right tone for me.

531
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,240
So I had to buy my makeup products abroad.

532
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,280
She doesn't need to use number 30.

533
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Some people are asking if you use shades over number 30.

534
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,680
- No, I don't. - That's absurd.

535
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,280
Number 301? Isn't that an apartment number?

536
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,080
(- Apartment 105 number 25. - Lee Dae Ho.)

537
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,040
Now it's time to apply the foundation.

538
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,110
But before I do that, I'm going to apply...

539
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,580
a thin layer of this gold shimmer.

540
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,280
We're going to apply it on her cheekbones.

541
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,110
The shimmer will act as a bonding agent...

542
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,780
when you're applying the foundation.

543
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,580
So now we move onto the foundation.

544
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,210
I'll show you the darker shades that I have.

545
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,680
Watch carefully. I'm going to take a small amount...

546
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,480
of this darker shade of concealer.

547
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Mix it with...

548
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
the foundation like so.

549
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,740
You're worried that she'll look like a cave woman?

550
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,880
Then stay tuned and watch.

551
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,580
- My skin is naturally dark. - Right.

552
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
As you can see, she looks very natural.

553
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,880
I've levelled out her skin tone.

554
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,640
You think her skin looks yellow?

555
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,040
That's not it. This is just her original skin tone.

556
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,980
- This is normal. - My skin looks different...

557
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,110
- under different lighting. - She's right.

558
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
(- She's blaming it on the lights. - The producer is the real victim.)

559
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,780
So let's move on.

560
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
Those with lighter complexions...

561
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,780
look amazing when this pink shimmer is applied.

562
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,380
But people with yellow or darker complexion,

563
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,380
gold is the way to go.

564
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,580
This is a gold coloured loose powder.

565
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,210
And it'll make her look fabulous.

566
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,940
I've applied some today on my cheekbones.

567
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,480
- Even a thin layer of it... - Okay.

568
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,850
can make you look younger.

569
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Your skin will also look really firm as well.

570
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
I'm going to apply some on her cheekbones.

571
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
- Remember what I said earlier? - Someone said "Gold poop".

572
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,280
I like poop. I'm also fond of Producer Dung.

573
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,940
My daughter is four years old and...

574
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,980
we sing "The Dung Song".

575
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,480
I sing it to her when she's on the potty.

576
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,210
Okay, we're done.

577
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
- I look better. - You look way better.

578
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,740
- But we're just getting started. - Great.

579
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,880
- What we're going to do next is... - "Dung makeup."

580
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,680
- Can't you say "Gold" instead? - I'd like that too.

581
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,780
It begins now.

582
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,880
("Han Ye Ri's Flying Ye Ri")

583
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,680
Wow! This is more than I expected.

584
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
You're all excited and so am I.

585
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,780
Before we talk, I'm going to...

586
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
first show you a short dance. After that let's talk.

587
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,480
(Happy New Year!)

588
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,880
(- I'm not giving you pocket money. - When are you getting married?)

589
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,380
Here I go.

590
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,780
(Elegant)

591
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,040
(She elegantly starts to dance.)

592
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,680
(- She's cleaning the floor. - That looks like toilet paper.)

593
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,380
(This the dance she performed on "Six Flying Dragons".)

594
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,280
(She choreographed it herself.)

595
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,010
(- She is so pretty. - It's strangely captivating.)

596
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,280
(Throws)

597
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,110
(- It's a carpet of toilet paper. - She is making a new road.)

598
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,110
(The song reaches climax.)

599
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,710
(Stepping lightly)

600
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,480
(- It's a toilet paper carpet ride. - Miss, walk on this line.)

601
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,910
(Ye Ri dances.)

602
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,310
My goodness.

603
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,410
Did I do well?

604
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,110
"It looks like an exorcism." What?

605
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
"Step lightly as you leave." What a poetic expression.

606
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,010
I showed you my dance as an opening of my programme.

607
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,210
Not many people know...

608
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,210
who I am.

609
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,710
So I will show you a popular movie I was in.

610
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,210
Ye Ri knows how to play table tennis.

611
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,580
Look at us in blue uniforms.

612
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,380
(She received a Newcomer Award at Paeksang Arts Awards.)

613
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,210
(Her role was a North Korean table tennis player, Yu Sun Bok.)

614
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,310
If you can't take us on,

615
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,780
how will you win a gold medal?

616
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,810
I miss Doo Na so much.

617
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,580
Ta-da. It's the next movie.

618
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,810
(It's a movie with a production cost of 10 billion dollars.)

619
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,310
I'm here to eat ramyun.

620
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,510
(She played a Korean Chinese woman, Hong Mae in "Sea Fog".)

621
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,710
Would you like some?

622
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,310
I ate a lot of cup ramyun during that time.

623
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,810
What are you trying to do to me?

624
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,680
What are you saying?

625
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,910
Don't go anywhere and stay here, okay?

626
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,910
I'm good with Korean Chinese accent, right?

627
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,180
"Han Ye Ri defects to North Korea."

628
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,440
My goodness, I can't believe it.

629
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,410
You don't know much about my life before the movies.

630
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,110
So I brought some pictures from the days...

631
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,910
I used to dance.

632
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,710
Ta-da. Can you see "1996" printed on the picture?

633
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,810
I took this picture in middle school to apply to high school.

634
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,580
I was such a baby then, right?

635
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,080
And this was taken during my dark days.

636
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,710
It's obvious, right? My cheeks are about to burst.

637
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,580
Ta-da. This was taken on the day of my presentation.

638
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,110
I look old, right?

639
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,310
"I'm the mother of Chosun."

640
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,210
I thought I would become an Intangible Cultural Property.

641
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,540
I once dreamed of taking my last breath on the stage,

642
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,580
but this is how I turned out.

643
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,710
My ideal type? Guess who my ideal type is.

644
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,810
There is an actor I like very much.

645
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,910
Tony Leung! Someone guessed it.

646
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,280
He is the actor I admire the most.

647
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,810
I would gladly marry him even if he turns 80 years old.

648
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,080
He is so cool. I love his movies.

649
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,810
I loved his acting in "In the Mood for Love".

650
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,210
I'm about to get a nosebleed.

651
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,440
I'm sure everyone has an actor they like very much.

652
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,510
I like him so much.

653
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,910
Someone asked what my preferred way of eating sweet and sour meat is.

654
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,010
I always dip the meat in the sauce.

655
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,810
I can't pour sauce over it. How can people prefer that?

656
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,080
Flying Chuk Sa Gwang asked,

657
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,810
"What would you do if Tony Leung prepares pouring sauce over meat?"

658
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,640
Then I will pour sauce over meat.

659
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,680
I'm very simple.

660
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,640
If that's what he likes, I will follow him.

661
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,710
"A traitor."

662
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,640
(- A traitor. - She changes her mind easily.)

663
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,310
I'm sorry.

664
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,010
I can't help it. Love is the best.

665
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,010
Mangtaegi wrote that "I look very young."

666
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,010
How do I maintain my looks? It's important to do what you like.

667

"Billy Elliot"? Fish Seller, I like that movie, too.

673
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,310
It's nice to converse with you all.

674
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,680
Hello, hello.

675

I can't really eat spicy food. Singha. My goodness.

"What do you do when you have free time?" I really like to sleep.

I love conversing with people.

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,310
So it's great to chat...

679
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,810
and converse with you.

(They start off with a performance.)

687
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,710
Let's go.

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,210
Look at the camera.

690
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,110
(Every singer who comes to the show begins with a song.)

691

(Lilting)

692

(Min Soo can rap well.)

698
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,910
(You are a good singer.)

699
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,710

- Hello. - Let's stop right here.

702
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,810
Hello.

703
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,810
I'm Yoon Hu's father.

704
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,210
Someone wrote that I'm a mix between Oh Se Deuk and The One.

705
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,810
People tell me that all the time.

706
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,710
I am here today...

707
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,910
because everyone has a different vocal range.

708
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,310
I will help you find what vocal range works for you...

709
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,110
and give you tips on how to sing...

710
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,010
your favourite songs at the karaoke better.

711
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,610
This is the title of my programme.

712
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,310
Shi... Gosh, that came out wrong.

713
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,210
(- Did he just swear? - He started off with a swear word.)

714
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,180
I get tongue-tied in front of the camera.

715
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,810
It is called "Yoon Min Soo's 25-hour Karaoke".

716
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,210
My mother used to own a karaoke called "25-hour Karaoke".

717
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,640
Thus the title.

718
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,310
"Shibasaki joins the game again."

719
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,410
(Laughing)

720
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,310
I wasn't swearing.

721
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,810
I invited some talented people to help me today.

722
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,680
- Hello. - Hello.

723
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,780
I'm a classical singer and a vocal trainer, Yoo Seul Ki.

724
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,210
It's nice to meet you.

725
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,310
(- I'll have the cutlet. - Waiter.)

726
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,710
People have different vocal ranges.

727
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,680
You can use a piano or a piano app...

728
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,410
to find your vocal range.

729
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,910
Do is the first note of the solfege scale.

730
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,710
Do. Start from there.

731
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,010
Do, ti, la, sol, fa. Let's say you can hit Fa...

732
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,610
with ease. Then you are a baritone.

733
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,610
- I'm a baritone. - Min Soo is a baritone.

734
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,110
(A baritone has a wide vocal range and is most common male voice.)

735
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,210
(A baritone has a wide vocal range and is most common male voice.)

736
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,610
Do. Let's check if you are a bass.

737
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,180
Do, ti, la, sol.

738
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,010
If you can hit Do that is one octave lower, you are a bass.

739
00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,510
(A bass has the lowest vocal range and sounds solemn and deep.)

740
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,810
Do. And if you can hit do two octaves higher,

741
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,310
then you are a tenor.

742
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:14,310
(A tenor has the highest vocal range of the male voice types.)

743
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,480
How about we invite the staff members...

744
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,380
- and help them... - That's a good idea.

745
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,510
find their vocal range?

746
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,610
- Hello. - Hello.

747
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,910
- They look familiar. - My goodness.

748
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,910
They have the body of a classical singer.

749
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,010
- It's nice to meet you. - They look like classical singers.

750
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,410
(Crowded)

751
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
All right. They look more like classical singers than me.

752
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,640
- To see if you are a tenor... - "It looks like a ssireum team."

753
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,010
Classical singers look like ssireum athletes.

754
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,810
Let's start. In 1, 2, 3, 4.

755
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,310
(They try each note to find their vocal range.)

756
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,510
(Singing)

757
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,680
Give up if you can't hit the note.

758
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,110
(Gloomy)

759
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,210
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - Someone wrote, "This is hell."

760
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,910
We will lose viewers.

761
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,110
(Dark)

762
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,810
Someone wrote that it looks like a choir in jail.

763
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,910
(The criminals are being reformed.)

764
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,810
- We are testing the vocal range. - That's what we are doing.

765
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,410
- Let's have them take turns. - All right.

766
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,280
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3, 4.

767
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,610
(Singing)

768
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,710
All right.

769
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,010
- His voice got quieter. - That's right.

770
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,110
People who are short and stout...

771
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,510
tend to be a tenor.

772
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,110
All right. Okay.

773
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,810
Keep going.

774
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,410
Okay.

775
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,540
His voice became thicker towards the end.

776
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,280
- He is a low baritone. - That's right.

777
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,180
I'm sure you now have a sense of how to test your vocal range.

778
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,710
- Let's take a few staff members... - Okay.

779
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,710
- and teach them how to sing. - All right.

780
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,440
He will give them tips on singing.

781
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,910
All right.

782
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,180
("Like Salmons That Travel Upstream" He is a baritone.)

783
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,810
(He follows the beat.)

784
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,540
(He follows the beat.)

785
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,510
(He looks unusual.)

786
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,210
(Salmons...)

787
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,710
(that travel upstream)

788
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,080
(He is charismatic from the start.)

789
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,380
(He looks like he would eat the salmons.)

790
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,310
(His singing will invoke deep sorrow in salmons.)

791
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,710
(Among many paths)

792
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,910
(I'm sorry.)

793
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,010
He abruptly stopped the song.

794
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,610
- Yes! - He was good.

795
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,710
He sang well.

796
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,310
You felt it, right?

797
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,710
The song seemed stuffy...

798
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,710
- and was a bit hard to listen to. - Right.

799
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,080
The song was a bit out of his vocal range.

800
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,510
If you lower the key of the song...

801
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,110
by one key or half,

802
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,210
you will be able to sing more comfortably.

803
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,810
Someone wrote, "Men should sing in the original key."

804
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,210
"It's a matter of pride." I think he just began watching.

805
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,010
Every person has a specific vocal range.

806
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,280
Singing the song that suits your vocal range...

807
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,810
makes you a good singer.

808
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,910
That's right. If you sing a song of your vocal range,

809
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,510
your song will sound better. It's the right way.

810
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,310
Let me give you another tip.

811
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,110
People often change the keys at the karaoke,

812
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,910
but not many people change the tempo.

813
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,810
I will try changing the tempo.

814
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,610
(How will the song sound now?)

815
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,210
Wow.

816
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,510
There. I slowed the tempo...

817
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,640
by two measures.

818
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,280
(He slowed the tempo.)

819
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,540
(Salmons...)

820
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,640
(that travel upstream)

821
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,440
(Slow)

822
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,080
(- I'm getting sleepy. - Good night, my baby.)

823
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,310
People think it sounds too gloomy.

824
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,910
(Reasons)

825
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,110
Yes.

826
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,610
(If salmons travelled upstream this slowly,)

827
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,310
(they would get eaten.)

828
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,540
- You all felt it too, right? - There is a difference.

829
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,810
- You felt it, right? - Yes, it sounds smoother.

830
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,740
"Did he sing in slow motion?"

831
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,610
No, he wasn't singing in slow motion.

832
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
But, if you slow down the tempo a little,

833
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,610
it becomes a lot easier to express emotions with your voice.

834
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,140
Why would we need to express emotion during a company dinner?

835
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,610
Well, there might be a colleague you like.

836
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,440
"That would ruin the evening."

837
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,840
"I am craving salmon sashimi."

838
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,340
(This is not going to be an easy show.)

839
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,110
- Let me try drawing this time. - Okay.

840
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,810
I will get my revenge. This is my chance.

841
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,440
But I thought my drawing was really good though.

842
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,010
Is this the type of drawing you like?

843
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Of course.

844
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
(She's my style.)

845
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,080
I had a quick look at your cartoons, I heard you are starting to go bald.

846
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
My hair? Yes, that's right.

847
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,140
So, I drew your hair very lightly.

848
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,640
Yes, it's okay. That's fine.

849
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,240
- I'm being generous with your hair. - Okay.

850
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,140
What's unusual about him?

851
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,440
My double eyelids look fake.

852
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,710
Fake double eyelids.

853
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,510
My nickname during high school was...

854
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,140
Yi Hwang.

855
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,080
Another one was Lee Bong Ju, the marathon runner.

856
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,840
Can you look at me, so that I can see your face clearly?

857
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,810
He has triangular-shaped eyebrows.

858
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
(- It looks like him. - He has the face of a traitor.)

859
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,440
Can you smile a little?

860
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,140
(Twitch)

861
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,810
(Look at that cunning smile.) (They both have a unique laugh.)

862
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Why are you laughing?

863
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,810
Does he look like a eunuch?

864
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
One moment please.

865
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,080
(Your Majesty)

866
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,080
I look frivolous?

867
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,340
I think I captured you perfectly,

868
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,140
Focus on the chin line, the chin line.

869
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,610
I just drew the chin.

870
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,010
It looks like this. I have a double chin.

871
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,040
Let's add dark circles.

872
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,140
(He looks very tired.)

873
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,940
What do you think?

874
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,110
How does it look?

875
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
It looks exactly like me.

876
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,810
They say they may have a nightmare from looking at the drawing.

877
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,510
They say it looks very gloomy and scary.

878
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,140
Now that we are done drawing portraits...

879
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,340
Let's draw the image that pops up...

880
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,940
when you think of the other person's occupation.

881
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,540
- When I think of female idols, - Okay.

882
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,440
they look very fancy on the outside, but inside...

883
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,540
they are struggling. That's how I see idols.

884
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,710
When I think of idols, I think of swans.

885
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,810
(- It has sinister eyes. - Isn't that an ostrich?)

886
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,080
A swan. Here we go.

887
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,750
(Yura the Swan.)

888
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,810
Since this Is my first time on My Little Television,

889
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,440
everything is fascinating.

890
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,750
It really is.

891
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,640
Why are you only focusing on her?

892
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,840
That's unfair.

893
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,980
"Lee Mal Nyeon is a slave to his art."

894
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,750
(Is that the swan's leg?)

895
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,910
The legs are...

896
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,010
Hold on a minute!

897
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,940
What's the point in drawing.

898
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,750
All of you only care about Yura, so I don't know why...

899
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,250
- I am drawing. - Hold on.

900
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,440
Weren't you drawing me?

901
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
No, I'm drawing the image I have about girl groups.

902
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,250
- They look very fancy, but... - I understand now.

903
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,610
their legs are...

904
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Is this the kind of artworks the viewers like?

905
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,250
The viewers of this programme aren't mainstream.

906
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,610
I should have drawn something else.

907
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
He looks a bit like a raccoon.

908
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,340
Me? I have never heard such thing in my life.

909
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,110
He looks like the Raccoon in the cartoon, "Bonobono".

910
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,980
- I know who you're talking about. - Right?

911
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,080
- Why do you think I look like him? - I'm a raccoon.

912
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,750
- You sound exactly like Bonobono. - Really?

913
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,340
Like this?

914
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,140
(- Mal Nyeon is having fun. - She makes my heart flutter.)

915
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,250
- You know what it is, right? - Yes.

916
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,540
- Do you have anything else? - Like this.

917
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,910
- Show us something else. - Show me something, first.

918
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,540
I don't have a special talent.

919
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,250
Can you imitate anyone?

920
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,640
Hello, I'm Gum Nan Se.

921
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,610
Don't you know what this is? He runs a radio programme.

922
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,750
Hello, I'm Gum Nan Se.

923
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,110
Hello, I'm Gum Nan Se.

924
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,980
No one seems impressed.

925
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,080
Someone wrote, "I thought you were imitating Yang Hyun Suk."

926
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,750
I did a great Gum Nan Se impersonation.

927
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,840
Yang Hyun Suk!

928
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,640
- So this is the image. - The legs are very muscular.

929
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,540
The drawing shows how hard female idol group members work.

930
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,040
This is the message I am trying to convey.

931
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,340
Girl group members look glamorous on the outside,

932
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,210
but their legs are continuously working underneath the surface.

933
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,710
(One day they will soar into the sky like a swan.)

934
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,710
They work very hard beneath the surface.

935
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,340
I feel like it would be a constant struggle.

936
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,040
That's how a swan swims.

937
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,610
Someone wrote, "Look at those muscular legs."

938
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,810
"What kind female idols have legs like that?"

939
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,110
"Whose legs are those?"

940
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,140
That's not the point.

941
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,980
They are saying that those legs are Kim Jong Kook's.

942
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
(They are Kim Jong Kook's legs.)

943
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,140
(- Jong Kook has impressive thighs. - It's Lake Turbo.)

944
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,810
I drew a picture that captures how hard girl group members work.

945
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,040
We have an expert with us...

946
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,510
who will tell us about the history of ramyun.

947
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,040
Let's start with the origin of ramyun.

948
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,640
Chinese people have a specific way of making noodles.

949
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,250
- Okay. - Like how we make jajangmyun,

950
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,640
- the noodles are stretched thin. - Okay.

951
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,610
It's one way of making noodle dishes.

952
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,710
I see.

953
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,640
In Chinese, cooking noodles in this particular style is "Ra mien".

954
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,010
- It's "Ra mien" in Chinese? - Ra mien.

955
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,910
These are the characters for Ra mien.

956
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,080
- Go on. - This became popular in Japan.

957
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,540
- How did that happen? - The First Sino-Japanese War.

958
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
The First Sino-Japanese War.

959
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,940
After the war, Chinese people lived in Japan...

960
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,440
and made noodles.

961
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,510
And the Japanese...

962
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,140
pronounced it as "Ramen".

963
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,980
It was a Japanese man who first invented...

964
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,340
instant noodles.

965
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,540
- Yes. His name is Momofuku Ando. - What was that?

966
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
- Yes. His name is Momofuku Ando. - What was that?

967
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,040
- What was that? - A packet of ramyun fell down.

968
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,910
- Okay. - The ramyun is angry.

969
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
- Is it angry? - It's an ominous sign.

970
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,340
- My goodness. - It's an ominous sign.

971
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,440
The funny thing is, the one that dropped on the floor is...

972
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,940
a ramyun from your company.

973
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,340
- It's an ominous sign. - My goodness.

974
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,750
It was a ramyun from company P.

975
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,640
Someone wrote, "It's the curse of company P."

976
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,340
(- Are they doomed? - The curse of company P.)

977
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Someone wrote, "It's time to sell your shares in P."

978
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,510
Someone wrote, "It's time to sell your shares of Paldo stock."

979
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,140
The company isn't listed on KOSDAQ.

980
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,250
Really?

981
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
(- He looks so happy. - He is happy it isn't listed.)

982
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,750
So Chinese noodles and the Japanese instant noodles...

983
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,640
use a different cooking method.

984
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,910
This is how the Japanese instant noodles came to be.

985
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,640
Momofuku Ando, the father of instant noodles got...

986
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,080
- Momofuku Ando. - his idea from fish being fried.

987
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,710
- When you fry something, - Okay.

988
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,510
the oil bubbles as the water evaporates.

989
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,440
- That's how frying works. - The hot oil cooks the ingredient.

990
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,140
So that's where he got the inspiration for the cooking process.

991
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,640
That's how he cooked ramyun noodles.

992
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,010
That's how...

993
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,540
the Japanese instant noodles came into existence.

994
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,110
- "This is boring." - People don't think it's fun.

995
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,640
They are saying that we will come last.

996
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,980
How do you say "No fun" in Chinese?

997
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,510
- Mei yo yi si. - Mei yo yi si.

998
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,250
- Dui bu qi. - What does that mean?

999
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,540
I'm sorry.

1000
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,010
(I'm sorry.)

1001
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,080
What can we do to make the programme fun?

1002
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
How about, the expert will teach us how to cook ramyun...

1003
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,750
- so they taste the best. - Shall I?

1004
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,980
- Give us a few tips. - That's right.

1005
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,250
You need to establish yourself as an expert.

1006
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,750
It's very easy to cook tasty ramyun.

1007
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,140
- The thing with ramyun is, - Okay.

1008
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,540
it loses its original taste if you add too many ingredients.

1009
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,340
You just need green onion, garlic, egg and chili pepper powder.

1010
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,340
These four ingredients will make any ramyun taste good.

1011
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,710
- Is that so? - Please cook it for us.

1012
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,340
- Let's try it. - Try this on.

1013
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,750
I heard that you need to follow the instruction to the letter.

1014
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,980
This is...

1015
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,340
You look fine. Don't worry about it.

1016
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,540
Don't worry about it. It suits you nicely.

1017
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,250
- You can do it. - I'm so glad Cao Lu is here.

1018
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,340
Show us the skills of an expert.

1019
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,810
I'll cook this for us.

1020
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,010
When you cook ramyun,

1021
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,340
is it better to break the noodles?

1022
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,640
- There is a line in the middle. - Okay.

1023
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,340
The noodles are about 60cm long.

1024
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,540
- 60cm. - That's if you don't break it.

1025
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,440
- It will be too long to eat easily. - That's right.

1026
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,140
- So you should break it in half. - Do you break it down the middle?

1027
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,440
- I see. - Wow.

1028
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,910
- It will break cleanly. - We always break it like this.

1029
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,440
I always broke the noodles horizontally.

1030
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,110
- So that's the way you do it. - It's easier to eat that way.

1031
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,440
- I have a question. - Okay.

1032
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,110
Why are you making ramyun from your company?

1033
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,440
We test our ramyun against other companies'.

1034
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,440
And I can say with confidence that ours wins every time.

1035
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,510
Is this so? Is this the star for your company?

1036
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,140
- Is this your star product? - Yes, it is.

1037
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,750
How well does it sell?

1038
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,610
We sell about 1 million packets every month.

1039
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,510
What about the always popular S ramyun?

1040
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,080
They sell about 25 million packets a month.

1041
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,910
You said that your ramyun wins every time. Why do they sell...

1042
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,040
- more than your company? - This is...

1043
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,540
- the rising star of the industry. - What?

1044
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,640
- The rising star? - Yes, it is.

1045
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,140
Scatter the egg into the soup.

1046
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,040
- No, don't do that. - We can't do that.

1047
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Don't ruin his work.

1048
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,340
- If we scatter the egg, - Okay.

1049
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
the taste of the soup will change.

1050
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,140
It'll just taste like ramyun with eggs.

1051
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,010
You need to follow the instructions on the packet to the letter.

1052
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,140
- To the letter. - Don't scatter the egg.

1053
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,880
Heung Kook and I will taste the ramyun he has cooked.

1054
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,880
(Heung Kook only eats Korean ramyun.)

1055
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,710
(Does he like the taste?)

1056
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,440
This is delicious.

1057
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
It's perfect.

1058
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,510
It tastes amazing.

1059
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,140
- Is it good? - I'm so happy.

1060
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,440
- Is it good? - I'm so happy.

1061
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,340
That's good.

1062
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,440
When we run a blind test with our rival company's product,

1063
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,510
we win 7 times out of 10.

1064
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,250
Then why doesn't it sell better?

1065
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,880
Our company isn't as popular.

1066
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,940
But we'll slowly take over the market.

1067
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,840
- It needs a better concept. - Really?

1068
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,140
Change the model to a woman.

1069
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,250
- A woman? - Do you want a ramyun commercial?

1070
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,440
- A ramyun commercial. - Our current model is a man.

1071
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,540
Replace him with a woman.

1072
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Replace him with a woman?

1073
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,750
She came prepared.

1074
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
- That's right. - Try some ramyun.

1075
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,080
You need to give it a variety of sound effects.

1076
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,110
(Blowing)

1077
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,880
(Cry of surprise)

1078
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,540
(Slurping)

1079
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,250
(Sigh of content)

1080
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,040
Cao Lu Ramyun is unrivalled in its taste! It's the best.

1081
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,640
What did you think?

1082
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,940
- Didn't you like it? - I like it.

1083
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,110
(Heung Kook focuses on ramyun.)

1084
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Wipe your mouth.

1085
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,880
Now, we will apply some colours.

1086
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,440
Before you start applying makeup,

1087
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,510
think about in what order you will apply the colours.

1088
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,250
You'll come out looking so much better that way.

1089
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
So...

1090
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,940
- I will start with the lips. - The lips.

1091
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,340
I will apply lipstick to her lips.

1092
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,140
- Burgundy is a trendy colour. - That's right.

1093
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,340
She knows what the latest trends are.

1094
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,340
- Of course I do. - Celebrities know what's trending.

1095
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,110
I mixed true red and burgundy for Yu Bin's lips.

1096
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,640
I didn't know you could mix the lip colours.

1097
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,110
Mixing the colours creates a more dramatic look.

1098
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
(- Is there such thing as fake red? - It looks like she ate a lollipop.)

1099
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,140
- I have applied the lipstick. - Wow.

1100
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,440
"Is that makeup for a shaman?"

1101
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,140
Don't be ridiculous.

1102
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,040
You think it looks like a colour your mother would wear?

1103
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,210
That is correct.

1104
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,610
Retro look is the look that was popular in the 70s.

1105
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,340
This colour is what the mothers of today would have worn.

1106
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,840
Our viewers are very observant.

1107
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,140
I will now apply eyeshadows.

1108
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,640
What characterises the retro makeup...

1109
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,250
is the lack of pearls.

1110
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,340
Apply just a touch of natural eyeshadow.

1111
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,640
Like this.

1112
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,880
Apply shade to the sides of your nose.

1113
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,840
Retro makeup is all about shading.

1114
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,880
"The model looks like Yu Bin."

1115
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,140
Thank you. I hear that all the time.

1116
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,640
You are so witty.

1117
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,640
- After that, - Yes?

1118
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,140
apply eyeshadow starting from under your eyes...

1119
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,010
and until you reach the edge.

1120
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,340
By drawing it like this the line will look better.

1121
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,310
- Now look at this. - Wow!

1122
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,750
Look at me, everyone. This is amazing.

1123
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,250
I've never seen the progress of wearing makeup on a screen before.

1124
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,840
- That's why it's so interesting. - You're right.

1125
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,680
"You're good." I've been doing this for 25 years.

1126
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,480
- She is the famous Jung Saem Mool. - That's right.

1127
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,140
Now, we will add gradation on the eyes.

1128
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,140
Like this.

1129
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:11,310
You will find that the gradation covers the eyeliner a little.

1130
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,940
So draw the line again one more time.

1131
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Draw it like this. After this...

1132
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,440
- Someone said, "That's too much." - Really?

1133
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,040
It will look different once we work on her eyebrows.

1134
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,340
- But we need to remember that... - That's right.

1135
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,640
we want to make sure that make up stand out, that's how we create...

1136
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,540
- the retro look. - That's right.

1137
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,040
The eyebrows have to be shaped into a seagull shape...

1138
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,640
- to complete the retro look. - That's right.

1139
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,750
Follow the outline of your eyebrows.

1140
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,340
This helps to give a more sophisticated look.

1141
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,040
Retro makeup emphasises lines and textures.

1142
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
So you have to go over the top...

1143
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,240
with the mascara.

1144
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,440
Just in case the mascara...

1145
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,340
smudges under the eyes,

1146
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,740
use a dry cotton swab and dab at the smudge.

1147
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,410
Make sure the mascara is dry, otherwise it will be a disaster.

1148
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,340
Wait until it's dry enough.

1149
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,040
It's about time we need to finish the look.

1150
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,340
- "Run away, Yu Bin." - Someone told me to run away.

1151
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,740
- Why? Why would you say that? - They know what's coming.

1152
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,440
I will work on it like this. That's right.

1153
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,840
(She has claimed many victims.)

1154
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,410
Wow, you look sexy.

1155
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,840
- Please welcome our dark priests. - Really?

1156
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,540
(The dark priests stride towards her.)

1157
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
(We're three minutes away from seeing something shocking.)

1158
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,840
(They're the dark priests.)

1159
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,240
Someone wrote, "Good luck."

1160
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,940
(- The drum sounds are ominous. - Rest in peace, Yu Bin.)

1161
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,710
- We're done. - Ta-da.

1162
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,040
- Ta-da. - Yes?

1163
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,740
This is her hair and makeup style that she had in...

1164
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,110
- the song "I Feel You". - Yes, it is.

1165
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,540
Wasn't this a success? She looks pretty.

1166
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,040
- I will dance to "I Feel You". - Yes, "I Feel You".

1167
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,610
Actually, I am wearing...

1168
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,580
my "I Feel You" costume, right now.

1169
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,710
But I'm shy to take off my clothes here.

1170
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,110
- You can change over there. - Please be patient.

1171
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,340
Someone wrote, "Please show us". They like the idea.

1172
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,840
Someone wrote, "Her pants are too short."

1173
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,340
- I'm back! - She's back.

1174
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,110
- She looks so pretty, right? - Yes.

1175
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,240
- I wore this for my performance. - Yes.

1176
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,640
It is actually a swimsuit.

1177
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,240
(- It's okay, I'm an adult. - I'm okay with that.)

1178
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,340
- Good. - I wore pants for your sake.

1179
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,510
(The dance version for "I Feel You".)

1180
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,940
Show us the dance moves.

1181
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,340
Let's do it together. Type the song for me.

1182
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,940
(- Okay! - I've never heard the song before.)

1183
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,580
(- When I'm alone - I feel you)

1184
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,740
(All I can do is clap along to the song.)

1185
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,940
(She's sexy.)

1186
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,740
(While she's performing passionately,)

1187
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,410
(she only claps.)

1188
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,840
(The dance performance must go on.)

1189
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,140
(The room is starting to heat up.)

1190
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,840
(- She moves like an old lady. - It this an exorcism?)

1191
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,040
Look how I move.

1192
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,240
(- You're so pretty. - I'm glad I'm watching this.)

1193
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,340
Let's dance together.

1194
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,440
(Jung Saem Mool is so cute.)

1195
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,210
I'm about to... So we are going to now...

1196
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,610
talk to each other.

1197
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,710
I'm not taking off all my clothes.

1198
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,710
Don't worry. I'm only taking off this one.

1199
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,240
I wore another layer inside. "What are you doing?"

1200
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,540
(She wore a white cotton t-shirt inside her hanbok.)

1201
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,540
I thought long and hard about the best way to communicate with you.

1202
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,110
So I thought we could communicate better if I wear...

1203
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,610
my practice clothes.

1204
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,240
That's why I wore...

1205
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,040
the shirt I wear for practice underneath.

1206
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,040
(Her microphone has come off.)

1207
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,840
My microphone? Thank you.

1208
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,140
I almost forgot to put my microphone back on.

1209
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,510
"Are you wearing long johns?" No, It's a shirt.

1210
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,840
(- That's her grandmother's. - What are you wearing?)

1211
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,640
This is not heattech innerwear.

1212
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,810
I knew this would happen. I knew I shouldn't have worn white.

1213
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,140
I would never wear innerwear in public.

1214
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,140
I'm here meeting you all for the first time.

1215
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,040
Someone wrote, "Is that a sweat absorbing one?" No, it's a shirt.

1216
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,310
(- You can buy 3 for 12 dollars. - What brand is it?)

1217
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,040
To wish you all a happy New Year,

1218
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,340
let me perform a traditional Korean dance.

1219
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,240
Happy New Year, everyone.

1220
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,240
Bring in the Buk!

1221
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,410
Open the door, open the door.

1222
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,580
I bring you luck for the new year.

1223
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,840
(- Is that Kwon Do Woo? - It's the Chuk Sa Gwang Band!)

1224
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,740
(The rhythm adds sophistication.)

1225
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,240
(This is a traditional folk dance performed by female dancers.)

1226
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,840
(The Chuk Sa Gwang Band leaves the stage.)

1227
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,610
So, did you receive the luck we just sent to you?

1228
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,940
Do you feel lucky?

1229
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,840
Did you see me dancing with this?

1230
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,540
I can use it like this,

1231
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,040
I can just hit it on each side, from the front and the back.

1232
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,740
"Was this the Joseon Dynasty's tambourine dance"?

1233
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:39,940
Yes, I can use it like a tambourine.

1234
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,240
She is my assistant for the day.

1235
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,610
Yes, my assistant.

1236
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,840
She is my teacher who leads the beat.

1237
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,140
This might be surprising to you, but her name is Sol Ji.

1238
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,340
(Surprisingly, her name is Sol Ji.)

1239
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,640
Let me apologise for that. Her nickname is drinking Ji.

1240
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,510
But she's also an amazing musician.

1241
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,040
Now, I'm going to show you...

1242
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,210
the Buddhist dance.

1243
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,740
It has been designated an...

1244
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,340
Important Intangible Cultural Property of Korea.

1245
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,410
It is a Buddhist ceremonial dance.

1246
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,140
I will put this red band around me.

1247
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,940
"Miss Goryeo"? You're right.

1248
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,940
Did you say, I look like a "Triangle kimbap"?

1249
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
I'm ready. Let me show you the dance now.

1250
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,440
(She is being reverent.)

1251
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,740
(It is considered the most artistic dance among all folk dances.)

1252
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,710
(- Can you play it faster? - Could we speed the beat up?)

1253
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,740
(She's moving very slowly.)

1254
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,840
(- It's healing me spiritually. - It's boring, but I love you.)

1255
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,640
(It's too slow for young people to watch.)

1256
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,510
(But she keeps dancing with the Buddhist monk's robe on.)

1257
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,410
(Concentrating)

1258
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,140
(The king of cameras appears out of nowhere.)

1259
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,040
(She hasn't seen him yet.)

1260
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,240
(She's startled.)

1261
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,610
(What is that?)

1262
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,040
(She fell down. She can't stop laughing.)

1263
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,040
(The camera man approaches her like a hyena.)

1264
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,840
(He gets as close to the dance as he can.)

1265
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,340
Let's go!

1266
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:21,240
(- Go away, ghost! - He looks like a satellite.)

1267
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,240
Wake up, wake up!

1268
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,040
You have lost your mind.

1269
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,540
(She fights her laughter alone.)

1270
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,840
Stay focused.

1271
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,740
(- Sol Ji is part of the song. - She's lost control.)

1272
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,440
(She tries to hold back the laughter.)

1273
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,840
(I will finish strong!)

1274
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,040
(And the master of dancing manages to finish her dance.)

1275
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,040
(- This dance makes me feel drunk. - It's healing me spiritually.)

1276
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,340
- What song do you want? - "MaMa".

1277
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,340
"MaMa" by Bobby Kim.

1278
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,740
You're very popular in this chat room.

1279
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,440
It's true. Everyone's talking about you.

1280
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,040
(He's maintaining his poker face.)

1281
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,240
("MaMa" sung by Park Seung Chul, a lighting team staff member.)

1282
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,140
Someone wrote, "The heart of perfection from Wisdom Sutra"

1283
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,140
(Mum)

1284
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,440
(I still remember)

1285
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,540
Sounds great!

1286
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,840
(It's a good song to sing at a dinner party.)

1287
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,740
(He is about to cry.)

1288
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,840
He's good.

1289
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,140
(He's tapping his foot to the music.)

1290
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,240
Someone wrote, "He sings like my boss."

1291
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,410
(He sings like my boss.)

1292
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,340
(He sounds like he's chanting Buddhist scriptures.)

1293
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,940
(It's a statue of Buddha.)

1294
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,240
(May you attain enlightenment.)

1295
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,040
(Where am I going)

1296
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,440
- I'll stop you there. - Okay.

1297
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,740
Did you hear that, everyone? "I'd like to order two more beers."

1298
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,240
(- Two more bottle of beer please! - He is too muscular to sing.)

1299
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,580
Yes, I feel like having a bottle of beer too.

1300
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,140
In the beginning, his voice wasn't singing to the melody,

1301
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,610
that's why he sounded unstable.

1302
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,410
(I still remember)

1303
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,940
I think he can sing a little higher. And then...

1304
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,740
you will sound more stable.

1305
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
You'll sing better too.

1306
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,040
By doing that you will be able to convey the emotions better.

1307
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,940
Park Jin Young say this all the time, "Vocalize while breathing".

1308
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,140
When you go to karaoke,

1309
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,840
there's a locked part on the machine. But if you...

1310
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,940
unlock and open it...

1311
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,340
- Ta-da. - Look at that.

1312
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,140
- They have something like this. - Okay.

1313
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,940
There's a dial that says "HI".

1314
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,140
Tweak the nob a little.

1315
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,710
Microphone check.

1316
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,740
It's not as clear, right?

1317
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,540
But if you adjust it a little,

1318
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:32,540
Microphone check.

1319
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,840
(His microphone test is unique.)

1320
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,510
Do you hear screeching sounds?

1321
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,140
You can adjust the sound by...

1322
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,210
controlling this dial as much as you want to.

1323
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,610
It will add that extra something to your voice.

1324
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,140
Let's try singing a song.

1325
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,640
- Are you raising the key? - Yes, I am.

1326
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,940
Because he's a tenor.

1327
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,340
(He's preparing himself.)

1328
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,040
Mama

1329
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,580
Do you hear the wheezy sounds?

1330
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,340
(His voice is conveying the emotions better.)

1331
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,210
(His voice was unstable before...)

1332
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,840
(as if he was chanting Buddhist scriptures.)

1333
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,140
I will always

1334
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,440
(He gives us a wink.)

1335
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,140
(He is full of confidence as he...)

1336
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,340
(finds the perfect key for his voice!)

1337
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,940
(- Drinking while breathing. - I'm feeling sad now.)

1338
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,040
(He makes eye contact with the camera.)

1339
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,140
(He's become a man of sensitivity. His emotions are exploding.)

1340
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,140
That was great.

1341
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,510
(He missed a beat.)

1342
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,680
(Although he missed the beat, he still sings with confidence.)

1343
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,740
I'm impressed.

1344
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,540
(He's getting emotional.)

1345
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,380
(Embracing my shadows)

1346
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,180
- That was awesome. - Bravo.

1347
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,280
(His singing problem was solved and everyone's delighted.)

1348
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,880
Did you hear how he finished that note?

1349
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,110
That's not easy to do.

1350
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,540
Did you hear how his tone changed?

1351
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,080
Dream researcher says "Min Soo finally gets a win."

1352
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,680
Thank you so much. I love you.

1353
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,280
I really love you. Here, take my heart.

1354
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,640
(- I enjoyed the song. - I cried listening to it.)

1355
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,180
Thank you. So this is what it feels like.

1356
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,780
It's time to learn about the history of ramyun.

1357
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,140
- S Company sells the most, right? - Yes, S Company.

1358
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,180
- Their ramyun came out in 1963. - In 1963.

1359
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,880
It was influenced by the ramyun in japan...

1360
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,280
- which were based on chicken stock. - I see.

1361
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,380
- Look at this. - I ate this a lot.

1362
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,540
- This is how we used to write Beef. - That's right.

1363
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,940
- This is from S Company, right? - Right.

1364
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,080
- S Company. - That's right.

1365
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,540
- Beef ramyun. - This ramyun from S Company...

1366
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,380
- will later on become this. - That's right.

1367
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,840
This is the ramyun they made in the 70s.

1368
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,540
- Do you have anything to add? - No.

1369
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,040
(There's nothing more to explain.)

1370
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,140
He didn't even hesitate.

1371
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,380
He doesn't care about the rival company.

1372
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,280
- Who remembers this? - Soybean paste ramyun!

1373
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,580
- It was released in 1979. - This was really tasty.

1374
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,180
- It was. - Why don't they make this anymore?

1375
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,380
I loved the hearty flavours.

1376
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,480
The majority of the public weren't too fond of...

1377
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,240
- paste flavoured ramyun. - I have to say this though.

1378
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,380
If this is how you're going to be,

1379
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,480
you'll need to maintain this level of enthusiasm.

1380
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,540
Don't get excited when we start talking about P Company.

1381
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,980
- Okay. - Do you understand?

1382
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,580
- I won't get excited. - I'm giving you a warning.

1383
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,480
Cao Lu will be familiar with these ones.

1384
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,780
- Okay. - Have you had this before?

1385
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,110
- I have! - Do you know the name?

1386
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
- It's frog ramyun. - No, it's Racoon ramyun.

1387
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,180
You aren't allowed to say brand names on television.

1388
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,580
- So let's just call it frog ramyun. - Is that so?

1389
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,640
- Okay, frog ramyun. - Yes.

1390
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,580
- But it's pretty obvious. - It's really delicious.

1391
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,380
Anyway, this is N ramyun.

1392
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,510
It's a steady seller.

1393
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,780
It's the first ramyun to use thick noodles.

1394
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,910
- Yes, thick noodles. - That's right.

1395
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,640
This ramyun has quite the tragic story.

1396
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,380
This is chlorella ramyun made by P Company.

1397
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,380
At that time, chlorella was very popular.

1398
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,940
- So we made ramyun with it. - It was quite expensive though.

1399
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,780
- This... - It was expensive.

1400
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,510
- Cuteness says, "It's green tea." - Green tea ramyun!

1401
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,180
Hyo the massager says "The Four Rivers Ramyun Project".

1402
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,780
(I have to laugh if I want to look cool.)

1403
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Because it's "Green Tea"?

1404
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,180
Now this is the product that made the ramyun market...

1405
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,680
- in Korea what it is today. - That's right!

1406
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,580
- It's a masterpiece. - Yes, it is.

1407
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,180
It's like a Samsung smartphone.

1408
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,680
It's a masterpiece.

1409
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,040
And this...

1410
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,480
is the masterpiece that made P Company...

1411
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,580
what it is today.

1412
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,980
It's a steady seller.

1413
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,280
"Mix with your right hand and with your left."

1414
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,840
This is the first Korean ramyun...

1415
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,780
- to use liquid flavour packets. - That's right.

1416
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,840
We still have the most knowledge on...

1417
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:23,380
- how to make liquid flavour packs. - Right.

1418
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,380
We collaborated with...

1419
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,040
a company in Japan and we came up with...

1420
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,910
- what you're seeing right now. - I see.

1421
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
The liquid sauces from other companies...

1422
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,780
I think that's enough.

1423
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,180
We don't want to promote...

1424
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,840
- any specific product. - Right.

1425
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,640
So let's leave it at that.

1426
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,680
Really? What's that?

1427
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,280
(The best ramyun from each ramyun company)

1428
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,480
(We cooked all of these in secret.)

1429
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,010
(They were all put into the same identical cups.)

1430
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,740
Really? What's that?

1431
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,580
- It's a blind taste test? - We're doing that now?

1432
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,480
Wouldn't this blind taste test make him even less credible?

1433
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,180
- They look identical. - I can't tell them apart.

1434
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,480
This is insane.

1435
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,840
- This will be difficult. - I know.

1436
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,110
(The answers are written on the bottom of the cup.)

1437
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,480
Can you guess which brand it is?

1438
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,980
Can't you tell by just looking at the noodles?

1439
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,180
Someone wrote, "Are you trying to get him fired?"

1440
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,280
He can do this.

1441
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,380
(- Nose, get to work. - What if he gets it wrong?)

1442
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,280
"He should get ready to write an apology letter."

1443
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,880
- What if he gets it wrong? - I'm doomed.

1444
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,940
- I don't know what these two are. - He's an expert.

1445
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,380
- He should know all these. - What's wrong?

1446
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,380
(Cao Lu goes ahead and eats one.)

1447
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,040
- This is the frog ramyun. - The frog ramyun?

1448
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,380
Just say the real name!

1449
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,180
- It's raccoon, not frog. - You can't say that on television.

1450
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,880
He's been in the business for 30 years.

1451
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,110
- Who are you trying to teach? - He still shouldn't say it.

1452
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,180
Okay. So you think this is frog ramyun?

1453
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,740
- Am I right? - You're right!

1454
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,880
- Really? - Yes.

1455
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,180
Yes! Should I become a ramyun fanatic?

1456
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,480
All right. Here he goes.

1457
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,740
(The expert gives it a go.)

1458
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,940
- This is squid jjamppong. - Is it squid jjamppong?

1459
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,640
That is correct.

1460
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,780
What's next?

1461
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,880
This is S ramyun from S company.

1462
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,080
S ramyun from S company.

1463
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,780
- Is he right? - No, that's incorrect

1464
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,140
This is Namja ramyun from P Company.

1465
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,840
That's where you work.

1466
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,180
In a blind taste test, this ramyun always wins.

1467
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,040
Really? This is your start product?

1468
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,380
- It's the next rising star. - Is that so?

1469
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,680
In a blind taste test 7 out of 10...

1470
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,280
prefer this ramyun.

1471
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,680
What's wrong with you? How could you not know?

1472
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,010
You can't air this.

1473
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,780
- This is a live show. - You can't air this.

1474
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,280
Everyone's already seen it.

1475
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,980
- This is a live show. - You cooked it for me...

1476
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,280
- earlier. - No, it's not.

1477
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,280
(There's no way I got this wrong.)

1478
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,380
I'm doomed.

1479
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,780
(I'm doomed.)

1480
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,140
Is this one cooked?

1481
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,680
(- He even cooked it earlier. - His desk will be gone tomorrow.)

1482
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,380
Come on. You can redeem yourself.

1483
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
He should at least know the ramyun his company makes.

1484
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,680
He's doomed. Will he still have a job tomorrow?

1485
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,180
This is S ramyun from N Company.

1486
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,280
S ramyun from N Company?

1487
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,380
S ramyun from N Company. That is correct.

1488
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,780
Here we go.

1489
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,280
- It's S ramyun. - S ramyun from S Company?

1490
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,080
- That's right. - You are correct.

1491
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,580
He seems to know the products from his rival companies well.

1492
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,110
But he can't tell apart his company's product.

1493
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,380
I received some urgent news.

1494
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,280
"The HR Team is finalizing the paper work as we speak."

1495
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,780
(You're lying!)

1496
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,840
(He drinks it like it's soju.)

1497
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,880
Hang on.

1498
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,540
Didn't I guess this one correctly?

1499
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,280
This? No, you didn't.

1500
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,380
- I didn't? - No.

1501
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,280
You're unbelievable.

1502
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,540
He still got many of them right.

1503
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,180
But he couldn't guess the ramyun...

1504
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,840
that he called...

1505
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,940
the star product of his company.

1506
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,080
- That's because... - Okay, we'll hear you out.

1507
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,540
That just shows how delicious it is.

1508
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,280
We're fourth in the business...

1509
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,040
but our products taste just as good.

1510
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:38,510
I was told to inform you, you don't need to come into work tomorrow.

1511
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,840
(He's sad.)

1512
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,580
- Would you like to say a few words? - Yes, he should.

1513
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,880
You might want to say something to your CEO.

1514
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,980
I was confused because...

1515
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,380
I've eaten this so many times.

1516
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,540
No, to be honest, we eat products made by our rivals more.

1517
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,740
So that is probably why I was so confused...

1518
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,740
(He chokes.)

1519
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,780
That's why I was confused.

1520
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,680
I hope you understand.

1521
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,940
You should drink some water.

1522
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,040
(He sacrifices himself to bring people laughter.)

1523
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,380
He choked on the noodles.

1524
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,780
I'm going to draw something with a Lunar New Year theme.

1525
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,010
We'll each draw the image that pops up when we think of theme.

1526
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,680
I'll do my specialty which is oil painting.

1527
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,380
We don't have a lot of time so we'll do this simultaneously.

1528
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,780
Do you want me to put this up?

1529
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,540
Why are you putting that up?

1530
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,080
One of us could cheat.

1531
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,040
Cheat? Why would I do that?

1532
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,780
You never know.

1533
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,880
- Really? Okay. - People change.

1534
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,380
- If you say so. - You might take a glimpse.

1535
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,180
It's like we're in separate rooms.

1536
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,540
Okay, so let's get started.

1537
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,780
Can you see what I'm doing?

1538
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,680
Do we get separate chat rooms as well?

1539
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,780
("Lee Mal Nyeon's Lonely Cartoon Life")

1540
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,380
Is that so?

1541
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,180
Let me show you this.

1542
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,740
This is what I clean my brushes with.

1543
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,040
I'm starting my drawing.

1544
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,180
- Sure, go ahead. - Okay.

1545
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,880
Oh, gosh. I spilt nearly all of it.

1546
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,740
You're running out of time.

1547
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,280
(- Yura hasn't started yet. - Mal Nyeon, be quiet!)

1548
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,040
Do you think you'll have enough time?

1549
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,180
Oh dear.

1550
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,780
(Glance)

1551
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,380
- Did you spill a lot? - It's none of your business.

1552
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,680
I hear you loud and clear.

1553
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
Now I'm ready.

1554
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,880
- So... - I have a big heart.

1555
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,380
I'm sure you do. Hang on, let me just...

1556
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,280
(- Yura ran away. - It's only been five minutes.)

1557
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,680
You need a lot of things when doing oil paintings.

1558
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,940
Now it's time to paint.

1559
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,240
- Let me guide you through it. - Are you sure you have time?

1560
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,740
They're saying that I'm running out of time.

1561
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,280
I'll leave it over here for now.

1562
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,740
Have you still not started yet?

1563
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,580
- Next I'll... - This isn't a joke.

1564
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,980
Hang on. I'm missing my white paint.

1565
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,280
This is not good. I'm in big trouble.

1566
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,380
Where's the white paint?

1567
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,380
Oh no. What now?

1568
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,480
(She stops because there's no white paint.)

1569
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,680
I'm doomed.

1570
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,540
Is this going to be an easy win?

1571
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,380
So it's Lunar New Year.

1572
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,580
Families gather around to celebrate the day.

1573
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,640
- Among them might be an aunt... - Right.

1574
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,540
- who brags about her kids. - Yes, there always is.

1575
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,040
So I'm going to draw some of the family members.

1576
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,680
Here's a nephew that's trying to...

1577
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,380
break something valuable in his uncle's collection.

1578
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,780
This is how I always draw people so...

1579
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,580
I'm sure that you'll be satisfied with my work.

1580
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,080
- Wow! - But the grandfather...

1581
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,880
This desk divider is useless.

1582
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,010
She still hasn't started.

1583
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,140
I can see what you've drawn on the screen.

1584
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,480
- You're right. - I don't know what to do.

1585
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,010
There's no white paint. What should I do?

1586
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,080
I'll have to make do without.

1587
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,980
So we start with the background.

1588
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,580
When you wake up, you see that the sky is so pretty...

1589
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,780
on the morning of Lunar New Year.

1590
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,980
Once you've done that, take a towel and...

1591
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,640
rub the oil paint to give it a smudged look.

1592
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,540
(- My heart is pounding so hard. - How can you not love her?)

1593
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,680
This is the sky.

1594
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,680
Let me try that, too.

1595
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,080
All right. So I've finished painting the sky.

1596
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,040
(He's giving us a real heart attack!)

1597
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,080
"You've already won."

1598
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,140
They're saying that I've already won.

1599
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,280
Why?

1600
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,940
They're saying that my painting of the sky is that good.

1601
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,940
That's absurd. I need you guys to be fair.

1602
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,540
All right.

1603
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,180
- What's wrong? - Got Yura wrote "Hurry up and..."

1604
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,080
- "go buy her white paint." - That's a great idea.

1605
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,840
That's it. I'm done!

1606
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,080
- I'll get you your white paint. - I was only kidding.

1607
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,280
- I'll be right back. - Where are you going?

1608
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,480
- I'm alone. - Keep going.

1609
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,740
They're asking you buy paint.

1610
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,280
I'll be back with some white paint for you.

1611
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,180
Now I'm going to draw roof tiles.

1612
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,180
I feel so lonely right now...

1613
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,480
- for some reason. - You should've been nice to me.

1614
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,180
Were you still here?

1615
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,740
You should've been nice when you had the chance.

1616
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,280
Okay, so now I'll draw the roof tiles.

1617
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,480
(Silent)

1618
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,580
(- Say something! - This is why we need Mal Nyeon.)

1619
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,810
I have stopped talking. This is bad.

1620
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,810
How do I communicate with the viewers?

1621
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,110
- Right now, I... - Have you finished drawing?

1622
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,380
I didn't buy white paint.

1623
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,810
Communicating with the viewers while drawing...

1624
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,710
- is very hard. - It's hard.

1625
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:56,810
- You need to concentrate. - It's very hard.

1626
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,610
But some viewers can get so childish.

1627
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,910
When I stop talking for even a second while I draw,

1628
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,080
they write "This is no fun" in the chat room.

1629
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,510
- Really? - It's hard to talk while you draw.

1630
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,310
No, I will try my best to communicate with the viewers.

1631
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,010
- Such is life. - You are making me look bad.

1632
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,510
- You should have supported me. - I didn't mean it like that.

1633
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,710
This is what I'm drawing.

1634
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,110
On the day of Lunar New Year, a grandfather is happily...

1635
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:24,110
watching ssireum.

1636
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,910
Since other family members don't care for ssireum,

1637
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,680
they are doing other things.

1638
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,710
You are good at drawing a tree.

1639
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,110
I only drew two branches so far.

1640
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,440
- It's not ginseng, is it? - What?

1641
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,610
It's not ginseng.

1642
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,410
- I need to add a few more details. - Okay.

1643
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,310
I have originally planned to draw...

1644
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,710
a magpie and beautiful snow.

1645
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,010
But I won't have enough time.

1646
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,110
I think I was too ambitious.

1647
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,010
- I glued my work on an envelope. - Stop boasting.

1648
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,910
I wanted to add more branches, too.

1649
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,910
I glued my work on an envelope.

1650
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,110
- Come on. - Now,

1651
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,410
I will put money in it.

1652
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,310
I don't have any money. Does anyone have money?

1653
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,510
Give me some money so I can put it in this envelope.

1654
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,980
- I messed up. - I'll put this in the envelope.

1655
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,580
- This is hard. - I told you so.

1656
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,210
I messed up.

1657
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,380
I will read the comments.

1658
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,110
"It looks like Lee Mal Nyeon's hair in 10 years."

1659
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,110
That will make a good title for the piece.

1660
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,910
- Let's use that as the title. - I have realised once again...

1661
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,410
how hard painting is.

1662
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,440
What comes next is a special on lips.

1663
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:25,580
About 70 to 80 percent of people don't know...

1664
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,480
how to take care of their lips.

1665
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,380
That's right. Dead skin cell are the biggest problem.

1666
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,810
Discolouration is another problem.

1667
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,810
So I will give you useful tips.

1668
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,710
Who is ready?

1669
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,910
My goodness.

1670
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,210
Hello.

1671
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,340
We have the Primary Schooler and the General.

1672
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,980
I won't give you any restrictions.

1673
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:49,210
Apply any lipsticks as you usually do.

1674
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,510
Here are the lipsticks.

1675
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,910
Some are moisturising and some are matte.

1676
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,110
- Have you picked one? - Yes.

1677
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,210
Apply the lipstick.

1678
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,210
- I need a mirror. - Right.

1679
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,010
All right.

1680
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,510
(They have different ways of applying lipstick.)

1681
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,080
The three women are applying lipstick.

1682
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,480
I will give you various tips shortly afterwards.

1683
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,710
- I'm done. - Okay.

1684
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,010
This is what the General did wrong.

1685
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,910
There are dead skin cells and scars on her lips.

1686
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,340
When she has dead skin on her lips,

1687
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,510
she rips it off unconsciously.

1688
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,010
This is what you should do with such lips.

1689
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,110
Take a wet tissue and lip balm in a pot.

1690
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,510
Put a generous amount of lip balm to the wet tissue...

1691
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,680
and remove the lipstick.

1692
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,910
Like this.

1693
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:35,210
This will really help your lips.

1694
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:38,710
Put some concentrated face oil to the wet tissue.

1695
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,180
And rub your lips.

1696
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,710
If you apply oil to dead skin and discoloured area...

1697
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,510
regularly,

1698
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,010
your lips will become glossy and moist.

1699
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,010
There is blood on her lips.

1700
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:55,280
Apply lip balm over discoloured areas of the lips.

1701
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,010
- My goodness. - What is it?

1702
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,210
Someone wrote that I look like Douner.

1703
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,810
Douner? Who is Douner?

1704
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:01,910
He is Dooly's friend.

1705
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:06,010
When you have pale skin and dyed hair,

1706
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,980
orange and reddish orange...

1707
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,180
make you pretty in a retro way.

1708
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,810
Since the General has plump lips,

1709
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:18,380
she shouldn't line her lips.

1710
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,910
And since her lips are very dry,

1711
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,810
it will help to apply lip balm over the lipstick.

1712
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,410
Don't use lip gloss when your lips are dry.

1713
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,410
It will only make your lips drier.

1714
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,710
Someone wrote that this should be my signature lip colour.

1715
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,810
Signature lip colour? That's right.

1716
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:33,910
She looks very cute.

1717
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,710
- It's The Primary Schooler's turn. - Okay.

1718
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:38,010
The Primary Schooler...

1719
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,380
Her lips are dry,

1720
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,710
but she hasn't pulled the dead skin on her lips.

1721
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,310
We will remove the lipstick.

1722
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,010
(She roughly handles the Primary Schooler's lips.)

1723
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,110
You do this.

1724
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,810
I look like a mother wiping off a child's drool?

1725
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,510
Goodness, my baby's lips are cracked.

1726
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,210
This is how I applied lip balm to my child yesterday.

1727
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:03,010
Now, get rid of excessive oil.

1728
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,710
Use a tissue paper.

1729
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,810
It's hard to apply lipstick along your cupid's bow.

1730
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,280
I will share an easy way to do it.

1731
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,510
Apply lipstick to about one tenth of a cotton bud.

1732
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,910
Lightly apply lipstick to the tip.

1733
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:18,510
Move the cotton bud back and forth along your cupid's bow.

1734
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,410
- It shaped your cupid's bow easily. - It did.

1735
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,510
Then take the cotton bud to your lower lip.

1736
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,180
This is how you sharpen the edges of your lips.

1737
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,710
Take a foundation...

1738
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,810
and apply some to the tip of a cotton bud.

1739
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:32,510
Sharpen the edges of your lips with a cotton bud.

1740
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:35,610
This way, you can use a cotton bud...

1741
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,510
to apply and erase the lipstick from your lips.

1742
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:40,410
It's an easy way to easily apply a dark lipstick.

1743
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,210
What do you think? Does she look pretty?

1744
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,710
Cotton buds are the best.

1745
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,110
Producer Dung, come over here.

1746
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:51,110
There aren't a lot of dead skin on her lips.

1747
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,380
Among the three of them, her lips are the best.

1748
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,380
This is what you can use as a substitute for lip balm.

1749
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,480
Eye cream is a good choice.

1750
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,280
It's effective for wrinkles on your lips.

1751
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,310
Rub eye cream on your lips.

1752
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:05,810
Gosh, her lips became so kissable.

1753
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,510
She has that innocent beauty.

1754
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,210
Let's apply a pink lipstick.

1755
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,080
Make the colour pop on the upper lip,

1756
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,980
but don't apply as much product on the lower lip.

1757
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,210
Women in their 20s like the look of a lip stain.

1758
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,180
There you go.

1759
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,810
She looks so innocent. The colour looks very pretty on her.

1760
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,410
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1761
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:30,110
Red, pink and reddish orange...

1762
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,110
are trendy colours of 2016.

1763
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,280
Keep that in mind.

1764
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,280
They go well with a retro outfit.

1765
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,280
It's very trendy.

1766
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,210
This time, I will show you a fan dance.

1767
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,910
Isn't this fan beautiful?

1768
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,210
(She begins the fan dance to the rhythm of janggu.)

1769
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,810
(Peek-a-boo)

1770
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,810
(Smiling)

1771
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,410
(People often think fan dance is a traditional dance of Korea.)

1772
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,010
(But the dance only emerged in 1954.)

1773
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,610
(Blooming)

1774
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,810
(Fans only serve as a decoration in fan dances of other countries.)

1775
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,910
(But the movements of the fan are crucial to the Korean fan dance.)

1776
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:17,010
(- Look at her triple axel. - I'm drunk on the Korean soul.)

1777
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:22,340
(It's an extravagant beauty hidden inside the sublime elegance.)

1778
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,610
(Flying Ye Ri)

1779
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,410
(She continues on with salpuri dance.)

1780
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,510
(It's a dance to ward off evil that utilises white outfit and shawl.)

1781
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,610
(Creeping)

1782
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,010
(Holding back laughter)

1783
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:41,110
(I won't laugh this time.)

1784
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,110
(Let's think of something sad.)

1785
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,910
(Your professionalism is impressive.)

1786
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:53,310
(The dance reaches its climax as the tempo quickens.)

1787
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,480
(- Salpuri dance is glamorous. - It's a funeral for the laughter.)

1788
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,010
(Salpuri dance transforms deep sorrow into beauty.)

1789
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,010
That was salpuri dance.

1790
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,910
I prepared salpuri dance with a wish to ward off evil...

1791
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,710
and bring good luck to everyone in the new year.

1792
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,280
If you would like to do something for your grandparents,

1793
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,550
take a white shawl and dance like this.

1794
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:20,180
You can even use a toilet paper to enjoy the salpuri dance...

1795
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,810
during a company dinner.

1796
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,510
I think it would be nice to have fun with the dance.

1797
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,010
Utilise an exfoliating towel?

1798
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:29,510
That's a good idea.

1799
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,440
I prepared the Chunaeng dance.

1800
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,510
During King Sunjo's reign, Crown Prince Hyomyeong...

1801
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,010
made the dance for his mother.

1802
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,610
Since this is a dance of the palace,

1803
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,610
we will need a king and a queen.

1804
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,080
Where did the king go?

1805
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:47,110
Put on your outfit and join us. Where is he?

1806
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,440
Your highness.

1807
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,710
Please come this way.

1808
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,710
Have you been drinking by any chance?

1809
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,710
His cheeks are red.

1810
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,610
- I swear I didn't drink alcohol. - Okay.

1811
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,810
My face gets flushed easily.

1812
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,380
All right.

1813
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,210
We will now show you the Chunaeng dance.

1814
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:06,110
Chunaeng dance...

1815
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,410
was originally done...

1816
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:12,910
on a small mat of about three square metres.

1817
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:17,810
(Crown Prince Hyomyeong turned a nightingale's chirp into a dance.)

1818
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:24,010
Showing a dancer's bare hands to the king was prohibited,

1819
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,610
so dancers hid their hands in long sleeves.

1820
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:33,710
(Movements of Chunaeng dance are perfectly controlled.)

1821
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:37,010
Your Highness, do you like the dance?

1822
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,480
- No. - You don't like it?

1823
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,580
I only have eyes for my queen.

1824
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,910
Your attention is focused on me.

1825
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,810
No, I was talking about my wife.

1826
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,210
No, I was talking about my wife.

1827
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,510
(Embarrassed)

1828
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,810
(Chunaeng dance is over.)

1829
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,210
Let's give Ms Park a round of applause.

1830
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,710
(She exits with a peculiar walk.)

1831
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:01,610
Let's learn the basic dance moves.

1832
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,280
We will first learn how to strengthen your lower abdomen.

1833
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,980
Please let me touch you for a second.

1834
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,110
All right. You need to tighten your lower abdomen.

1835
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,610
Your belly is very soft.

1836
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,610
Bring your feet together and push your knees forward.

1837
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,110
Your hips stay in position.

1838
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,910
Push your knees forward. That's right.

1839
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,010
Push your knees forward.

1840
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,110
This man...

1841
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,610
This man has a defective body.

1842
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,210
(- He is the king of defect. - He won't be a powerful king.)

1843
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,340
"The king of defect"?

1844
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,080
You need to work the muscles of your inner thighs.

1845
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,510
Blushing won't help you.

1846
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,310
Let's stretch out your arms first.

1847
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:36,510
Lower your body from that position.

1848
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:39,010
Stand on your toes and push your knees forward. Good.

1849
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,980
- You're doing really well. - So, I'm allowed to raise my heels?

1850
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,340
- Yes, of course. - Oh.

1851
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,550
I thought I wasn't allowed to lift them.

1852
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,550
(Why are you doing something that we never told you to do?)

1853
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,840
He finally realised that he was allowed to lift his heels.

1854
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,140
Now you know how to do it, right?

1855
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,640
As you go bend down, use your heels.

1856
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,840
Could you stop right there? Thank you.

1857
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,340
Hold that pose. We are going to hold this pose for 10 seconds.

1858
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:04,240
And 1, 2, 3, 4...

1859
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:10,240
again 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

1860
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,340
That was fantastic.

1861
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,810
(- Was he being tortured? - She is a strict instructor.)

1862
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,550
I will now announce the...

1863
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,240
half-time results for MLT-20.

1864
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,140
- They are announcing the results? - It's too soon.

1865
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,240
- They're out? - The half-time results?

1866
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,140
- Currently coming in third place... - They're not the final results.

1867
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,840
is "Jung Saem Mool's Colourful Life".

1868
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,240
(Jung Same Mool is coming third with 14,906 viewers.)

1869
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,140
- Currently coming in second... - Am I dead last?

1870
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,010
is Kim Gu Ra.

1871
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,340
- That's us. - Wow.

1872
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,240
- That's us. - Thank you.

1873
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,440
Currently coming in first place is...

1874
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,340
(Currently in first place)

1875
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,240
Currently in first place is "Yoo and Nyeon".

1876
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,640
- I knew we could do it. - We're coming in first place.

1877
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,240
- We're number one. - We're number one.

1878
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:57,940
- This is a great feeling. - Thank you, we won't let you down.

1879
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,110
- No, we won't. - Don't worry.

1880
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,610
- We're in last place. - Yes.

1881
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,010
(Crying)

1882
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,740
It's okay. I don't mind if I come in last place.

1883
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,010
- Half-time intermission... - I'm going to do my imitation.

1884
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,340
- I'm so happy right now, thank you. - Yes.

1885
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:15,940
"Lee Mal Nyeon, you should be grateful to Yura. You did nothing."

1886
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:19,410
I'm going to start drawing now.

1887
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,840
Here we go.

1888
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,050
As we go, it turns into happiness

1889
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,640
We're starting to develop chemistry and teamwork.

1890
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:30,050
(We watch and listen.)

1891
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,240
It tastes different now.

1892
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,240
Round and round we go

1893
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,840
