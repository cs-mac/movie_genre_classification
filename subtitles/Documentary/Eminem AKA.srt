1
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,030
Counselor! I've got him!

2
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,238
Down! You come down!

3
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,619
Down for good!

4
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,493
Forgive this early intrusion.

5
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,057
How are you?

6
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,660
I am a great admirer of yours.
Honored to meet you.

7
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:06,470
May I?

8
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:10,405
Can I use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,506
Your arm, please. Relax it.

10
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,311
- Your age?
- 43.

11
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,882
So, what are you cooking up?

12
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,286
Another film without hope?

13
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,448
- First time taking the cure?
- Yes.

14
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:31,620
Take a deep breath.

15
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:34,286
Come in.

16
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:39,361
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- No, do come in.

17
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:40,828
Breathe in.

18
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,474
Deeper.

19
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:49,678
Good morning... May I smoke?

20
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,180
Cough.

21
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,486
Breathe in.

22
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,584
- You've already read it?
- Yes.

23
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:04,920
Breathe.

24
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,199
And... what do you think?

25
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:14,763
Well, I made some notes,
but we'll talk later.

26
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,601
Your system is a bit worn out.
You may get dressed now.

27
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,836
Nice looking girl. American, right?

28
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,440
You've got some fine merchandise there.

29
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,414
This treatment will do you good,
you'll see.

30
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,656
Nurse. 300 ml of holy water,

31
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,558
3 doses to be taken at 15 minute intervals,
on an empty stomach.

32
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:42,154
- Mud bath every other day...
- What time is it?

33
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:46,426
After the mud bath, ten minutes in the
mineral water as prescribed...

34
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,335
- I'll wait for you at the spring.
- Yes, thank you.

35
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,192
Sir!

36
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,431
Sir, your glass.

37
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,915
Over here.

38
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,749
You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

39
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:27,450
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

40
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:31,018
Frankly, I wouldn't want to be
the one to cause you any trouble.

41
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,359
No, don't worry.
I'm the one who called you in.

42
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,892
On first reading it's evident

43
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:40,835
that the film lacks a problematic,
or a philosophical premise...

44
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,302
Would you like to sit down?

45
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,173
...making the film
a series of gratuitous episodes,

46
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,044
perhaps amusing
for their ambiguous realism.

47
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:55,046
One wonders what the authors
are trying to say...

48
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,950
Are they trying to make us think?
To scare us?

49
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,550
From the start, the action reveals
a poverty of poetic inspiration.

50
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:07,986
Forgive me, but this might be
the definitive proof

51
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:14,061
that cinema is 50 years
behind all other arts.

52
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:17,130
The subject doesn't even have the merits

53
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:21,474
of an 'avant garde' film,
but it has all the shortcomings.

54
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:25,511
Here, my notes.
I doubt they will be helpful.

55
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:31,912
It's still a mystery that you'd think of me

56
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,016
for a collaboration that, frankly,
I don't think can work.

57
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,759
No, no. On the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

58
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:45,568
You see, the film...
I really want to make this film.

59
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:48,799
I postponed the shoot
for two weeks because...

60
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:57,238
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.

61
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,543
Mezzabotta! Mario!
You're here too?

62
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,381
Guido!

63
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,391
What happened to you!

64
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,596
Hey, big Guido, how are you?

65
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:18,066
You've sprouted quite a few
white hairs, old Snaporaz!

66
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,663
Are you drinking that stuff?
It's bad for you.

67
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:25,002
They said my liver is, well...
And you, what's your treatment?

68
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,946
Just a second... Gloria!

69
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:34,750
- Your daughter. She's all grown up.
- No, she's not my daughter.

70
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,423
Cruel bees, sucking all the life
from these poor flowers.

71
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:45,084
- Darling, this is my friend...
- I'm sorry. My shoes...

72
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:48,428
Gloria. Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,500
Fine, thank you.

74
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,395
I know all about you.
Pupi always, always tells me.

75
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:58,931
We even had a big fight
when I was very critical of your last film.

76
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,872
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

77
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,777
Let's go for a drink. Let's go.

78
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,214
And you, are you here alone?
And your wife?

79
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,685
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Better that way...

80
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:13,182
Well, I mean, better in general...

81
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,759
You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

82
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,458
We're waiting for an annulment.

83
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:22,624
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

84
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,228
Congratulations.

85
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,469
Well, big Guido. What are you
working on? Something good?

86
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,036
Sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.

87
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,736
Daumier, the author, Miss...
Pardon me, what is your name?

88
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,244
- Gloria.
- Gloria Morin.

89
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,875
Nice to meet you.
I am a big admirer of yours.

90
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,416
I'm flattered.

91
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:44,610
Are you an actress?
Did I see your photo somewhere?

92
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,190
An actress. Yes, well...

93
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:52,058
I have ambitions in that area.
Actually enormous ambitions,

94
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,324
but that's all, for the moment.

95
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:55,762
She's got a degree in philosophy.

96
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,926
Allow me. Mario Mezzabotta.
- Nice to meet you.

97
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,960
I don't have a degree.
I'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.

98
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,667
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

99
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,875
The loneliness of modern man
in contemporary theater.

100
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,941
Interesting subject. Right, Professor?

101
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,879
And what is the meaning
of the capricious apparitions

102
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:16,715
of the girl of the spring?

103
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,922
An offer of purity?
Of warmth to the protagonist?

104
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:24,553
Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst...

105
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,938
She didn't make it. Better that way.

106
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:38,965
- Yack! How are you?
- Not too bad.

107
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,061
- Did anybody recognize you?
- I don't think so.

108
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,696
You brought all that luggage?

109
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,175
It's just five suitcases.
Gowns occupy so much space.

110
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,905
I brought one... you'll see.
Did you get it all?

111
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,040
Carla, it's quiet here at night.
There's nothing going on.

112
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,574
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows,

113
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,917
some trendy clubs,
even at our hotel.

114
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,685
Have you been behaving?
- Yes, yes.

115
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:04,625
Actually... I couldn't get you a room
in my hotel,

116
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,664
and besides it's full of people who know me.

117
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:10,924
So, I found someplace else.
A perfect hotel...

118
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,433
Very pretty, you know...
- But why?

119
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,602
- And how's this guy?
- Sgulp? Great.

120
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,744
You look a little pale. How come?

121
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,808
See, the hotel is right here.

122
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,282
Signora, guests!

123
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,617
See. Like I told you. It's not...

124
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,983
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,

125
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,184
I'll get them to bring a couple
of sandwiches.

126
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:40,218
It feels a little sad here.
- No, it's typical!

127
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,555
Besides I'm hungry.
You had lunch, but I didn't.

128
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,232
Hello, Sir.

129
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,394
How's the solitaire coming along?

130
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,439
Everything's ready,
the room, the bathroom.

131
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,838
Rest assured.
Signora will feel at home.

132
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,468
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't
have anything ready for lunch?

133
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,102
- The restroom, please?
- It's over there.

134
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,306
I'll see to it personally.

135
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,913
Trains, such horrible things.
They leave your hands so black.

136
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,748
Are you happy I'm here?
- Yes.

137
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,224
- Really happy or a little happy?
- Very happy.

138
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,191
Hmm. Smack!

139
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,595
Mm, what a nice smell!

140
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:16,165
Guido, I thought this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

141
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:19,134
- Really? Good, good.
- But no. Not a wrinkle.

142
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:20,995
Even after a three-hour trip.

143
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:30,205
You didn't even tell me you like it.
Do you like it?

144
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,110
Such a beautiful lady!

145
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,082
So refined.
That thing she has on her head...

146
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,144
What is it? Ploosh?

147
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,918
- Plush, plush.
- Ah, ploosh.

148
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,694
I looked around for it like crazy.
I was quite desperate.

149
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:50,225
But you know me.
When Carla makes up her mind...

150
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,164
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

151
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,264
I read a good Donald Duck last week...

152
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,966
There was a dinosaur...

153
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,408
- Here she is, my sweet-buns.
- Be good, a dinosaur...

154
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:04,642
Guido be good.
What do you want to do now?

155
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:07,509
Are you sure you've been behaving?
- Sure, why?

156
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:12,644
Anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry.
Oh, my wedding ring.

157
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,916
Listen, Guido.
That little thing you promised me...

158
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,387
What little thing?

159
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,828
Now I bet she brings up
her husband again.

160
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:25,801
You don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

161
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:30,131
My poor Luigi doesn't seem
happy at all.

162
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,700
You see, my husband is not
the confident type.

163
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,202
He gets depressed.

164
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:39,843
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very clever...

165
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,275
It's so hot here!

166
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,650
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

167
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,489
He just needs a push.

168
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,956
He's still working at the
fuel company, same salary.

169
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:51,959
Really?

170
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,794
Be good and put down my purse.
You'll break it.

171
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:58,130
I love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

172
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,268
Why don't you find him a job?

173
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,905
You know so many people.
You've promised it so many times.

174
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,274
I even had a dream about it.

175
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,278
I dreamed that
you did find him a job,

176
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,080
but he'd lost his mind
and killed us both.

177
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,387
- Who?
- You and me!

178
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,354
Know where we were?

179
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,551
In that little street, Via della Croce,
where I bought you

180
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:28,564
the same tie your wife did.
Do you remember?

181
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:32,932
And I never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

182
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,607
We were there on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked.

183
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,875
And he came in and he killed us
both with a broom!

184
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,909
- Draw the blinds more.
- Yes.

185
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:54,380
That's it. Now go into
the corridor for a minute,

186
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,084
then pretend you've come
to the wrong room

187
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,593
and found a stranger.

188
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,997
Oh, that's good.
We've never done this one.

189
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:02,825
Hold it there.
Let me look at you.

190
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,868
No. No. Your make-up
needs to be more, more...

191
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:13,033
- More what?
- More like a slut!

192
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,105
Give me your eyeliner.

193
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,517
- Nice lampshade.
- Yes, yes.

194
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,579
- I'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

195
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,354
What is this hotel called?

196
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:29,820
The Railway Hotel.

197
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,324
I want to write to my
husband so he'll send me

198
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,796
an express letter right away.
He writes such nice letters.

199
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,465
I'll let you read them.
- Fine, but keep still...

200
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,834
Make a slutty face.

201
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,534
Go out in the corridor.

202
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,008
- So, it's a part I have to play.
- Yes.

203
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,637
Who do you think I am?
One of your actresses?

204
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:51,941
You don't think
I could be one of them?

205
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:55,283
Not me. I wouldn't want
to lead that life.

206
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,319
I like staying home.

207
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,884
Go on, get out. I'm sleeping now.

208
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,588
Tell me. If I were really
to do something like this,

209
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,857
would you be jealous?

210
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,032
Why? Would you really?

211
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,100
Who knows?

212
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:19,434
- May I get you something?
- No, I just came out on a whim.

213
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,070
- Would you like me to run you a bath?
- No, I was just...

214
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,171
- A glass of water, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

215
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,517
What did she want?
What did she say?

216
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:33,488
The owner, she wanted
to give me a glass of water.

217
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,754
Come here. Come.

218
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,494
Open up the sheet.

219
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:46,558
- Guido, do you love me a little?
- Yes, yes.

220
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,688
Is that you, Mama?

221
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:22,166
So many tears, my son,
so many tears.

222
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,035
Papa, wait! Don't go.

223
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,402
We talked so little.

224
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,016
Listen Papa,
I have so many questions.

225
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,650
I cannot answer them yet.

226
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:43,353
See the ceiling here? It's so low.

227
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:47,786
I would have liked it higher.
It's ugly, my son, ugly.

228
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:53,098
I would have liked it different.
Couldn't you take care of it?

229
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,228
You used to draw so well. I'd like...

230
00:21:56,706 --> 00:22:00,335
Oh, the Commendatore,
he shouldn't have bothered.

231
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:08,677
- Hello.
- Respects. He's got very little time.

232
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,512
Hi.

233
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,685
How is he doing, this son of mine?

234
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:18,452
Careful. Don't let him move you.

235
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:23,391
He isn't doing well? How come?

236
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:27,003
It is so hard, realizing that
one has made such huge mistakes.

237
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:27,867
But I...

238
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,573
Mother prepared you
a little something.

239
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,048
A little cheese and two peaches.

240
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:41,808
Don't worry about me.

241
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,350
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

242
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,389
but your mother comes every day.

243
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:51,086
She keeps me company, you know.
And keeps everything in order.

244
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:53,326
A little decorum is always necessary.

245
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,427
That's how we were brought up.

246
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,758
And with your wife, Luisa -- all fine?

247
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:59,200
Yes. Luisa...

248
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,634
You two together have been
my joy. Goodbye, son...

249
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,504
What is this place?
Do you like it here?

250
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,049
I haven't figured it out yet.

251
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:20,049
But it's going much better.

252
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:25,528
At first, you see, at first...

253
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:32,562
Guido! I do my best.
What more can I do?

254
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,210
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

255
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:50,744
I'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

256
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:51,947
What are you thinking about?

257
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,588
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,072
Good afternoon.

259
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:16,233
Guido! In a few days,
I'll get you an introduction

260
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,797
so you can get
all the advice you need.

261
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,507
Nice mystical figure. Right?

262
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,968
I brought you the three old men.

263
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,037
One is a Russian,
another is a retired general...

264
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:26,206
What old men?

265
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,874
The ones for the role of the Father.

266
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,078
Cover me, Cesarino...

267
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,316
Come here, buffoon.

268
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:38,520
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

269
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,192
- I called you six times.
- Yes, yes I know.

270
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:43,391
- It's about Claudia's script.
- So?

271
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,128
I thought about mailing it to you.

272
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,192
In fact, I've already mailed it.
- Really?

273
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,304
You've still got your looks.
Why don't you go back to acting?

274
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,773
I was up all night with
an idea for the spaceship.

275
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,434
Why don't we make the upper story...

276
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,276
Conocchia, don't take my arm!
I hate it! And wear a jacket!

277
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,375
Now I need to wear a jacket
to talk to you...

278
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,508
How are you? How was your trip?

279
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:05,554
Good. It's been an hour...

280
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:11,150
What a blinding vision! Beautiful!

281
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:15,792
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,133
You're always telling me
I'm 'bellissima'

283
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,431
but you never tell me about my part.

284
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:24,398
How was my screen test?
- Great, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:30,705
They told me I have to look
motherly and eat a lot of pasta.

286
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:35,173
I should gain six pounds. Is this all?

287
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:37,444
See? You already know
more than I do.

288
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:41,048
You are the author.
You should be telling me something.

289
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,285
- What should this lady do?
- What?

290
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,588
Agostini!

291
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,561
I don't want to bother you.
The hotel is grand,

292
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,797
the whisky, excellent.
But I have three questions.

293
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,637
Yes, yes, later. What is it?
Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.

294
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:00,574
Agostini, we should...

295
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:03,134
I just didn't feel like talking to that guy.

296
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,244
Claudia is getting offers
from all over the world.

297
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:09,449
I can't keep her waiting.
Give her something.

298
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,645
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

299
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:15,657
Does Claudia realize that this
might be a great part?

300
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:18,923
Perhaps the best she's ever
played? I'll explain...

301
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,461
I'm telling you as a friend,
you're gonna lose her.

302
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:32,235
- You want to see the old men or not?
- Are you crazy? We're ready...

303
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,042
What?
- The old men.

304
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,236
- Where are they?
- Here.

305
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:39,140
Signora Carla called. She doesn't
want to stay in that hotel.

306
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,581
It's ugly. She's right.
- What can I do? Bring her here?

307
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,247
I'll call the old men.

308
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,515
Sorry, I wanted to introduce you
to my little wife.

309
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:50,424
Thrilled.

310
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,954
She writes too. She's a columnist
for some ladies' magazines.

311
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:57,795
She's got a few questions for you.

312
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:01,359
My readers go crazy for romance.

313
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:05,730
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

314
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,174
Here they are.
Say hello to the Dottore.

315
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:12,707
Step down. You too, General.

316
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,412
- How old are you?
- 70.

317
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,215
- And you?
- 64.

318
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,587
- And you?
- 68.

319
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:27,192
They aren't old enough.

320
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,026
What? This one
has one foot in the grave.

321
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:31,363
Next time I'll get three corpses.
You asked for a pathetic type...

322
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:35,269
This one makes you wanna cry
the minute you see him.

323
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:42,142
Hello, Commendatore.

324
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,408
If you kneel, what do I do?

325
00:28:48,484 --> 00:28:50,008
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.
How are you, little Guido?

326
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:54,417
Hello, Commendatore.

327
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,720
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

328
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:57,555
Where's the swimming pool?

329
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:59,492
We haven't even checked in. Shut up!

330
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,022
Has the treatment helped?
- Yes.

331
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,290
- Feeling better? Here.
- What is it?

332
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:03,490
Just a token.

333
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,396
- You're always giving me presents.
- It's just like mine.

334
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,729
It doesn't need winding.

335
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,734
A watch! A little watch, everyone!

336
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:15,876
- So, are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, I really think so.

337
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,413
We've got the Americans...

338
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:49,611
I've seen her passport.
She's 52 years old?

339
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,613
Ah, she's a little girl.

340
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,240
Good evening, signora.

341
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:56,781
And who are you, darling?

342
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:06,010
Mr. Director, another little question...

343
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,527
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

344
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:16,896
Thank you, I got it.

345
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,657
You want to know about
my political affiliation.

346
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:24,100
As an honest man,
and all of you Italians are,

347
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,165
you should be able to answer me.

348
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:31,475
Is Italy an essentially Catholic country?

349
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,208
Yes, it is!

350
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:34,216
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

351
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:37,550
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

352
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:42,520
I need to talk to you later,
face to face,

353
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,892
I'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

354
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:50,330
Fine, we'll discuss it later.
What was that about your cholesterol?

355
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,046
...only one great writer.
The early Fitzgerald.

356
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:19,288
Then his writing became an orgy
of pragmatism or brutal realism.

357
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:23,027
What does Left or Right mean?

358
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:25,966
You're such an optimist
to believe that in a world

359
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,833
this confused and chaotic
there are people so lucid

360
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:32,067
as to belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right.

361
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:36,272
The Americans have this new
theory about cholesterol...

362
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,347
- Is your ice-cream good?
- Very good.

363
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,449
Could you say approximately
how many scenes she'll be in?

364
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,523
What?

365
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:49,718
- How many scenes?
- Five.

366
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,388
Only five.

367
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,121
Maybe six, or even seven.

368
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,858
Good evening.

369
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:59,794
Hi, Guido.

370
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:03,301
The Ambassador's got his eye on signora.

371
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:09,833
So?

372
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,812
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Good, now I know.

373
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,675
- Do you want me to ask her to dance?
- Yes, ask her.

374
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:17,547
Dear friends there's only one truth...

375
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:22,856
But I am so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

376
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,520
I need to coexist with my character
for a while before shooting...

377
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:29,723
The lady says she needs
to know her character.

378
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:36,798
I need to get inside her skin,
her ideas, or I'll fail.

379
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,707
Hasn't the Maestro explained
the part yet?

380
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:42,369
- No.
- I am sorry, dear lady.

381
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:46,074
I don't have such information.
I'm only the producer.

382
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:50,283
Guido, isn't it true that I know nothing?
- Right. Not a thing.

383
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,358
And now three days of rest.

384
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:08,401
They look like glass.
The first cherries of spring.

385
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:13,935
Thanks. And for Guido?

386
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,875
Mario Mezzabotta,
all 200 pounds of him.

387
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:26,846
Shall we take a little walk?

388
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:37,556
I know... Naturally,
you think I've lost it.

389
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:38,463
Yes.

390
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,695
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- It's all right.

391
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:46,071
I may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

392
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:53,649
Could you create something important,
beautiful and real on a commission?

393
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:55,674
For instance, if the Pope asked you?

394
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:58,682
Yes, yes. I'll think about it.
Excuse me.

395
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,216
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

396
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:06,752
Maybe she's only with me
for the money.

397
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,253
Actually, that's certainly it.

398
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:12,059
But I've never felt closer
to anybody in my life.

399
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:17,269
Just look at her.
She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

400
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,767
She has it all. Only for the money?

401
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,404
But there are so many rich young men
around these days, loads of them.

402
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,741
It's clear. She cares for you.

403
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:29,411
Right. And she hasn't tried
to pressure me.

404
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:31,946
I made up my mind rationally.

405
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,557
The poor thing has never
even mentioned my wife,

406
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,888
my family, never a reproach.

407
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,525
How did you meet her?

408
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:44,457
In London. She was in school
with my daughter.

409
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,192
How many years have you
been married?

410
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:49,100
Many. 31.

411
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,803
And your wife...

412
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:54,305
My wife took it really badly.
She hates her.

413
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:58,407
While Gloria, poor thing,
is fond of her.

414
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,016
So spell it out. I am a fool!

415
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,853
There must be a shooting schedule.
Dates.

416
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:09,084
Otherwise we're off to Germany.
We have other offers.

417
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:12,252
Will you be leaving me
in the dark 'til the end?

418
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,725
You look like a little snail.

419
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:21,468
- What is a little snail?
- Une petite escargot.

420
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,142
Can you hear the voice
of the springs?

421
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,743
The Romans used to call it
'Happy Waters.'

422
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:52,861
Maya, let's entertain these bores.

423
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:55,566
May I?

424
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,908
Are you ready, Maya?
What am I holding?

425
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:04,042
A velvet purse.

426
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:06,838
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

427
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,712
A red one.

428
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,488
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

429
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,255
- A purse.
- Is there any money in it?

430
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,495
2,725 lire.

431
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:26,026
And this lady here.
What is she thinking?

432
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,165
No dirty thoughts, I hope.

433
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,670
Just think about something.

434
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:30,966
About what?

435
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,507
Whatever you like.
Are you thinking?

436
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:34,704
Yes.

437
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:38,244
I'd like to live another 100 years.

438
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,914
Best of luck!

439
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:46,913
And what is in this pretty
lady's head?

440
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:48,320
Let me be.

441
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,622
May I think about someone?

442
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,388
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!

443
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:56,197
Forget about it. I'm ashamed.

444
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,960
What about?

445
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,725
Can I really think of a person?

446
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:02,430
I'd be afraid to have my thoughts read.

447
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,472
Don't you worry darling,
no risk there.

448
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,337
Would you like to leave? It's cold.

449
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:09,639
A little kiss and a big slap.
Is that right?

450
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:15,572
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, 'What a trickster.'

451
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,313
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick.

452
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:21,550
And it isn't just a coincidence.

453
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:24,057
It's an exceptional example
of magnetic fields and telepathy.

454
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:27,391
I transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.

455
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,958
You! Do you believe
you can hide your thoughts?

456
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:43,139
Please, leave her alone.
Don't insist.

457
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,210
Thoughts are sacred.

458
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:48,006
See, it's all a game.

459
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,276
Maya, are you ready?

460
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,853
Just a moment, could we know
what you gentlemen are thinking?

461
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,182
You for instance.

462
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:57,657
What are you thinking?

463
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,694
What else? My director.
My cross and my delight.

464
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,298
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

465
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,899
It has been quite a while... years!

466
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,993
Unfortunately yes, my dear.

467
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:11,368
Just a moment. You're famous now.

468
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,537
Cut it out.
Just tell me what's your trick?

469
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:19,172
Well, it's partly a trick,
but part of it is real.

470
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:22,081
I don't know how, but it happens.
- Can you transmit anything?

471
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,676
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

472
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:27,317
- Do you want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

473
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,586
I bet now, with you, it won't work.

474
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:39,900
I don't understand. I can't repeat...

475
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:10,058
Asa... nisi... masa?
Is this right?

476
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,292
- Right?
- Yes.

477
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:15,694
But what does it mean?

478
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:24,211
Guido, come here!
Where are you?

479
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,977
Don't be spoiled! What a wonder!

480
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,380
I don't want to take a bath,
I don't want to...

481
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,940
Come here... Iet me catch you?

482
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,416
I know what that rascal wants.

483
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,079
He wants to be carried
by his sweetheart,

484
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:34,747
doesn't he, the strapping lad.

485
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:37,792
Come here. Come here.

486
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,192
He never wants to take
the wine bath, the naughty boy.

487
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:42,890
Don't you know that if you do
you'll grow into a strong man?

488
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:46,059
Guido is scared! Guido is scared!

489
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:00,011
The Devil and damnation!

490
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:09,750
Granny, granny!

491
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,554
The wood is all wet this year.

492
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,424
This prowling cat is just
like your grandfather.

493
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,963
Always on the prowl
and only comes in for food.

494
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,294
Shame on you! Go to bed.

495
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:23,767
Last time I slammed the door
in his face

496
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,966
and left him outside for two days.

497
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:32,069
I could have married again
and found a handsome man,

498
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:35,206
rest assured, better
than your grandfather.

499
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,710
What an idiot I am!

500
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,518
I thought that if I took another
husband, my first husband,

501
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:46,493
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't have waited.

502
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:50,522
Be quiet! Go to bed, children!

503
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,986
Nanny, Claudio wet himself!

504
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:25,192
What are you doing?
Go to sleep. You too, sleep.

505
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,903
Little Guido, get under the covers.
It's cold. Be still.

506
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:41,776
Did you say your prayers?

507
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:46,812
Aren't you a beautiful sticky bun?
The most beautiful!

508
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:48,685
Give me a kiss, too.

509
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:51,726
Who do you love best? Me?
Is that right?

510
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:53,624
You can't fool me.

511
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,822
I'm going to give you a spanking.

512
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:03,304
I can tell when you're pretending.

513
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:08,235
Sleep tight, little creatures.

514
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:10,505
Close your eyes.

515
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:28,889
Guido, don't close your
eyes tonight!

516
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,398
It's the night the portrait's eyes move.
You're not scared, are you?

517
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:32,933
You must be quiet!

518
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,663
Uncle Agostino will look into
the corner and find the treasure!

519
00:43:35,737 --> 00:43:37,671
Don't be afraid, Guido!
We'll be rich!

520
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:44,838
Do you remember the spell?
Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!

521
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,839
Sir, you got two or three calls from Rome.
Your wife, I think.

522
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:26,183
Fine. Get me the line.

523
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,885
- Gino, get the gentleman the line.
- All right.

524
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,916
- This is for you. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

525
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,722
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

526
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:50,509
No, I'm not offended.

527
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,178
There's only one thing
that offends me.

528
00:44:54,383 --> 00:45:01,186
You know me. No.

529
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,183
I forgive him everything.

530
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:16,604
Let's have a little chat.

531
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:18,530
Sit beside me for a moment.

532
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:22,131
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired and waiting for a call.

533
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:24,570
Would you like some?

534
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:26,443
No, thank you.
I have such a headache.

535
00:45:27,649 --> 00:45:28,775
Give me your hands.

536
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,417
No, sit down.

537
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:36,049
I have a healing fluid
in my left hand.

538
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,616
I put it on my belly when it aches.

539
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,691
Take off your hat.

540
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:46,860
Is it any better?

541
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:52,900
Yes, maybe.

542
00:45:57,979 --> 00:45:59,344
Why do you look at me that way?

543
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:04,613
Oh, don't say I'm beautiful.
You make it sound insulting.

544
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,450
What's with you?

545
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:09,415
I don't know.

546
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:18,190
I feel I made all the wrong
decisions in my life and in my work.

547
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:25,573
Tell me, why do you enjoy
torturing me?

548
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,207
Torturing you?

549
00:46:28,343 --> 00:46:30,709
Talk to me as you would
to an old friend.

550
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:34,239
I need to feel close to my director.

551
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:42,448
Did you see my last movie,
the one shot in Belgrade?

552
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:47,123
My character was a woman
marked by the injuries of time,

553
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:50,164
yet still desirable...

554
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:53,732
- Play "Mystification".
- I don't know it.

555
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,600
But yes...

556
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,535
What a character... this woman...

557
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,568
But...

558
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,509
In whom people find protection
and love.

559
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:08,446
I am this character.
I am like her in life and love.

560
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:11,212
That's why I'm so lonely.

561
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,055
And I have always forgiven
everything in the man...

562
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,751
the men, I love.

563
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:20,391
- Sir, Rome on the line.
- Thank you.

564
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,862
I am very sensual. Wicked, too!

565
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:24,899
Yes, yes, you're very close.
I'll be right back.

566
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,804
Rome on the line. You may speak.

567
00:47:32,874 --> 00:47:33,898
Hello, yes!

568
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:36,466
- Do you want Luisa?
- Yes.

569
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:39,639
Feeling guilty, you beast?
This is Rossella.

570
00:47:39,714 --> 00:47:42,547
Hi, Rossella. How are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

571
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:46,644
Where were you this time?
Your rest cure? What an excuse...

572
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,552
Here comes Luisa.

573
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:52,056
Guido, I called you twice.
Where were you?

574
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:53,856
I know. I'm sorry.

575
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,830
I was up in the production office.
We're working.

576
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:57,999
How are you?

577
00:47:58,066 --> 00:48:00,728
Not bad... And the treatment?

578
00:48:00,802 --> 00:48:02,929
Is it helping?

579
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:06,804
Perhaps. But, you know,
I can't really rest.

580
00:48:07,008 --> 00:48:08,532
And you? What are you doing?
Having fun?

581
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,339
The usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, Enrico.
They were about to leave.

582
00:48:12,414 --> 00:48:14,848
But are you having a good time?
Did you meet anybody?

583
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,645
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.

584
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:18,618
But for my work, it's better this way.

585
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,813
- Good night, Guido.
- 'Night.

586
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:24,657
You've met no one you know?
Are you always alone?

587
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:26,057
Of course.

588
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:27,723
Really?

589
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:31,561
Luisa, why don't you come visit?

590
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,695
Just a short stay.
It's easy to get here.

591
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:35,999
When are you going
to start shooting, you bore?

592
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:38,130
I don't know.
Let me talk to Luisa, please.

593
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,772
So, should I come?
Do you want me to?

594
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:42,434
If you'd like to.

595
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,640
You could even bring a friend.

596
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,941
But would it make you happy?

597
00:48:46,014 --> 00:48:48,346
Of course, or I wouldn't ask you.

598
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,608
- Sir, are you staying on?
- No.

599
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:52,449
When should I come?

600
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,748
Whenever it's good for you.

601
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:55,255
Careful, I'll come.

602
00:48:55,323 --> 00:48:57,223
Darling, I wouldn't have asked.

603
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:59,886
I'd love it...
So long, and good night.

604
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:01,553
Bye, Mr. Alienated. Good night.

605
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:04,292
Night, Guido.

606
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,738
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought...

607
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:17,642
Just a second, madam. I am going
to step into the office so...

608
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:20,112
- Shit!
- It's in my best interest.

609
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:22,308
Tomorrow morning
we'll discuss everything. All right?

610
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,124
Beams for the central structure:
10,000.

611
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,358
Planks for steps: 260.

612
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:36,821
'Evening.

613
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:37,824
Do you need something?

614
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:39,457
No, thanks.
Go on with your work.

615
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:43,126
What a well-behaved
production team.

616
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:46,266
Hi.

617
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:48,442
Oh, hi Eleonora.

618
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:52,709
2,350. Corrugated iron.

619
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,442
Listen, Dottore, since you're here.

620
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:57,747
I called the pensione about
the German, but she's gone.

621
00:49:57,819 --> 00:49:59,719
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

622
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,914
Really?

623
00:50:06,428 --> 00:50:07,952
What should I do?

624
00:50:09,898 --> 00:50:11,365
What an honor, Dottore.

625
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,264
You've caught me
with my pants down!

626
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:17,668
Listen Guido.
About the farm... there's that...

627
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,834
Ah, here. Where's this place?

628
00:50:22,243 --> 00:50:24,575
It doesn't even have a note
about the address, nothing!

629
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:26,608
It's in the Prince's estate.

630
00:50:26,781 --> 00:50:28,612
- Who's in here?
- My little nieces.

631
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,042
Eva and Dina.

632
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,714
'Evening.

633
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:35,912
C'mon. Let him take a look at you.

634
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,481
Perhaps he'll give you
a little part.

635
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:41,827
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

636
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:43,989
Where are you from?

637
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,461
- Trieste.
- Hurray for Italy!

638
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:52,202
You've got a nice set up here,
don't you?

639
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:53,396
Tell him about my cousin.

640
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:56,740
Guido. This one's cousin
is six feet tall.

641
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,938
You should see her.
She might be good for the movie.

642
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,513
This one... you she-devil...

643
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:04,379
It's true. She's tall like me
standing on the bed.

644
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,884
See?

645
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,817
She's twice been voted
Miss Nylon Stockings.

646
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:09,821
Is Guido in there? I'm coming in.

647
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,755
Sleep, Conocchia, sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

648
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:14,252
May I ask you a question?

649
00:51:14,662 --> 00:51:15,594
Go ahead.

650
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:20,827
My friend here says...
you can't make a love story.

651
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,496
- Shut up!
- She's right.

652
00:51:24,305 --> 00:51:25,533
Should I wake you up
in the morning, Guido?

653
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:26,571
No, thanks.

654
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,703
Our commander will never
catch us unprepared.

655
00:51:32,847 --> 00:51:34,678
This production crew never sleeps!

656
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:36,750
Such a splitting headache.
What did I eat?

657
00:51:38,586 --> 00:51:40,713
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

658
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,122
Do you need anything, Guido?
Is it a new idea?

659
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:45,625
Do you have something to tell me?

660
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:47,490
No, thank you, no.

661
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,291
Go back to bed.
I don't need anything.

662
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:51,025
- Anything at all.
- No, thank you. Good night.

663
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,324
Good night my ass!

664
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:58,163
Who can sleep here?
How can I get any sleep?

665
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,232
Conocchia, calm down.

666
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,635
Allow me. I have been in this
business for 30 years,

667
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,578
I've worked on movies
you couldn't begin to imagine

668
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:08,479
and I have never been afraid
of anything!

669
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,484
What are you shouting for,
you crazy old man!

670
00:52:11,386 --> 00:52:13,786
There, you've said it now. Old.

671
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:17,850
Finally you've spat it out.
Conocchia is old.

672
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,517
What do you want?
Get back inside.

673
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:24,989
You always keep me in the dark.
I never know what to do.

674
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:29,433
When to talk or when to shut up.
I don't want to bother you.

675
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:31,505
I don't want to know
what this movie is about.

676
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:34,631
- You want to keep it a secret? Go ahead.
- Please, go back to bed.

677
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:38,437
But if I'm to help you out,
as I've always done,

678
00:52:38,513 --> 00:52:41,505
and you were so happy then,
you must tell me something!

679
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,847
Tell me: get rid
of the French woman...

680
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:46,887
this is how I want the spaceship...
tell me: go hang yourself,

681
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,219
but do tell me something.

682
00:52:50,058 --> 00:52:52,390
You've changed so much,
Guido my friend.

683
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:58,326
What are you doing now?
Crying? Aren't you ashamed?

684
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:01,061
I'll be leaving tomorrow.
I'm quitting.

685
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:04,400
I don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

686
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:08,772
Just be careful. You're not
the man you used to be, either.

687
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:35,160
A crisis of inspiration?

688
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:39,004
And what if it weren't a
passing one, my dear?

689
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:42,774
What if it's the final collapse
of a filthy liar

690
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:45,641
with no flair or talent? Sgulp!

691
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,307
Let's say you are purity itself.

692
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,240
But what the hell does it mean
to be really honest?

693
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,550
Didn't you hear
what the Falcaccio said?

694
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:28,954
"It's time to set all the symbols aside,
the echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

695
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:32,956
What is it you want then?

696
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,632
Yes, this could be it.

697
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,378
There's a museum in the town,
and you, the guard's daughter,

698
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:58,248
grew up surrounded by images
of ancient beauty...

699
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:15,800
You're right.

700
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,403
I've come to stay forever.

701
00:55:55,476 --> 00:56:00,106
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

702
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:04,948
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

703
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:16,819
Hello?

704
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:18,761
They're asking for you
from the Railway Hotel.

705
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,266
Fine. I'll take it.

706
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:25,797
Hello? Who's that? Hello?

707
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:29,777
Guido, I feel dreadful.
The mineral water made me sick.

708
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,870
I have a temperature. Come.
Come here, immediately.

709
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:36,041
At this time of night?
I can't. I'll come tomorrow.

710
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,274
Come.

711
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:39,615
The poor thing, if you only knew
how she was asking for you.

712
00:56:39,654 --> 00:56:40,814
Here's the ice.

713
00:56:43,825 --> 00:56:47,124
- She's melting. She's got at least 104.
- Yes, fine. Just go now.

714
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:51,022
- Should I bring the peas?
- What peas?

715
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,691
When she was delirious
she asked for peas. It's a good sign.

716
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:56,532
No, just forget about it.

717
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:58,469
- If you need anything, let us know.
- Yes, thanks.

718
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:10,782
Carla, is this the first time you've run
such a high fever so suddenly?

719
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:18,918
No. It shoots up over nothing.

720
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:21,723
Then it goes away.
My husband is used to it.

721
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,991
It doesn't scare him

722
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:28,028
No, don't get up.
Stay under the covers.

723
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,796
- I'm so hot. I'm thirsty.
- Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.

724
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,343
Drink slowly or you'll get
all bloated!

725
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:42,441
- Is it day or night?
- What are you talking about?

726
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:44,041
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:47,179
Listen, now we'll wait for the
doctor and see what he has to say.

728
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,315
It wouldn't be a bad idea to send
your husband a telegram.

729
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:54,019
We can't take full responsibility for this.
Yes, he ought to know.

730
00:57:55,796 --> 00:57:58,822
No, I don't want it to be over.
If he comes, he'll take me away.

731
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:02,059
And I have bought
so many nice little dresses.

732
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:03,933
Why did you gorge on
all that water?

733
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,870
That's for sick people.
Are you sick?

734
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,868
You're always ready when
there's something to gorge on.

735
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:12,602
What else should I do?
You're always leaving me here alone.

736
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:19,282
I drafted my will two years ago.

737
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,886
Anyway, it's not like you die sooner
just because you make a will.

738
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:29,195
You see, I have a brother
and a sister too,

739
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:32,759
but I'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

740
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,002
It's mine, but how would
the poor thing manage with out it...

741
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:39,096
even if he does get remarried?

742
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,341
Ah, these sheets!

743
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:50,877
Listen, tell me the truth,
the truth, you hear?

744
00:58:51,886 --> 00:58:53,979
Why do you stay with me?

745
00:58:55,957 --> 00:58:58,585
What can I tell the Cardinal tomorrow?

746
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:03,994
Yes, I did read the little synopsis
your producer sent us.

747
00:59:04,065 --> 00:59:07,057
It's very interesting.
From a factual point of view though,

748
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:09,568
the meeting between
the protagonist

749
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:12,231
and a prince of the church could
not happen during a mud treatment

750
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:15,798
as you describe it.
I'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.

751
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,276
A high prelate has his
own private room.

752
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,179
True, but I was looking for
an unconventional setting.

753
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:22,375
What do you mean?

754
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,248
The protagonist received
a Catholic upbringing and...

755
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,550
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

756
00:59:28,623 --> 00:59:30,181
Nice to meet you.
You must be the director.

757
00:59:30,258 --> 00:59:31,350
Yes.

758
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:34,326
Is the subject of this film
a religious one?

759
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:36,124
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

760
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,031
As I was saying, the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

761
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:42,899
Iike all of us, for that matter.
So, he has certain complexes,

762
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:45,872
certain needs he can no
longer repress.

763
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:49,333
And a prince of the church appears to him
like the depositary of a truth

764
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,776
that he can no longer accept
although it still fascinates him.

765
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:55,748
So, he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps a flash of understanding.

766
00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:57,644
Saul in Damascus, right?

767
00:59:57,718 --> 00:59:59,618
Don't we all harbor such hopes?

768
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,451
I do realize the idea might sound a
bit superficial, gothic if you want...

769
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:04,286
No, no, that's not it.

770
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:08,385
I don't believe cinema
lends itself well to certain topics.

771
01:00:08,462 --> 01:00:12,922
You mix sacred
and profane love too casually.

772
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,592
Isn't that so?
- Maybe.

773
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:16,933
Yours is a great responsibility.

774
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:20,132
You can either corrupt
or educate thousands of souls.

775
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:22,504
His Eminence
will listen to you all the same.

776
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,301
You can ask him some questions.

777
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,046
Allow me to introduce you
to the director.

778
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:36,184
Please, do sit down.

779
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:41,261
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume,

780
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:45,425
But my producer is restless,
perhaps he's right,

781
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:47,228
and he insisted that I...

782
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:50,227
- Are you married?
- Yes.

783
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:53,265
- Any children?
- Yes. I mean, no.

784
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,038
- How old are you?
- 43.

785
01:01:00,881 --> 01:01:03,349
- Do you hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

786
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,446
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.

787
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:08,146
It's called Diomedeo.

788
01:01:09,023 --> 01:01:13,187
The legend has it that
when Diomedes died,

789
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,253
all these little birds gathered
and accompanied him to his grave

790
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:20,526
singing a funeral lamentation.

791
01:01:22,737 --> 01:01:25,103
Hear? It sounds like wailing.

792
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:05,404
Guido, Guido let's go see
the Saraghina.

793
01:02:09,617 --> 01:02:10,845
Coming.

794
01:02:44,685 --> 01:02:46,550
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.

795
01:02:47,922 --> 01:02:49,480
Here.

796
01:05:38,258 --> 01:05:41,227
Shame on you, shame on you...

797
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,689
It's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

798
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:46,631
I don't believe it, it can't be true...

799
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:51,028
Look at your mother, look at her!

800
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:52,766
- Mother.
- Stop there.

801
01:05:52,940 --> 01:06:00,369
Oh God, I'm so ashamed,
so ashamed and hurt!

802
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:40,283
But above all, during his whole life
and in any place where he lived,

803
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:45,314
the pious Luigi most abhorred
any talk or dealing with women,

804
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:48,190
whose presence he avoided
in such a way that whoever

805
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:52,562
saw him thought he had a natural
dislike of them...

806
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:55,695
Get down!

807
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:27,626
Don't you know that Saraghina
is the devil?

808
01:07:28,402 --> 01:07:30,632
No, I didn't. I really did not.

809
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,027
So, what does it mean?

810
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:44,270
It's a character inspired by
your childhood memories.

811
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:47,446
No connection with a real
critical conscience.

812
01:08:48,615 --> 01:08:51,641
No, if you really want to make
a polemical piece

813
01:08:51,718 --> 01:08:56,587
about the Italian Catholic
consciousness, you would need

814
01:08:56,657 --> 01:09:01,754
a much higher degree of culture

815
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:05,888
as well as inexorable logic and clarity.

816
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:13,230
Forgive me, but...
your naivete is a serious failing.

817
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,876
Your little memories,
bathed in nostalgia,

818
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,038
your inoffensive and fundamentally
sentimental evocations

819
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,580
are all the expressions
of an accomplice...

820
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:24,515
"How?" said the parish priest,
"With a communist?"

821
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:26,618
See? He didn't say: 'a man'.

822
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:28,946
Catholic conscience?

823
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,487
Just think what Suetonious was
at the time of the Caesars!

824
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:42,231
No, your intention was to denounce,
but you end up

825
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:44,896
supporting it like an accomplice.

826
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:48,333
See? What confusion...
what ambiguity!

827
01:09:55,749 --> 01:09:59,617
Dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!

828
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:01,654
But you don't need me anymore.

829
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:03,553
That isn't true, absolutely not true.

830
01:10:03,624 --> 01:10:06,923
127: showers and mud treatments.

831
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,654
129: massages.

832
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:13,395
131: inhalations.

833
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:31,917
Hello, Commendatore.

834
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:37,152
You know, I've figured out
what you're trying to talk about...

835
01:10:37,224 --> 01:10:42,218
Man's inner confusion.
But you've got to be clearer.

836
01:10:42,296 --> 01:10:45,527
You have to make yourself understood.
Otherwise what's the use of it?

837
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,169
Let's go, Guido.

838
01:11:00,213 --> 01:11:01,805
If what you have to say
is interesting,

839
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,372
it must be so for everybody.

840
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,913
How can you not care
if audiences understand?

841
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:12,049
I'm sorry, but that is
arrogant and presumptuous

842
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:16,094
Commendatore, let's go over there.
Inhale. Breathe deeply.

843
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:17,330
Hi, Guido.

844
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,665
I've saved you a spot by the jet.

845
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,667
I went to the spaceship this morning

846
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,499
and it's already gone up 50 meters...

847
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:43,947
Mario.

848
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:11,816
Guido, his Eminence is
waiting for you. I repeat.

849
01:12:12,652 --> 01:12:16,418
His Eminence is waiting.

850
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:20,522
Get dressed, quickly.

851
01:12:20,594 --> 01:12:22,755
The Cardinal is already waiting.

852
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:23,796
Tell him everything.

853
01:12:23,864 --> 01:12:25,661
Confess everything,
don't hide anything

854
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:29,190
and if you have any spare time just
put in a good word for me too.

855
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:33,269
It's a golden opportunity, Guido.
The Cardinal! You're so lucky.

856
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,672
He can give dispensations for anything...

857
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:38,506
Remember my divorce in Mexico City.
Get me my Mexican divorce.

858
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:40,011
He won't say no to you.

859
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,106
And above all show you're devout,
throw yourself down on your knees,

860
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:46,050
kiss his ring, cry,
say you've repented.

861
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:50,852
Getting in their good graces means
you can have anything you want in life.

862
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:52,158
Listen to me.

863
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:55,887
Careful, Guido. We're in your hands.

864
01:13:01,935 --> 01:13:03,835
You only get five minutes.

865
01:13:19,152 --> 01:13:22,178
Your Eminence, I'm not happy.

866
01:13:24,591 --> 01:13:29,358
Why should you be?
That isn't your job.

867
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:35,301
Who told you we come into the world
to be happy?

868
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:42,833
Origen says in his homilies:
Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.

869
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:47,280
There's no salvation outside
the church.

870
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:51,373
Extra Ecclesiam, nemo salvatur.

871
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:55,782
No one will meet salvation,
outside the church.

872
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:02,455
Salus extra Ecclesiam, non est.

873
01:14:04,097 --> 01:14:07,328
There's no salvation outside
the church.

874
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:13,631
Civitas dei. He who isn't
in the City of God,

875
01:14:14,307 --> 01:14:17,936
belongs to the City of the Devil.

876
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:45,336
Come see this great
human phenomenon, the fakir Siva,

877
01:14:45,472 --> 01:14:47,997
who has broken all
previous records...

878
01:14:48,074 --> 01:14:52,204
our experiment is controlled daily
by European experts...

879
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:22,002
20,000... 22... 23,000...
and the lady in the back?

880
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:25,408
25,000? Very well,
the bid is 24,000.

881
01:15:25,478 --> 01:15:27,275
Do I hear 30,000?

882
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:33,115
Splendid. 35,000... 40,000.
Going, going...

883
01:15:33,186 --> 01:15:38,624
One more offer?
50,000, the bid is 50,000...

884
01:15:59,646 --> 01:16:01,773
- When did you get here?
- Around five.

885
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,475
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

886
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:05,984
How are you?
- Fine, fine.

887
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:08,945
Who did you come with?

888
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,582
With Rossella and Enrico.
Tilde's here too.

889
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:19,127
Good girl. You actually came.
You look good, you know?

890
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,528
Hey there, Rossa.

891
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:25,797
It's been a year since
we last danced together.

892
01:16:28,408 --> 01:16:31,275
Luisa, darling. You're my treasure.

893
01:16:31,645 --> 01:16:35,012
I'm so happy you came.
It's always the same.

894
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:37,914
As soon you're away...

895
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:39,380
You feel lonely.

896
01:16:39,686 --> 01:16:42,314
Is it true? Did you miss me?
- Yes.

897
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,258
You weren't enjoying the company
of all these lovely ladies?

898
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,222
So you've noticed them...

899
01:16:49,296 --> 01:16:51,730
No flings since you left?

900
01:16:51,798 --> 01:16:54,733
Poor Guido.
And your famous virility?

901
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:56,864
- You smell so good.
- Do you like it?

902
01:16:56,936 --> 01:16:58,164
You're so light.

903
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,268
And how's your project going?
Better?

904
01:17:02,342 --> 01:17:05,834
Well, I don't think I've had
any major breakthroughs.

905
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:09,771
But what's it about?
What are you up to this time?

906
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:13,112
Oh, sorry.

907
01:17:14,554 --> 01:17:17,045
Listen, am I mistaken
or has Enrico fallen for you?

908
01:17:23,863 --> 01:17:25,125
She's adorable, isn't she?

909
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,762
Bravo. Very good.

910
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,430
Evening signora.
So nice to have you here.

911
01:17:35,508 --> 01:17:36,497
Thanks.

912
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:40,479
Maestro, we're at your service.
Should we get going?

913
01:17:40,547 --> 01:17:41,809
I'm coming.

914
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:43,778
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

915
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:47,081
the depths of insanity
a producer can fall into.

916
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:50,452
Frankly, I'd rather not
shake hands with this one.

917
01:17:50,523 --> 01:17:53,549
The moment she touches you
she knows what you're thinking.

918
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:55,821
Who else could it be?

919
01:17:55,895 --> 01:17:57,658
Your guiding spirit.

920
01:17:57,731 --> 01:18:00,029
Haven't you reached
that stage of intimacy yet?

921
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,864
- May I introduce my sister?
- Ah, the beautiful little sister!

922
01:18:02,936 --> 01:18:05,928
You see the kind of women
your director attracts?

923
01:18:06,005 --> 01:18:07,267
Delighted to meet you,
Commendatore.

924
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,037
I just finished a screenplay
about nuclear warfare.

925
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,670
Only a producer of your courage
could get it made.

926
01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:15,442
Does the beautiful sorceress
belong to your harem too?

927
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:18,780
Iet's say I'm a sort of overseer.

928
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,149
So are you any better?
Has your isolation helped?

929
01:18:24,257 --> 01:18:26,316
You do look better.
- Really?

930
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,627
No. Just kidding. Are you better?
Actually, I was a little worried.

931
01:18:29,696 --> 01:18:31,425
It was good of you to ask Luisa to come.

932
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,227
The very thought made her happy.

933
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:36,826
If you don't mind I'd rather not come.
My presence is futile.

934
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:41,169
- Suit yourself.
- No, my friend. I insist. Get in Conocchia's car.

935
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:43,399
Sweetie move it, go with Laura.

936
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:45,637
- Where's your wife?
- I don't know. She was just here.

937
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,373
Rossella, come with us.

938
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:50,814
Yes, I want to tell you
a strange story.

939
01:18:51,384 --> 01:18:53,978
My sister was a nun.
She died very young

940
01:18:54,053 --> 01:18:58,888
and one night her portrait
suddenly changed its expression.

941
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,721
Please, get in.

942
01:19:00,794 --> 01:19:03,388
Changed as if it wanted to warn me
about some danger...

943
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,920
I'll sit in the front.

944
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:08,627
So a couple days later
my uncle says,

945
01:19:08,701 --> 01:19:10,259
Let's go to the market, kid.

946
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:14,397
He drove an Isotta Fraschini...
I was recounting a premonition...

947
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:43,227
So what do you think?

948
01:19:43,302 --> 01:19:45,566
You have to be a little crazy
to listen to this director.

949
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:48,100
Bundle up. It's damp.

950
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:53,908
Renato, where are you?

951
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:55,974
Here, Commendatore.

952
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:58,072
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

953
01:19:58,517 --> 01:20:01,509
Follow me, ladies.
Careful. The ground is bumpy.

954
01:20:01,987 --> 01:20:06,253
It seems to me we're a bit behind.
- No. We're already up to 70 meters.

955
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:07,450
Listen, what's up with Luisa?

956
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:09,926
She's changed all of a sudden.
She's turned so nervous and angry.

957
01:20:09,995 --> 01:20:12,361
I don't know. She was so happy
to come see you.

958
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:14,023
You might have said something
that upset her.

959
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:16,159
- Never.
- And what's this?

960
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:18,498
I find this extraordinarily fascinating.

961
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,165
This model will be
superimposed on the structure,

962
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,470
to create the illusion that
the rocket is on the launch pad.

963
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:25,908
- Am I right?
- Right.

964
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:30,009
This is the rocket's launch pad.

965
01:20:30,082 --> 01:20:32,516
The most important moment
in the movie.

966
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:36,684
No photos.
- Just one, Commendatore.

967
01:20:37,522 --> 01:20:40,491
What is your husband up to this time?
Science fiction?

968
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:43,323
What do I know? Ask him.

969
01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:46,292
Giancarlo wrote him
such a beautiful story about Martians.

970
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:49,834
What is this amusement park for?

971
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:51,994
You have no idea what
a job this was.

972
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,369
No construction company
wanted to take it on.

973
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,135
It rests entirely on sand.

974
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:59,734
How much concrete did it take?

975
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:04,013
Tons! 400 tons.

976
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:06,175
Commendatore, if you don't mind,

977
01:21:06,251 --> 01:21:09,152
I'll stop at the end of this
first flight. I have vertigo.

978
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:12,150
For 80 million you could buy
at least ten apartments.

979
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:14,920
It's a pompous shack, just like him.

980
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:18,588
The little sister-in-law is not
exactly tender with our director.

981
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:20,324
Maybe she's in love with him.
- With him?

982
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:23,094
I pray day and night
that I'll be spared a husband like him.

983
01:21:23,335 --> 01:21:24,927
What now? More climbing?

984
01:21:25,003 --> 01:21:26,595
I'd be glad to carry you.

985
01:21:26,905 --> 01:21:31,399
When I think he made me spend
80 million on this structure.

986
01:21:31,476 --> 01:21:34,445
Wouldn't a well-crafted backdrop
have been better?

987
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:37,713
A backdrop! That's out of
your grandfather's time.

988
01:21:37,782 --> 01:21:39,841
Besides, are they your millions,
Conocchia?

989
01:21:42,254 --> 01:21:46,315
Luisa, are you cold?
Take my jacket.

990
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:48,325
No, no. Thank you.

991
01:21:48,393 --> 01:21:50,156
Anyway, we're going
back to the hotel.

992
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:55,022
Is something wrong?

993
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,935
You've gotten sad all of a sudden.
Am I wrong?

994
01:22:00,839 --> 01:22:04,138
No. I'm not sad at all.

995
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:10,711
The sequence starts with an image
of planet Earth

996
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:13,979
completely wiped out
by a thermonuclear war...

997
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:17,848
Guido seemed glad to see you,
really.

998
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:22,223
...and the spaceship, our new Noah's Ark,
tries to escape, while the rest of humanity

999
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:25,058
seeks refuge on another planet.

1000
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:28,622
More than 10,000 extras,
even 15,000, a tragic crowd.

1001
01:22:30,402 --> 01:22:33,462
We're really going to see all this
in your movie?

1002
01:22:33,772 --> 01:22:38,334
The prophet is raising his voice.
He's decided to scare everybody.

1003
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:41,470
Why not? Don't tell me you also love
movies where nothing happens?

1004
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,610
In my movie I have all
sorts of things happen.

1005
01:22:45,584 --> 01:22:48,610
I'm putting everything in.
Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1006
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:51,011
Sailor, come here.

1007
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:53,114
What did you learn in America?

1008
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,786
No, I don't want water.
Dance and I'll give you a part.

1009
01:22:57,095 --> 01:22:58,323
Dance.

1010
01:23:06,504 --> 01:23:08,631
What's up with you?
What's going on?

1011
01:23:08,707 --> 01:23:12,108
Rossella, cut the big sister tone.
It puts me off right away.

1012
01:23:13,845 --> 01:23:16,370
Mr. Director, what part do I get?

1013
01:23:22,187 --> 01:23:24,519
What does Luisa think about me?
What does she want to do?

1014
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,956
What's my part? My part?

1015
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:28,250
Go away!

1016
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:31,156
You know Luisa.
She doesn't say much.

1017
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:32,856
Not even to me,
and I'm her best friend.

1018
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:37,128
I really don't know. She's lost.

1019
01:23:37,202 --> 01:23:39,261
One day she says one thing,
another day, something else.

1020
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,804
Unfortunately, I think the only
thing she'd like

1021
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:44,938
is for you to be someone else.

1022
01:23:45,277 --> 01:23:46,403
Why?

1023
01:23:46,478 --> 01:23:48,844
It's the mistake everyone makes.

1024
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:55,811
But that kind little fellow,
is he in love with her?

1025
01:23:56,087 --> 01:23:59,318
You'd like that, so your conscience
won't gnaw at you anymore.

1026
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,988
You're such a scoundrel.

1027
01:24:02,594 --> 01:24:07,691
Poor Enrico, he's so awkward.
Everybody's noticed.

1028
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:10,997
He hangs around, listens to her,
keeps her company.

1029
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:13,036
He's a great friend.

1030
01:24:17,175 --> 01:24:19,006
I thought my ideas were so clear.

1031
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:23,745
I wanted to make an honest film.
No lies whatsoever.

1032
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:29,080
I thought I had something
so simple to say.

1033
01:24:30,388 --> 01:24:32,413
Something useful to everybody.

1034
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:34,821
A film that could help to bury forever

1035
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:37,757
all those dead things
we carry within ourselves.

1036
01:24:40,432 --> 01:24:44,425
Instead, I'm the one without the courage
to bury anything at all.

1037
01:24:45,937 --> 01:24:51,375
And now I'm utterly confused.
This launch pad to deal with...

1038
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:56,743
I wonder why things turned out
this way.

1039
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:01,247
When did I go wrong?

1040
01:25:04,122 --> 01:25:06,249
I really have nothing to say...

1041
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:09,192
but I want to say it all the same.

1042
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:14,521
And your spirits,
why don't they come to my rescue?

1043
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,466
You always said they had
plenty of messages for me.

1044
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:19,465
Let them get to work!

1045
01:25:19,671 --> 01:25:23,266
I've already told you,
your attitude is wrong,

1046
01:25:23,341 --> 01:25:26,003
Your curiosity toward them is childish.

1047
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:28,445
You want too many guarantees.

1048
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:32,244
- Fine, but what do they say?
- Always the same thing. Even now.

1049
01:25:33,284 --> 01:25:35,912
They're very reasonable spirits.
They know you very well.

1050
01:25:36,788 --> 01:25:38,119
So?

1051
01:25:39,824 --> 01:25:43,590
They say you're free,
but you must learn to choose.

1052
01:25:44,162 --> 01:25:48,258
You don't have much time.
And you have to hurry.

1053
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:55,402
Guido, are you coming up?
Yes or no?

1054
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:44,550
Room 320, please.

1055
01:26:44,722 --> 01:26:45,916
Nobody's in.

1056
01:26:46,658 --> 01:26:47,852
Fine, thanks.

1057
01:27:30,969 --> 01:27:32,129
Have you got a headache?

1058
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,638
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1059
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,600
Do you take them often?

1060
01:27:38,343 --> 01:27:39,867
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1061
01:27:43,314 --> 01:27:44,838
What's worrying you now?

1062
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:10,897
What?

1063
01:28:11,276 --> 01:28:13,369
Nothing.
If you could only see yourself.

1064
01:28:14,078 --> 01:28:15,409
Why are you laughing?

1065
01:28:15,747 --> 01:28:19,274
I don't think I could ever betray you,
if only because I couldn't bear

1066
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:24,310
the ridiculous effort
of having to hide and lie.

1067
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,654
But obviously it's easy for you.

1068
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:30,916
Listen Luisa.
I am very happy you're here,

1069
01:28:31,396 --> 01:28:34,661
but I am very tired and sleepy.

1070
01:28:39,037 --> 01:28:42,473
Sleep then. Good night.

1071
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:52,539
I don't know what you think my
life is like, reducing it all

1072
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:54,881
to the pettiness of somebody
stealing from the cookie jar.

1073
01:28:54,986 --> 01:28:58,513
What do you know about my life?
What I hate and what I don't.

1074
01:28:58,856 --> 01:29:00,551
I only know what you show me.

1075
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:06,591
What am I showing you?

1076
01:29:07,632 --> 01:29:09,031
Come on, tell me what you see.

1077
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:12,893
You and your judgmental moralism.
What are you getting at?

1078
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:16,837
Nothing. I know we've
been stagnating for years.

1079
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:20,136
But it's you; you're the one
who always calls me back

1080
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:21,872
and wants to start all over again.

1081
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,012
Once and for all, I don't want
to restart anything.

1082
01:29:25,483 --> 01:29:26,745
But what do you want?

1083
01:29:27,285 --> 01:29:30,652
Why did you want me here?
What good am I to you?

1084
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:33,651
What are you trying to get from me?
What is it you want?

1085
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:58,501
Don't fret. I'd already spotted
her last night when I got in.

1086
01:31:07,485 --> 01:31:09,919
I've asked no questions,
so don't say a word.

1087
01:31:10,088 --> 01:31:14,081
Spare me the embarrassment
of having to listen to your lies.

1088
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:20,755
She must have been born
in March or April.

1089
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:23,961
She's got all the characteristics
of an Aries. She's the Aries type.

1090
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:26,231
I'll tell you what type she is.

1091
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:30,098
Exactly the type most likely to make

1092
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:34,805
a good companion for feeble,
spineless, confused men.

1093
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,871
Luisa, I didn't know.

1094
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:41,681
I'm seeing her for the first time,
like you.

1095
01:31:42,587 --> 01:31:45,351
Really, in a place like this,
where there are so many people,

1096
01:31:45,423 --> 01:31:48,551
it's no surprise to run into the poor thing.

1097
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:53,595
So this is why you've been
tormenting me since last night.

1098
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:55,590
You should have told me.

1099
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:00,898
What annoys me most is
that people could think

1100
01:32:00,972 --> 01:32:02,735
I'd go with somebody who
dresses that way.

1101
01:32:03,441 --> 01:32:04,772
Have you seen her clothes?

1102
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:06,673
Listen, can't we go for a walk?

1103
01:32:06,744 --> 01:32:08,268
Let's not talk about this anymore.

1104
01:32:08,346 --> 01:32:11,042
It's been over for three years.
Finished. Enough.

1105
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:17,986
He drives me crazy.
He pretends he's telling the truth.

1106
01:32:18,055 --> 01:32:21,821
He acts honest.
As if he's the one who's right.

1107
01:32:23,361 --> 01:32:25,386
How can you live this way?

1108
01:32:27,698 --> 01:32:29,165
It's not right living this way,

1109
01:32:29,233 --> 01:32:31,633
not letting others know
what's true and what's false.

1110
01:32:31,702 --> 01:32:34,432
Is it possible that for you
it's all the same? How?

1111
01:32:34,472 --> 01:32:37,805
You're right. I know, I'm boring.

1112
01:32:39,143 --> 01:32:43,170
How sad having to play
the bourgeois wife who doesn't understand.

1113
01:32:43,815 --> 01:32:45,908
You tell me, what should I do.

1114
01:32:46,117 --> 01:32:47,914
I really can't laugh about it
the way you do.

1115
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,953
No darling, I'm not laughing.

1116
01:32:52,456 --> 01:32:55,050
What do you tell her?

1117
01:33:00,097 --> 01:33:03,498
What disgusts me the most is that
you've mixed her up in our life.

1118
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:06,093
She knows everything
about you and me.

1119
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:10,536
That whore. Cow!

1120
01:33:13,678 --> 01:33:16,272
You're a real pain, you know.

1121
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:25,587
And yet...

1122
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,542
Signora Carla, you sing so well.

1123
01:33:51,716 --> 01:33:53,479
No, I'm just an amateur.

1124
01:33:53,618 --> 01:33:55,051
And how pretty you look.

1125
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,121
I've wanted to meet you for so long.
- And I, you.

1126
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:07,588
You're so stylish.

1127
01:34:07,632 --> 01:34:11,762
No, you're the stylish one.
Me, frankly, I'm a bit trashy.

1128
01:34:11,836 --> 01:34:13,571
What are you talking about?
This is so refined.

1129
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:14,469
Do you like it?

1130
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:16,598
It's a little outfit I found in Vogue.
- Really?

1131
01:34:16,641 --> 01:34:18,632
If you only knew how long
it took me to find it.

1132
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:21,270
But you know,
when Carla wants something...

1133
01:34:35,026 --> 01:34:37,358
Here he comes!

1134
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:40,192
Guido's here.

1135
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:42,725
Good evening, women.

1136
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,064
Close the door, there's a storm.

1137
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:47,999
How are you? Well?

1138
01:34:48,072 --> 01:34:49,801
Every gift comes with its nametag.

1139
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:52,505
Don't get mixed up.
This is Caterina's.

1140
01:34:53,611 --> 01:34:55,135
He's a darling!

1141
01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:57,677
And this one is for my darling sister-in-law,

1142
01:34:57,715 --> 01:35:00,650
because she's finally understood
how things should be.

1143
01:35:00,851 --> 01:35:02,443
We'll draw your bath right away.

1144
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,351
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1145
01:35:04,422 --> 01:35:07,414
Thanks. I need to talk to you, Guido.

1146
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,423
I know what she wants to tell you.

1147
01:35:10,494 --> 01:35:12,985
Now we'll have to send her away
because she's acting jealous.

1148
01:35:13,264 --> 01:35:15,596
What were you doing upstairs?

1149
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:19,602
I went to see those poor things.
They'd always be alone, if not for me.

1150
01:35:19,637 --> 01:35:23,129
The role doesn't suit her.
She's only a common bourgeoise.

1151
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:24,401
She has no class.

1152
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:27,103
Leave him alone now.
He's got to take his bath.

1153
01:35:27,378 --> 01:35:30,347
Oh Guido, this is splendid,
I've always wanted one like it.

1154
01:35:30,514 --> 01:35:32,982
Hurry, Carla, Hedy!
Get the buckets.

1155
01:35:36,053 --> 01:35:38,078
Guido, my husband wrote.

1156
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:40,953
He wants me home for New Year's,
just for a day, do you mind?

1157
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:44,092
If you do, I'll tell him I can't.
- I think that will be fine.

1158
01:35:44,428 --> 01:35:45,759
Come on, Carlotta!

1159
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,533
- Who's that little black girl?
- A surprise from us.

1160
01:35:52,603 --> 01:35:55,071
She's from Hawaii,
don't you remember her?

1161
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:58,798
You told us about her
so many times.

1162
01:36:04,015 --> 01:36:06,142
Thank you, Luisa. You're so kind.

1163
01:36:06,484 --> 01:36:08,213
Such a delicate little present.

1164
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,225
That tiara is mine.

1165
01:36:17,294 --> 01:36:19,023
Yes, I know.
I'll give it back to you later.

1166
01:36:21,565 --> 01:36:22,827
Oh, darling!

1167
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:25,627
What a thrill to find you here.

1168
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:27,902
- How are you?
- Fine.

1169
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:32,331
But do tell me, who are you?

1170
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:35,402
The name doesn't matter.
I'm happy to be here.

1171
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:38,341
Don't ask me any questions.
- Can I stay?

1172
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:42,580
Of course, you pretty thing.
I'm busy now.

1173
01:36:42,653 --> 01:36:44,280
But later?

1174
01:36:47,058 --> 01:36:49,219
Rossella?
What are you doing here?

1175
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,894
Playing Pinocchio's wise cricket.
Do you mind?

1176
01:36:51,962 --> 01:36:53,224
No. But why are you laughing?

1177
01:36:53,297 --> 01:36:55,731
It's nothing. I just want to see
how you get out of this one.

1178
01:36:56,233 --> 01:36:59,760
You've finally got your harem,
King Solomon!

1179
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,667
- It was high time.
- Sure was.

1180
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,805
Lower me down.

1181
01:37:08,112 --> 01:37:11,343
Aren't you a little scared?

1182
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:13,483
Of what? Everything is going great.

1183
01:37:13,884 --> 01:37:15,408
Can I stay too? I'm having such fun.

1184
01:37:15,453 --> 01:37:17,717
I don't want anything.
I'll just watch you.

1185
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:19,949
We have rules that must be
respected. Do you know that?

1186
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:21,116
Come, help me.

1187
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:27,630
It's a two piece suit with a busby
in ostrich feathers. Do you like it?

1188
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:30,523
Hi Hedy, it's beautiful.

1189
01:37:31,702 --> 01:37:33,294
So, what are the rules?

1190
01:37:33,637 --> 01:37:36,572
I don't know. He promised me
a part in his movie and said

1191
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,608
I'd have to change dresses a lot.

1192
01:37:43,948 --> 01:37:46,610
Girls, that's enough. Get me out.

1193
01:37:48,486 --> 01:37:51,114
- Gloria, the talcum powder.
- Ah, yes.

1194
01:37:53,824 --> 01:37:56,190
Guido, do you know she prepared
something just the way you like it?

1195
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,524
- Really?
- A cake.

1196
01:37:58,596 --> 01:38:00,860
- Are you happy, girls?
- Of course!

1197
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:02,893
Isn't this just what
you always wanted?

1198
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:06,232
Certainly! Isn't he the best
kid in the world?

1199
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:08,504
Nadine, hurry up with the powder!

1200
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:11,902
Oh Nadine, what was it you used
to say in Copenhagen?

1201
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,609
We're delighted to invite
our passengers

1202
01:38:14,678 --> 01:38:17,806
to spend the night in Copenhagen
due to a problem with the motor.

1203
01:38:17,982 --> 01:38:20,644
Just listen to her voice...

1204
01:38:20,718 --> 01:38:23,346
The company will cover
all expenses.

1205
01:38:23,687 --> 01:38:25,780
Good night to you all.

1206
01:38:32,396 --> 01:38:34,523
Madeleine, come help us.

1207
01:38:34,732 --> 01:38:37,792
- Saraghina!
- Here I am. I'll carry Guido.

1208
01:38:37,868 --> 01:38:41,304
Oh, my poor man. The water was
scalding. He's turned all red!

1209
01:38:41,372 --> 01:38:45,536
- Such nice, thin legs.
- Straight like when he was a boy.

1210
01:38:45,609 --> 01:38:48,271
He likes to act like a kid,
but he's really very complex.

1211
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:50,939
Don't be fooled. I'm onto him.
He's a hypocrite.

1212
01:38:51,015 --> 01:38:52,448
No, he's not.

1213
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:54,347
But why does he have to tell
everything to anybody?

1214
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:56,613
He knows how to stand up
for himself.

1215
01:38:57,054 --> 01:38:59,522
Guido, help me.

1216
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:00,921
Who's screaming like that?

1217
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:03,425
Jacqueline. She refuses to
go upstairs with the old ones,

1218
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:06,395
so we've locked her in the cellar.

1219
01:39:06,463 --> 01:39:10,092
It's scandalous. I don't want to
have to speak to those witches,

1220
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:15,002
so much older than me. I'm 26.
Go to the Paris public register.

1221
01:39:15,773 --> 01:39:21,871
Jacqueline Bon Bon, 26,
the 4th of July 1938.

1222
01:39:22,313 --> 01:39:24,804
You have no right
to send me upstairs.

1223
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:29,346
It's not my time yet.
Look, I'm so agile. Look at my legs.

1224
01:39:30,254 --> 01:39:33,553
Which one of you has such a tight
little ass? Look at my chest.

1225
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:38,853
Guido, don't send me upstairs.
I don't want to go upstairs.

1226
01:39:39,897 --> 01:39:43,333
You know the rules.
The rules are the rules.

1227
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:43,991
Guido I...

1228
01:39:44,134 --> 01:39:47,262
Calm down. Apparently
it's nice upstairs, too.

1229
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:50,332
- Your earring. Here.
- Thank you.

1230
01:39:52,843 --> 01:39:57,678
You've always loved me. Please,
tell him to give me an extension.

1231
01:39:57,848 --> 01:40:00,510
Guido, couldn't we give her
an extension?

1232
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:03,075
What are you doing?
You're breaking my balls too?

1233
01:40:03,153 --> 01:40:06,680
I beg you Guido, just for one year.

1234
01:40:06,757 --> 01:40:09,692
- No extension.
- I'm not going upstairs.

1235
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,455
- What did you say?
- I'm not going upstairs.

1236
01:40:11,528 --> 01:40:14,019
- Say it again if you dare.
- I'm not going upstairs!

1237
01:40:14,098 --> 01:40:17,363
This one is crazy. I told you we
should never have let her in.

1238
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:20,193
Hey, girl!
Just look at your rulebook.

1239
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:22,967
Whoever passes the age limit
shall be removed to the upper floors,

1240
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,031
where she shall be treated equally well,

1241
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:26,940
but shall live basking
in her memories.

1242
01:40:26,977 --> 01:40:29,241
It's so disgusting, absurd,
we shouldn't have accepted it.

1243
01:40:29,313 --> 01:40:31,577
Never, right from the start.

1244
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:37,420
It's not fair!

1245
01:40:38,055 --> 01:40:40,114
These are rules invented
by someone

1246
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:44,752
who doesn't pass the test himself.

1247
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:47,996
In France such a man would be
the shame of the nation.

1248
01:40:48,065 --> 01:40:50,192
Are we lemons to thrown out
after we're squeezed?

1249
01:40:50,267 --> 01:40:52,861
- Guido, they're so right.
- You're a monster.

1250
01:40:55,873 --> 01:40:58,307
Our time has come!

1251
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,707
Hurray for Jacqueline, who has
shown us the way to our freedom.

1252
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:02,939
Down with the tyrant,
down with Bluebeard!

1253
01:41:03,614 --> 01:41:06,583
We have the right to be loved
'til we're 70 years old.

1254
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:10,847
Down with him!

1255
01:41:11,322 --> 01:41:13,256
And what do you think you are?
A boy?

1256
01:41:13,324 --> 01:41:15,884
Let's say it once and for all,
he doesn't know how to make love.

1257
01:41:16,327 --> 01:41:18,386
That's the truth.

1258
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:20,258
- And he falls asleep right away.
- I don't sleep. I think.

1259
01:41:20,331 --> 01:41:23,391
Guido, don't send us upstairs
when we get old.

1260
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:25,802
Down, down.

1261
01:41:27,771 --> 01:41:30,262
Quick!
They're rebelling upstairs too.

1262
01:41:34,945 --> 01:41:37,812
Oh, delicious!

1263
01:41:38,849 --> 01:41:43,946
You pig, you liar. I came all the
way from Paris. What's my part?

1264
01:41:50,594 --> 01:41:52,858
Guido, who will dance for you?
You liked it so much.

1265
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,591
I don't like it anymore.

1266
01:41:55,232 --> 01:41:56,859
Luisa, help me!

1267
01:41:57,101 --> 01:41:59,160
Sorry, but I don't meddle
in my husband's business.

1268
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:02,303
If this is his decision, it's good.
Those are the rules.

1269
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:04,864
Hurry up Guido, the soup's getting cold.

1270
01:42:05,109 --> 01:42:06,576
Can't you see I'm busy?

1271
01:42:07,745 --> 01:42:09,440
What an extraordinary man.

1272
01:42:09,513 --> 01:42:11,037
Yes, but...

1273
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,682
He needs to act this way.
He does it almost every night.

1274
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,182
Guido, do you remember me?

1275
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,690
But darling, you're wounded;
I'll get you some cream...

1276
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,318
- I don't want any cream.
- Some balm.

1277
01:42:24,395 --> 01:42:26,226
- I don't want any balm.
- Drops...

1278
01:42:26,463 --> 01:42:28,829
It's not true that he dumps you
like squeezed lemons.

1279
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:30,958
Actually, he'd like to keep you all
with him always.

1280
01:42:31,034 --> 01:42:33,127
He is too good, too patient.

1281
01:42:38,275 --> 01:42:40,004
No, not me, no.

1282
01:42:58,262 --> 01:43:01,629
He doesn't like you. You're old.

1283
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:06,761
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy
to have had the opportunity

1284
01:43:06,837 --> 01:43:10,603
to live with you and we wish you
the best of luck upstairs.

1285
01:43:11,008 --> 01:43:13,636
We'd like to reassure you
on Guido's behalf

1286
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,769
that you were the first
showgirl in his life.

1287
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:20,048
You're now entitled to
a song and dance of your choice,

1288
01:43:20,117 --> 01:43:22,950
with your very own spotlight.

1289
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:26,248
Thank you girls, you're so kind.

1290
01:43:26,323 --> 01:43:28,621
Would you like me
to sing a love song?

1291
01:43:29,026 --> 01:43:31,620
No, better something sexy.
That was my specialty.

1292
01:43:31,995 --> 01:43:34,828
Guido, remember
the Apollo theater in Bologna?

1293
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:35,922
Yes, I do.

1294
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:37,864
No, better a happy song!

1295
01:43:45,275 --> 01:43:47,505
Oh, I've lost my pearls.

1296
01:43:57,921 --> 01:43:59,582
Oh, again!

1297
01:44:08,265 --> 01:44:10,028
You're not even listening.

1298
01:44:25,749 --> 01:44:26,773
Farewell, Guido.

1299
01:44:57,481 --> 01:45:00,075
I thought it was such
a funny situation,

1300
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:03,879
the funniest part of my story.

1301
01:45:04,621 --> 01:45:07,715
I'd even prepared a little
speech to give at the table:

1302
01:45:09,293 --> 01:45:15,254
Darlings, happiness is being able
to tell the truth

1303
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:17,493
without ever making anybody suffer.

1304
01:45:18,635 --> 01:45:21,331
Carla would have played the harp,
as on any night,

1305
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:24,430
and we would have been happy
hiding in here,

1306
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:27,869
far away from the world.
All of you and I.

1307
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:35,207
What's wrong? Why this sadness?

1308
01:45:35,719 --> 01:45:38,688
See? We've made him feel guilty.

1309
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:50,732
That's not it, Guido.

1310
01:45:50,801 --> 01:45:52,359
It has been a wonderful evening.

1311
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:53,869
You mustn't be sad.

1312
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:57,165
Do you need anything?

1313
01:46:01,545 --> 01:46:06,448
Now they'll all go to bed
and I still have a lot to do:

1314
01:46:08,418 --> 01:46:16,883
the laundry, all the dishes,
mend the sheets, scrub the floors

1315
01:46:17,628 --> 01:46:20,096
and set up breakfast for tomorrow.

1316
01:46:26,903 --> 01:46:29,371
Aren't we fine living all together this way?

1317
01:46:31,642 --> 01:46:34,543
At first I didn't understand,

1318
01:46:35,579 --> 01:46:38,480
that this is the way things
are meant to be.

1319
01:46:39,182 --> 01:46:41,241
But now...

1320
01:46:41,418 --> 01:46:44,387
Don't you think I'm good now?
I don't bother you anymore.

1321
01:46:44,454 --> 01:46:45,944
I don't ask questions.

1322
01:46:49,826 --> 01:46:54,559
A bit slow, wasn't I?
It's taken me 20 years to understand.

1323
01:46:55,132 --> 01:46:59,228
20 years since the day
we got married

1324
01:47:01,038 --> 01:47:04,201
and you became my husband
and I your wife.

1325
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:09,312
Do you remember Guido?
Do you remember that day?

1326
01:47:12,382 --> 01:47:15,545
If you could only be patient
a little longer, Luisa.

1327
01:47:16,653 --> 01:47:18,450
But perhaps you've had it.

1328
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:23,182
Frankly, I'd love to be able
to offer a word of advice.

1329
01:47:23,593 --> 01:47:25,857
But I think tonight you're called

1330
01:47:25,929 --> 01:47:30,161
to solve a problem
for which there is no solution.

1331
01:47:30,233 --> 01:47:33,600
Finding a precise face
for a crowd of characters

1332
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:37,731
that in your script are so rough,
so vague, so superficial...

1333
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:40,342
What is it we're watching?

1334
01:47:40,844 --> 01:47:42,175
I don't know... screen tests.

1335
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,640
You're not well.

1336
01:47:44,715 --> 01:47:46,478
Quite the contrary.

1337
01:47:52,856 --> 01:47:55,484
Agostini, get on the catwalk
and do a little dance for us.

1338
01:47:55,559 --> 01:47:58,187
I'll accompany you on the piano.

1339
01:47:58,995 --> 01:48:00,826
Listen here. "The solitary ego

1340
01:48:00,897 --> 01:48:03,866
that revolves around itself
and feeds upon itself, ends up

1341
01:48:03,934 --> 01:48:06,732
strangled by a great cry
or a great laugh."

1342
01:48:07,104 --> 01:48:10,665
Words that Stendhal wrote
during his stay in Italy.

1343
01:48:10,974 --> 01:48:14,137
If we sometimes read those sayings
on chocolate wrappers

1344
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:17,510
instead of throwing them away,
we would be spared many an illusion.

1345
01:48:47,677 --> 01:48:51,613
There he is. By the door,
always ready to run away.

1346
01:48:55,786 --> 01:48:58,118
Good evening to you all
and apologies for the delay.

1347
01:48:58,688 --> 01:49:00,451
Well, what are you up to now?

1348
01:49:01,258 --> 01:49:02,691
- Guido where are you?
- Here.

1349
01:49:02,759 --> 01:49:04,784
- Come down.
- I'd rather stay up here.

1350
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:08,422
Evening... Good, you're here too.
Let's get going.

1351
01:49:08,498 --> 01:49:09,624
Right away.

1352
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:12,595
They skipped the variety act tonight
so we could use the theater.

1353
01:49:14,604 --> 01:49:15,502
Let's go.

1354
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,164
Young man, it's time
to make up your mind.

1355
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:20,704
I've brought all the screen tests...

1356
01:49:20,777 --> 01:49:23,610
Pardon me Conocchia,
but the time for his jokes is over.

1357
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:26,005
All his doubts, his uncertainties,
his whims.

1358
01:49:26,082 --> 01:49:29,142
He had all the time he wanted,
but tonight we're here to choose.

1359
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:31,119
- That's why we're all here.
- Right.

1360
01:49:31,188 --> 01:49:32,849
Conocchia has gotten
everything from Rome.

1361
01:49:32,923 --> 01:49:36,256
The new and the old screen tests,
even the ones we shot five months ago.

1362
01:49:36,526 --> 01:49:39,222
Now we'll go through them one by one,
and you have to say:

1363
01:49:39,262 --> 01:49:41,526
This is the wife,
this is the mistress,

1364
01:49:41,598 --> 01:49:43,896
this is the Cardinal,
this is Saraghina. Clear?

1365
01:49:44,467 --> 01:49:47,527
I don't want to be the joke
of the Italian film industry

1366
01:49:47,604 --> 01:49:49,629
but above all I don't want you
to end up that way.

1367
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:51,931
They're all ready to shoot you down.

1368
01:49:52,309 --> 01:49:55,244
You've got very few friends left,
on the Left or the Right.

1369
01:49:55,312 --> 01:49:58,281
But I am here to help you
each and every way.

1370
01:49:58,481 --> 01:50:00,949
We must start shooting
and we must do it immediately.

1371
01:50:01,017 --> 01:50:02,450
Roll the screen tests.

1372
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:07,454
Miss Olimpia's screen test.

1373
01:50:09,226 --> 01:50:10,318
Miss Olimpia...

1374
01:50:13,096 --> 01:50:18,159
- Should I shut the door?
- Yes. Sway, sway your big hips.

1375
01:50:18,835 --> 01:50:21,929
Put down your stuff. Good.

1376
01:50:22,172 --> 01:50:26,336
Now go to the mirror.
Admire yourself.

1377
01:50:27,477 --> 01:50:33,438
More. Swell your chest.
There.

1378
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:36,777
Now go to the phone.
Slowly. Don't run.

1379
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,354
- Why are you running?
- I'm not.

1380
01:50:39,689 --> 01:50:42,021
Look, hit that mark.
There, on the floor.

1381
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:45,991
Hello, the concierge please?

1382
01:50:46,329 --> 01:50:47,523
Speaking.

1383
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:50,896
I'd like a bottle of flat water.

1384
01:50:50,967 --> 01:50:51,934
Fiuggi.

1385
01:50:52,002 --> 01:50:53,492
No, Fiuggi is sparkling.

1386
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:57,006
No, look this way.
Fiuggi is the least sparkling.

1387
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,707
Fine, I'll take the Fiuggi.

1388
01:50:58,775 --> 01:51:00,436
Will this one do, Guido?

1389
01:51:00,543 --> 01:51:03,478
He's got to make up his mind
because she's leaving for England.

1390
01:51:03,546 --> 01:51:05,173
She's leaving next week, Guido.

1391
01:51:05,248 --> 01:51:06,716
- And who's this one?
- Shut up, you!

1392
01:51:06,716 --> 01:51:08,616
Or do you prefer this one.

1393
01:51:08,685 --> 01:51:09,777
This is an important character.

1394
01:51:09,853 --> 01:51:12,583
People need to like her right off the bat.
Right, Guido?

1395
01:51:16,092 --> 01:51:17,992
Signora, sit down
as if you were drained.

1396
01:51:18,061 --> 01:51:20,154
This character is a woman who
has lost the desire to fight.

1397
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,926
because... say your line...

1398
01:51:23,667 --> 01:51:24,531
- Without stopping?
- What?

1399
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:26,228
- Without stopping?
- Yes, yes.

1400
01:51:29,773 --> 01:51:32,207
I am the one who's offering you
complete freedom.

1401
01:51:33,543 --> 01:51:36,307
Anyway, I'm no good to you this way.
I'm just a nuisance.

1402
01:51:41,251 --> 01:51:43,378
And who's this?
What should she represent?

1403
01:51:43,987 --> 01:51:46,046
Didn't you hear? She's the wife.

1404
01:51:50,226 --> 01:51:53,957
Still, she's likable, soulful.
Don't you think?

1405
01:51:54,597 --> 01:51:57,760
- Gimme a cigarette.
- I've run out. Enrico, fill us up.

1406
01:51:58,501 --> 01:52:00,366
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1407
01:52:00,437 --> 01:52:01,301
You're welcome.

1408
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:04,672
I cannot go on like this any longer.

1409
01:52:04,741 --> 01:52:07,073
Now, you tell me how I should be.

1410
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:09,441
Not someone who lies and swears
he's telling the truth

1411
01:52:09,512 --> 01:52:11,173
every second of the day.

1412
01:52:11,247 --> 01:52:14,045
That would be enough.
You don't even do that.

1413
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:16,945
With you I never,
never know the truth.

1414
01:52:17,387 --> 01:52:18,854
Even in the smallest things.

1415
01:52:20,357 --> 01:52:22,382
Luisa, I care for you.

1416
01:52:23,026 --> 01:52:24,721
Lying is like breathing to you.

1417
01:52:24,928 --> 01:52:26,020
Repeat that, please.

1418
01:52:26,363 --> 01:52:27,955
Lying is like breathing to you.

1419
01:52:29,632 --> 01:52:31,031
So brazen.

1420
01:52:34,604 --> 01:52:36,333
- All lines from his life.
- Right.

1421
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:40,307
I know this one. She's the princess.

1422
01:52:41,044 --> 01:52:43,239
Am I not alone already?
What are you giving me?

1423
01:52:43,947 --> 01:52:45,244
What have I got to look
forward to?

1424
01:52:45,315 --> 01:52:47,078
Look this way. Put on the glasses.

1425
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:50,110
Repeat the last line.

1426
01:52:50,186 --> 01:52:51,778
Am I not alone already?

1427
01:52:51,855 --> 01:52:53,755
You have to say it,
yes, aggressively,

1428
01:52:53,823 --> 01:52:55,381
but also with deep bitterness.

1429
01:52:55,825 --> 01:52:58,555
He said: What?
You want a separation.

1430
01:52:58,628 --> 01:52:59,720
You want to be alone.

1431
01:52:59,896 --> 01:53:01,796
But what would you do on your own?

1432
01:53:01,831 --> 01:53:05,961
And she answers: why,
am I not alone already? Go on.

1433
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:09,868
Guido, there's no doubt
about this one. She's perfect.

1434
01:53:15,945 --> 01:53:18,641
Five months. We've been going
this way for five months.

1435
01:53:18,982 --> 01:53:20,472
But they're all so old!

1436
01:53:22,819 --> 01:53:23,877
Fiuggi is sparkling.

1437
01:53:23,953 --> 01:53:27,013
No, it's the least sparkling.
Louder.

1438
01:53:29,492 --> 01:53:30,652
Put down the phone.

1439
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:33,388
Screen test for Miss Olimpia.

1440
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:35,993
What about this one?

1441
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:40,799
It's dangerous leaving me alone.

1442
01:53:42,138 --> 01:53:43,833
Why, what do you do?

1443
01:53:43,907 --> 01:53:45,101
Should I repeat the line?

1444
01:53:45,175 --> 01:53:51,080
No, just turn your little
head this way. Now, stop.

1445
01:53:52,215 --> 01:53:53,876
Where are you going?

1446
01:53:55,418 --> 01:53:56,942
Back to the hotel. I'm sleepy.

1447
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,288
Wait a second. Listen.

1448
01:53:59,856 --> 01:54:01,289
What happened?

1449
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:04,950
Nothing. Nothing ever
happens between us.

1450
01:54:06,596 --> 01:54:08,530
Were you offended
by something you saw?

1451
01:54:09,032 --> 01:54:09,862
It's just a movie.

1452
01:54:09,999 --> 01:54:11,796
I'm the first to understand that.

1453
01:54:11,868 --> 01:54:14,894
It's a movie, another invention,
another lie.

1454
01:54:14,971 --> 01:54:17,599
You put everybody in it,
but the way you like to see them.

1455
01:54:17,674 --> 01:54:19,539
But I know the truth.

1456
01:54:19,609 --> 01:54:23,545
The difference is that
I would never have the impudence

1457
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:25,171
to tell everybody the way you do.

1458
01:54:25,949 --> 01:54:28,042
Go ahead. Make your movie.

1459
01:54:28,118 --> 01:54:29,176
No, I won't.

1460
01:54:29,252 --> 01:54:31,152
Indulge yourself. Stroke your ego.

1461
01:54:32,355 --> 01:54:34,721
Go make everyone think
you're so wonderful.

1462
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:38,150
What could you ever teach strangers
when you can't

1463
01:54:38,228 --> 01:54:40,662
even tell the simplest truth
to the ones closest to you?

1464
01:54:40,697 --> 01:54:42,426
To the one who's been
growing old with you?

1465
01:54:42,465 --> 01:54:44,126
Come on Luisa. Cut the drama.

1466
01:54:46,169 --> 01:54:48,103
You were right to ask me here.

1467
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:51,272
We needed to find closure.

1468
01:54:51,574 --> 01:54:54,099
This time, I assure you,
I won't be coming back.

1469
01:54:54,477 --> 01:54:56,104
You can go to hell!

1470
01:55:09,058 --> 01:55:12,459
Fine, just run, run.

1471
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:15,157
Do what the doctor ordered, run!

1472
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:19,998
Shut up! Throw this ignoramus out.

1473
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,060
Fine, now sing.

1474
01:55:22,772 --> 01:55:25,400
You may say I'm losing it,
but I have the bills here...

1475
01:55:26,543 --> 01:55:30,809
I'll never pay this one, never!
Conocchia, you're losing it.

1476
01:55:31,281 --> 01:55:33,841
Saraghina look,
we've got the money.

1477
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:36,917
Saraghina, the Rumba, the Rumba...

1478
01:55:37,086 --> 01:55:40,021
Guido, would you please
say something? Please!

1479
01:55:42,058 --> 01:55:43,355
What about this one, Guido?

1480
01:55:44,561 --> 01:55:46,392
Frankly I preferred the one before.

1481
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:48,427
This one is from Naples.

1482
01:55:48,498 --> 01:55:52,594
Can't you see that I'm... stuttering.

1483
01:55:52,936 --> 01:55:56,201
When are you coming?
I'm tired of waiting.

1484
01:55:56,372 --> 01:55:57,202
Look at me.

1485
01:55:57,273 --> 01:55:59,468
Don't leave me alone!
You know it's dangerous.

1486
01:55:59,842 --> 01:56:04,506
Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous, darling.

1487
01:56:04,647 --> 01:56:05,511
Look over here.

1488
01:56:05,648 --> 01:56:08,947
Why aren't you coming now?
Why are you keeping me waiting?

1489
01:56:09,319 --> 01:56:11,378
You know it's dangerous
when I have to wait.

1490
01:56:11,454 --> 01:56:13,649
Louder, louder!

1491
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:16,124
Countess, walk.

1492
01:56:18,461 --> 01:56:19,655
Don't touch me.

1493
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:21,754
This way, this way.

1494
01:56:24,133 --> 01:56:26,601
Screen tests Mrs. Grazia, one.

1495
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:28,528
Just bare your shoulders
all of a sudden.

1496
01:56:28,605 --> 01:56:31,506
Saraghina, we've got the money.
The money.

1497
01:56:32,475 --> 01:56:34,705
Stop. Very good. Was it all right?

1498
01:56:36,846 --> 01:56:39,406
Signora, what do you think?

1499
01:56:39,482 --> 01:56:41,313
If he won't speak up,
at least we can say something.

1500
01:56:41,384 --> 01:56:44,717
Somebody say something!
This is a democracy, right?

1501
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:50,421
You can't hide. We've found you
anyway. How are you?

1502
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,752
Hi, I'm Poletti,
from Claudia's press agency.

1503
01:56:53,830 --> 01:56:57,027
We met 15 years ago.
You might not remember me...

1504
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,762
- Look, she's here.
- Where?

1505
01:57:06,442 --> 01:57:07,704
Excuse me.

1506
01:57:16,753 --> 01:57:19,221
- Claudia.
- How are you?

1507
01:57:19,289 --> 01:57:23,089
Well, and you?
You're finally here.

1508
01:57:23,259 --> 01:57:24,487
Let's go outside, all right?

1509
01:57:25,295 --> 01:57:27,263
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1510
01:57:30,033 --> 01:57:31,557
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1511
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,807
When do we start shooting?

1512
01:57:39,275 --> 01:57:41,869
- Soon, very soon.
- And what's my part?

1513
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:43,873
I'll tell you everything later.

1514
01:57:43,946 --> 01:57:45,811
I'm very happy to be working
with you

1515
01:57:45,882 --> 01:57:47,281
and I hope I'll be able to help you.

1516
01:57:47,617 --> 01:57:48,914
But you must tell me everything.

1517
01:57:50,386 --> 01:57:51,580
Where are we going now?

1518
01:58:01,564 --> 01:58:05,056
Well?
- This way.

1519
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:24,484
You're so beautiful.
I'm at a loss for words.

1520
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:26,249
You make my heart beat
like a school boy's.

1521
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,082
You don't believe me, do you?

1522
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,658
You inspire such deep respect.

1523
01:58:33,563 --> 01:58:37,192
Who do you love?
Claudia, who are you with?

1524
01:58:37,266 --> 01:58:39,131
- Who do you care for?
- You.

1525
01:58:42,305 --> 01:58:44,000
You arrived just in time, you know.

1526
01:58:45,508 --> 01:58:47,169
Why do you smile that way?

1527
01:58:47,243 --> 01:58:50,610
I never know if you're judging me,
absolving me, mocking me.

1528
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,672
I'm listening. You said you wanted
to tell me about the film.

1529
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,081
I don't know anything.

1530
01:59:01,224 --> 01:59:04,990
Could you leave everything behind
and start from zero again?

1531
01:59:06,396 --> 01:59:09,490
Pick one thing, and one only,
and be absolutely devoted to it?

1532
01:59:09,799 --> 01:59:11,994
Make it the reason for your existence,

1533
01:59:12,068 --> 01:59:14,400
the thing that contains everything,
that becomes everything,

1534
01:59:14,437 --> 01:59:18,066
because your dedication to it
makes it last forever? Could you?

1535
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:22,602
All right, listen.
If I were to say, Claudia...

1536
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:27,576
Where are we going?
I don't know the way...

1537
01:59:28,785 --> 01:59:31,219
And what about you? Could you?

1538
01:59:32,188 --> 01:59:35,783
The springs must be nearby.
Listen. Turn here.

1539
01:59:38,294 --> 01:59:40,421
No, this guy here, he couldn't.

1540
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:44,488
He wants to grab everything,
can't give up a single thing.

1541
01:59:45,301 --> 01:59:46,359
He changes his mind every day,

1542
01:59:46,436 --> 01:59:48,563
because he's afraid he might
miss the right path.

1543
01:59:48,638 --> 01:59:50,731
And he's slowly bleeding to death.
- So this is how the movie ends?

1544
01:59:50,773 --> 01:59:52,070
No, this is how it starts.

1545
01:59:52,175 --> 01:59:54,143
Then one day he meets the girl
of the spring.

1546
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:56,974
She's one of those girls that
distributes the healing water,

1547
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:04,442
she's beautiful, young and ancient,
a child and a woman already,

1548
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:09,287
authentic and radiant.
There's no doubt that she's his salvation.

1549
02:00:10,893 --> 02:00:12,690
You'll be dressed in white
and your hair will be long,

1550
02:00:12,762 --> 02:00:14,286
just the way you wear it.

1551
02:00:24,841 --> 02:00:26,274
Turn the headlights off.

1552
02:01:05,181 --> 02:01:06,307
And then?

1553
02:01:21,764 --> 02:01:23,129
Let's leave.

1554
02:01:25,067 --> 02:01:28,161
I don't like this place.
It doesn't feel real.

1555
02:01:29,038 --> 02:01:31,199
I like it enormously. Isn't that odd?

1556
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:37,611
I didn't get much from your story.

1557
02:01:38,414 --> 02:01:42,373
A guy like your character,
who doesn't love anybody,

1558
02:01:42,685 --> 02:01:44,346
is not very sympathetic you know.

1559
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:49,754
It's his fault.
What does he expect?

1560
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:53,125
You think I don't know that?

1561
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:56,755
You're a bit of a bore too.

1562
02:01:57,099 --> 02:01:59,932
You really can't take the least bit
of criticism.

1563
02:02:00,169 --> 02:02:03,798
You're so funny with that big hat,
made up like an old man.

1564
02:02:06,576 --> 02:02:11,343
I don't understand. He meets a girl
that can give him a new life

1565
02:02:11,847 --> 02:02:13,314
and he pushes her away?

1566
02:02:13,382 --> 02:02:15,077
Because he no longer believes in it.

1567
02:02:16,686 --> 02:02:18,551
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1568
02:02:18,788 --> 02:02:21,120
Because it isn't true that
a woman can change a man.

1569
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:23,048
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1570
02:02:23,125 --> 02:02:26,617
And above all because I don't feel
like telling another pile of lies.

1571
02:02:26,796 --> 02:02:28,696
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1572
02:02:30,366 --> 02:02:34,427
I'm sorry, Claudia, for making you
come all the way here.

1573
02:02:35,304 --> 02:02:37,465
You're such a fake.

1574
02:02:37,707 --> 02:02:39,402
So, there's no part in the film.

1575
02:02:40,476 --> 02:02:43,570
You're right. There isn't.

1576
02:02:43,846 --> 02:02:47,873
And there's no film.
There's nothing anywhere.

1577
02:02:48,484 --> 02:02:52,079
If it were up to me
we would call it all off now.

1578
02:02:57,493 --> 02:02:59,358
Ah, here you are.

1579
02:02:59,428 --> 02:03:02,693
Where did you go?
We're starting next week.

1580
02:03:03,966 --> 02:03:05,695
Your producer had a great idea.

1581
02:03:05,768 --> 02:03:08,760
The greatest cocktail party ever
to launch a movie.

1582
02:03:08,838 --> 02:03:10,863
And you know where?
- At the launch pad. Tomorrow afternoon.

1583
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,703
Radio, television,
and all the foreign press.

1584
02:03:13,042 --> 02:03:15,237
Come on, Guido, we're starting for real.

1585
02:03:40,703 --> 02:03:41,727
Catch him!

1586
02:03:49,011 --> 02:03:50,706
Let's go. Walk!

1587
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,576
I want to go home.

1588
02:03:51,647 --> 02:03:54,138
Here, he's here.

1589
02:04:02,992 --> 02:04:04,755
Guido, where are you going?
It's over here.

1590
02:04:10,733 --> 02:04:13,258
Guido, I'm sure today will be
a beautiful day.

1591
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:22,435
I'm really curious
to finally hear the story...

1592
02:04:23,913 --> 02:04:27,144
Don't you take yourself a little
too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1593
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:36,956
Leave me alone,
I can walk by myself.

1594
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:44,226
Good luck!

1595
02:04:47,269 --> 02:04:49,464
Dottore, here he is!

1596
02:04:52,341 --> 02:04:53,968
Calm down!

1597
02:04:54,043 --> 02:04:56,807
We've been waiting three days
for you. It's winter already.

1598
02:04:57,213 --> 02:04:58,544
Attention, please.

1599
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:07,878
...do you think of pornography
as an art form or...

1600
02:05:07,957 --> 02:05:10,425
...is pornography a more
intense form of...

1601
02:05:10,493 --> 02:05:14,054
...why don't you ever make a film
about love?

1602
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:29,068
I wish to announce that...

1603
02:05:29,145 --> 02:05:30,874
Tomorrow... tomorrow...

1604
02:05:31,213 --> 02:05:33,613
What do you think
you can teach us?

1605
02:05:33,682 --> 02:05:35,741
Do you really think your life
can be of any interest to others?

1606
02:05:38,053 --> 02:05:40,749
He wants to say something.

1607
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:53,227
Answer, say something, go on.

1608
02:05:53,836 --> 02:05:57,465
Anything at all! Say anything!

1609
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:59,705
Do it for me!

1610
02:06:02,478 --> 02:06:03,809
I promise you...

1611
02:06:03,879 --> 02:06:07,610
...this film. And afterward,
what will you live on?

1612
02:06:08,918 --> 02:06:11,079
Are you for or against divorce?
Tell me, frankly...

1613
02:06:11,153 --> 02:06:14,179
Is that your main problem?

1614
02:06:14,256 --> 02:06:16,247
That you can't communicate?
Or is that just a pretext?

1615
02:06:16,492 --> 02:06:19,120
Your questions betray
a certain hostility.

1616
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:21,663
I assure you my director
is in great form...

1617
02:06:21,831 --> 02:06:23,628
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

1618
02:06:24,166 --> 02:06:26,396
...he should be treated with respect,
because...

1619
02:06:26,669 --> 02:06:28,762
Conocchia, forgive me
if I treated you badly.

1620
02:06:29,171 --> 02:06:32,140
You were wonderful,
the best of them all.

1621
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:34,199
He ponders, considers, reflects.

1622
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:35,768
Speak! Answer!

1623
02:06:35,845 --> 02:06:37,745
I've paid for your confusion,
your breakdown.

1624
02:06:37,813 --> 02:06:39,337
For months I've been paying
for everything.

1625
02:06:39,415 --> 02:06:41,576
Quit this film and I'll ruin you.

1626
02:06:41,984 --> 02:06:43,781
He'll now be at your disposal.

1627
02:06:43,853 --> 02:06:45,184
The press always has been...

1628
02:06:45,254 --> 02:06:48,280
Claudia, where are you?
And your spirits, Rossella?

1629
02:06:50,759 --> 02:06:53,353
What should I do? Leave you?
Disappear?

1630
02:06:53,429 --> 02:06:55,363
You will never be
what you once were.

1631
02:06:55,631 --> 02:06:58,998
Will I ever be your wife?
When will you truly marry me?

1632
02:06:59,168 --> 02:07:01,659
Luisa, is it really true
that you want a separation?

1633
02:07:01,737 --> 02:07:02,795
That you want to leave me?

1634
02:07:02,872 --> 02:07:04,464
How can I go on like this
'til the end?

1635
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:06,167
...and what does your wife think?

1636
02:07:11,413 --> 02:07:13,506
It's in your right-hand pocket,
Dottore.

1637
02:07:14,483 --> 02:07:15,677
So long, Guido.

1638
02:07:15,851 --> 02:07:17,682
I put it in your right-hand pocket.

1639
02:07:27,196 --> 02:07:30,825
Nobody gets away with this. Buffoon!

1640
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,802
Out of there, out! You coward!

1641
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:38,638
Just a minute, a little moment.
I'm thinking of what to say.

1642
02:07:39,975 --> 02:07:42,876
I'm coming... right away!

1643
02:07:45,614 --> 02:07:47,980
Such an incurable romantic.

1644
02:07:52,488 --> 02:07:54,956
Where are you running, you low-life?

1645
02:08:13,175 --> 02:08:15,735
Take it all down, guys!
The film is off.

1646
02:08:16,045 --> 02:08:19,105
In two days it all has to be gone.
Start right away.

1647
02:08:19,448 --> 02:08:20,915
Tear it all down. Come on!

1648
02:08:21,183 --> 02:08:23,048
- Is that it, Dottore?
- Yes, thanks.

1649
02:08:23,185 --> 02:08:25,983
So long, guys. See you next time.

1650
02:08:26,322 --> 02:08:27,584
Let's hope so.

1651
02:08:33,028 --> 02:08:34,222
So long, sailor.

1652
02:08:38,634 --> 02:08:40,295
You've made the right choice.

1653
02:08:40,369 --> 02:08:42,303
Believe me, today
is a good day for you.

1654
02:08:43,238 --> 02:08:45,399
These are tough decisions, I know.

1655
02:08:45,908 --> 02:08:49,674
But we intellectuals, and I say we
because I consider you such,

1656
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:52,675
must remain lucid to the bitter end.

1657
02:08:53,148 --> 02:08:55,241
This life is so full of confusion already,

1658
02:08:55,317 --> 02:08:58,047
that there's no need
to add chaos to chaos.

1659
02:08:59,822 --> 02:09:02,882
Losing money is part
of a producer's job.

1660
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,328
I congratulate you.
You had no choice.

1661
02:09:07,629 --> 02:09:09,324
And he got what he deserved,

1662
02:09:09,531 --> 02:09:13,331
for having joined such a frivolous
venture so lightheartedly.

1663
02:09:15,371 --> 02:09:17,703
Believe me, no need for remorse.

1664
02:09:17,973 --> 02:09:19,463
Destroying is better than creating

1665
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:22,237
when we're not creating those few,
truly necessary things.

1666
02:09:22,678 --> 02:09:25,272
But then is there anything
so clear and right

1667
02:09:25,347 --> 02:09:27,611
that it deserves to live in this world?

1668
02:09:28,984 --> 02:09:31,953
For him, the wrong movie
is only a financial matter.

1669
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:35,488
But for you, at this point,
it could have been the end.

1670
02:09:36,225 --> 02:09:38,989
Better to quit
and strew the ground with salt,

1671
02:09:39,061 --> 02:09:42,428
as the ancients did,
to purify the battlefields.

1672
02:09:42,865 --> 02:09:45,834
In the end what we need is...

1673
02:09:45,901 --> 02:09:49,029
some hygiene, some cleanliness,
disinfection.

1674
02:09:49,371 --> 02:09:53,831
We're smothered by images,
words and sounds

1675
02:09:53,909 --> 02:09:59,040
that have no right to exist, coming
from, and bound for, nothingness.

1676
02:09:59,415 --> 02:10:03,784
Of any artist truly worth the name
we should ask nothing

1677
02:10:03,852 --> 02:10:07,151
except this act of faith: to learn silence.

1678
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:10,217
Do you remember Mallarme's
homage to the white page?

1679
02:10:10,292 --> 02:10:11,589
And Rimbaud...
- Guido, wait!

1680
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:14,458
...a poet, my friend, not a movie director.
What was his finest poetry?

1681
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:16,521
We're ready to begin.

1682
02:10:16,598 --> 02:10:20,090
His refusal to continue writing
and his departure for Africa.

1683
02:10:20,169 --> 02:10:21,466
Congratulations.

1684
02:10:21,537 --> 02:10:25,337
If we can't have everything,
true perfection is nothingness.

1685
02:10:25,741 --> 02:10:30,678
Forgive me for quoting all the time.
But we critics... do what we can.

1686
02:10:31,346 --> 02:10:35,442
Our true mission is... sweeping away
the thousands of miscarriages

1687
02:10:35,517 --> 02:10:39,977
that everyday... obscenely...
try to come to the light.

1688
02:10:40,656 --> 02:10:45,116
And you would actually dare leave
behind you a whole film,

1689
02:10:45,661 --> 02:10:49,256
Iike a cripple who leaves behind
his crooked footprint.

1690
02:10:49,965 --> 02:10:52,297
Such a monstrous presumption
to think

1691
02:10:52,367 --> 02:10:56,633
that others could benefit from the
squalid catalogue of your mistakes!

1692
02:10:57,639 --> 02:11:00,301
And how do you benefit
from stringing together

1693
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:01,774
the tattered pieces of your life?

1694
02:11:01,844 --> 02:11:04,642
Your vague memories, the faces of people

1695
02:11:04,713 --> 02:11:06,908
that you were never able to love...

1696
02:11:15,591 --> 02:11:18,116
What is this sudden happiness
that makes me tremble,

1697
02:11:18,193 --> 02:11:19,785
giving me strength, life?

1698
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:23,455
Forgive me, sweet creatures.

1699
02:11:23,532 --> 02:11:25,466
I hadn't understood. I didn't know.

1700
02:11:26,268 --> 02:11:28,828
It's so natural accepting you,
loving you.

1701
02:11:29,171 --> 02:11:30,798
And so simple.

1702
02:11:31,373 --> 02:11:34,342
Luisa, I feel I've been freed.

1703
02:11:34,843 --> 02:11:37,038
Everything seems so good,
so meaningful.

1704
02:11:37,112 --> 02:11:38,374
Everything is true.

1705
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,748
I wish I could explain.

1706
02:11:41,416 --> 02:11:43,316
But I don't know how to.

1707
02:11:44,153 --> 02:11:48,089
So. Everything is confused again,
as it was before.

1708
02:11:48,223 --> 02:11:49,087
The lights!

1709
02:11:49,158 --> 02:11:50,716
But this confusion is... me.

1710
02:11:50,792 --> 02:11:53,852
Not as I'd like to be, but as I am.

1711
02:11:54,329 --> 02:11:58,265
I'm not afraid anymore
of telling the truth,

1712
02:11:58,333 --> 02:12:02,292
of the things I don't know,
what I'm looking for and haven't found.

1713
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:04,061
This is the only way I can feel alive

1714
02:12:04,139 --> 02:12:06,801
and I can look into your faithful
eyes without shame.

1715
02:12:07,576 --> 02:12:09,134
Life is a celebration.

1716
02:12:09,211 --> 02:12:10,872
Let's live it together!

1717
02:12:12,014 --> 02:12:14,881
This is all I can say Luisa,
to you or the others.

1718
02:12:15,017 --> 02:12:17,042
Accept me for what I am,
if you want me.

1719
02:12:17,419 --> 02:12:19,853
It's the only way we might be able
to find each other.

1720
02:12:21,023 --> 02:12:22,923
I don't know if what
you said to me is right.

1721
02:12:23,659 --> 02:12:26,719
But I can try if you help me.

1722
02:13:26,588 --> 02:13:28,715
Just a minute.
I'll give you the go-ahead.

1723
02:13:39,334 --> 02:13:42,269
Now. Go to the curtain.

1724
02:13:51,913 --> 02:13:52,971
Draw it.

1725
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,009
Everyone come down.

1726
02:13:57,085 --> 02:13:59,610
Talk to each other.

1727
02:14:51,006 --> 02:14:52,098
Mother.

1728
02:14:57,746 --> 02:15:01,147
Sgulp! I did understand what
you wanted to say, you know.

1729
02:15:01,216 --> 02:15:03,081
That you can't do without us.

1730
02:15:03,518 --> 02:15:07,477
At what time will you call me tomorrow?
- Fine, fine. Now join the line!

1731
02:15:07,522 --> 02:15:08,511
Maurice!

1732
02:15:12,728 --> 02:15:16,858
Come, quickly!
Stop fooling around.

1733
02:15:17,099 --> 02:15:21,798
Everybody hold hands!
Spread out! All together.

1734
02:15:24,406 --> 02:15:25,373
Maestro!

1735
02:15:26,007 --> 02:15:28,305
Let's all hold hands!
