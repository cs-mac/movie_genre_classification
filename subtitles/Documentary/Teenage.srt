Two atomic bombs
three days apart.

This is a story
that ends with a beginning.

848
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,727
The old world was over,

849
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,564
and a new figure emerged.

01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:57,407
and gave us Coca-Colas instead.

[ British Boy ]
The teenager
was an American invention.

859
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,555

860
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,727
We knew we could be
blown up in an instant.

861

bankers, the police.

869

And we are the ones
who will fight for it.
