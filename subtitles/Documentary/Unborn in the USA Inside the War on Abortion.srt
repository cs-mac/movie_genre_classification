Well, we've gotten your lab results back.
And everything looks fine.

164
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,832
But there was one oddity.
Are you a twin by any chance, Miss Beldon?

165
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,715
No, I'm an only child.

166
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,796
Are you familiar with the term
"genetic mosaicism"?

167
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,550
Occasionally,
when you're dealing with twins,

168
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,835
the placentas can become fused

169
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,718
and a certain amount of blood
will be exchanged back and forth.

170
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,112
I suppose the emerging pigmentation
in your affected iris could be the result

171
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,713
of that foreign genetic strand.

172
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,314
Now I don't think it's anything
you need to worry about.

173
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,598
But you may wanna see a genetic counsellor,
just to be on the safe side.

176
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,590
Case, what's up?

177
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,195
I just got back from the eye doctor,
and I got my test results back.

178
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,838
And?

179
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,956
Am I a twin, Dad?

180
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,158
Yes.

181
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,798
- Oh, my God.
- You had...

182
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,950
You would have had a brother.

183
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,555
Sweetheart, he died
while you were still in utero.

184
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,993
How?

185
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,550
- Case, it's a long time ago...
- Dad, I need to know.

186
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,548
It was a freak thing.

187
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,234
One of the umbilical cords
got twisted around his throat.

188
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,639
My cord?

189
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,031
So, my brother died?

190
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,394
Is that why Mom killed herself?

191
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,473
Your mother was clinically depressed.
Period.

192
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,438
The hard truth is that
some people come into this world

193
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,714
less equipped for life than others.

194
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,392
Like my brother?

195
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,153
He was never your brother, Case.

196
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,038
It was way too early
in the pregnancy for that.

197

No one does. Mr Walker suffered a stroke.

220

Now he's paralysed from the waist down.

221
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,477
But he doesn't suffer much any more.
His mind is elsewhere.

222
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,757
It's very homey here.

It's tolerable.
I've certainly endured worse.

Oh!

It was just a hallucination, you know?</i>

317
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,838
This was different. She was there.

318
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,589
What if the same thing that happened
to my mother is happening to me?

319
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,830
What if I end up like she did?

I'm sorry, I was just so startled.

Your mother never told
me you were a twin.

But when I saw your eyes today, I knew.

348

The boy in that reflection,
that was your great uncle.

349
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,353
My twin brother, Barto.

350
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,638
He died in 1944,
when we were together in Auschwitz.

351
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,476
<i>We were taken to see
the doctor in charge.</i>

352
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,030
<i>A man who was obsessed with twins.</i>

353
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,073
<i>He was very handsome. Very polite.</i>

354
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,069
<i>We thought we'd been rescued.</i>

355
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,671
<i>The Nazis believed that twins could
unravel the mysteries of genetics.</i>

356
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,600
<i>They conducted experiments on us.</i>

357
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,517
<i>Horrible experiments that blurred the line
between science and occult.</i>

358
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,757
<i>One of their obsessions was eye colour.</i>

359
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,834
<i>By trial and error, they attempted
to fabricate blue eyes from brown.</i>

360
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,470
<i>The injections were painful.</i>

<i>Some caused blindness.</i>

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,277
<i>Some caused death.</i>

363
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,476
Two days later, he came back, except...

364
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,156
It wasn't really Barto.

365
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,390
A doorway had been opened.

366
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,319
Something else was inhabiting his body.

367
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,311
Something else?

368
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,434
Have you ever heard of a dybbuk?

369
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,314
Mmm-mmm.

370
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,315
It is the soul of a dead person that
has been barred from entering heaven.

371
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,438
So it endlessly wanders the borderlands
between the worlds,

372
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,193
trying to find a new body.

373
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,669
Some people are doorways.

374
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,918
Yes. Especially twins.

375
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,959
Because what is a twin
but another kind of mirror?

376
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,635
And mirrors have always been doorways
to the other world.

377
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,469
What happened to your brother?

378
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,672
From the moment he came back,
I knew it wasn't Barto.

379
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,758
<i>A dybbuk had crossed over
and taken his place.</i>

its way back ever since.

Casey. The dybbuk's blood
is on our hands now.

384
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,077
This thing, this entity,
it tried to take hold of your unborn twin!

385
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,916
And when it couldn't have him,
it turned its gaze to the other child.

386
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,309

Well, as for dybbuks, there really
is no such thing, Miss Beldon.

At least, not outside
the realms of folklore.

423
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,029
You have to understand,
back in the Middle Ages,

424
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,954
things like spirits and demons
were really just a catchall

of properly diagnosing.

426

Mental illness, as we know it,
didn't exist back then.

00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,995
I'm not mentally ill, okay?
What's happening to me is real.

428
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,392
Even assuming it is, what you're
asking is beyond my expertise.

429
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,717
I've never performed an exorcism before,
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

430
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,157
Well, you could read the book.
It would tell you what to do.

to these kind of rites that are

it's these elements that I'm familiar with.

It probably predates mankind.

01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:20,031
And it's because of their belief
that these words give us the best shot

626
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,957
at driving this thing out.

627
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,155
I've translated what's in the book,

628
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,199
so I'll be leading the invocation and Arthur
and a few others will be assisting us.

629
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,077
Yeah. Yeah, but before we get started,

630
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,870
there's a few formalities
that we have to get out of the way.

631
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,998
Can I see your IDs, please?

632
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,551
I gotta verify that you're of legal age
to consent to this.

633
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,358
- All right.
- You kidding?

634
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,475
- No.
- No?

635
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:50,157
Not kidding. These are the forms, actually.
I don't know if they're legally binding,

636
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,472
but we're in murky waters here,
just in case something does go wrong.

637
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,072
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

638
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,472
- Great. So when do we do this?
- Tomorrow night. Sabbath.

639
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,555
- At your synagogue?
- Oh, no, no, no.

640
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,276
Given how unorthodox this all is,
I think we'll find another venue.

641
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,831
Yeah, yeah. Is there somewhere
that is particularly negative to you?

642
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,514
Somewhere that
you may have incurred a lot of pain?

643
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,391
- Hell of a place to get religious, Sendak.
- Cheery, isn't it?

644
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,316
This is Rick Hesse, he's an EMT.

645
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,914
I thought it would be a good idea
to have him here, just in case.

646
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,230
- RICK: Nice to meet you.
- As for the other volunteers,

647
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,199
they've all been through some kind of
hardship and they're willing to help.

648
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,272
Now, typically, a Jewish exorcism rite
involves 10 people.

649
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,509
Why 10?

650
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,795
10 fingers, 10 commandments.

651
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,158
<i>10 is also the number of the Sephiroth,
which are the known attributes of God.</i>

652
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,958
The idea is that these 10

653
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,679
form a protective circle
around the afflicted person.

654
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,958
Yeah, once we get going,
Casey will stand in the middle of the circle,

655
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,474
Sendak will read the
original text in Hebrew,

656
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,677
and the rest of you will follow me
in English, call and response format.

657
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:45,233
<i>Now the heart of the ceremony is Psalm 91.
Yoshev B'seter, the Psalm of Protection.</i>

658
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,869
<i>At the beginning and the end of
the invocation, I'll sound the shofar,</i>

659
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,952
which is an animal horn
used in religious ceremonies.

660
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:57,068
In this case, the sound is intended to
shock the spirit hiding within the victim.

661
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,675
Once the spirit is more compliant,
then we can start drawing it out.

662
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,512
That's when the rest of us
are the most vulnerable.

663
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,115
It wants Casey,
but it will take any port in the storm.

664
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,476
And remember, no matter what happens,
once we've begun,

665
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,870
the exorcism must be finished.
Any questions?

666
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,793
Yeah, why are they bringing in a gurney?

667
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,279
The gurney is for Casey's protection
as well as ours.

668
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,875
Sometimes people thrash out,
just a precaution. That's all.

669
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,388
All right then. Let's get started.

670
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,629
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

671
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,153
I just want this to be over.

672
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,911
My name is Arthur Wyndham,
and this is the video record

673
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,039
of the attempted
exorcism of Casey Beldon.

674
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:05,148
We have the permission of the ecclesiastical
authority who are praying for us.

675
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,830
Everyone participating tonight is here
of their own free will, including Casey.

676
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,797
- Agreed?
- Yes.

677
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,758
- Just for the camera.
- Yes, this is what I want.

678
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,190
Now, if... And this is a big if.

679
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,636
But assuming a spirit
actually manifests itself on your person,

680
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:27,111
it may take the shape of a kind of bulge
beneath the flesh.

681
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,474
Now try not to be alarmed by this.

682
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,516
Even though we're dealing
with a spiritual phenomenon,

683
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,160
the entity still needs to be housed
in some degree of physical mass.

684
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,358
So if your body produces a reaction like
that, it means what we're doing is working.

685
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,590
- I understand.
- All right.

686
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,953
Okay, so we're gonna
place this block in your mouth,

687
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,192
- so you don't bite on your tongue.
- Let's just get on with this.

688
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,869
Okay.
