1
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,765
<i>He who merits,</i>

2
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:46,965
<i>through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks</i>

3
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,779
<i>is, however, not counted</i>

4
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,918
<i>among the members
of our Central Committee.</i>

5
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,014
<i>And so</i>

6
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,127
<i>we only can explain it
by reading this letter</i>

7
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:08,458
<i>from the hand and word</i>

8
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:13,894
<i>of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.</i>

9
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,900
<i>A self-explanatory letter.</i>

10
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,879
<i>It says the following:</i>

11
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,676
<i>"Havana, Year of Agriculture.</i>

12
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:33,619
<i>Fidel, at this moment
I remember many things:</i>

13
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,248
<i>When I met you at María Antonia's house,</i>

14
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:40,487
<i>when you proposed that I come along,</i>

15
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:43,428
<i>all the tension
involved in the preparations.</i>

16
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:49,433
<i>One day they came by
asking who to notify in case of death,</i>

17
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:53,838
<i>and the real possibility of it
struck us all.</i>

18
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,605
<i>Later we knew it was true</i>

19
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:05,180
<i>that in a real revolution,
one either wins or dies.</i>

20
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,352
<i>I feel that I have completed
the part of my duty</i>

21
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:13,394
<i>that tied me to the Cuban
revolution in its territory,</i>

22
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,588
<i>and I say farewell to you,</i>

23
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:20,294
<i>to the comrades, to your people,
who now are mine.</i>

24
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,906
<i>I formally resign my positions</i>

25
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,702
<i>in the leadership of the party,</i>

26
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:30,677
<i>my post as minister,
my rank of comandante,</i>

27
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:33,042
<i>and my Cuban citizenship.</i>

28
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:40,784
<i>Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.</i>

29
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:46,088
<i>I can do what is denied to you
by your responsibility as Cuba's leader,</i>

30
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,663
<i>and the time has come for us to part.</i>

31
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:54,166
<i>If my last hour
arrives beneath other skies,</i>

32
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:58,933
<i>my last thought will be for this people,</i>

33
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,873
<i>and especially for you."</i>

34
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,696
Let me see you without the hat.

35
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,610
You're the living portrait of your father.

36
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,584
You have the money?

37
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,343
Yes.

38
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:51,086
We could wait until things settle down.

39
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:58,992
If we don't do it now,
we'll have to wait another 50 years.

40
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,466
One more.

41
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,663
One, two,

42
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,565
three.

43
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:13,143
Aleidita, remember Mom and Dad
sit at the head of the table.

44
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,911
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramón the seat.

45
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:22,484
Here it is. Four and five.

46
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,489
What is he doing?

47
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,135
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.

48
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,569
Go see what your brother is doing.

49
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,356
Special representative from the OAS?

50
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:40,629
Yes, the Organization of American States.

51
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:44,006
Just a second, please.

52
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,271
There's a man who is
a special OAS representative.

53
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:55,675
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.

54
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,119
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

55
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,987
Mister, may I help you with your suitcase?

56
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:08,221
No need.

57
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,726
No. No.

58
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,675
I'm worried about Monje.

59
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,078
Why?

60
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:33,916
When I asked him about the 20 men he promised,

61
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,688
he said, "Which men?"
as if I had never talked to him.

62
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,395
It's okay.

63
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,971
Apolinar.

64
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,237
Serapio.

65
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,939
- How old are you, Serapio?
- Sixteen.

66
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,116
At 16, a man already knows what he wants.

67
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,387
Hello. I'm Camba.

68
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,925
Ramón.

69
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,433
Do you know who that man is?

70
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,226
He came with you.

71
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:23,998
The man you just shook hands with

72
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,198
is Che Guevara.

73
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,546
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

74
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,879
Could I shake his hand again?

75
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,616
- Ramón.
- Ricardo.

76
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,184
- This is Coco, Inti's brother.
- I know, I know.

77
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,353
- The farm is under his name.
- Braulio.

78
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:58,398
- How are you doing, bro?
- How are you?

79
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,435
- Miguel!
- What's up?

80
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,938
- Urbano, how was the trip?
- Quite tough.

81
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,644
Rolando.

82
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,444
You're Inti?

83
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,784
- It's an honor to meet you.
- The honor is mine. I'm Ramón.

84
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:26,289
This is Dr. Ernesto Maymura.

85
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,694
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.

86
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:33,734
- Where did you do your residency?
- At Calixto García.

87
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,904
And so we fell asleep.

88
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,203
Do you know where we woke up?

89
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,111
- In the United States.
- In New York.

90
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,712
We went right in with our Panamanian passports.

91
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,550
Everything was going smoothly

92
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,922
until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!

93
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:03,225
Braulio says, "Let's go over there,
they have hot dogs."

94
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,233
So we got there and, of course,
the vendor was Dominican.

95
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:12,534
The first thing he says is,
"Oh, but you're Cuban."

96
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,732
Braulio just looks at him.

97
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,615
He served us the hot dogs without another word.

98
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,584
I made a mistake and took the wrong flight.

99
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:29,350
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.

100
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,186
What did we discover?

101
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,323
If you dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.

102
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,028
Good one!

103
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,660
To Bolivia or anywhere else!

104
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:50,773
Brother!

105
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,023
Let's go.

106
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,233
Hello.

107
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:18,933
- Eustaquio.
- Welcome, Eustaquio. I'm Ramón.

108
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,802
- Salustio.
- Ramón.

109
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:25,744
- I'm Pedro.
- Ramón.

110
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:27,847
Paco.

111
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:32,211
- Aniceto.
- Tuma, this is Aniceto.

112
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,756
Carlos.

113
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:36,988
Tuma.

114
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,288
- Willy.
- I'm Chapaco.

115
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:44,262
I'll need a few days to learn all your names.

116
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,863
In the last conversation I had with Monje,

117
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,795
I made it clear that if we really
want to change this society,

118
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,128
we are the ones most capable of doing it.

119
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,534
That's why the party
has to support the guerrilla.

120
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:36,776
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.

121
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:39,714
He began to talk about his love for his family.

122
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,181
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.

123
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,315
That is why, with all due respect, Ramón,

124
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:51,389
I don't think the party
will support an armed struggle,

125
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,585
much less Mario Monje.

126
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,259
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz

127
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:02,267
and recruit the best people from the party

128
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,663
to join the group.

129
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,844
First we have to meet
Mario Monje as we agreed to.

130
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:13,072
Not doing so would be inappropriate.

131
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:32,898
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.

132
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:38,797
Mario, anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men,

133
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,306
conditions are right.

134
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,569
When children work in mines

135
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:51,317
and 50 percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age...

136
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,386
When these same miners go on strike

137
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:57,753
to improve their wages,

138
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:04,594
and they are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right or not?

139
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,967
If infant mortality rates

140
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,470
are the highest in Latin America

141
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,939
because of lack of hospitals and medical care,

142
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,805
the situation is right for me.

143
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:22,008
If we learned something in Cuba,

144
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,646
it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle

145
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,156
has no chance of taking power.

146
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:37,189
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner,

147
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:39,698
they will turn their backs on you.

148
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,695
You will die heroically,

149
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:48,836
but you have no hope of achieving victory.

150
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,909
Then let's change the name of Bolivia.

151
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:57,678
After all, Simón Bolívar
was a Venezuelan, right?

152
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,582
Comrade Monje,

153
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:03,384
your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che,

154
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:07,928
that Ramón, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.

155
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:11,863
It's true. Ramón is like Simón Bolívar.

156
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,499
The party does not endorse armed struggle.

157
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,669
You are free to abandon it.

158
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,311
And you will have our support if you do.

159
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:29,315
If you stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.

160
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,488
As the head of the Communist Party here,
I advise you to leave with me.

161
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:46,426
With a mojito, you cannot grind up the leaves.

162
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:47,626
I know about mojitos.

163
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,464
So you know you can't grind them up.

164
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,799
You cannot grind the leaves.

165
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,309
How are you?

166
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,880
Come over.
Just a second, I'm finishing here.

167
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,887
Then you have to cover it.

168
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,253
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.

169
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,863
No, I forgot something.
On top of the cream, put cheese.

170
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,520
Cheese.

171
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,227
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.

172
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,425
Go ahead.

173
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,902
- Everything good?
- Yes, good.

174
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:30,105
Why did Che change the location of the camp?

175
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:33,413
I think he wanted to be closer to Argentina.

176
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:37,143
He had contacts waiting for him in Alto Beni.

177
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:41,822
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.

178
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:44,050
They support us.

179
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:48,590
Che needed somewhere to train for six months

180
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,992
where he wouldn't be bothered.

181
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:56,331
How is that Ñancahuazú region?

182
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:03,344
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.

183
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:07,808
In fact, the few peasants who live there

184
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,043
don't trust foreigners.

185
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:16,986
The Soviets won't allow Monje to make a deal.

186
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,524
No.

187
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:26,257
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.

188
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:33,034
And we need to find out if there's
anything else that we need to send.

189
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,168
We also found a cave which could be useful.

190
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,775
Good morning.

191
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:45,920
I told the men that I'm going back
to La Paz today.

192
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,589
I'm resigning from the party.

193
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,888
My mission is over.

194
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,389
- Okay.
- The jeep arrives this afternoon.

195
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,295
Why don't you stay in the camp
until the jeep arrives?

196
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:04,462
I would like to be alone.

197
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,608
I'll wait at the zinc house.

198
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,141
Fine.

199
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:15,609
I'll return on January 10th,
with my decision made.

200
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,843
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.

201
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:30,291
Coco, find Moisés Guevara.

202
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,331
Tell him I want to talk to him.

203
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:37,768
We're leaving in a few days on a training march

204
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:41,267
for about 20, 25 days.

205
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,677
I'll go to the mines.

206
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:50,584
I'll be back between
the 4th and 14th of February.

207
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,949
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's Carnival season,

208
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:56,387
La Diablada in Oruro.

209
00:27:57,126 --> 00:28:00,323
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.

210
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,199
You are our primary connection to the outside.

211
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:09,732
Your cover needs to remain intact.

212
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,499
You can't come back to the camp.

213
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,042
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.

214
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:21,546
And your husband?

215
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:24,445
How are things?
Did you get the trip straightened out?

216
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,647
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.

217
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:32,087
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?

218
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:34,895
We've been in contact.

219
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:40,332
- What happened?
- I think he likes me.

220
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,697
I know he likes me.

221
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,135
- Should I try to see him again?
- Yes.

222
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:53,174
Tania, when this thing heats up,

223
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:56,309
your job will make the difference.

224
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:04,118
Here are provisions:
Sugar, eggs, flour, what's needed.

225
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:13,729
The new employee, is he Bolivian?

226
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,301
Yes.

227
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,962
- How much do I owe you?
- No, keep your money.

228
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,598
- No, keep it.
- We are neighbors now.

229
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:24,302
- Take it.
- I'm not doing this for the money.

230
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,517
I want to take part in your project.

231
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:37,648
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.

232
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,058
Okay?

233
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,190
Go with Tuma to see our neighbor

234
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:49,365
and tell him we need his help.
Involve him without offering much.

235
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:54,435
Tell him that we'll pay for
what he carries in the jeep

236
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,271
and nothing else.

237
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:57,968
Tumaini.

238
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,343
Put a little fear in him.

239
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:03,177
And explain to him that if he betrays us
he'll pay with his life.

240
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:07,186
You can drive back and forth
to town in your jeep

241
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:11,588
so you can buy the food we need,
and we'll pay you well.

242
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,819
Yes, sure, whatever you want.

243
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,527
- Good.
- I have to tell you something.

244
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,295
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.

245
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,836
Okay, fine.

246
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:46,859
You want some more?

247
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:53,530
There were two little birds who lived in a tree.

248
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:59,097
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers and sing and sing.

249
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,607
One day a hunter came by.

250
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,841
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.

251
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,343
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.

252
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,249
He saved his own life.

253
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:15,615
It's a nice story.

254
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,123
- It's good.
- It's good. I liked it.

255
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,818
I really liked it. I know what you mean.

256
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,378
You junkie son of a bitch.

257
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,638
We'll see.

258
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,788
Good morning.

259
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,129
- How are you?
- Good morning.

260
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,601
This looks beautiful!

261
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:06,034
I see the factory is doing well.

262
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,937
- Good morning.
- Come with me.

263
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,913
Can we come in? Show me the house.

264
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,056
I see you are really busy.

265
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,753
Soon.

266
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't know when, but soon
we will confront the enemy.

267
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:40,105
Our contact with the outside will be limited.

268
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:47,309
Some of us will die,
and it's sad to see your comrades die

269
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:52,515
because you can't help them
with your limited resources.

270
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,848
Food will be scarce.

271
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,556
Sometimes we won't have anything to eat.

272
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,862
And if all of this weren't enough,

273
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:09,428
we'll have to endure the harsh weather.

274
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:13,497
By the end,

275
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,539
we will have become human waste.

276
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:19,540
That's all I can promise you.

277
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,215
<i>Think it over.</i>

278
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,189
<i>You still have time to go back home.</i>

279
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,357
<i>Afterwards it will be too late.</i>

280
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,295
<i>In closing,</i>

281
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:39,964
<i>I would like to repeat</i>

282
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,832
<i>what I said to Monje.</i>

283
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:47,642
<i>Me? I'm already here.</i>

284
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,842
<i>They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.</i>

285
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:57,074
<i>I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.</i>

286
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:42,393
How much corn can you sell us right now?

287
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,489
There's not even enough for us, sir.

288
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,794
At least sell us a pig.

289
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,599
They're piglets, just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?

290
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,708
Besides, they belong to the missus.

291
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,840
How much is your pig, madam?

292
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,505
I can't sell them, they're only sucklings.

293
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,311
I'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.

294
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,749
I'm not sure.

295
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:09,823
How about 40,000?

296
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:12,686
Should we sell or not?

297
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,724
Make it 50,000, okay?

298
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,664
Okay.

299
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,401
What conditions do they live in?

300
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,329
Very bad.

301
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,568
Do they have children?

302
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:33,442
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.

303
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:37,278
One of the little boys has a badly infected eye.

304
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,420
How old is the peasant?

305
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,415
About 40, 50 years old.

306
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:46,493
I think he's a bit older, you know?

307
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:53,358
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?

308
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:56,629
His eyes sparkled when he saw the money.

309
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:58,371
Hello.

310
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,499
Good day, Honorato.

311
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,781
Come, I want to talk to you.

312
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:20,792
We want there to be schools for your children,

313
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:23,692
and hospitals to take care of them,

314
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:25,799
and roads to be built

315
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:29,459
so trucks can reach here,
and you can sell your products.

316
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:33,307
Don't you want all these things?

317
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:36,033
Well, yes, that would be nice.

318
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:39,612
But in order to do this, we need your help.

319
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,848
Two and three.

320
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,792
Look.

321
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,965
You are a big man.

322
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,600
May God repay you.

323
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:02,760
- It's all right.
- May God repay you.

324
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,941
Okay.

325
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,437
- See you.
- Bye, madam.

326
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,043
- Goodbye.
- May God repay you.

327
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,354
What are you doing?

328
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,858
That's communal food.

329
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,094
No one helps themselves
without being given permission to do so.

330
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:41,599
Understood?

331
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:46,232
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.

332
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:50,468
- Everything belongs to the group.
- But we're hungry.

333
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:55,548
We're all hungry, Darío.
But one can feeds six for breakfast.

334
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,786
There's one missing.

335
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:33,217
I have no radio coverage with
the main camp, so I'm going back.

336
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:36,755
No, big guy. You're not going anywhere.

337
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:40,520
Stay with us until 6, then you can
tell Ramón how far we've gone.

338
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:42,458
No, I'm going now while it's still light out.

339
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,121
Hey, I'm giving you an order!

340
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,427
Stay here until 6.

341
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:52,700
- I'm leaving now.
- You're not leaving, can't you hear?

342
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:54,364
You listen to me, I'm fucking going!

343
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,840
You'll have to go through my machete first!

344
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,070
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

345
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:01,340
Hey, Miguel!

346
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:03,507
What's going on here?

347
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:05,619
Listen, listen!

348
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,345
Miguel, look at me!

349
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,387
Hey, you're comrades.

350
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,219
- For what? He has to follow orders!
- That's enough!

351
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:16,488
Miguel, you have to control yourself

352
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,861
and give orders with respect

353
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,763
like a boss.

354
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:27,631
You cannot threaten or hit anyone here.

355
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:31,134
That's not permitted by the guerrilla.

356
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:33,971
And you know that better than anyone.

357
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,279
And you

358
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:40,582
lied.

359
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:46,784
Miguel never hit you with the machete
handle. He didn't even touch you.

360
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:51,056
The one thing I won't tolerate here

361
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,393
is a liar.

362
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,092
One more incident like that, Pacho,

363
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:59,869
and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonorable discharge.

364
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:06,873
Incidents like this destroy group morale
and our readiness for combat,

365
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,448
not only of you or you,

366
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:11,881
but of the entire group.

367
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:16,815
If anyone feels weak or discouraged,

368
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,389
he shouldn't resort to such methods,

369
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:24,460
but should speak to the political commissaries,

370
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:27,396
to Inti or Rolando or to me,

371
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,367
and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.

372
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,803
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.

373
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,841
Listen to me.

374
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:18,542
Ramón could be back now in Cuba with his family,

375
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:23,820
with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.

376
00:42:23,992 --> 00:42:28,827
But he is here because he wants you
to have a better life,

377
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:32,325
so your kids can learn to read and write.

378
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,533
I'm just a baker, I've been a slave all my life,

379
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:40,372
but someday I'll be free.

380
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,706
Rest, because we'll be leaving at sunrise.

381
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:52,046
- We're not staying here?
- No, we need to be patient.

382
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,485
We are taking you to another camp
where you'll be safer.

383
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:58,050
Have you had any problems?

384
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:01,252
There's a neighbor that thinks
we're making cocaine.

385
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,258
The police have been here twice already.

386
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:13,704
When's the last time you heard from Ramón?

387
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:16,207
Over a week ago.

388
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,039
We lost contact with the whole group.

389
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,850
Moisés, hello!

390
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:29,981
Who did you bring?

391
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:34,322
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Perú.

392
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:38,259
Are you going back to Camiri?

393
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:41,231
I need to talk to Ramón first.

394
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:44,860
Monje and the party
are interfering with everything.

395
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,100
They even convinced the last Bolivians
that were trained in Cuba

396
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:53,111
not to come here and join us.

397
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:57,083
Hey, listen.

398
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:00,277
Hey. Everyone keep away
from her hammock.

399
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:04,118
Whoever touches her will be severely punished.

400
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,494
Listen to me, Arturo.

401
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,491
They are Bolivian, and they have come to fight.

402
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,261
You must not disrespect them.

403
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:29,247
I need two volunteers to go hunt,
and I thought about you.

404
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:34,848
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.

405
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:42,991
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this!

406
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:59,062
Hey, that sounds like a plane.

407
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:01,969
Airplane!

408
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:05,478
Come on, Ramón.

409
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:14,286
Get down, Ramón.

410
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:44,648
They caught two of Moisés' men who deserted,

411
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:46,446
and they talked like parrots.

412
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:49,021
Soldiers went into the zinc house.

413
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,954
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.

414
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:54,890
- Who gave orders to move camp?
- Antonio did.

415
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,997
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.

416
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,864
- Bring back all to the camp.
- Okay.

417
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:02,593
Rolando.

418
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:06,439
Prepare an ambush.

419
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:14,514
Was there anything in the jeep?

420
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:19,647
I had some recordings of Fidel's speeches.

421
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:24,249
They're going to search the jeep
which will lead them to the hotel,

422
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,417
and the hotel will lead them to your apartment,

423
00:47:27,995 --> 00:47:30,862
and your apartment will lead them to everything.

424
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:33,792
I couldn't trust anyone.

425
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:38,297
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.

426
00:47:38,472 --> 00:47:45,173
- That's why I decided to bring--
- You had strict orders not to return.

427
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,547
That's five years of lost work.

428
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,279
Tania, five!

429
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:55,515
Give me your rifle.

430
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:01,384
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.

431
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,062
Hold your fire!

432
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:49,399
We surrender! We surrender!

433
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,674
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.

434
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,308
I didn't want to be here. I swear.

435
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,181
Calm down.

436
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:04,891
- Please don't kill me, please.
- Calm down.

437
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:10,025
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.

438
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,028
- No one is going to hurt you.
- And I have a bad heart.

439
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,300
Don't believe a word Major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.

440
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,803
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.

441
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:25,139
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.

442
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,011
So, what should we do with him?

443
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:30,150
Kill him.

444
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,882
Yes, kill him.

445
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,583
Put him on his side.

446
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:43,088
- Did you give him a painkiller?
- Not yet.

447
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:45,598
Give him some morphine.

448
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:50,161
We have committed ourselves
to a struggle in which,

449
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:54,569
whether we like it or not, we may have to kill

450
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:57,034
or be killed,

451
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:00,669
because we are fighting for Bolivia's freedom.

452
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:05,718
You can do it now.

453
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,296
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.

454
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:21,768
We hope to see you soon.

455
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:26,706
Because we could use more
of your ammunitions and weapons.

456
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:33,310
Long live a free Bolivia!

457
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:35,813
Long live the National Liberation Army!

458
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:47,626
No one wanted to stay.

459
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,460
That takes time.

460
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:10,181
This is a national emergency.

461
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:13,149
Is the United States going to sit back

462
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,346
and let Castro create another
Communist revolution in Bolivia,

463
00:51:16,524 --> 00:51:17,923
in the heart of South America?

464
00:51:18,092 --> 00:51:20,219
Mr. President,
the threat has three components.

465
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:23,591
One, the actions of the guerillas themselves.

466
00:51:23,764 --> 00:51:27,598
Two, the lack of anti-guerilla capability
at all levels in the field,

467
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,395
including your high command.

468
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,505
Three, the potential for the various
elements in the population

469
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,504
to become indifferent to the situation.

470
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,666
That's my point.

471
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,438
What if Che Guevara is here?

472
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:41,808
I can't have that information made public.

473
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,745
Mr. President, our latest intelligence

474
00:51:43,918 --> 00:51:46,045
indicates Guevara did not get out of the Congo.

475
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,745
Guevara is irrelevant
if you're controlling the press

476
00:51:48,923 --> 00:51:52,381
and winning the hearts of the peasants.
They're your source of information.

477
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,427
If anyone's going to know
where the guerrillas are, it's them.

478
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,394
We believe you should train
a small, specially equipped force

479
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:00,625
to deal directly with the existing threat.

480
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,497
These men should be recruited
from existing Bolivian forces

481
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:07,539
and their area of operation
should be restricted to the combat zone.

482
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:10,935
And who is going to train these men?

483
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:14,842
We have men supervising
similar operations in Vietnam.

484
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:16,983
They can work with your people.

485
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:21,684
No, if you leave now you could be arrested.

486
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:25,882
I think you should wait until
we start our march northward.

487
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,927
- You're going north?
- Yes.

488
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:33,428
Then we can let you off on the Cochabamba road.

489
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:37,298
No, I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.

490
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:40,838
Ciro, we're at war.

491
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,003
Give me a guide.

492
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:46,646
Give me a guide, and I'll make the arrangements.

493
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:50,011
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.

494
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,151
I'll think about an alternative.

495
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,881
But any move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.

496
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:10,966
Ramón, your books are soaked.

497
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:14,073
Put them on those rocks to dry.

498
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:19,911
Arturo.

499
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,106
Water got in the radio, everything is rusted.

500
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,412
What are you saying, that it doesn't work?

501
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:29,454
It still receives, but it doesn't send.

502
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,395
Shit. Now we're really screwed.

503
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:42,365
Not quite. We still have
the visitors to relay messages.

504
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,568
The army says that you are here
to practice Communism.

505
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:53,440
That you have no God,
that you all work for the state.

506
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:57,710
That you rape women and destroy families.

507
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:02,379
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and want to make us slaves.

508
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:04,717
And what kind of freedom do you have?

509
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:06,621
The kind where I can do whatever I want.

510
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:10,890
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.

511
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:13,192
We haven't come to harm anybody.

512
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:16,461
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.

513
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,035
But I have nothing, only this.

514
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:24,269
How much do you want for this?

515
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,140
Whatever you have. Take it.

516
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:33,779
I'll stay if you need me.

517
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:39,055
What I need now are peasants.

518
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:44,563
It's better if you go to France and make
a network to promote our cause,

519
00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:49,499
so they can send us money, medicine and radios.

520
00:54:51,238 --> 00:54:55,174
I'd also need you to take some messages to Cuba.

521
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,034
I'll write Sartre and Bertrand Russell

522
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:03,775
to organize a worldwide fund

523
00:55:03,951 --> 00:55:06,943
on behalf of the Bolivian revolution.

524
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,533
Don't worry.

525
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,564
We'll take you out of here when you recover.

526
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:27,933
I'm not worried.

527
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,239
Tumaini.

528
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,590
Here, it's yours.

529
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:52,022
To protect you.

530
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:07,471
I'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.

531
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,209
I want you to stay with the sick
until we come back.

532
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:13,580
How long will you be gone?

533
00:56:13,754 --> 00:56:15,221
About three days.

534
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:57,196
Rolando.

535
00:56:57,364 --> 00:57:00,731
Go with Loro to replace Benigno and Miguel.

536
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:02,866
Ramón.

537
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:05,036
There's no one in the house.

538
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:09,005
So leave the money with a note.

539
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:36,262
Pick up everything, we're leaving.

540
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,813
Ramón.

541
00:57:50,851 --> 00:57:52,944
There's no sign of Loro.

542
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:03,160
That's what they've given me, captain.

543
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,825
What good is this for?

544
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:07,557
Are there any shops here?

545
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:12,066
They took my pigs and my corn.

546
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:17,477
You helped them, and they gave you money.

547
00:58:17,644 --> 00:58:21,307
Now you are going to help us
eliminate them, otherwise...

548
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:24,575
And now you are stealing my chickens, captain.

549
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,219
Listen to me closely, smartass,
really pay attention.

550
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:34,383
Let me know immediately
if the guerrillas come back again.

551
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:37,086
You have a good heart.

552
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:40,023
You'll do it.

553
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,808
- Alejandro.
- Hey.

554
00:58:54,982 --> 00:58:57,212
This is Captain Mitchell, in charge of training.

555
00:58:57,384 --> 00:58:59,818
Nice to meet you.

556
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:12,293
By the time we're through,
we'll turn the Bolivians

557
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:16,664
- into U.S.-grade special forces.
- We'll train them in the following areas:

558
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:20,034
Weapons, communications,
demolition and intelligence.

559
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:21,697
Also educate them politically,

560
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:24,537
so they understand the moral
component of the operation.

561
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:27,441
We also have one of the best
chopper pilots in Nam.

562
00:59:27,614 --> 00:59:29,707
- So how much time do you need?
- Five months.

563
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:55,970
Good morning.

564
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:03,241
I'm just here to write an article
on the guerrilla movement in Bolivia.

565
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:09,879
Trying to confirm the Bolivian army's rumors

566
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:14,187
that Che Guevara is the leader of the group,

567
01:00:14,561 --> 01:00:17,496
and there is a woman with him.

568
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,190
This guy is a Trojan horse.

569
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,464
I don't want any Cubans talking to him.

570
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:34,881
- What's up, Darío?
- Food is ready.

571
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,506
Start serving. Children first.

572
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:42,579
Are you from Paraguay?

573
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:47,056
Paraguay? No way, I'm from Oruro.

574
01:00:48,295 --> 01:00:50,195
Okay, kids.

575
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:53,491
Once you are done you have to leave, right?

576
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:57,103
We can't leave, because that gringo
owes us money.

577
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,636
How much does he owe you?

578
01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:02,070
Fifty pesos.

579
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:17,389
I spoke with the Englishman about the way out.

580
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:22,158
He says the army knows him in Camiri.

581
01:01:23,997 --> 01:01:26,488
We could get out that way.

582
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:30,036
You are the ones to make that decision.

583
01:01:31,972 --> 01:01:36,409
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.

584
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,042
Inti will take you up the road to Camiri.

585
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:48,214
Try not to go through Muyupampa.

586
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,083
Don't get yourselves captured.

587
01:01:51,258 --> 01:01:55,092
If that happens, remember
to always deny my presence

588
01:01:55,262 --> 01:02:00,063
and the presence of all Cubans here
at each moment and at all costs.

589
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:04,670
- Do you have a cigarette?
- No, I don't.

590
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:06,465
Goddamn it!

591
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,076
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.

592
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:12,768
- But I do have some tobacco.
- Oh.

593
01:02:12,946 --> 01:02:15,471
Thanks, brother.

594
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,177
Where are the Cubans?

595
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:21,445
- Well, they should be--
- Darío, come here!

596
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:28,959
I told you not to talk to that guy.
What did he say?

597
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:32,621
He didn't say anything, brother.
I asked him for a cigarette.

598
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,528
You're going to the back.

599
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,939
Freeze! Stop right there!

600
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:18,134
Drop your backpacks
and show us your papers, shitheads!

601
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:22,176
Throw them on the ground.

602
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:26,080
The Frenchman's name is Régis Debray.

603
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,883
Masquerades as a radical author,
a Marxist journalist.

604
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:34,390
<i>Spends a lot of time in Cuba,
and is a good friend of Fidel Castro.</i>

605
01:03:35,362 --> 01:03:39,662
<i>The Argentine's name is Ciro Bustos.
A painter and also a writer.</i>

606
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:43,394
<i>This character collected money in 1963</i>

607
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,939
<i>for a local guerrilla movement
led by Jorge Massetti.</i>

608
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:51,871
<i>Massetti was killed
by the police in Argentina in 1964.</i>

609
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,267
<i>Two mercenaries, a
Frenchman and an Argentine, were killed</i>

610
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,710
<i>when confronted by the army
in the area known as Vaca Guzmán.</i>

611
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:32,174
The Guzmán region, that's in Muyupampa.

612
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:38,685
If that's true, those bastards
are going to pay for it, bigtime.

613
01:04:48,201 --> 01:04:51,466
The three of them were arrested.
They were taken to Camiri.

614
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,696
Who told you that?

615
01:04:52,872 --> 01:04:55,841
We stopped a van that came from Muyupampa

616
01:04:56,009 --> 01:05:01,072
with a German priest and a man.
They gave all the information.

617
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:05,911
They want to talk to the boss.
They gave us some sweets and stuff.

618
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:08,813
- Inti, have those people seen you?
- No.

619
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,731
Many of your men are not Bolivian.

620
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:25,598
That's why no one trusts you.

621
01:05:25,772 --> 01:05:27,535
But they trust you.

622
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:32,201
They asked us to talk to you.

623
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:37,012
Then tell them that our army
is open to anyone who wants to fight.

624
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,912
They should be here with us.

625
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:42,577
No, they reject everything
that has to do with violence.

626
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:47,284
So people in power can use
violence to oppress us,

627
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,190
but we can't use it to free ourselves?

628
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,025
They don't want to join you,
and they don't want you here.

629
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,760
You don't have the right to ruin their lives.

630
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,875
You are going to have peace today in Muyupampa

631
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:09,378
on the condition that you bring us
a truck of food and medical goods

632
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:12,278
by 6 p.m. on this watch.

633
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,913
We'll meet at Nemesio's farm.
We'll pay for everything.

634
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:20,550
Then we'll go, you have my word.

635
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:22,552
Okay.

636
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:26,565
Open your mouth.

637
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:48,647
They will torture Bustos and Debray.

638
01:06:48,822 --> 01:06:50,949
They'll learn everything.

639
01:06:56,329 --> 01:06:57,853
Ramón.

640
01:06:58,531 --> 01:07:01,466
I think you should change your name.

641
01:07:03,002 --> 01:07:05,163
That's not a bad idea.

642
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:13,635
Plane! Get everyone out of the house.

643
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:15,713
- Run!
- Cover yourselves!

644
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:18,276
Quickly, under the tree!

645
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,975
Get out of here!

646
01:07:27,193 --> 01:07:29,684
Most of these men are Cubans.
Don't be mistaken.

647
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:36,434
This is an invasion promoted by Castro.

648
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:44,377
A Communist plot to remove a peaceful,
democratically elected government.

649
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:47,312
President Barrientos, what about the Americans?

650
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:50,682
Are there U.S. military advisors?

651
01:07:50,855 --> 01:07:55,258
The United States has sent
planes, helicopters and nothing more.

652
01:07:55,426 --> 01:07:59,226
That's their response to the guerrilla threat?

653
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:05,496
Our military is entirely capable
of handling this situation.

654
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:09,600
The guerrilla forces are on their last legs.

655
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:13,504
Is Che Guevara leading this group?

656
01:08:14,245 --> 01:08:18,875
I'll say it once.
Che Guevara is not in Bolivia.

657
01:08:32,496 --> 01:08:35,124
- Fernando. Fernando.
- Hm.

658
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:38,598
The miners are threatening to go on strike.

659
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:42,600
Where?

660
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:44,900
In Catavi, Siglo XX.

661
01:08:45,242 --> 01:08:47,574
The miners are going on strike!

662
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:19,899
Fernando. Miners have pledged 50
bolivianos of their paychecks to our cause.

663
01:09:22,046 --> 01:09:24,810
For them, that's a fortune.

664
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:30,110
Arturo, report to Miguel at the ambush

665
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:32,380
and replace Pablito.

666
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:37,121
I'll go through all of Bolivia
without firing a single shot.

667
01:09:37,294 --> 01:09:38,693
Okay.

668
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:43,195
Sir, the situation is slipping
through our fingers.

669
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:46,033
The pope and de Gaulle
are pressuring us about Debray.

670
01:09:46,203 --> 01:09:50,230
Some members of your coalition
are expressing support for the strike

671
01:09:50,407 --> 01:09:52,341
and sympathy for the rebel cause.

672
01:09:52,576 --> 01:09:55,477
We need to take control of this thing.

673
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:58,245
What do you have in mind?

674
01:09:58,415 --> 01:09:59,643
Tell people about Guevara.

675
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:03,548
Declare a state of emergency
and crack down on the Siglo XX miners,

676
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:05,211
the iron fist.

677
01:10:05,389 --> 01:10:09,621
Seal the borders and declare
a national state of war.

678
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,689
And the rebels?

679
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:13,419
Your main problem, Mr. President,

680
01:10:13,597 --> 01:10:17,226
is the lack of coordination
among your deployed forces.

681
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:19,926
I couldn't agree more, sir.

682
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:22,866
What do you suggest?

683
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:25,204
Divide the region in three zones.

684
01:10:25,376 --> 01:10:29,039
Surround each zone,
cut off its source of supply,

685
01:10:29,213 --> 01:10:32,148
and liquidate any guerrilla forces.

686
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,518
<i>A few minutes ago,
Radio Argentina reported</i>

687
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:41,715
<i>the sad news about the Siglo XX massacre,</i>

688
01:10:41,925 --> 01:10:45,827
<i>which resulted in the deaths
of 87 miners.</i>

689
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:49,898
<i>The families and fellow miners
mourn their loss.</i>

690
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,900
What are they saying on Bolivian stations?

691
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,897
The same.

692
01:10:55,072 --> 01:10:59,099
They confirm the battle in the mines,
but they are silent about the death toll.

693
01:11:16,126 --> 01:11:17,991
They hit Pombo.

694
01:11:19,263 --> 01:11:21,493
They almost got us, man.

695
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:42,409
Pour me some water.

696
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,064
Come on, breathe.

697
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:16,616
The worst is over.

698
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:46,182
He asked that you hold
his watch until you can give it to his son.

699
01:12:58,495 --> 01:12:59,985
Joaquín.

700
01:13:00,531 --> 01:13:02,829
We can't circle it forever.

701
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,468
This place is crawling with troops.

702
01:13:07,938 --> 01:13:10,338
Ramón told us not to move out of the area.

703
01:13:10,507 --> 01:13:14,238
That was before the army overran our camp.

704
01:13:14,411 --> 01:13:17,141
We have no food left, nothing.

705
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:20,147
If Ramón were coming back, he'd be here by now.

706
01:13:21,018 --> 01:13:23,646
If we leave, how are we going to meet him?

707
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:27,814
If Ramón is not here it's because
the army is preventing him.

708
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:31,992
I say we find our way to the Rio Grande.

709
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:36,258
We've got as much chance
finding Ramón across the river

710
01:13:36,433 --> 01:13:38,867
as we do here.

711
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:58,314
Good morning, miss.

712
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:00,923
Can you sell me a can of milk?

713
01:14:02,559 --> 01:14:04,550
Ricardo, what's up?

714
01:14:05,262 --> 01:14:08,527
- Shut up and give me your canteen.
- Moron!

715
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:24,336
Breathe! Now hold it.

716
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:26,142
- Fuck!
- Calm down.

717
01:14:26,316 --> 01:14:27,613
Hold it!

718
01:14:46,036 --> 01:14:47,060
Breathe.

719
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:09,251
How long are we going to look for these people?

720
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,691
Until we find them.

721
01:15:11,862 --> 01:15:16,196
I agree, but I think
we're moving away from them.

722
01:15:16,366 --> 01:15:19,631
We should try to make contact
with the capital again.

723
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:22,033
We're at an impasse.

724
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:25,470
How many more of us have to die
to find the other group?

725
01:15:25,642 --> 01:15:30,978
Chapaco, if you were lost,
we'd do the same thing.

726
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:35,378
No one abandons anyone in the group.

727
01:15:35,919 --> 01:15:37,284
Is that clear?

728
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:41,189
Let's go.

729
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,902
Excuse me, Fernando,

730
01:16:37,214 --> 01:16:39,580
but the men are starving,

731
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,216
and we have nothing to give them.

732
01:16:42,486 --> 01:16:47,253
We also have nothing for the animals.
They're eating the bark off the trees.

733
01:16:47,424 --> 01:16:49,585
- What do you want me to do?
- Kill a horse.

734
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:59,302
I'm giving you another shot.

735
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,600
Fernando, with your permission.

736
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:41,510
I think I could

737
01:17:41,678 --> 01:17:45,637
make it back to the camp
to look for your medicines.

738
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,540
What do you want?

739
01:17:49,286 --> 01:17:51,345
Do you want me to divide the group again?

740
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:54,150
I'm not doing it.

741
01:17:54,324 --> 01:17:59,318
And even less, risk anyone's life

742
01:17:59,496 --> 01:18:01,191
for the sake of my own well-being.

743
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:08,325
We are in a difficult situation.

744
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:11,828
The truth is, all of us

745
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,993
have made mistakes.

746
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:16,833
But I made the worst mistake

747
01:19:17,274 --> 01:19:20,710
when I didn't bring my medicines along.

748
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:24,880
This struggle gives us

749
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:28,310
the opportunity to become

750
01:19:28,919 --> 01:19:34,482
true revolutionaries,
the highest level of humanity.

751
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,959
To become men

752
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:42,526
in the purest sense of the word.

753
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:46,965
Too old to learn.

754
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:50,967
If the wheel rolls downhill,

755
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:53,200
let it go.

756
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:13,558
Come on, let's go up.

757
01:20:17,032 --> 01:20:18,727
Let's go!

758
01:20:24,773 --> 01:20:28,072
- Let's go!
- No, I can hold them!

759
01:20:28,243 --> 01:20:29,767
Go!

760
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:36,343
You bastards!

761
01:20:41,923 --> 01:20:46,019
They're reporting three hours
of intense combat in Monteagudo

762
01:20:46,194 --> 01:20:49,721
between a group of guerrillas
and the 3rd division.

763
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:54,425
The army didn't suffer any casualties.

764
01:20:54,603 --> 01:20:56,366
Here's Monteagudo.

765
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,233
They are talking about one dead guerrilla

766
01:21:00,408 --> 01:21:02,103
named Antonio Fernández from Tarata.

767
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:05,144
Pombo, sounds like it was Pedro.

768
01:21:05,313 --> 01:21:07,110
He's from Tarata.

769
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:10,411
Monteagudo is here.

770
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:15,184
- Where exactly?
- Here, south of Ñancahuazú.

771
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:27,967
This is where Joaquín
and his group are operating.

772
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:32,231
- So, what we're hearing makes sense.
- We're not far off.

773
01:21:37,345 --> 01:21:39,643
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

774
01:21:39,814 --> 01:21:42,544
With your permission,
I need to check your house.

775
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:45,382
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

776
01:21:47,556 --> 01:21:49,148
Hello, madam.

777
01:21:50,492 --> 01:21:52,119
Good afternoon.

778
01:21:59,267 --> 01:22:01,428
Don't worry, madam, we won't do you any harm.

779
01:22:03,138 --> 01:22:05,038
Who's that man over there?

780
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:08,104
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

781
01:22:08,777 --> 01:22:11,940
- Who is that man?
- Oh, he's a friend...

782
01:22:12,113 --> 01:22:13,273
Is he all right?

783
01:22:13,481 --> 01:22:15,847
Have you seen the army around here?

784
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:19,648
He's a neighbor. He has a fever.

785
01:22:20,455 --> 01:22:22,616
We have a doctor with us.

786
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:27,194
We'll bring him to see you when we come back.

787
01:22:27,462 --> 01:22:28,656
Do you understand me?

788
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:30,627
But what about the army?

789
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:35,632
We need to find a way across the river, a ford.

790
01:22:35,804 --> 01:22:39,069
You live here and you know
this area well. You can help us.

791
01:22:42,844 --> 01:22:44,709
Get us some food.

792
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,743
There, have some money.

793
01:22:46,915 --> 01:22:49,816
You are seven people, right?
And eight with the woman.

794
01:22:51,653 --> 01:22:53,518
How do you know that we're seven?

795
01:22:54,923 --> 01:22:58,984
I'm slowing everyone down.
I don't know if I'll be able to go on.

796
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,720
Of course you can, Tania.

797
01:23:02,497 --> 01:23:04,897
We'll be back in two days.

798
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:12,969
Remember, sir, find us an easy place
to cross the river.

799
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,498
Pombo, I've got to talk to Fernando.

800
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:17,832
Fernando is sleeping.
He's recovering from an asthma attack.

801
01:24:18,006 --> 01:24:20,998
Don't you think he's had
enough worries for today?

802
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:22,438
Let him rest.

803
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,078
Inti, what's the matter?

804
01:24:25,714 --> 01:24:27,409
Okay, go and tell him.

805
01:24:33,288 --> 01:24:36,621
I think you should speak to Camba and Chapaco.

806
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:40,818
Camba says his physical condition
prevents him from continuing.

807
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:43,997
I think he no longer sees
the point of the struggle.

808
01:24:46,434 --> 01:24:48,231
I talked to Inti already.

809
01:24:49,537 --> 01:24:54,201
Fernando, I am a bit sick.

810
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:56,105
- I don't believe--
- Camba.

811
01:24:57,212 --> 01:25:01,478
I can't let you go
until we meet Joaquín's group,

812
01:25:02,283 --> 01:25:04,513
because if they capture you,

813
01:25:04,686 --> 01:25:06,881
you not only risk your own life,

814
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:11,389
but you also put the whole group at risk.

815
01:25:13,061 --> 01:25:14,858
Look, Camba.

816
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:17,998
To survive here, to win,

817
01:25:18,767 --> 01:25:21,565
you have to live as if you've already died.

818
01:25:30,512 --> 01:25:33,504
I never said to Inti that I wanted to quit.

819
01:25:34,582 --> 01:25:36,777
Quitting is for cowards.

820
01:25:38,653 --> 01:25:43,488
What I told Inti is that in six months
to a year, I want to return home.

821
01:25:55,336 --> 01:25:56,860
Let's see.

822
01:25:58,606 --> 01:26:00,267
Tell me

823
01:26:02,444 --> 01:26:05,709
exactly where you said to cross.

824
01:26:06,948 --> 01:26:11,044
Just about here is where
I will make them cross, captain.

825
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,984
Now,

826
01:26:21,463 --> 01:26:25,866
put this white shirt on
so we don't shoot at you.

827
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:30,701
Now go home and don't move

828
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:35,605
until the guerrillas arrive,
or they'll suspect something.

829
01:28:26,454 --> 01:28:27,944
Fire!

830
01:28:34,963 --> 01:28:36,954
<i>Today, the Bolivian army</i>

831
01:28:37,131 --> 01:28:41,033
<i>reported a rebel clash
at Vado del Yeso.</i>

832
01:28:41,202 --> 01:28:44,433
<i>Ten rebels were reported killed.</i>

833
01:28:44,606 --> 01:28:48,542
<i>The group's one survivor,
José Carrillo, is a local miner</i>

834
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,703
<i>who was under the command
of a Cuban named Joaquín Acuña.</i>

835
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,075
That's bullshit from the army.

836
01:28:55,249 --> 01:28:57,308
They can't all be dead,

837
01:28:57,852 --> 01:29:00,582
unless they were walking in their sleep.

838
01:29:00,922 --> 01:29:02,822
José Carrillo is Paco.

839
01:29:02,991 --> 01:29:05,687
Maybe he was caught and is talking.

840
01:29:07,762 --> 01:29:08,786
Let's go.

841
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:11,931
It's already 5:00.

842
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,621
- What happened to her face?
- The piranhas ate it.

843
01:29:37,825 --> 01:29:41,090
I requested a coffin.
There's a cemetery in town.

844
01:29:41,262 --> 01:29:43,492
Mr. President,
with your permission, sir.

845
01:29:43,665 --> 01:29:46,793
What do you plan to do with Che
if he is captured alive?

846
01:29:48,836 --> 01:29:50,804
Personally, I think

847
01:29:50,972 --> 01:29:53,566
the biggest mistake Batista made

848
01:29:53,741 --> 01:29:56,642
was not killing Fidel when he had the chance.

849
01:30:59,474 --> 01:31:00,907
Thanks.

850
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:09,047
Fernando, they say the truck comes
every day, and the deputy--

851
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:11,242
- What's his name?
- Vidal Aguilar.

852
01:31:11,419 --> 01:31:14,752
--left yesterday for Vallegrande
to warn the army about us.

853
01:31:14,922 --> 01:31:18,585
It's a two-day-old telegram
sent by the army to the deputy.

854
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,093
It says, "Any expenses incurred will be

855
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:25,562
reimbursed by the army."

856
01:31:25,767 --> 01:31:28,668
Inti is already talking to the wife.
They own a store.

857
01:31:28,836 --> 01:31:31,168
Tell Inti that in reprisal for that,

858
01:31:31,339 --> 01:31:33,671
we will take all that we need from the store.

859
01:31:34,142 --> 01:31:38,545
Take 10 cans of sardines and those tomatoes.

860
01:31:40,715 --> 01:31:43,309
This is for my children!

861
01:31:43,484 --> 01:31:45,918
Madam, madam.

862
01:31:46,087 --> 01:31:51,684
<i>Dear comrades, we've been here
fighting the army for six months now.</i>

863
01:31:51,893 --> 01:31:53,417
<i>You may wonder why.</i>

864
01:31:53,961 --> 01:31:57,954
<i>We want to end injustice
in this country.</i>

865
01:31:58,699 --> 01:32:01,827
<i>To end neglect and misery</i>

866
01:32:02,003 --> 01:32:04,836
<i>to which the government subjects
its own people.</i>

867
01:32:06,007 --> 01:32:09,499
<i>For example,
where is the nearest hospital?</i>

868
01:32:09,877 --> 01:32:13,745
<i>About 100 kilometers away, right?
What if you get sick?</i>

869
01:32:13,948 --> 01:32:17,076
<i>First you have to pay
to take a truck to Vallegrande,</i>

870
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,775
<i>and then you pay for the stay.</i>

871
01:32:18,986 --> 01:32:22,012
<i>So you go to a hospital,
which they say is public,</i>

872
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,886
<i>but to see a doctor,
you must pay first.</i>

873
01:32:25,593 --> 01:32:27,584
<i>Isn't this the way it is?</i>

874
01:32:27,995 --> 01:32:32,796
<i>And the medicine? They won't even
give you aspirin for free.</i>

875
01:32:32,967 --> 01:32:34,457
<i>In other words,</i>

876
01:32:34,902 --> 01:32:40,204
<i>if your kid gets sick or dies because
you have no money for the hospital,</i>

877
01:32:40,374 --> 01:32:42,205
<i>who is going to care?</i>

878
01:32:43,077 --> 01:32:45,841
That is the reason why your luck
changing for the better

879
01:32:46,013 --> 01:32:50,109
depends on the triumph of our struggle...

880
01:32:51,052 --> 01:32:52,178
Yes?

881
01:32:52,353 --> 01:32:55,083
Is there going to be fighting
here in the village?

882
01:32:57,592 --> 01:33:02,086
We have no intention of
fighting in the villages.

883
01:33:47,608 --> 01:33:49,303
Nothing.

884
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:51,769
Two pigs and a mule.

885
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:54,738
- Weird, isn't it?
- You're telling me.

886
01:33:54,982 --> 01:33:58,440
- Where is Miguel?
- He should already be here.

887
01:34:01,422 --> 01:34:02,753
Hey.

888
01:34:03,224 --> 01:34:06,125
Madam, madam!

889
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:08,325
Madam!

890
01:34:14,835 --> 01:34:16,427
I don't see anything.

891
01:34:17,271 --> 01:34:19,239
Absolute silence.

892
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:23,442
Smells like soldiers to me.

893
01:34:24,111 --> 01:34:26,545
It's completely deserted.

894
01:34:26,714 --> 01:34:32,050
I talked to an old woman who said
that her grandson saw soldiers yesterday.

895
01:34:34,255 --> 01:34:35,620
Miguel.

896
01:34:36,924 --> 01:34:41,054
Get the vanguard ready to go
to Jagüey at 1300 hours.

897
01:34:41,228 --> 01:34:43,628
You heard it.
The vanguard, get ready.

898
01:34:43,798 --> 01:34:47,234
Miguel, stay on guard.

899
01:34:47,401 --> 01:34:50,234
Take all security measures.

900
01:34:50,838 --> 01:34:52,237
Understood.

901
01:34:59,213 --> 01:35:01,272
- Tell me.
- Fernando.

902
01:35:01,449 --> 01:35:03,542
I think it's better that I stay here.

903
01:35:03,718 --> 01:35:06,949
I can't stand up or pee.

904
01:35:08,356 --> 01:35:10,722
We aren't going to leave you here.

905
01:35:12,126 --> 01:35:16,654
When we get to Jagüey, we'll make a decision.

906
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:33,446
Good afternoon.

907
01:35:33,614 --> 01:35:35,548
I met him on the way to Jagüey.

908
01:35:35,716 --> 01:35:37,911
He says he comes from Vallegrande.

909
01:35:40,154 --> 01:35:42,088
Where are you going with these goods?

910
01:35:42,256 --> 01:35:46,556
To Picacho, sir.
I have jerky and cheese to sell to

911
01:35:46,727 --> 01:35:48,251
Pombo, Pombo.

912
01:35:48,562 --> 01:35:49,790
support my family, sir.

913
01:35:49,964 --> 01:35:54,333
- Have you seen the army around?
- No, sir. I haven't seen the army.

914
01:35:54,502 --> 01:35:56,800
Fernando, he looks too nervous to me.

915
01:35:56,971 --> 01:35:59,371
Maintain vigilance.

916
01:35:59,974 --> 01:36:03,034
Fall into line. Everyone, stay alert.

917
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,374
Are you sure you haven't seen the army?

918
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,780
No, sir. I haven't seen the army.

919
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:13,616
Good.

920
01:36:14,422 --> 01:36:17,050
Pombo, walk with him
to the outskirts of the village.

921
01:36:17,224 --> 01:36:18,623
Thank you, sir.

922
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:31,702
You have a pebble factory in your shoe.

923
01:36:31,872 --> 01:36:33,601
It's the second time
you've stopped for the same shit.

924
01:36:40,147 --> 01:36:44,311
Pacho, that way.
Darío, go over there.

925
01:36:45,586 --> 01:36:47,679
Willy, go with them.

926
01:36:50,191 --> 01:36:51,715
- Antonio.
- Chapaco, let's go.

927
01:36:51,892 --> 01:36:55,419
Urbano, go over by the fence.

928
01:36:57,765 --> 01:36:59,926
Arturo, over there.

929
01:37:00,267 --> 01:37:01,700
Keep going, Darío.

930
01:37:03,204 --> 01:37:06,332
Retreat!
Everybody run down the hill!

931
01:37:09,577 --> 01:37:12,740
I'm covering you!
Downhill, everyone!

932
01:37:12,913 --> 01:37:16,644
- Chino, what's wrong?
- I lost my glasses!

933
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:18,916
They'll kill you. Here they are!

934
01:37:19,086 --> 01:37:21,646
They killed Coco, Julio and Miguel.

935
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:25,923
Camba, this way. Camba!

936
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,052
Camba! What are you doing?

937
01:37:31,699 --> 01:37:33,189
Come on!

938
01:37:52,153 --> 01:37:53,677
What happened?

939
01:37:56,924 --> 01:37:59,586
They killed Miguel, Julio and your brother.

940
01:38:03,831 --> 01:38:05,799
I tried to get them out,

941
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:08,201
but I couldn't.

942
01:38:15,242 --> 01:38:16,709
I'm sorry.

943
01:38:33,694 --> 01:38:35,821
This is Che's vanguard.

944
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,957
You think he's close?

945
01:38:38,465 --> 01:38:41,730
I think you should bring in
the 2nd Ranger division.

946
01:38:42,069 --> 01:38:44,435
They haven't finished training.

947
01:38:45,372 --> 01:38:47,932
You're going to need every man you can get.

948
01:39:18,606 --> 01:39:20,301
Benigno.

949
01:39:21,242 --> 01:39:22,800
Benigno.

950
01:39:23,744 --> 01:39:27,578
Benigno, Fernando is asking you to stop.

951
01:39:31,185 --> 01:39:32,618
Hold on.

952
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:53,934
Benigno, let me see your wound.

953
01:39:54,108 --> 01:39:57,669
It's okay. It's nothing.

954
01:40:00,948 --> 01:40:02,347
Take it.

955
01:40:05,286 --> 01:40:07,311
Tell me, Fernando.

956
01:40:08,956 --> 01:40:11,550
Go with Benigno to explore.

957
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:17,062
Let's see if we can find a place
to spend the day without being seen.

958
01:40:21,268 --> 01:40:23,736
Captain, a message from Lieutenant Huerta.

959
01:40:23,904 --> 01:40:27,567
A peasant saw some rebels
heading toward Yuro Ravine.

960
01:40:27,741 --> 01:40:29,709
Tell him we're on our way.

961
01:40:39,753 --> 01:40:40,777
Look.

962
01:40:45,926 --> 01:40:49,089
Must be a peasant
on his way to Pucará. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

963
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,724
- How many are there?
- More than a battalion.

964
01:41:55,896 --> 01:41:59,457
- Are they together?
- Two or three meters from each other.

965
01:41:59,633 --> 01:42:02,966
Willy, go look for Ñato and Urbano, immediately.

966
01:42:03,137 --> 01:42:06,163
Arturo, bring Darío and Aniceto.

967
01:42:07,107 --> 01:42:11,339
Fernando, the left ravine ends in a house

968
01:42:11,512 --> 01:42:13,673
that's taken by the army.

969
01:42:14,014 --> 01:42:17,745
- You can't get out of the middle one.
- This is the steepest ravine.

970
01:42:18,018 --> 01:42:20,543
It's 500 meters to the hill.

971
01:42:20,721 --> 01:42:25,351
And there's also a tree I think
would be good as a lookout.

972
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:27,221
- Then go there immediately.
- Okay.

973
01:42:27,394 --> 01:42:32,058
Benigno, be vigilant, find a place
where we can leave during the night.

974
01:42:32,232 --> 01:42:33,392
Okay.

975
01:42:33,567 --> 01:42:35,034
Take care.

976
01:42:37,104 --> 01:42:39,868
We'll wait there until 9 at night.

977
01:42:40,174 --> 01:42:41,903
Those who don't arrive by then

978
01:42:42,075 --> 01:42:46,409
should make their way down
the ravine to Rio Grande,

979
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:50,108
and from there to the mouth of Santa Elena.

980
01:42:50,284 --> 01:42:52,752
We'll wait there for two days.

981
01:42:53,854 --> 01:42:56,152
Pacho and Willy.

982
01:42:56,323 --> 01:42:59,156
You will take this position here.

983
01:42:59,326 --> 01:43:03,524
Antonio and Arturo,

984
01:43:04,598 --> 01:43:06,589
into this ravine.

985
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,395
No one shoots until they shoot.

986
01:43:10,571 --> 01:43:12,038
If you hear gunfire,

987
01:43:12,372 --> 01:43:15,068
first, find out for sure
that they know about you

988
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:17,506
and that they're not just sweeping the area.

989
01:43:17,678 --> 01:43:20,579
Do you understand? Go now.

990
01:43:25,552 --> 01:43:28,680
Go with Darío and reinforce Benigno's position.

991
01:43:28,856 --> 01:43:32,690
Don't let him fall asleep from exhaustion.

992
01:43:38,098 --> 01:43:39,497
Fernando.

993
01:43:41,702 --> 01:43:44,603
We've been in worse situations than this.

994
01:43:48,542 --> 01:43:52,638
There are three ravines:
La Tusca, San Antonio and Yuro.

995
01:43:52,813 --> 01:43:55,976
The guerrillas could be in any one of them.

996
01:43:56,149 --> 01:43:57,878
Search all three.

997
01:43:58,051 --> 01:44:00,315
Start in the upper canyons
and make your way down.

998
01:44:00,487 --> 01:44:02,352
What if they try to escape?

999
01:44:02,523 --> 01:44:05,390
I'll set up a command post
where the three ravines meet.

1000
01:46:11,652 --> 01:46:12,949
Ñato.

1001
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:16,513
Get Aniceto.

1002
01:46:24,965 --> 01:46:28,366
Go with Ñato and take over for Pombo and Urbano.

1003
01:46:28,535 --> 01:46:31,231
Make them both come back.

1004
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:33,904
Wait a moment.

1005
01:47:59,126 --> 01:48:00,684
What's that?

1006
01:48:03,797 --> 01:48:05,662
Hey, Urbano.

1007
01:48:06,133 --> 01:48:08,465
Ñato is making signs I don't understand.

1008
01:48:08,635 --> 01:48:12,298
Either he's saying Fernando wants us
to retreat or move toward him.

1009
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:36,293
- Antonio, do we move?
- No, we stay here.

1010
01:48:45,605 --> 01:48:49,302
Pablito, prepare the wounded to leave.

1011
01:48:50,477 --> 01:48:51,910
Go now.

1012
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,909
Fuck! We have to leave now, Urbano.

1013
01:50:02,082 --> 01:50:04,880
Pombo, go now! I can cover you!

1014
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:07,144
Wait, wait, wait!

1015
01:50:08,188 --> 01:50:11,123
Wait! Now move!

1016
01:50:25,272 --> 01:50:29,038
There they are.
Pombo and Urbano are there.

1017
01:53:02,862 --> 01:53:04,659
How do you feel?

1018
01:53:06,066 --> 01:53:07,431
Fine.

1019
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:10,560
The lieutenant bandaged it for me.

1020
01:53:14,207 --> 01:53:16,402
Where have you taken Willy and Chino?

1021
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:18,839
They're next door.

1022
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:22,980
How many guerrillas are left out there?

1023
01:53:23,883 --> 01:53:25,407
I don't know.

1024
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:29,350
What was your rendezvous point?

1025
01:53:30,423 --> 01:53:32,186
We didn't have one.

1026
01:53:33,093 --> 01:53:34,788
What's your rendezvous point?

1027
01:53:34,961 --> 01:53:38,419
- I told you we didn't have one.
- You didn't have one?

1028
01:53:39,466 --> 01:53:42,094
Why did you come here
to La Higuera during the day?

1029
01:53:42,268 --> 01:53:44,793
Does it matter?
Nothing matters anymore.

1030
01:53:44,971 --> 01:53:46,768
Listen to me.

1031
01:53:47,474 --> 01:53:49,601
You are no longer in Cuba, sir.

1032
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:54,068
And you should know that
I am a colonel in the Bolivian army.

1033
01:53:54,447 --> 01:53:58,611
You escaped the Congo, Venezuela,
but I assure you, not Bolivia.

1034
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:03,784
This is where your adventures end,
you foreign piece of shit.

1035
01:54:04,257 --> 01:54:06,589
All right. Get some rest.

1036
01:54:06,759 --> 01:54:10,855
Tomorrow we'll go to Vallegrande
to have your wound examined.

1037
01:54:16,636 --> 01:54:18,433
Put on your best face.

1038
01:54:19,339 --> 01:54:21,933
A lot of people will want a photograph of you.

1039
01:54:24,144 --> 01:54:26,339
Maybe we should shave you.

1040
01:54:35,522 --> 01:54:37,456
Piece of shit!

1041
01:54:42,629 --> 01:54:46,065
Bring me the dead, and leave them here, quickly!

1042
01:55:51,397 --> 01:55:52,694
That's not right.

1043
01:55:53,733 --> 01:55:56,099
They shouldn't do that with the dead.

1044
01:56:02,976 --> 01:56:04,603
Do you want to smoke?

1045
01:56:05,745 --> 01:56:07,212
Yes.

1046
01:56:13,186 --> 01:56:14,653
Thanks.

1047
01:56:18,524 --> 01:56:20,219
How is Cuba?

1048
01:56:22,362 --> 01:56:24,523
Cuba is progressing.

1049
01:56:25,798 --> 01:56:27,766
Do they have religion there?

1050
01:56:29,435 --> 01:56:32,768
Yes, there are religions.

1051
01:56:33,339 --> 01:56:36,365
I thought Communists didn't believe in God.

1052
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:38,777
Well,

1053
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:42,179
in Cuba there's no official religion,

1054
01:56:42,348 --> 01:56:44,077
but many people believe in God.

1055
01:56:46,286 --> 01:56:47,514
You don't believe in anything?

1056
01:56:48,154 --> 01:56:51,180
Yes, I believe in mankind.

1057
01:56:57,730 --> 01:57:00,528
- Are you married?
- No, no.

1058
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:03,328
- How about you?
- Yes.

1059
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:05,401
Do you have children?

1060
01:57:05,571 --> 01:57:07,869
- I have five.
- Five!

1061
01:57:09,042 --> 01:57:10,976
Three girls and two boys.

1062
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:16,408
You want some more?

1063
01:57:17,183 --> 01:57:18,514
Yes.

1064
01:57:27,226 --> 01:57:28,716
What's your name?

1065
01:57:28,895 --> 01:57:30,362
Eduardo.

1066
01:57:31,164 --> 01:57:32,461
Eduardo.

1067
01:57:37,303 --> 01:57:39,271
Would you untie me, Eduardo?

1068
01:58:10,636 --> 01:58:11,967
Hey.

1069
01:58:12,372 --> 01:58:15,637
- Che asked me to free him.
- What?

1070
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:17,536
He asked me to untie him.

1071
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:20,474
No, you're crazy. They'd kill both of us.

1072
01:58:22,849 --> 01:58:24,840
I don't want to go back in.

1073
01:58:25,017 --> 01:58:26,746
You take the next shift.

1074
01:59:09,228 --> 01:59:11,423
What are you thinking about, comandante?

1075
01:59:12,698 --> 01:59:14,427
Where are you from?

1076
01:59:14,934 --> 01:59:16,526
From Cuba.

1077
01:59:18,104 --> 01:59:20,299
I don't talk to traitors.

1078
01:59:21,874 --> 01:59:24,138
Okay, so you don't want to talk to traitors.

1079
01:59:24,544 --> 01:59:26,944
But listen to what I have to say.

1080
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:29,946
You executed my uncle.

1081
01:59:32,919 --> 01:59:35,319
Must be hard, comandante?

1082
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:37,752
You, here, in the jungle,

1083
01:59:37,924 --> 01:59:41,382
and Fidel in Havana having lunch at El Nacional.

1084
01:59:43,196 --> 01:59:45,096
Can you imagine?

1085
02:00:13,125 --> 02:00:17,084
What made you think the Bolivians
would be receptive to your ideas?

1086
02:00:17,663 --> 02:00:20,461
We already had our revolution.

1087
02:00:20,867 --> 02:00:23,301
Didn't you hear about the land reform in 1952?

1088
02:00:23,469 --> 02:00:28,873
Yes, and Barrientos sold out.
Now you have a military dictatorship.

1089
02:00:29,242 --> 02:00:31,938
Have you seen how your peasants live?

1090
02:00:32,745 --> 02:00:35,839
If the peasants are so bad off,

1091
02:00:36,015 --> 02:00:37,880
why did they turn you in?

1092
02:00:38,818 --> 02:00:41,082
Maybe they believed your lies.

1093
02:00:44,857 --> 02:00:47,724
Or maybe, they never wanted you here.

1094
02:00:47,894 --> 02:00:50,260
Yes, maybe.

1095
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:54,231
Or maybe our failure will wake them up.

1096
02:01:23,129 --> 02:01:24,153
Captain.

1097
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:26,264
- Tell me.
- A call for Colonel Zenteno.

1098
02:01:26,432 --> 02:01:30,596
I told them he had left, but they
asked for the senior officer.

1099
02:01:33,906 --> 02:01:35,498
Bravo 1.

1100
02:01:37,376 --> 02:01:39,139
This is Captain Ramírez.

1101
02:01:41,747 --> 02:01:43,647
Repeat, please.

1102
02:01:45,451 --> 02:01:48,750
Order 600. I will tell the colonel.

1103
02:02:04,704 --> 02:02:06,194
Put him there.

1104
02:02:08,341 --> 02:02:11,674
Take a picture.
You just have to press here.

1105
02:02:15,014 --> 02:02:17,141
So that you can smoke, comandante.

1106
02:02:20,052 --> 02:02:21,917
Say cheese.

1107
02:02:28,861 --> 02:02:30,328
Stop there.

1108
02:02:37,503 --> 02:02:41,599
I have a message for you from the
high command. They ordered a 600.

1109
02:02:43,142 --> 02:02:45,042
Fine. I have to leave for Vallegrande.

1110
02:02:45,211 --> 02:02:50,171
I'll send a helicopter back at 1400 hours.
Have the body ready.

1111
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,517
Yes, sir.

1112
02:02:52,752 --> 02:02:54,219
Let's go.

1113
02:02:55,154 --> 02:02:59,250
You can shoot from here down.
Nothing more.

1114
02:02:59,525 --> 02:03:01,652
Listen to me closely.

1115
02:03:02,028 --> 02:03:04,326
I need two volunteers.

1116
02:03:09,902 --> 02:03:11,460
Someone else?

1117
02:03:17,343 --> 02:03:19,607
Sergeant. Let me do it.
