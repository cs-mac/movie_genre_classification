1
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,959
"September 11, 1777.

2
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,799
"My loving wife,

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,391
"these past few months away from you
and Nathaniel have been difficult,

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,670
"and I miss both of you terribly.

5
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,866
"We have all made sacrifices,
starting with our commander.

6
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,759
"We face the most
powerful army in the world.

7
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,225
"In our last battle we felt
the bite of their artillery."

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,546
Fire!

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,839
"But we held firm and
pushed them back.

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,199
"Our commander did not let us fail.

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,159
"We trust him. He keeps
our spirits high."

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,431
Battalion, attention!

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,799
"General Washington reminds us

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,839
"that life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,399
"are our unalienable rights and we
will not give them up to the crown.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,559
"When the war is won,
America will be the first nation

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,079
"to freely choose its own way.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,999
"Today will be another test of our
will as we face General Howe,

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,359
"whose troops outnumber
us by the thousands.

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,879
"The American cause now rests on
providence and General Washington."

21
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,679
Hold the line, boys!

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,679
Hold the line!

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,462
Ready, fire!

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,308
Fire!

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,101
Fire!

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,469
Charge!

27
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,661
General Washington!

28
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,159
Fall back! Retreat!

29
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,479
Fall back! Retreat!

30
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,479
- Advance!
- Retreat!

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,262
Fall back, company!

32
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,071
Imagine the unimaginable.

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,062
What if George Washington had
been killed by a sniper's bullet?

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,068
What if the Civil War had torn this
country into two or 10 countries?

35
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,862
What if Hitler got the
atomic bomb first?

36
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,947
What would the world look like
if America did not exist?

37
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,703
From farmers in the fields

38
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,542
to the tallest of the
towers that fall and rise

39
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,799
1-7-7-6, the names upon the list

40
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,630
of all the ones who
gave until they died

41
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,879
Don't you hold back

42
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,839
I can see in your mind

43
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,943
and your mind will set you free

44
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,919
Rise to the top of the world

45
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,199
America

46
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,110
America, don't you cry

47
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,239
Lift me up

48
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,199
Give me strength to press on

49
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,119
Rise to the top of the world

50
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,279
America

51
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,302
America, don't you cry

52
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,039
Lift me up

53
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,159
Give me strength to press on

54
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,479
Rise to the top of the world

55
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,670
I love America.

56
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,719
I chose this country.

57
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,879
America, don't you cry

58
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,879
And like millions of immigrants,
I've been blessed by my life in America.

59
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,559
Give me strength to press on

60
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,239
This country does
something truly unique.

61
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,944
It allows you to write the
script of your own life.

62
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,679
A chapter of my script
was making the film 2016.

63
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,879
It surprised Hollywood and the
media by becoming a runaway hit.

64
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,266
It became the number two political
documentary film of all time.

65
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,919
In the film I made three predictions.

66
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,119
The federal government
would grow bigger

67
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,839
as America's role in the
world grows smaller.

68
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,199
Under President Obama,
the national debt would double.

69
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,319
This administration would
undermine our allies

70
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,909
and strengthen our enemies.

71
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,101
Seeing these predictions come true,
I'm scared for the future of America.

72
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,022
But I believe we can be strong again
unless we choose another path.

73
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,039
A century and a half ago,
a young Abraham Lincoln

74
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,902
issued a prophetic warning.

75
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,719
Shall we expect some
transatlantic military giant

76
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,879
to step the ocean and
crush us with a blow?

77
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,999
Never. All the armies of Europe,
Asia and Africa combined

78
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,279
with a Bonaparte for a commander

79
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,559
could not by force take
a drink from the Ohio.

80
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,982
At what point then, is the
approach of danger to be expected?

81
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,799
I answer that if it ever reach us,
it must spring up from amongst us.

82
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,468
It cannot come from abroad.

83
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,399
If destruction be our lot,

84
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,119
then we ourselves must be
the author and finisher of it.

85
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,199
As a nation of freemen,

86
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,589
we must live throughout
all time or die by suicide.

87
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,239
How do you convince a great nation
to author its own destruction?

88
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,119
You start by telling a new story.

89
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,839
'Cause if you got a business,
you didn't build that.

90
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,959
Somebody else made that happen.

91
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,119
What President Obama is really saying

92
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
is that the wealth and
abundance of American life

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,350
are not earned, they're stolen.

94
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,959
But it's not just President Obama.

95
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,159
Thievery was a critical element

96
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,439
to the expansion of American empire.

97
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,159
This is a nation founded on genocide

98
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,865
and built on the backs of slaves.

99
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,062
Moving borders. They call
it American imperialism.

100
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,119
Obama didn't create this movement.

101
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,599
It created him.

102
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,199
Not God bless America.
God damn America.

103
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,639
European expansion, conquest,
colonization, genocide.

104
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,759
American foreign policy
has been aggressive

105
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,319
and imperialist for a very long time.

106
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,519
It was expansionist immediately starting
right after the Revolutionary War.

107
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,519
Incredible as it may seem,

108
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,862
there are people in America who
want a world without America.

109
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,270
Their indictments against America
start at the very beginning.

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,239
What are the words that come to mind

111
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,989
when you hear the phrase,
Christopher Columbus?

112
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,670
I know your name.

113
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,260
What's your unit?

114
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,942
Lieutenant Colonel John Fer
of the United States Air Force.

115
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,559
And ends 400 years later in
America with the Trail of Tears

116
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,799
where 18,000 Native Americans
were forced to march 2,000 miles,

117
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,479
leaving a third of them dead.

118
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,423
What words come to mind when
you think of the word "America"?

119
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,319
A sadness. For me,
it's just a great sadness.

120
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,910
I think of all the hundreds of
nations that were destroyed.

121
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,919
In 1845, Mexican territory
covered most of Texas,

122
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,559
New Mexico, Arizona and California.

123
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,559
I like Chicano nationalism.

124
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,799
I really do prefer Hispanic
culture to Anglo-Saxon culture.

125
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,639
And you say, "Well, why don't
you move back to Mexico?"

126
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,119
I don't have to. I'm in Mexico.

127
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,199
And like I tell my Chicano students,

128
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,599
maybe after there isn't a United States,
we'll still be here, like the Indians.

129
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,479
So to put it biblically, you are
in America but not of America.

130
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,599
I'm not of America, no.

131
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,479
Charles Truxillo is a
professor of Chicano studies

132
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,439
at the University of New Mexico.

133
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,182
He's a leading representative of a movement
trying to reclaim Mexico's lost lands.

134
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,919
Did the United States steal half
of Mexico in the Mexican War?

135
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,479
Yes, and the wealth of those areas.
California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas,

136
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,199
the oil, the minerals,

137
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,359
would have made Mexico
a premier economic power,

138
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,391
like it's becoming now.

139
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,839
When I went one time with my father
to Mexico to visit relatives,

140
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,879
we were in an old classroom

141
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,679
and they had a map of North
America up in the classroom.

142
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,759
And it had the area that's
the American Southwest

143
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,239
from Texas to California
cross-thatched

144
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,519
with the colors of Mexico
and the United States,

145
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,226
and they had named that area
provincias perdidas, lost provinces.

146
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,559
They have killed us, beat us,

147
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,559
drugged us, knocked us and
raped us and robbed us.

148
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,103
Done everything but the right thing.

149
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,319
We don't see any American dream.

150
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,944
We've experienced only
the American nightmare.

151
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,239
We took Africans from their
country to build our way of ease

152
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,501
and kept them enslaved
and living in fear.

153
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,679
Well, obviously as a
black person in America,

154
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,039
it's, um, a part of the
wretched history of this nation

155
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,799
that my foremothers and forefathers
were not seen as fully human.

156
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,559
I spoke to the African American
scholar Michael Eric Dyson

157
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,719
at Georgetown University.

158
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,719
Has Obama's election
and re-election...

159
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,599
Doesn't that say something
about the end of racism?

160
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,079
I would not deny at all that American
has made enormous progress.

161
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,759
Are we there yet? No.

162
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,759
America doesn't want to confront
the vicious inequalities

163
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,599
that it set loose in this nation.

164
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,439
Absorbing things that are not yours.
Taking stuff that is not yours.

165
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,079
We can say thievery was a critical element
to the expansion of American empire

166
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,750
and the establishment of
the American way of life.

167
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,639
150 years ago at the
height of slavery,

168
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,879
another man made an even more
passionate indictment of America.

169
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,663
The American slave,
what is your 4th of July?

170
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,144
I answer a day that reveals to him
more than all other days in a year,

171
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,030
a gross injustice.

172
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,199
Your celebration is a sham.

173
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,479
You profess to believe that of
one blood God made all nations

174
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,919
and hath commanded all men
everywhere to love one another.

175
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,959
Yet, you notoriously hate

176
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,839
and glory in your hatred all men whose
skin are not colored like your own.

177
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,479
Meet Frederick Douglass.

178
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,159
Born a slave, he escaped to freedom

179
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,784
and became a champion of
the antislavery movement.

180
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,439
You can bare your bosom to
the storm of British artillery

181
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,559
to throw off a three-penny tax on tea

182
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,799
and yet wring the last
hard-earned farthing

183
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,390
from the grasp of the black
laborers of your country.

184
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,199
There is not a nation on the earth

185
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,679
guilty of practices more shocking

186
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,719
and bloody

187
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,062
than are the people of the United
States, than on this 4th of July.

188
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,319
We like to think of ourselves
as a peace-loving people.

189
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
If they said, "We're going in for the
oil," we'd say, "No, don't do it."

190
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,382
But instead they say,
"We're going in for democracy."

191
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,919
Has the United States been a force
for good or ill in the world?

192
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,719
For the people we conquer,

193
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,390
the Vietnamese, we killed
a couple million of them,

194
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,427
not a force for good.

195
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,119
MIT professor Noam Chomsky is a
leading critic of American imperialism.

196
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,439
There's a reason why most of the
world regards the United States

197
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,159
as a predatory colonial power.

198
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,079
We overthrew the democratic
government of Guatemala in 1954,

199
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,399
Iran in 1953, Cuba in 1961.

200
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,310
Then Brazil, Chile,
Uruguay, Argentina,

201
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,667
on through the world.
It's not a pretty record.

202
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,479
We are the 99%!

203
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,719
Whose street? Our street!
Occupy Wall Street!

204
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,759
We've never had anything
like this in this country

205
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,239
where we take on
economic issues like this.

206
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,719
If you want money, after you get
that million, you want a billion.

207
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,479
After you get a billion, you want a trillion.
After you get a trillion, you want a zillion.

208
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,262
There is no end. There is no line.

209
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,639
The charge against capitalism is
that greedy, selfish business owners

210
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,024
steal from people.

211
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,879
They create gross inequality by
depriving people of their fair share.

212
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,999
And it's only right that we ask
everyone to pay their fair share.

213
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,959
Asking everyone to
pay their fair share.

214
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,159
Pay their fair share.

215
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,559
There is nobody in this country
who got rich on his own.

216
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,759
Nobody.

217
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,399
You built a factory out there.
Good for you.

218
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,679
But I want to be clear,
you moved your goods

219
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,879
to market on the roads
the rest of us paid for.

220
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,599
You hired workers the rest
of us paid to educate.

221
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,279
You were safe in your factory

222
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,146
because of police forces and fire
forces that the rest of us paid for.

223
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,719
It doesn't matter whether
you're making profits

224
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
from a hot dog stand in Times Square

225
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,662
or if you're the biggest
company on NASDAQ,

226
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,586
capitalists are under fire.

227
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,959
Until we change the system,
and let's use the C word here.

228
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,039
We're talking about capitalism.

229
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,279
If it's a more comfortable
word for you, greed.

230
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,559
That's just another word for it.

231
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,799
This ultimately has to change.

232
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,959
How much more are you
going to make them suffer?

233
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,551
Because some day they're
not gonna take it anymore.

234
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,239
These are the indictments
against America.

235
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,039
We stole the country from
the Native Americans.

236
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,799
We took half of Mexico
in the Mexican War.

237
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,359
We stole the labor of
the African Americans.

238
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,464
And today our foreign policy and our
free market system are forms of theft.

239
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,599
These indictments developed separately
and each has been around for a long time.

240
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,119
But now they've come together in a
single narrative of American shame.

241
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,879
One professor pulled
this narrative together.

242
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,519
His name is Howard Zinn.

243
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,599
I prefer to try to tell the story
of the discovery of America

244
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,679
from the viewpoint of the Arawaks.

245
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,959
Of the Constitution from the
standpoint of the slaves.

246
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,221
Of Andrew Jackson as
seen by the Cherokees.

247
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,439
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
grew up in the same

248
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
South Boston neighborhood as Zinn.

249
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,919
They gave him a nice plug in
their movie Good Will Hunting.

250
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,679
You want to read a real history book,

251
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,759
read Howard Zion's People's
History of the United States.

252
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,639
That book will knock you on your ass.

253
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,519
Zion's book has made
him quite the celebrity.

254
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,079
What I didn't realize is that
from the very beginning,

255
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,159
from when Columbus met the Arawaks,

256
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,184
there was... It was just nonstop, um,

257
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,519
violence and, uh, and,
uh, just taking over.

258
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,479
They're bullying people and
taking over their resources.

259
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,479
Howard Zinn is the most influential
historian of the past 50 years.

260
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,839
His book has sold over
two million copies,

261
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,799
becoming required reading in most
colleges and many high schools.

262
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,319
Even Tony Soprano's
kid had to read it.

263
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,839
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,

264
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,119
is teaching your son that if
Columbus was alive today,

265
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,679
he would go on trial for
crimes against humanity,

266
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,621
like Milošević in, you know, Europe.

267
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
Your teacher said that?

268
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,199
It's not just my teacher.
It's the truth.

269
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,345
It's in my history book.

270
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,787
This is the new story
of American shame.

271
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,199
Are our lives,
innocent on the surface,

272
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,986
part of a ruthless engine of
looting, exploitation and murder?

273
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,559
It's a powerful critique.

274
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,709
We can't just dismiss it with chants
of liberty, freedom, rah, rah, rah.

275
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,759
The critics are raising the
primary question of justice.

276
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,510
...with liberty and justice for all.

277
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,639
Read the Declaration of independence.

278
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,786
It's a cry against injustice.

279
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,790
For the American founders, liberty
was the solution to that injustice.

280
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,839
This is not just an attack on the 1%.

281
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,119
It's an attack on all of us.

282
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,239
We are a nation of
immigrants and settlers.

283
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,547
And we are the ones
accused of these crimes.

284
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,429
If these things are true,
something has to be done about them.

285
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,679
- There he is.
- How's it going?

286
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,239
- Good. Come on in.
- Good to see you.

287
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,839
- Been a while, hasn't it?
- It has been.

288
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,719
Reagan had called the Soviet Union,
you remember, an evil empire.

289
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,679
- Yeah.
- And the Soviet Union has dissolved.

290
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,599
So, who's the new evil empire?

291
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,839
Well, you're sitting in it.

292
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,239
One of the most vocal
critics of America

293
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,599
is Professor Ward Churchill.

294
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,879
He gained notoriety right after 9/11

295
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,799
by suggesting some of the people
in the World Trade Center

296
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,079
were like Nazi war criminals
and deserved what they got.

297
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,279
If the US had the
atomic bomb earlier,

298
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,279
chances are pretty good it would
have dropped it on Nazi Germany,

299
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,279
and certainly, for a Jew,
that would be a good idea

300
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,399
because to destroy an evil
regime is a good thing.

301
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,839
Yeah.

302
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,987
So if you could drop a bomb on the
United States, would you do it?

303
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,387
Well, if it would be justifiable

304
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,679
in the context you just described,

305
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,679
then by the same logic,
it would be justifiable here.

306
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,879
It's not one set of rules
for everybody else

307
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,060
and another set of rules
for the United States.

308
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,226
That is American suicide.

309
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,759
But there is an alternative remedy
for this theft and injustice.

310
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,519
Starting today, we must pick
ourselves up, dust ourselves off,

311
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,064
and begin again the work
of remaking America.

312
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,679
To remake America

313
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,463
you have to unmake the
America that's here now.

314
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,079
You are about to witness
the very exciting story

315
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
of a city and its people.

316
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,279
It is the story of a city
seeking new horizons.

317
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,462
Yes, Detroit is enjoying
its finest hour.

318
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,359
Obama's remaking involves
economic redistribution

319
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,159
never before imagined.

320
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,184
It's aimed at returning
centuries of stolen goods.

321
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,279
Detroit was once the
richest city in the world,

322
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,759
the pinnacle of America.

323
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,910
If America goes the way of Detroit,
that would be another kind of suicide.

324
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,359
But is suicide the price
we must pay for justice?

325
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,384
If our wealth is stolen,
then we must give it back.

326
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,119
So, is America guilty as charged?

327
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,984
It depends on whether the story
of American shame is true or not.

328
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,559
I came from India to
America 30 years ago.

329
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,911
I know a world without her.

330
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,559
When I hear young
people on the campus

331
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,582
repeat the Zinn narrative
of American shame,

332
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,180
I know they haven't been
told the whole story.

333
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,519
Is Howard Zinn a real historian?

334
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,759
No, Howard Zinn is not
a real historian.

335
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,399
He constantly has
misstatements of fact.

336
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,319
More than misstatements,
actual proven untruths,

337
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,944
and he doesn't care
that it's inaccurate.

338
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,079
Professor Ron Radosh is a leading
scholar of American radicalism

339
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,279
and a contemporary of Howard Zinn.

340
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,719
Now, you used to be a member
of the US Communist Party.

341
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
Right, I left it because I
realized that the ideology

342
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,799
and the practice had no
relation to American reality.

343
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,159
Howard Zinn left because it
was not revolutionary enough.

344
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,039
What he does is try
to create a glossary

345
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,879
of radical heroes who the new movement
he wants to build should emulate.

346
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,799
That's why he's writing this book.

347
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,479
He was writing to try and inspire a
social movement among young people

348
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,879
who would act as revolutionaries.

349
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,821
That's his purpose, not history.

350
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,519
I got into history with a very,
sort of, modest objective.

351
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,541
Uh, I wanted to change the world.

352
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,359
If you read his book,

353
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,799
America is the single most
oppressive nation in the world.

354
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,039
America is intrinsically evil.

355
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,199
He wants us to understand
how bad America is.

356
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,759
And then, we will join him in creating
a new social revolutionary movement.

357
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,351
If Howard Zinn gives us
a twisted picture of America,

358
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,319
is there a more reliable source?

359
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,999
Meet Alexis de Tocqueville,

360
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,639
a French aristocrat who traveled
through America in 1831

361
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,981
and wrote the classic book
Democracy in America.

362
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,439
Tocqueville witnessed
America first-hand.

363
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,110
He saw the founding
principles in action.

364
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,919
He saw Americans as
very entrepreneurial.

365
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,599
Choose any American at random

366
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,545
and he could be enterprising,
adventurous, and above all, an innovator.

367
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,919
Tocqueville observed how no one bows
or scrapes before another in America.

368
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,439
America is the only country
where we call the waiter "sir,"

369
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,063
as if he were a knight.

370
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,399
Tocqueville witnessed the
importance of Christianity.

371
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,719
He saw faith shaping not
only people's inner life,

372
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,707
but also their political life.

373
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,666
He wrote, "Religion must be regarded
as the first of their political institutions.

374
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,959
"When a private individual
meditates an undertaking,

375
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,079
"he never thinks of soliciting the
cooperation of the government.

376
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,865
"Rather, he does it himself or
in collaboration with others."

377
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,999
- God bless you, sir.
- God bless you.

378
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,399
"In the end, the sum of
these private undertakings

379
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,309
"far exceeds all that the
government could have done."

380
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,791
Now, Tocqueville did recognize
the things that Zinn talks about.

381
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,719
At one point, Tocqueville stood
on the Ohio-Kentucky border.

382
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,919
He looked north and he
saw industrious Ohio.

383
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,181
He looked south and
he saw idle Kentucky.

384
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,279
"On both sides," he commented,
"the soil is equally fertile.

385
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,799
"The situation just as favorable."

386
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,946
So what explained the difference?

387
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,959
"Slavery," Tocqueville
said, "degrades work.

388
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,559
"It produces a people without energy,
without a spirit of enterprise.

389
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,839
"Slaves have no incentive to work

390
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,305
"because they don't get to
keep the fruit of their labor."

391
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,799
Thank you all for coming
out to auction today.

392
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,959
"And masters become lazy
because there are slaves

393
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,359
"to do everything for them."

394
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,679
We're gonna sell them here
'cause they are ready to work.

395
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,439
We're gonna start this auction off with
this strapping young buck right here.

396
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,759
This one right here is
fresh out of the water.

397
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,359
We're gonna open this
auction up at $200.

398
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,959
Do I have $200? Who's gonna bid 300?
Who's gonna bid 300?

399
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,759
When Tocqueville saw slavery,

400
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,199
when he saw the treatment
of the Native Americans,

401
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,870
he knew none of this
was uniquely American.

402
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,024
In fact, it was part of a
universal conquest ethic.

403
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,239
Most countries are
founded in conquest.

404
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,343
Europe, conquest, conquest
and more conquest.

405
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,239
Look at Britain.

406
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,279
Before becoming an empire,
it was conquered

407
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,719
by the Norman kings of France
and earlier by the Romans.

408
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,879
Before the British came,
India was invaded by the Persians,

409
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,711
the Mongols, the Afghans,
the Arabs and Alexander the Great.

410
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,039
Conquest was how wealth was acquired.

411
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,301
Not through entrepreneurship,
invention or business.

412
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,585
Historically, every culture has despised
entrepreneurs and merchants.

413
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,439
In India, we have the caste system.

414
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,199
Who's at the top?
The Brahmin or priest.

415
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,631
The entrepreneur is one
step from the bottom.

416
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,559
The Islamic historian Ibn Khaldūn

417
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,300
says that looting is morally preferable
to entrepreneurship or trade.

418
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,639
Why? Because looting is more manly.

419
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,743
In looting, you have to beat the guy
in open combat to take his stuff.

420
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,559
America is based on a different idea.

421
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,788
The idea of acquiring wealth not
by taking it from someone else.

422
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,479
Instead, wealth can be created

423
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,741
through innovation,
entrepreneurship and trade.

424
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,906
Let's take a look at Manhattan.

425
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,119
Reportedly in 1626,

426
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,986
Native Americans sold Manhattan to
the Dutch for $700 in today's money.

427
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,628
There's land all over the world
now that you can buy for $700.

428
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,990
But when the Dutch bought
Manhattan, there was no Manhattan.

429
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,599
Prices are astronomical today

430
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,782
because of what's been built
over the past 300 years.

431
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,959
Manhattan is the creation
of the people who built it,

432
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,823
not the original
inhabitants who sold it.

433
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,028
Manhattan represents the new
American ethic of wealth creation.

434
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,024
An alternative to conquest.

435
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,140
It's time to respond to Zion's
story of American shame.

436
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,188
Did America steal the country
from the Native Americans?

437
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,159
Much of this critique
focuses on Columbus

438
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,119
and the actions of the
Spanish conquistadors.

439
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,079
But Columbus never even
landed in America.

440
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,799
And the actions of the Spanish,

441
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,310
that was 150 years before America.

442
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,039
Zinn blames America for
the sins of the Spanish

443
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,710
and the Portuguese and
Great Britain and France.

444
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,748
What about all the broken
treaties since 1776?

445
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,279
Well, the very idea of a treaty is a
departure from the conquest ethic.

446
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,020
The conquest ethic was very
simple, you win, I lose.

447
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,199
This is not a defense of relocation

448
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,319
or the way the Native
Americans have been treated.

449
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,559
Some restitution is due.

450
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,719
And some has been made.

451
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,199
In the case of the Black Hills,
American courts acknowledge

452
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,919
the land was taken in violation
of the Laramie Treaty of 1868.

453
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,706
$1 billion, fair market value of the
land plus interest, has been set aside.

454
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,385
But the Sioux have rejected it.
They want the land.

455
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,428
But is it their land?

456
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,319
In the late 1700s, the Sioux took
that land from the Cheyenne,

457
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,103
who had earlier pushed out
the Kiowa and the Arapaho.

458
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,479
Land possession is
part of a long history

459
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,719
in which the stronger Native American
tribes displaced weaker ones.

460
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,919
The Native Americans, too,
subscribe to the conquest ethic.

461
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,919
But what about the
charge of genocide?

462
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,319
In the two centuries after Columbus,

463
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,079
the Native American
population declined by 80%.

464
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,359
But it wasn't due to warfare.

465
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,519
Rather, as historian William
McNeill points out,

466
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,079
they contracted diseases,

467
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,239
measles, typhus, smallpox,
cholera and malaria,

468
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,942
to which they had no immunities.

469
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,079
Now, this is tragedy on a grand
scale, but it's not genocide

470
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,671
because genocide implies an
intention to wipe out a people.

471
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,039
Just a century and a half earlier,

472
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,639
one-third of the population
of Europe was wiped out

473
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,919
by a series of bubonic
and pneumonic plagues.

474
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,239
Those plagues came from Asia,
and the Europeans had no immunities.

475
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,988
We don't call that genocide.

476
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,879
I understand the pain of
Charmaine White Face and others

477
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,439
over the loss of an old way of life,

478
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,919
but the Native Americans, if they
wanted, can return to that way.

479
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,559
Instead, they have exercised the
right of tribal self-government

480
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,559
and many have chosen
to build resorts, casinos

481
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,262
and other entrepreneurial businesses.

482
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,186
Did America steal half of
Mexico in the Mexican War?

483
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,279
It seems cruel.

484
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,079
We took the land of these Mexicans

485
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,279
and now we won't even
allow them to come back

486
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,268
and work as laborers on land
that used to be theirs.

487
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,465
I asked Texas Senator Ted Cruz
what started the Mexican War.

488
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,719
What prompted the Texas Revolution,

489
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,439
the Texians, who were
part of Mexico at the time.

490
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,319
General Santa Anna,
who was the dictator in Mexico,

491
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,599
began stripping away
the rights of Texians.

492
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,999
And indeed, they began to revolt to
protect their freedom and independence.

493
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,159
And so the Texians
fought a revolution,

494
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,879
just like our founding
fathers in America did,

495
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,959
and won their
independence from Mexico.

496
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,199
Texas joined the American union,

497
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,144
and its border dispute with Mexico
precipitated the Mexican War.

498
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,479
America won that war.

499
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,599
As a result, American
troops were in Mexico City.

500
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,559
We took all of Mexico.

501
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,106
Then we retired its debt and
gave half the country back.

502
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,799
The people who ended up on the
American side of the border

503
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,423
were made American citizens.

504
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,199
Temo Muniz is a law student
active in Hispanic politics.

505
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,639
Would you consider
yourself Mexican American?

506
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,519
Mexican is the adjective.

507
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,079
American is the noun.

508
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,639
I am a proud Texan born and raised.

509
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,559
I'm an American of Mexican heritage.

510
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,199
Do you believe in the American dream?

511
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,999
Definitely. I've seen it first-hand.

512
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,639
My dad was a shepherd boy

513
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,919
from the mountains of
San Luis Potosí Mexico.

514
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,279
He pretty much bootstrapped
his way to building

515
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,959
one of the largest manufacturing
companies in his industry sector.

516
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,559
Like I said, we started from
the bottom. We had, uh, nothing.

517
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,999
Uh, dumpster diving to sell
things, to resell things.

518
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,439
Selling chips at the park at the
age of six. Collecting cans.

519
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,199
Unloading cotton bales
at the age of 13.

520
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,119
So, I've witnessed it. I've lived it.
And I know the American dream is alive.

521
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,279
What is your American dream?

522
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,759
Well, I'm still in search of it.

523
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,519
I'm in law school right now.

524
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,239
And I hope to really be an
influence to my community.

525
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,959
We're cut from the same cloth as any
American who has a pioneer spirit.

526
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,599
What would your life be like
today if you were in Mexico?

527
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,959
If we had the same
American dream in Mexico,

528
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,279
we'd probably be extorted
by the cartel kingpins.

529
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,759
Asking us for 10%, 20%
of the fruits of our labor.

530
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,199
We wouldn't even have the
natural right to bear arms

531
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,399
to defend ourselves
against the cartels.

532
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,639
It's hard to build any kind of dream
when you're living under tyranny.

533
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,639
I've heard of las provincias
perdidas, the lost provinces.

534
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,359
The truth of the matter, Dinesh,
is that we don't care about that.

535
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,439
We're here in America.
We're building up the American dream.

536
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,279
We're successful.
We've tasted freedom and liberty.

537
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,839
We're not going back.

538
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,159
What would you do if
the American Southwest

539
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,119
were somehow to be
returned to Mexico?

540
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,159
Uh, I'd be moving to Minneapolis.

541
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,239
So you'd want to stay in America?

542
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,944
America is where I was born and
Texas is where I'm gonna die.

543
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,159
And he's not alone.

544
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,519
How long have you been in
border control law enforcement?

545
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,839
Dinesh, I was a border patrol agent
on the border for 26-plus years.

546
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,519
Now, how many people
would you say in a year

547
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,079
surreptitiously cross the border?

548
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,039
Probably in the millions.

549
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,039
And these are people obviously crossing
from the United States into Mexico.

550
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,919
No, they're people crossing from
Mexico into the United States. Yes.

551
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,359
But don't you have Mexican Americans

552
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,919
who are trying to cross back
into their old country?

553
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,039
Uh, I've never seen one illegally try
and cross back into Mexico, no, never.

554
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,559
They prefer it here?

555
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,421
Obviously.

556
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,559
I wonder how many
people in Mexico today

557
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,389
wish the United States
had kept all of Mexico.

558
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,239
The enslavement of African
Americans was theft.

559
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,669
Theft of life and labor.

560
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,719
Were the American founders hypocrites in
affirming that all men are created equal

561
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,141
while approving a constitution
that allowed slavery to continue?

562
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,919
This was debated by the
Republican Abraham Lincoln

563
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,622
and his Democratic opponent.

564
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,119
So if you desire Negro citizenship,

565
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,999
if you desire to let them move into our
state to settle with the white man,

566
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,839
then by all means, support Mr. Lincoln
and the black Republican party

567
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,719
who are for Negro citizenship.

568
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,426
The authors of that notable instrument
intended to include all men.

569
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,319
They did not intend to declare
all men equal in all respects.

570
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,959
They did not mean to say
that all were equal in color,

571
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,861
size, intellect, moral
developments or social capacity.

572
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,119
They define with
tolerable distinctness

573
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,064
in what respect they did
consider all men created equal.

574
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,839
Equal in certain inalienable rights.

575
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,068
Among which are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

576
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,879
They did not mean to
assert the obvious untruth

577
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,439
that all were then actually
enjoying this equality.

578
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,941
Nor yet that they were about to
confer them immediately upon them.

579
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,519
They simply meant
to declare the right,

580
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,182
so that the enforcement of it might follow
as fast as circumstances should permit.

581
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,399
Lincoln recognized that the founders

582
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,519
could not have outlawed slavery
and still had a union.

583
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,399
No Southern state would
have joined such a union

584
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,467
and slavery might have
lasted much longer.

585
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,359
Earlier in his career,
Frederick Douglass

586
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,039
had called Lincoln the
white man's president.

587
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,119
There was a movement in America
supported by many blacks

588
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,399
and even by Lincoln to
relocate blacks to Africa.

589
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,239
But meeting Lincoln restored
Douglass' faith in America.

590
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,559
Douglass condemned that movement.

591
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,919
He didn't want to leave America,
nor did he want to destroy America.

592
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,879
He wanted to participate in America.

593
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,039
He wanted to make this
country his home.

594
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,788
Now, take the Constitution.

595
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,839
According to its plain reading,

596
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,399
I defy the presentation of a
single proslavery clause in it.

597
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,599
On the other hand, it will be found
to contain principles and purposes

598
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,304
entirely hostile to the
existence of slavery.

599
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,742
I do not despair at this country.

600
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,239
There are forces in operation

601
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,548
which must inevitably work
the downfall of slavery.

602
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,984
For the first time in history,
a great war was fought to end slavery.

603
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,306
300,000 Northern soldiers
died in that war.

604
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,919
They died to secure for the slaves

605
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,024
a freedom that the slaves were not in
the position to secure for themselves.

606
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,343
Even the Civil Rights Movement was not
a break with the American founding.

607
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,949
In a sense, we've come to our
nation's capital to cash a check.

608
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,861
When the architects of our republic

609
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,959
wrote the magnificent
words of the Constitution

610
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,027
and the Declaration of independence,

611
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,543
they were signing a promissory note

612
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,429
To which every American
was to fall heir.

613
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,599
Where did Martin Luther
King get his promissory note?

614
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,439
Not from the segregationists.

615
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,746
He got it from the
Declaration of independence.

616
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,159
It was the American founding
that established the principles

617
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,263
that made possible the success
of the Civil Rights Movement.

618
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,999
The topic of race, more than
any other, generates taboos.

619
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,546
And taboos are the enemy
of history and of truth.

620
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,359
In the early 17th century when
slavery started in America,

621
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,064
another group was brought
to this country by force.

622
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,839
They were white indentured servants.

623
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,667
Starting in 1618, children were
captured from the streets of London

624
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,746
and sold into colonial America.

625
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,959
But it didn't stop there.

626
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,479
Over the next century and a half,

627
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,799
another 150,000 Irish men,
women and children

628
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,462
were declared soldiers of war by Britain
and sold into colonial indentured servitude

629
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,306
with many landing in
Virginia and New England.

630
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,599
Indentured servitude was not slavery.

631
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,021
It didn't have the same ideology
of racial dehumanization.

632
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,021
And it was for a limited period,
typically seven years.

633
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,399
Yet, these people often
had their term extended

634
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,467
or died before they
got their freedom.

635
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,079
Indentured servants worked
side by side with slaves.

636
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,386
For many years, white indentured
servants outnumbered black slaves.

637
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,959
Our next story, one you
won't find in Howard Zinn,

638
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,708
is set in South Carolina,

639
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,143
where we encounter one of the most
feared plantation owners in the South.

640
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,587
Meet William Ellison.

641
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,279
Born himself into slavery,
Ellison was freed as a young man.

642
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,199
He became a blacksmith,
then a mechanic for cotton gins.

643
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,639
And then went into farming

644
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,239
where he eventually owned
1,000 acres and 60 slaves.

645
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,759
He was also known as a slave breeder,

646
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,159
a practice shunned even by
most white slave owners.

647
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,749
That's a fine young one for you.

648
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,719
When the Civil War broke out,
Ellison supported the Confederacy,

649
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,839
investing in Confederate bonds

650
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,908
and supplying food and provisions
for the Confederate army.

651
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,039
Ellison's story is told by
the African American scholar

652
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,719
Henry Louis Gates.

653
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,239
Gates and other scholars estimate that
in the period before the Civil War,

654
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:13,664
there were approximately 3,500 free blacks
who owned more than 10,000 black slaves.

655
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,719
In South Carolina and Louisiana,

656
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,879
Gates points out,
the percentage of free blacks

657
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,199
who owned slaves was
approximately the same

658
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,719
as the percentage of
whites who owned slaves.

659
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,879
These episodes illustrate the
universality of the conquest ethic

660
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,479
and the uniqueness of the
American response to it.

661
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,959
Slavery existed all over the world.

662
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,439
The Egyptians had slaves.
The Chinese had slaves.

663
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,919
The Africans did. American Indians
had slaves long before Columbus.

664
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,439
And tragically, slavery continues
today in many countries.

665
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,986
What's uniquely Western
is the abolition of slavery.

666
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,399
And what's uniquely American is the
fighting of a great war to end it.

667
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,079
Zinn wants a narrative
of American shame.

668
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,759
That's why he leaves
these stories out.

669
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,022
And that's why we have a moral
obligation to put them back in.

670
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,951
And here's someone else who
gets left out of Zinn's narrative.

671
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,079
Good afternoon. I'm Madam Walker
and this is my daughter Lelia.

672
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,024
Meet Sarah Breedlove, also
known as Madam C.J. Walker.

673
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,944
She started selling her own hair
care products door to door.

674
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,469
Madam C.J. Walker became the first
self-made female millionaire in America.

675
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,869
- They're ready for you.
- Thank you.

676
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,679
Good morning, madam.

677
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,860
Good morning, ladies.
Get back to work.

678
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,999
See, ladies, you don't
have to define yourself

679
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,999
by your current station in life.

680
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,839
But only by your vision
of who you can become.

681
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,079
Yes. Yes.

682
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,519
- Today you see a success.
- Yes.

683
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,359
And I hear many of you
say, "But, Madam Walker,

684
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,540
"I just don't have the
opportunities you had."

685
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,621
And I respond, "Really?"

686
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,108
I was the first
freeborn in my family.

687
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,823
Orphaned at age seven.

688
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,479
Married at 14 and widowed
with child by 20.

689
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,039
Mmm-hmm.

690
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,559
I'm a woman that came from
the cotton fields of the South.

691
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,639
Yes.

692
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,199
From there, I was
promoted to the washtub.

693
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,879
From there, I was promoted
to the cook kitchen.

694
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,959
Uh-huh.

695
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,159
From there, I promoted
myself to the business

696
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,999
of manufacturing hair
goods and preparations.

697
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,559
Yes!

698
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,439
I have built my own
factory on my own ground.

699
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,620
I got my start by
giving myself a start.

700
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,239
Ladies, there is no
flower-strewn path to success.

701
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,750
And if there is, I haven't found it.

702
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,199
If I've accomplished anything in my life,
it's because I was willing to work hard.

703
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,519
You can do something new today.

704
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,559
And don't be too haughty.

705
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,399
You can always go to
that washtub for a seat.

706
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,079
What a role model.

707
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,279
So why is she left out
of the history books?

708
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,079
Because she confounds
the shame narrative.

709
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,119
She's an African
American success story.

710
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,319
In a way, she sounds
like Martin Luther King.

711
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,599
King once said, "Every man
must write with his own hand

712
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,759
"the charter of his
Emancipation Proclamation.

713
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,639
"We are all in this
country a minority of one

714
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,948
"and how we succeed or fail
depends on our efforts."

715
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,119
Did America get rich by simply
stealing from other countries?

716
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,119
Starting with the Vietnam War,
another charge surfaced,

717
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,119
America the imperialist.

718
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,079
We will build a revolutionary
youth movement

719
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,639
capable of actively engaging in
the war against the imperialists.

720
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,959
We will escalate our attacks until
imperialism is defeated in Vietnam.

721
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,319
That was Bill Ayers, founder
of the Weather Underground.

722
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,999
He bombed the Pentagon

723
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,679
and says he wished he
could have done more.

724
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,679
He's now a college professor.

725
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,159
And who are his agents
of American imperialism?

726
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,119
Meet John Fer.

727
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,759
I always adored flying.

728
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,959
And I built and flew model airplanes
since I was five years old.

729
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,759
And so eventually become
a pilot in the Air Force.

730
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,066
But things didn't work out
so well for John Fer.

731
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,519
And they blew the
airplane out of the sky.

732
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,319
I landed on the ground

733
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,149
and then I was marched off
to the interrogation room.

734
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,119
I was absolutely shocked at the
threshold that I had to cry uncle.

735
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,868
I wanted to turn off the pain.

736
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,479
Why did you go to Vietnam?

737
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,039
I believed that we were
doing the right thing

738
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,839
of helping the South Vietnamese
stand on their own two feet,

739
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,679
so that one day then we
could extract ourselves

740
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,359
and we would have
a free South Vietnam.

741
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,159
I was there to give opportunity

742
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,626
for the South Vietnamese people
to exercise their own destiny.

743
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,679
John Fer would spend
the next six years

744
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,543
in the famed POW prison,
the Hanoi Hilton.

745
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,220
I came home to a different America.

746
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,519
Whatever you think
about the Vietnam War,

747
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,541
America wasn't stealing
from the Vietnamese.

748
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,719
And in Iraq, we spent a
whole bunch of money

749
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,559
and then we turned over
the oil fields to the Iraqis.

750
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,831
Under the conquest ethic,
we would have kept it.

751
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,399
In Afghanistan after 9/11,

752
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,199
the US military, even while
bombing terrorist targets,

753
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,586
was delivering food rations
to Afghan civilians.

754
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,799
And far from stealing,
America rebuilt Germany and Japan

755
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,184
after World War ll.

756
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,184
Contrary to the Zinn narrative,
we're not the bad guys of the world.

757
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,719
As Colin Powell said,

758
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,382
"The only land that America asks for
abroad is land to bury our dead."

759
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,799
Finally, capitalism.
Does it rip off the consumer?

760
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,279
Welcome to Delish Dinesh.

761
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,359
- Can I help you?
- I'll take a hamburger.

762
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,519
$1.95.

763
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,479
Maria just paid $1.95
for that hamburger.

764
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,999
Ek burger jaldi banao.

765
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,559
But the cost of me
making the hamburger,

766
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,959
with food, labor, rent, insurance,
advertising, permits...

767
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,919
Hey, boss, soda machine broken again.

768
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,861
...equals $1.79.

769
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,190
Leaving me with a whopping
8% or 16 cent profit.

770
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,439
The best way to judge
if I'm ripping her off

771
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,747
is to see what it would cost for
her to make the burger at home.

772
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,823
Maria's burger has the same
stuff as Delish Dinesh.

773
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,479
But when you add it up,
Maria's homemade burger

774
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,799
costs $2. 22.

775
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,266
That's 27 cents more than the
burger at my restaurant.

776
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,661
And that doesn't even factor in the
time that it cost her to make it.

777
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,399
Does this work for the
big companies, too?

778
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,759
And we are calling it iPhone.

779
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,151
Steve Jobs, did he rip people off?

780
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,509
He created products that people didn't
even know they wanted or needed.

781
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,519
But once he made them available,

782
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,479
they clamored for them and
stood in line to buy them

783
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,719
and freely spent their
money for them.

784
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,079
There's no rip-off.

785
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,919
Capitalism works not through
coercion or conquest,

786
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,191
but through the consent
of the consumer.

787
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,559
To see why there's
so much inequality,

788
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,879
consider the example of Zinn's
own disciple Matt Damon.

789
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,469
Here he is in The Bourne Ultimatum.

790
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,079
Here he is in The Bourne Identity.

791
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,399
How does Matt Damon make
so much more money than you?

792
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,799
Is it because he works
harder than you

793
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,108
putting in an intense six weeks filming
to earn several million dollars?

794
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,119
Could it be because of
his unbelievable skills?

795
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,470
Please.

796
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,759
There's only one reason Matt
Damon makes so much money.

797
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,239
The consumers who buy
tickets to his movies.

798
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,783
In other words,

799
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,901
you.

800
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,159
You moved your goods to market

801
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,239
on the roads the rest of us paid for.

802
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,999
You hired workers the rest
of us paid to educate.

803
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,599
You were safe in your factory

804
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,545
because of police forces and fire
forces that the rest of us paid for.

805
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,199
Is Senator Warren right?

806
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,639
Entrepreneurs and business
owners do use public services,

807
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,229
but so does everyone else.

808
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,719
Let's say, a successful
business owner

809
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,759
makes four times as much
as the average employee.

810
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,479
But she also pays four
times as much in taxes.

811
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,119
Do her kids get four times more
attention in public school?

812
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,639
Does she get to drive four
times as fast on the freeway?

813
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,279
Will the fire department
arrive four times faster?

814
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,744
No. Not at all.

815
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,549
What about the rest of the world?

816
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,871
Does capitalism promote
global injustice?

817
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,546
From businesses in the Middle East

818
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,748
to factories in South America

819
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,039
to entrepreneurs in China,

820
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,186
the world is embracing
the free market.

821
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,519
Does it seem to you ironic that this
sort of entrepreneurial capitalism,

822
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,839
that this recipe has become
so controversial at home here

823
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,439
while it is being enthusiastically embraced
in so many other parts of the world?

824
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,519
I spoke to Jagdish Bhagwati,

825
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,759
a professor of economics
at Columbia University

826
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,199
and a leading researcher
on global capitalism.

827
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,079
How many people have been
lifted out of poverty in India?

828
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,199
Over 200 million
people are, you know,

829
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,519
in less than 15 years,
have pulled out of poverty.

830
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,719
And in China the number
is even greater.

831
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,879
Far greater. It's about 400
to 500 million people.

832
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,759
'Cause they started earlier.

833
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,719
Capitalism, entrepreneurial capitalism
is the most important moral case.

834
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,559
So there's no reason
for us to be apologetic.

835
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,039
It's the other guys who
should be apologetic.

836
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,799
'Cause every bit of experience shows

837
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,471
that they're the ones who really
undermine the fortunes of the poor.

838
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,719
And when it comes to helping
the poor through charity,

839
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,079
you may be surprised
at who cares the most.

840
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,639
Meet Arthur Brooks, head of the
American Enterprise institute.

841
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,159
One of the things that
we typically find

842
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,559
in our modern conversation
about who's charitable

843
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,399
is that folks who believe in
greater government transfers,

844
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,359
more income redistribution,

845
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,399
they believe they're the most
charitable members of society.

846
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,079
When you look at the data,
a different picture emerges.

847
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,399
What we really find is that folks
who are on the conservative side,

848
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,879
especially the religious conservative
side, give away the most.

849
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,879
About four times as much.

850
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,471
About four times as much of their resources
as people who are on the secular left.

851
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,948
And if you're struggling in America,
is it still possible to pull yourself up?

852
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,879
I believed that my problems
were somebody else's fault.

853
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,439
I believed that America
was so inherently racist

854
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,279
that I didn't need to mainstream.

855
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,839
And I believed that the poor were poor
because the wealthy were wealthy.

856
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,719
I met with my friend Star Parker.

857
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,879
You were on welfare for how long?

858
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,999
I was in and out seven years,
but three-and-a-half years consistently.

859
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,879
Did it ever occur to you to go looking
for work and if not, why not?

860
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,519
Why bother? Why would I
go out and find work

861
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,279
when somebody else was willing to send
me a check on the 1st and the 15th?

862
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,999
My life go in a little black hole.

863
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,999
And that's where I was living.

864
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,159
When some people looked me in the eye
and pointed their finger in my face

865
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,799
and told me my lifestyle
was unacceptable to God,

866
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,319
and when they said that, I didn't
even know there were churches,

867
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,159
but there was something about their
conviction that got my attention.

868
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,839
I finally went to church with
them and heard the gospel

869
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,999
and I changed and I
went back to college.

870
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,479
I got a degree. I started a business.

871
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,159
And now I run an organization today

872
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,639
and am a nationally syndicated
columnist and an author.

873
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,662
For me, Star Parker is the
quintessential American.

874
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,319
She draws on those classic American
virtues that Tocqueville talked about,

875
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,789
individual initiative, community,
faith, to help herself and others.

876
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,182
So is the wealth of
America based on theft?

877
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,903
Actually, no.

878
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,743
The wealth of America isn't
stolen, it's created.

879
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,239
All right, this way. This way.

880
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,919
The ethic of conquest is universal.

881
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,039
What's uniquely American
is the alternative,

882
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,506
equal rights, self-determination
and wealth creation.

883
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,839
If America did not exist,

884
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,719
the conquest ethic would
dominate the world once again.

885
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,719
America isn't the problem.

886
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,229
America is the answer.

887
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,119
Tocqueville knew that.

888
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,106
I know it.

889
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,629
And so does U2's Bono.

890
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,879
It's not a right-left issue.

891
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,719
It's a right-wrong issue.

892
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,999
And America has constantly been
on the side of what's right.

893
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,239
Because when it comes down to it,

894
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,467
this is about keeping faith
with the idea of America.

895
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,159
Because America is an idea, isn't it?

896
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,784
I mean, Ireland is a great
country, but it's not an idea.

897
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,079
Great Britain is a great country.

898
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,384
It's not an idea.

899
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,679
That's how we see
you around the world.

900
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,759
As one of the greatest
ideas in human history.

901
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,279
Right up there with the Renaissance.

902
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,119
Right up there with crop rotation

903
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,470
and the Beatles' White Album.

904
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,351
You and me are created equal.

905
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,670
If we have dignity, if we have justice,
then leave it to us, we'll do the rest.

906
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,719
This country was the first

907
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,981
to claw its way out of darkness
and put that on paper.

908
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,199
These aren't just
American ideas anymore.

909
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,983
There's no copyright on them.
You brought them into the world.

910
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,784
These truths, your truths,
they're self-evident in us.

911
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,839
But now we turn to
a political question.

912
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,159
If America is a force for good,
why are they trying to make us feel bad?

913
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,319
Who's behind this?

914
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:54,399
The shaming of America is not accidental.
It's part of a strategy.

915
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,159
This becomes a contest of power.

916
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,959
Now, power has always
gone into two areas,

917
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,999
those who have money
and those who have people.

918
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,919
We have nothing but people.

919
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,519
If an organizer doesn't have
any idea what to do about it,

920
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,919
he hasn't got any damn
business being in there.

921
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,319
Do I make myself clear?

922
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,519
Who was Saul Alinsky?

923
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,119
Saul Alinsky was a man of the left,
and very far to the left.

924
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,279
To pin it down, he was
a democratic socialist.

925
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,239
Meaning that he wanted the United
States to become a socialist country,

926
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,159
but he was willing to see that happen
slowly through the democratic process.

927
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,759
You tell them that I'm meeting with my staff
and with the fight leaders on Friday at noon.

928
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,239
I spoke to scholar and
author Stanley Kurtz,

929
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,879
who's done extensive
research on Alinsky.

930
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,159
Well, Alinsky wants to polarize.

931
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,079
He wants the people he calls
"the haves" to feel guilty

932
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,148
and he wants the people he calls
"the have nots" to feel resentful.

933
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,119
Alinsky perfected the art
of the political shakedown.

934
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,519
I have, on occasion,
remarked that I felt confident

935
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,239
that I could persuade a
millionaire on a Friday

936
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,999
to subsidize a
revolution for Saturday,

937
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,599
out of which he would make
a huge profit on Sunday,

938
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,559
even though he was certain
to be executed on Monday.

939
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,470
While finishing graduate school,
Alinsky sought out an unusual mentor.

940
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,828
Frank Nitti, Al Capone's
number two in the Chicago mob.

941
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,631
Known as a thug or a hoodlum.

942
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,185
Also known as a
racketeer and gangster.

943
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,359
Nitti took me under his wing.

944
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,799
I called him the professor
and I became his student.

945
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,999
Nitti's boys took me everywhere,
showed me all of the mob's operations

946
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,999
from gin mills and whorehouses
and bookie joints

947
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,199
to the legitimate businesses they
were beginning to take over.

948
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,999
Within a few months,
I got to know the workings

949
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,180
of the Capone mob inside out.

950
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,279
Alinsky saw up close the
ease with which the Mafia

951
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,985
could extract money through
theft, intimidation and murder.

952
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,719
But he figured out a way to do
it without going to prison.

953
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,159
How is it the haves prosper while
we struggle just to survive?

954
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,679
He wanted to build from the ground up

955
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:21,799
by creating a sort of coalition
of community organizations

956
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,583
that he hoped to establish
all across the country.

957
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,519
The one thing I've come to realize

958
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,359
is that any positive action
for radical social change

959
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,540
will have to be focused
on the white middle class

960
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,260
for the simple reason that this
is where the real power lies.

961
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,039
The American middle class is decent.

962
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,061
It wants to live up
to its own ideals.

963
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,799
Alinsky knew that if he could show a gap
between people's lives and their ideals,

964
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,549
he could exploit their
shame to gain power.

965
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,064
Alinsky became the godfather in the art
of using shame for political shakedown.

966
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,359
But he needed an army of recruits
to carry out the shakedown.

967
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,664
And he knew where to look.

968
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,559
The 1960s saw the birth
of a new generation

969
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,239
alienated from its parents,
alienated from America.

970
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,639
Ripe pickings for Alinsky.

971
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,519
But first he had to
straighten them out.

972
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,999
I have a hell of a lot
more love than you have

973
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,559
because I'm willing to go out
and get corruptive for it.

974
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,399
I'm willing to fight for it. I'm willing
to stick my life on the line on it.

975
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,119
And you're just willing to stick around
and talk about love and hippies

976
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,743
and not do a damn thing.

977
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,679
Alinsky wrote an instruction manual

978
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,303
for this new army of
shakedown artists.

979
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,839
In Rules For Radicals, we discover
that the mobster Frank Nitti

980
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,781
was not Alinsky's only mentor.

981
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,559
Alinsky was an atheist.

982
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,501
What could he possibly
learn from the Devil?

983
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,319
Three things. Polarization.

984
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,279
We've got to get away from
all this reconciliation jazz

985
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,319
and all this friendship and
all that kind of business.

986
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,839
Demonization.

987
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,919
They'd love to see all the Negroes
in America living on the reserves.

988
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,119
And deception.

989
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,079
You do what you can
with what you have

990
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,908
and close it with moral arguments.

991
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,310
Today, Alinsky's influence
can be seen across academia,

992
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,111
the media

993
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,190
and government.

994
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,279
And his most famous disciple lives
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

995
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,159
I don't think there's any
doubt that Barack Obama

996
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,599
really hasn't leveled with the American
public about his political past.

997
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,679
And this is probably the
most dramatic example.

998
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,559
Obama first encountered
Alinskyite organizing

999
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,799
at a series of socialist conferences

1000
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,759
that he attended when he lived
in New York City as a young man.

1001
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,199
Those conferences touted Alinskyite
organizing as the next big political wave

1002
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,839
and as the best way to bring
socialism to America.

1003
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,319
And those same conferences
touted Chicago

1004
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,879
as the place to find the very
best Alinskyite organizers.

1005
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,119
Clearly Obama has mastered the
Alinskyite strategy of deception.

1006
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,479
We will keep this promise.

1007
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,639
If you like your doctor,
you keep seeing your doctor.

1008
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,879
If you like your doctor...

1009
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,559
If you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor.

1010
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,439
Save a typical family
an average of $2,500.

1011
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,199
I'll make our government
open and transparent.

1012
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,719
We're building a transparent process.

1013
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,239
No matter what you've heard,

1014
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,479
if you like your doctor or health
care plan, you can keep it.

1015
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,159
If you don't have insurance,
you'll finally be able to afford it.

1016
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,479
Alinsky would be so
proud of Obamacare.

1017
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,741
It's a masterpiece of
distortion and extortion.

1018
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,599
Here's the distortion.

1019
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,239
Obama gives the impression
that he is colluding with us

1020
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,559
against the insurance companies.

1021
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,868
But in reality, he's colluding with
the insurance companies against us.

1022
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,159
He's forcing Americans to buy
insurance who don't want to buy it.

1023
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,799
And this makes the insurance
companies very happy

1024
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,141
because it means more
profits for them.

1025
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,759
With the corporate and the bank
bailouts, it was the same deal.

1026
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,759
Obama embraced the bailouts.

1027
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,759
He recognized it was a way

1028
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,146
for the federal government to gain
control over those institutions.

1029
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,759
What these naive corporate
executives don't realize

1030
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,679
is that while they might
make a profit on Sunday,

1031
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,667
they could be gone by Monday.

1032
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,145
But Obama wasn't the only disciple.

1033
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,559
Well, when Hillary was
still in high school,

1034
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,679
she fell under the spell of
a Methodist youth minister.

1035
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,399
And at that time Hillary
had been a Goldwater girl.

1036
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:48,788
A conservative growing up in a perfectly
conventional American suburb.

1037
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:55,468
But this very charismatic Methodist
minister drew Hillary sharply to the left.

1038
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,999
Mr. Alinsky, this is Hillary.

1039
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,226
- A pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1040
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,359
- Are you enjoying your work back there?
- I am.

1041
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,679
Well, you'll have a lot of it.

1042
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,039
After high school,
Hillary met with Alinsky again

1043
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,879
at Wellesley College,
where she invited him to speak.

1044
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,071
Later, Alinksy would offer her a
job, but Hillary turned it down.

1045
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,719
When she got to college,
she decided to focus

1046
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,399
on Alinsky as her senior thesis work.

1047
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,159
Hillary was looking
to Alinsky for a way

1048
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,439
to put her existing leftist
ideology into practice.

1049
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,079
But in studying Alinsky.
Hillary came to the conclusion

1050
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,479
that Alinsky organizing could
never truly transform America

1051
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,599
unless it somehow was
connected more deeply

1052
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,039
To the core of the
American political system.

1053
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:31,599
Alinsky always opposed tight relationships
between community organizers and politics.

1054
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,828
So this is where Hillary decided to
take Alinsky in a different direction.

1055
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,759
While Alinsky wanted the radicals
to pressure the government,

1056
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,509
Hillary wanted the radicals
to become the government.

1057
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,959
Why try to shame people
from the outside

1058
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,901
when you can intimidate
them from the inside?

1059
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:06,029
So I would say on ideology. Hillary is
closer to Obama than she is to Bill.

1060
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,064
Hillary figured it out,
Obama is now carrying it out.

1061
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:27,159
The IRS, EPA, DOJ, NSA

1062
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,707
are all collecting information and
storing it on every American.

1063
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,519
Welcome to the Panopticon,

1064
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,759
a prison designed by philosopher
Jeremy Bentham in the 1800s.

1065
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,385
His design gave the
guards a God's eye view.

1066
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,822
Here, there's no privacy,

1067
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,386
What Bentham envisioned for a prison
has now become the hi-tech Panopticon.

1068
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,382
Nobody is listening to
your telephone calls.

1069
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,079
The United States is not
spying on ordinary people

1070
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,782
who don't threaten
our national security.

1071
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,879
There's no question that the collection
of these huge amounts of data

1072
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,199
gives the government the ability
to go after anybody and everybody.

1073
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,719
The government will always use
as much power as you give it.

1074
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,426
It will always go up to and
sometimes cross over, eh, the line.

1075
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,919
That's a real problem,

1076
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,439
particularly if we're looking at
everyone's Internet searches,

1077
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,799
we're looking at what magazines
you read, what books you read,

1078
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,599
and really a lot of your life.

1079
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,559
Imagine how much of
your life is online.

1080
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,919
If they can look at your
Visa bill without a warrant.

1081
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,945
This program, by the way,
is fully overseen by the FISA Court,

1082
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,239
a court specially put together
to evaluate classified programs

1083
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,799
to make sure that
the executive branch

1084
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,439
or government generally
is not abusing them

1085
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,679
and that it's being carried out
consistent with the Constitution.

1086
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,279
The FISA Court should not be
allowed to use the term "court."

1087
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,119
It is not a court.

1088
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:25,119
A court by definition means an
institution that hears both sides

1089
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,959
of a case and controversy.

1090
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,439
Due process is an open court.
Adversarial process on both sides of it.

1091
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,159
But it's not in a secret court.

1092
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:38,799
FISA, with nobody to advocate for the
individual that's being spied upon.

1093
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,719
Judges should not be
allowed to wear robes.

1094
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,279
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the word "judge."

1095
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,679
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the word "court."

1096
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,839
And it's misleading the public.

1097
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,639
Many people will say,
"I haven't done anything wrong

1098
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,639
"and so I don't really care
if they read my mail."

1099
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,719
The problem with that is it's
a much different standard

1100
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,239
than innocent until proven guilty.

1101
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,839
It's that everything is open.

1102
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,279
They come into your house and say,

1103
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,799
"Oh, you've been sending
e-mails to someone in Lebanon.

1104
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,159
"We suspect you of terrorism."

1105
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,159
If they get in your house
and they find no terrorism,

1106
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,119
you're not connected,
but they find you have paint

1107
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,239
that you brought home from the office
that you bought with a business expense

1108
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,479
and you were painting your office,

1109
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,999
now you're painting
the inside of your house,

1110
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,999
you've now committed a tax violation.

1111
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,279
Or maybe they find you
have an unregistered gun.

1112
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,679
Everything in America
now is criminal.

1113
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,799
You can't practice commercial law

1114
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,999
or real estate law, be in
the hedge fund business,

1115
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,060
do a great many things without running
afoul of potential criminal statute.

1116
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,119
Harvey, you've written a book
that has the remarkable title

1117
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,639
Three Felonies a Day.

1118
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,439
Now, how is it possible for an ordinary
guy to commit three felonies a day?

1119
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,319
On a normal day,

1120
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:54,039
the average reasonably engaged American
does at least three things that arguably

1121
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:58,039
can be deemed federal
felonies by some ambitious

1122
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,199
Department of Justice prosecutor.

1123
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:06,239
The problem with most federal felonies
is that an average normal person,

1124
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,359
even, I have to say,
a lot of my fellow lawyers,

1125
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,719
wouldn't have a clue that
what they're engaging in

1126
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,559
is arguably prosecutable.

1127
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,239
Well, and consider it on
top of this IRS scandal

1128
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,999
where it appears as if the government
is using the IRS for partisan reasons.

1129
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,119
Maybe I'm not so, uh,
confident that I would want

1130
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,839
all my phone records given to,
uh, the government

1131
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,039
if it appears maybe I could be
targeted by the government.

1132
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,159
I talk to people routinely now
who I don't think are paranoid,

1133
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,879
who are saying, "I'm a little
worried about having my name

1134
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,919
"publically associated with conservatives
or Republicans because I fear retaliation.

1135
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,839
"I fear that I will be targeted
by the SEC or the IRS

1136
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,279
"or different arms of government."

1137
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,399
And I think it's a legitimate fear.

1138
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,079
I think there's probably almost nothing
more fundamentally un-American

1139
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,879
than using government to target
your political opponents.

1140
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,279
Well, when the President does it,
that means that it is not illegal.

1141
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,399
During the Nixon Administration,
I was audited four times.

1142
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:09,919
I was audited because I was a very
vocal critic of the Nixon Administration.

1143
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,239
We all pay taxes.
We all file tax returns.

1144
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,279
And talk about a trap for the unwary.
They can get absolutely anybody.

1145
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,399
They can bankrupt you just from
trying to defend against them.

1146
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,439
And then the rest of the game is

1147
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,079
are you going to avoid
a long prison sentence

1148
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,590
and pled guilty for a short sentence?

1149
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:38,479
There are a lot of people in
prison today based on guilty pleas

1150
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,679
who could have won their
case had they litigated it.

1151
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,987
But the risks of litigation are so
great that they can't afford to do it.

1152
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,759
It was Lavrenty Beria
who told Stalin,

1153
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,987
"Show me the man and
I'll find you the crime."

1154
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:01,319
What the government did to our little group
in Wetumpka, Alabama, is un-American.

1155
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,079
It isn't a matter of firing
or arresting individuals.

1156
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:09,479
The individuals who sought to intimidate us
were acting as they thought they should

1157
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,319
in a government culture that has
little respect for its citizens.

1158
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,199
Many of the agents and agencies
of the federal government

1159
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,159
do not understand that they
are servants of the people.

1160
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,399
They think they are our masters,
and they are mistaken.

1161
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,839
I'm not interested in
scoring political points.

1162
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,590
I want to protect and preserve
the America that I grew up in.

1163
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:38,679
The America that people crossed oceans
and risked their lives to become a part of.

1164
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,959
And I am terrified
it is slipping away.

1165
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,741
Thank you.

1166
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,745
Aaron Swartz was an
internet whiz kid.

1167
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,879
At 14, he developed a new way to
publish information on the Web.

1168
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,599
In his late teens, he cofounded a
company that merged with Reddit

1169
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,510
to become one of the Web's most
frequently used social news sites.

1170
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,199
He became a vocal critic of several of
the Obama Administration's policies.

1171
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,399
The freedoms guaranteed
in our Constitution,

1172
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,919
the freedoms our country had been
built on would be suddenly deleted.

1173
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,999
Aaron Swartz was prosecuted
by the US Attorney's office

1174
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,264
in Massachusetts for allegedly breaking
into the computer networks at MIT

1175
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,399
and downloading without authorization
thousands of academic articles.

1176
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,199
He was charged with crimes
that would have carried

1177
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:43,559
a penalty of up to 35 years in
prison and $1 million fine.

1178
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,359
The articles were funded
by taxpayer money

1179
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,079
and Aaron thought they should
be available to the public.

1180
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,799
The government argued they
were copyrighted material.

1181
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,239
It strikes me as disproportionate,
being used inappropriately

1182
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,359
to try to bully, uh,
someone into pleading guilty

1183
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:03,110
to something that strikes
me as rather, uh, minor.

1184
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,199
The company that owns
the copyrighted articles

1185
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,559
asked federal prosecutors
to drop the charges.

1186
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:13,981
But the prosecutor wanted
to send Aaron to prison.

1187
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:23,303
On January 11, 2013,
Aaron Swartz took his own life.

1188
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,668
He was 26 years old.

1189
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,639
New accusations that the feds are
unfairly targeting conservatives

1190
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,119
in an effort to silence
those who do not agree

1191
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,029
with the Obama Administration
during a crucial election year.

1192
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,399
Conservative filmmaker and
author Dinesh D'Souza

1193
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,199
is the latest victim to be targeted
by the Obama White House.

1194
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,159
And he's also the man behind
the anti-Obama documentary

1195
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,999
2016, Obama's America.

1196
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,039
Dinesh D'Souza was indicted

1197
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,062
on federal charges of violating
campaign finance laws.

1198
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,679
But do you believe this is
because of the film that you did

1199
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,508
leading up to last year's election?

1200
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:19,344
I made a mistake and I'm not
above the law. No one is.

1201
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,679
But we don't want
to live in a society

1202
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:25,359
where Lady Justice has one eye
open and winks at her friends

1203
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,825
and casts an evil eye
at her adversaries.

1204
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,823
Where will they stop?

1205
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,584
At the point where we stop them.

1206
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,831
We won't let them shame us.

1207
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:55,070
We won't let them intimidate us.

1208
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,261
We're going to start telling
the true story of America.

1209
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,422
In stone, our leaders
appear only as legends.

1210
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:13,466
No faults, no fears, no self-doubts.

1211
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:19,181
But also no laughter.
No hope. No love.

1212
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,039
And yet our human experience tells us

1213
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,903
they had all of these in
the troubles they faced.

1214
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,462
They're ready for you, Mr. President.

1215
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,466
Ready, Mother?

1216
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,719
My friends, no one who
is not in my situation

1217
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:01,028
can appreciate the feelings of
sadness I have at this parting.

1218
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:07,101
To this place and to the kindness
of these people, I owe everything.

1219
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,945
Here I have lived for a
quarter of a century.

1220
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,662
To you, dear friends, I owe
all that I have, all that I am.

1221
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:25,383
I leave now, not knowing when
or whether ever I may return,

1222
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:32,319
with a task before me that is greater
than that which rested upon Washington.

1223
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,067
Fire!

1224
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:43,024
Without the assistance of the Almighty
who attended him, I cannot succeed.

1225
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,591
With that assistance, I cannot fail.

1226
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,385
Fire it in, boys!

1227
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:04,159
Trusting in him who can go
with me and remain with you

1228
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:07,279
and be everywhere for good,

1229
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,985
let us confidently hope
that all will yet be well.

1230
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,519
Through his care commending you,

1231
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:26,588
as I hope that in your
prayers you will commend me.

1232
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,344
I bid you an affectionate farewell.

1233
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,350
And how badly we need right now

1234
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,988
a Washington, a Lincoln, a Reagan.

1235
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,387
Well, we don't have them.

1236
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:13,860
But we do have us.

1237
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,021
The Revolution was a struggle
for the creation of America.

1238
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,470
The Civil War was a struggle for
the preservation of America.

1239
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,985
World War ll was a struggle
for the protection of America.

1240
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,999
Our struggle is for the
restoration of America.

1241
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,439
President Reagan once said,

1242
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:47,039
"Ours is the only national anthem
that ends with a question.

1243
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,639
"Every generation must
answer that question."

1244
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,839
Let us resolve to fight for America

1245
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,181
as if the outcome of the
struggle depended on us alone.

1246
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,708
We cannot do anything less.

1247
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,959
This is our home.

1248
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,599
A lost sailor.

1249
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,780
- He was looking for my country, not yours.
- Yes.

1250
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,511
- Yeah, but you wish he didn't come.
- I wish he didn't come.

1251
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,039
I spoke with Charmaine White
Face, a Native American activist

1252
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,199
and member of the Great Sioux Nation

1253
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,919
whose ancestral land, the Black Hills,
includes Mount Rushmore.

1254
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,199
Having Mount Rushmore here is horrible.
It's a symbol of oppression.

1255
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,559
It's a symbol of
genocide for our people.

1256
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,279
The charge of genocide

1257
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,701
begins with Columbus enslaving
1,500 Arawak Indians
