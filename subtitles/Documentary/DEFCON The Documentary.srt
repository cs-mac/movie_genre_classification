00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,870
BoA first appeared with this song around the same age as that girl.

9
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,560
She's a new face.

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,560
A fearless rookie entering the world of singers.

11

This is BoA's first stage.

12
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,485
BoA was a 13-year-old girl back in the year 2000.

She left a strong impression with her debut song "ID; Peace B."

14

Not only is her singing and dancing perfect...

15
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,571
But it's hard to believe that she's just a young girl with her stage manners.

16
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,090
However, we could see her fresh charms befitting her age on various variety shows.

My next song was titled "Sara."

30
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,114
But fellow celebrities and managers would say...

31
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,970
"Buy us food" or "What are you buying?" (Buy sounds like Sara)

32
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,171
I want to buy so don't tease me.

I'm singing my song but that hurt my feelings.

I finished my first album and preparing a special album.

35
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,570
I'm really scared since I'm going to another country to work on it.

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,020

I don't know if it'll work but it should, right?

50

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:07,000
With another song after a strong debut, we could see another charm to it.

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,890
She prepared her foray into Japan as she debuted in Korea.

59
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,340

She's the first K-pop artist to perfrom in Indonesia.

158
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,200
She's still popular in Japan as Asia's star.

159
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,428
Many great artists around the world made offers to this No. 1 Korean female artist.

160
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,900
They're good-looking!

161
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,570
BoA introduces the members.

162
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,460
He's Brian the mischievous one.

163
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,920
- I think he was joking. - It was a joke.

164
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,320
That was strong.

165
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,750
But you can tell how mischievous he is in the next few clips.

166
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:53,114
She's memorizing the lyrics before the actual recording.

167
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,980
She recorded first with Shane the lead vocalist.

168
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,628
They recorded without prior practice but seem satisfied with the harmony.

169
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,310
She's not intimidated at all.

170
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:28,857
She worked well with Mark but now they even play around.

["Flying Without Wings" will be included in both BoA and Westlife's album]

Look at how mischievous Brian is.

173

He livens up the mood on the spot with various things.

174
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,114
BoA finished her recording and we met with Westlife.

175
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,570
I was worried while recording.

176
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,971
It was hard since it was my first time recording with foreigners.

177
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:04,514
They played around and made me feel relaxed so the recording went well.

178
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,600
They even played pool and were sad when they had to part.

179
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,114
They were sad when they parted because they became close.

180
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,200
"Atlantis Princess" is the title track of her 3rd album released in 2003.

181
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:56,485
The fairytale-like lyrics and her uniquely soft voice stood out.

She released her 4th album a year later. A colorful rhythm stands out in "My Name."

185
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,171
It's an urban dance genre and we can see how see grew in a year.

A flashy performance as good as her exceptional singing.

191
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,380
It's the greatest charm and strength of BoA's dance songs.

192
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,457
Another charm of BoA's songs shined in ballads as well.

193
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,430
Let's rank BoA's special ballads.

Feel the beauty of sentimental ballad by the young BoA with "I'm Sorry."

196
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:23,371
BoA's "Mayday! Mayday!" means "I cry out desperately to touch you."

197
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,310
"My Prayer" is a song like a desperate prayer.

198

A special meeting between BoA and Kim Dong-ryool's ballad "Stand By."

BoA turned 20 in 2005 and released an intense new song.

203
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,540
"Girls on Top" is the title track of her 5th album.

204
00:53:53,540 --> 00:54:01,085
She made a great impact with this song that cries out against male chauvinism.

205
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:06,114
The move where she sings on top of a male dancer drew attention.

206

[Like the title, it cries out against male chauvinism and bias]

[A unique move in singing on top of a male dancer attracted attention]

210

After her 5th album, she focuses on her activities in Japan and the US.

211

She released her 6th Japanese album in 2008.

[After Ayumi Hamasaki, she took 2nd out of all the artists in Japan]

214
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,560
This is how she strengthens her position in Japan.

215
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:40,342
But she doesn't stop here and attempts a bigger stage in 2008.

She makes her Korean comeback in 2010 after such a passionate attempt in 5 years.

223
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:12,810
"Hurricane Venus" is the title track of her 6th album.

224

Maybe it's because I'm back home but it feels warm.

- I want her to sing that... - How will you get the beats?

256

It's because you won't be singing only rhythmical songs, right?

BoA is pretty but why did she look prettier on this show?

273

Maybe because it's SBS?

01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,560
[Secret weapon featuring BoA]

312
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:14,560
Her eyes and talent for discovering raw talent and polishing them shined.

313
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,600
Hi, I'm BoA, a judge on KPOP STAR.

314
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:24,942
She received a special award at the 2012 SBS Entertainment Awards.

315
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:31,142
2012 is also an important year where she grows as a musician.

316
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:42,514
She presents "Only One" in 2012 for her 7th album.

317
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:46,460
A song she wrote became the title track for the first time since her debut.

318
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:49,790
This confirmed her talent as a musician.

319
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,130
[It's a midtempo R&B with heavy drumbeat, sweet piano melody, and grand orchestra]

320
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:43,110
[It contains the sad heart of a lover before breaking up]

321
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:48,060
[BoA's captivating voice shined]

322
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:53,060
[She wanted an acoustic song with less computerized sound]

323
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:58,130
[A song she wrote became the title track for the first time since her debut]

324
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,400
This is a lyrical hip-hop where the lyrics are expressed with dance.

325
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,885
The performance was memorable like a scene from a musical.

326
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:27,680
Her labelmates participated as well.

327
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,340
SM Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

328
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,700
What is that?

329
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:10,085
Her dance partners got together for a performance battle.

330
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,130
[A representative from TVXQ, Super Junior, and SHINee]

331
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:18,542
I was chosen first as BoA's dance partner for "Only One."

332
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:22,210
Then it was Eunhyuk and Taemin.

333
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:25,460
They're BoA's dance partner.

334
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:32,270
[Yunho, Eunhyuk, and Taemin were BoA's dance partner!]

335
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,750
For example, I did it today and Eunhyuk did it tomorrow.

336
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,290
I got nervous because we took turns.

337
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,885
We didn't see each other until the rehearsal.

338
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:50,500
We just told each other to do our part and do well.

339
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,420
He'll say, "You always do well."

340
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:59,885
On the day of the performance, we're busy changing clothes.

341
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,080
Taemin and I will get ready and be like this near the stage when it's Yunho's turn.

342
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:12,380
I feel this energy as I go up the stage.

343
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,020
I'm determined before I begin.

344
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:22,020
I cast a spell on myself to live up to the expectations.

345
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:26,020
"I'm sorry but I'm the best." I say that for that moment.

346
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,850
That's right! You need that!

347
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:31,760
Eunhyuk looks at me after I'm done.

348
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,720
"Your expression was very good."

349
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,320
Then Taemin will say, "They liked it."

350
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,220
You evaluate each other.

351
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,790
We evaluate each other but I thought, "What's going on?"

352
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,070
Luckily for me, I went first.

353
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,420
I did a lot of research while monitoring him.

354
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,530
What feel to give?

355
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,970
Yes, but what can I do to stand out?

356
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:59,970
I wanted to get a good evaluation since people write comments.

357
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,760
I watched Yunho's performance and his expression is really good.

358
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,430
He takes control and goes in.

359
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:11,000
All he needs to do is just walk in and dance but he doesn't do that.

360
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,960
He does that...

361
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,610
and starts acting!

362
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,720
Do that again!

363
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,540
Start!

364
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,390
Since he touches his lips as he comes in, he has this overwhelming charisma.

365
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,820
You can do that too.

366
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,160
I can't do those things.

367
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:36,160
I watched Taemin's performance and it's like a beautiful picture.

368
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:42,700
- Stimulates maternal instinct. - He has this charm I don't have.

369
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,700
It was hard for me to deal with her seniority and overcome that wall.

370
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:53,670
I thought I need to get close first and talked a lot during practice.

371
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:57,670
I couldn't get into the emotion during practice.

372
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:03,685
I thought about what I should do and during the camera rehearsal...

373
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,690
I thought, "Forget this," and was very assertive.

374
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:11,340
Wasn't there physical contact?

375
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:17,771
The manager and staff said it was good because I did it with confidence.

376
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,830
Even BoA liked it.

377
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:23,330
[I like assertive young men]

378
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:26,800
What about you, Eunhyuk?

379
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,690
It was awkward.

380
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:33,890
It wasn't about dancing as time went by.

381
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:39,314
I wanted to make news according to how intense the physical contact is.

382
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:40,900
Of course!

383
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:50,200
Yunho danced with his face almost touching her face.

384
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:56,628
The first move is putting hands together.

385
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,990
But Taemin didn't do that and stroked her head.

386
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,750
He's younger than her...

387
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,850
He was stroking her head.

388
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:13,720
So I was thinking what to do.

389
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:21,257
I decided on a kissing performance for the last performance of Inkigayo.

390
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:25,470
There would be no issue greater than this.

391
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,400
I told BoA that I'll go for it.

392
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:33,040
Go where?

393
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,330
BoA said to do it if I can.

394
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,420
So I went.

395
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,740
I approached her.

396
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,140
- Anchovy approaches. - I approached...

397
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:50,200
I didn't know but her headset's mike was right in front of her mouth.

398
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:55,714
I couldn't draw close to her lips but I was really nervous.

399
01:21:55,910 --> 01:22:01,114
I tried but it was awkward.

400
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,260
[Let's check it out!]

401
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,657
They each put on a great performance because of such competition.

402
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,130
You sure grew up.

403
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:17,910
BoA just had her 10th anniversary.

404
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:21,910
She did grow up and grow up well she did.

405
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:26,110
What did she think she will be in 10 years?

406
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:29,910
What do you think you'll be doing in 10 years?

407
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,820
- In 10 years? - Yes.

408
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:39,200
Well... I'll know when that time comes but I want to be a good wife and wise mother.

409
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:43,240
- No one will believe me but... - You do look like it.

410
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,180
Really?

411
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:49,350
I think I'll have a beautiful family.

412
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:55,685
I also want to learn composition so I might be doing that.

413
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:59,100
- How old are you? - I'm 14.

414
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,240
Then you'll be 24 in 10 years. You want to get married early?

415
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:07,810
I'm only 24 in 10 years.

416
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:09,100
That's right.

417
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,910
Seems like you forget your age at times.

418
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,470
Do you currently have a boyfriend?

419
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:19,020
Me? I really want one.

420
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,070
She wants one.

421
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,900
- There's a present I want. - We're not objects.

422
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,900
She could say that since it's her birthday.

423
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:36,000
But people tell me that he'll appear when the time comes.

424
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,340
I lived like that for 28 years.

425
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,950
When did you last date?

426
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,760
- About 2 years ago. - 2 years ago?

427
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,970
Did it end well?

428
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:52,390
Yes, you know how it is.

429
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:56,570
It's him! It's "only one."

430
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,810
Don't connect it like that.

431
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:02,520
This is when you're really vicious.

432
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,520
You'll be meeting someone in the future but who's your current ideal man?

433
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:10,240
That's right. I think many want to know.

434
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:16,285
I don't have an ideal man. If he just likes me then...

435
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:20,630
10 years passed but she's still single.

436
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:28,244
She's very simple and wants a man who likes her. Will she meet her soulmate?

437
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:33,010
She held her first exclusive concert in 2013.

438
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:36,270
It was a time to look back on her best performances.

439
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:39,950
She presented a concert befitting her name.

440
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:45,742
Let's look forward to her stage she'll create in 15-20 years.
