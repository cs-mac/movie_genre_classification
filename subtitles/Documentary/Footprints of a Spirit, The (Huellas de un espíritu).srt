1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,400
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT

2
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
Saturday the 6th of January, 1917,

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
five condemned soldiers
were escorted to Bouchavesnes

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
at the Front in the Somme.

5
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Watch out for the wire!

6
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,800
The first,
once cheerful and adventurous,

7
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,700
wore the tag number 2124.
He was drafted from the Seine area.

8
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,700
On his feet were boots,
taken from a dead German.

9
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,500
Before becoming 2124,
he was known as Bastoche

10
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
and was hooked on a pretty redhead,

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
a certain Véronique Passavant.

12
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
He was a carpenter.

13
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,600
Taking a break from his woodwork,
they'd go for a beer

14
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
at Little Louis' bar,
in Golden Hand St.

15
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,400
He'd taken his boots from an enemy
who no longer needed them.

16
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,500
Stuffed with straw or newspaper,

17
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
they replaced his old clodhoppers.

18
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,000
He was court-martialed
for self-mutilation.

19
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Gunpowder had been found
on his wounded hand.

20
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
He faced the death sentence.

21
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,200
Watch out for the wire!

22
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
The second soldier
was tag number 4077,

23
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
also from near the Seine.

24
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,800
He was a welder
for the State Railways, in Bagneux.

25
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
His name was Francis Gaignard,

26
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,300
nicknamed Six-Sous.

27
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,600
He knew the poor build the canons
of their own destruction,

28
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,900
but it's the rich who sell them.

29
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
He tried to explain it to the troops,

30
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,800
but he wasn't a good speaker.

31
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
And cheap wine,
poverty's best friend,

32
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
deadened the soldiers' eyes,

33
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,300
making it difficult
to get through to them.

34
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,900
Number 1818 was surely the bravest
and the toughest of them all.

35
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,800
He had once
killed a fellow officer...

36
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
an officer who kicked the dead.

37
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,600
Get up!

38
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
You swines!

39
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
You lazy cowards!

40
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
You! Get up!

41
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
Attack! Attack!

42
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
You! Get going!

43
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
No one ever found out.

44
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer
from Dordogne.

45
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,400
One August morning,

46
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,900
they came to get him at his farm

47
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
and sent him off on a train.

48
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
Watch out for the wire!

49
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,900
The telephone wire is the only link
to the land of the living.

50
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,900
A flimsy wire, their only chance
for President Poincaré's pardon.

51
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Even if the only one
to still believe in it

52
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,200
is him.
Number 7328, recruited in Corsica.

53
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Angel Bassignano.

54
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,100
According to all who'd known him,

55
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,700
he was no angel at all.

56
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,600
He was a liar, a cheat, a show-off,

57
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,800
a sneak and a troublemaker.

58
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Before all this,

59
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,800
Tina Lombardi worked as his whore.

60
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,200
He'd received a 5-year sentence for
an affair of either love or honour,

61
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,300
depending on who he was talking to.

62
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,100
It was, in fact, a conflict
between village pimps.

63
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,200
Summer 1916,
common-law criminals were enlisted

64
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
to beef up regiments
melted in the fires at Verdun.

65
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,000
They gave him the choice.

66
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
It's been shitting shells
round here!

67
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,700
No, it's been rather quiet.

68
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Who are those for?

69
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, actually...
you'll be attacking tomorrow.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,500
We're getting a head start.

71
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
Watch out for the wire!

72
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,700
The fifth was a "Cornflower",
the nickname for the class of '17.

73
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
He was five months shy of 20.

74
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
These days, everything scared him.

75
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,200
French canons short-firing,

76
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,700
the wind that heralded
the mustard gas attacks,

77
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,000
executions to set an example.

78
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
He hadn't been like that before,

79
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,000
quite the opposite,

80
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,100
braving storms as he helped
lighthouse keepers.

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,400
And then came one shell too many.

82
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,800
There you go... The winning ticket
back to your fiancée.

83
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
The ticket for a court-martial.

84
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,000
Turn a blind eye, Sarge.
He's been through enough.

85
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,400
They could execute him.

86
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,300
- Be human for once.
- Shut up!

87
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Please, Sarge!

88
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,600
Shut up!

89
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
The first time
Mathilde and Manech made love,

90
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
he fell asleep,
his hand on her breast.

91
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,100
Each time his wound throbs,

92
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Manech feels Mathilde's heart
in his palm.

93
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,700
Each beat brings her closer to him.

94
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,900
If Manech were dead,
Mathilde would know.

95
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,200
Since the death notice,

96
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,400
she stubbornly holds on to her
intuition, like to a flimsy wire.

97
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
She never gets discouraged.

98
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
And Mathilde
is of a cheerful disposition.

99
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,700
If that wire doesn't lead her
to her lover, never mind...

100
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,200
she can always use it as a noose.

101
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,200
In June 1920, Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

102
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
A patient at the Rennes hospital
wants to see her.

103
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,000
He'd met Manech in January '17
at the Front in the Somme.

104
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
August 1912.

105
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Handsome, wasn't I?

106
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
It's a De Dion,

107
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,000
with direct drive.

108
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Please, tell me about Manech.

109
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
In January '17,

110
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
I escorted five condemned soldiers.

111
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
He was one of them...

112
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes.

113
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,800
I was to take them
to a front-line trench.

114
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Gendarmes were waiting
with the prisoners

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
near a bombed-out cemetery.

116
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,200
What are you doing
with those German boots?

117
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,300
Waiting.

118
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,600
What for?

119
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Poincaré's pardon? You'll wait!

120
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,700
He'll sign it!

121
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,300
I shouldn't
even have been condemned.

122
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm Corsican, not French!

123
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Leave him be.

124
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,400
He's lost it,
but that's for the best.

125
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Finished, Lieutenant?

126
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,400
The cold has saved that one.

127
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,000
Gangrene would've got him
in summer.

128
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
And Manech?

129
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Was he in pain?

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,100
They had to cut off two fingers,

131
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,000
but he wasn't suffering anymore.

132
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
I led them to a trench,

133
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,900
called "Bingo Crépuscule".

134
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Bloody hell!

135
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Couldn't you have lost them
on your way?

136
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,900
A kick in the ass
to get rid of them!

137
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,000
My orders
are to bring you these five.

138
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,700
And I'll tell you my orders!

139
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm to throw these guys over the top

140
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
and leave them to die like dogs

141
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,200
between our line and the Jerries'!

142
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,800
Those are my damned orders,
Sergeant!

143
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,200
You see, Sergeant, with the Jerries,

144
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
It's a little too calm?
Let's start the fireworks

145
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,700
and watch all hell let loose!

146
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,800
Soup, guys!
You're lucky, it's still warm.

147
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Beetroot and fennel.

148
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,300
What can I get for you?

149
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,700
A large hot chocolate
and some bread with honey.

150
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,600
I'd kill my parents to get you that!

151
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

152
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,000
He's an orphan!

153
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,000
He'll get it. Célestin Poux
is the "Mess Hall Marauder",

154
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,200
the "Kitchen Raider".

155
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,700
Fifteen minutes later,
he came back with it all.

156
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,600
Salted Guérande butter,

157
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,300
lavender honey,

158
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,600
and...

159
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,100
cocoa from Nigeria!

160
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,200
Grand...

161
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,200
Tell me, Cornflower,

162
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,600
you've no one to write to?
A fiancée?

163
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Mathilde.

164
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Her name is Mathilde.

165
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,200
I hear her heart beating,
like Morse code.

166
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
We're engaged.

167
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,400
Luckily, we won't have to wait
till the end of the war.

168
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,300
Now I can go straight home
after the execution.

169
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,100
Should I spare you the rest?

170
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm lame, not dim.

171
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,000
What happened?

172
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We opened the barbed wire

173
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,600
and equipped the five
against the cold.

174
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,800
Célestin Poux gave up a red woolen
glove to protect your fiancé's hand.

175
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Are they far?

176
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Too far for grenades,
too near for artillery.

177
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,500
Gas is out of the question.
The gasser always gets it!

178
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Think they'll make it?

179
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,500
If they're not blown to bits,
they'll starve and freeze.

180
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,300
Either way, it'll amuse the Jerries.

181
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,100
A Corporal gave Bastoche,
the carpenter, a hug.

182
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
It was Corporal Gordes.

183
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,800
They clearly knew each other
before the war.

184
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,500
And then,

185
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
over they went.

186
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,400
- Shit...
- Shut up.

187
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,700
- Shit!
- Shut up!

188
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
September '14.

189
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
150 pound weight, easy!

190
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,000
And I wasn't at my best!

191
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,800
But that morning,

192
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,100
in January '17,
was Manech still alive?

193
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,200
At dawn,
Favart called out their names.

194
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,200
Apart from the Dordogne farmer,
they all replied.

195
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,600
Bassignano!

196
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,700
Sir!

197
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
Bouquet!

198
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,300
What now?

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Langonnet!

200
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah, still here!

201
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
The Cornflower,
hide yourself better.

202
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
Notre Dame!

203
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
That's all I know.

204
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,800
I wrote up my report
with a heavy heart.

205
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,600
About time, Esperanza! The Brits
are replacing us, we're off.

206
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
So, Bingo-thingy?

207
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
What's that?

208
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,600
The condemned prisoners' list,
signed by Capt. Favourier.

209
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,100
Give it to me.

210
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,300
Don't just stand there like that.
This isn't Pompeii!

211
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,600
You've been promoted.
You're off to the Vosges.

212
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,200
Even so, Sir,

213
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,300
this expedition is going to be
hard to swallow.

214
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Lucky you.

215
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,400
Where you're going, there's
mustard gas and throat lozenges.

216
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
The famous Vosges sweets.

217
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,100
Dismissed!

218
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,500
A few months later,
I was wounded, in the Somme.

219
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
I ended up in the same ambulance
as Chardolot,

220
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,000
a corporal from Bingo Crépuscule.

221
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,400
But he only had
a few days left to live.

222
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,800
It's me. Esperanza.

223
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,900
Bingo Crépuscule, remember?

224
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Sorry, I don't recognize you.

225
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,400
The five thrown over
into no-man's-land,

226
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,600
what happened to them?

227
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,000
What do you think?

228
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,600
No one made it.

229
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,900
Your conscience bothering you,
Esperanza?

230
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
You should've stuck around.

231
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,900
You'd have seen capital Ms,

232
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,300
underwear being waved
and a flying albatross.

233
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
You're delirious with fever!

234
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,200
We sent over five men
and recovered five stiffs.

235
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Conclusion...

236
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,100
My eyes are gone but I can imagine
your expression and I like it.

237
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,100
He really spoke of capital Ms
and an albatross?

238
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,200
And underwear.

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
Here you go, Miss.

240
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,200
In here

241
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,600
are the prisoners' belongings
I was to return to their families.

242
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
My health's prevented it.

243
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,000
That's the letter
the Dordogne farmer, Notre Dame,

244
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,800
wrote to his wife.

245
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,900
I sent the original
just after Bingo.

246
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
You're here
because of the mustard gas?

247
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,600
Not even. Damned Spanish flu!

248
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Death moves in mysterious ways.

249
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
If you can't cry, try talking.

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,700
If you can't talk, say nothing.

251
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,000
But sometimes,
talking can bring on the tears.

252
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Tears say what you can't say,

253
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
if you get my drift?

254
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Otherwise,
you can just keep that sour-face!

255
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,800
Little Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

256
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,900
Shame she won't talk to me.

257
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

258
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,200
Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.

259
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,900
"Benoît Notre Dame, number 1818.
I won't be writing for a long time."

260
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

261
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,400
His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.

262
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,800
Tell my Baptistin that I so love

263
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,900
that he'll be fine
if he listens to his dear mother.

264
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,600
She's the kindest person I know.
Love you. Benoît.

265
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,100
"For Tina Lombardi,
from Angel Bassignano."

266
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,200
If Chickpea comes in before
dinner's called, Manech is alive.

267
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm not hungry.

268
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,200
Dinner's ready.

269
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,400
Mathilde, dinner!

270
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,100
Coming!

271
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,100
Mathilde was born
the 1 st of January, 1900.

272
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,600
It's easy for calculating her age.

273
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,800
In 1903, her parents died
in the n 44 bus accident.

274
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,700
Since then,

275
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Mathilde often says to herself,

276
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,500
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."

277
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,900
Her uncle and aunt,

278
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Sylvain and Bénédicte,
have raised her,

279
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,500
with her parents' life insurance
invested by Pierre-Marie Rouvière.

280
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,800
When she was five,
Mathilde came down with polio.

281
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
She was bedridden for months,

282
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,400
despite mustard compresses...

283
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,300
pendulums

284
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,200
and four-leaf clover infusions.

285
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,600
Today, Mathilde is twenty.

286
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,200
She plays the tuba.

287
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,200
It is the only instrument capable
of imitating a distress call.

288
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,000
Chickpea, the dog,
farts in his sleep.

289
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,600
When she hears it,
Bénédicte never fails to say,

290
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,500
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart.

291
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,200
Mathilde needs daily treatment.

292
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Since the Armistice, Georges Cornu,
a swimming champion,

293
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,500
massages her.

294
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,800
She used to get embarrassed,
but she got over it.

295
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Mathilde sometimes imagines
that Georges admires her,

296
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,900
tormented with desire.

297
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,100
What's more, he once said,

298
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
You do have a fine figure, Miss.

299
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,100
And I've kneaded quite a few.

300
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,400
After that,
how should she call him?

301
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Dear Georges...

302
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,600
My dear Georges...

303
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Jojo...

304
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,100
Sometimes,
before falling asleep,

305
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,400
she imagines herself
in arousing situations.

306
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,100
Mathilde doesn't need
to fantasize for very long

307
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,400
before reaching fulfilment.

308
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,500
Since his disappearance,

309
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,500
she can't bear to think about her
fiancé as she satisfies herself.

310
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
That's the way it is...

311
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,500
If I were you, Mathilde,
I'd forget him.

312
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,800
Why chase pipe dreams?

313
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,300
If he was alive,
you'd have heard from him.

314
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,100
He was taken prisoner.

315
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,800
And stayed with a German girl
with braids and big boobs!

316
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,600
A Breton boy eating sauerkraut!

317
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Lmpossible!

318
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,300
- Can I help?
- Keep your feet on the ground.

319
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,100
I stand on my own two feet!

320
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
- What?
- Never mind.

321
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,100
I heard you anyway.

322
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,700
But your dreams don't stand up.

323
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Manech
can't have been taken at Bingo.

324
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,200
Our men took the trench facing it.

325
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
Normally, it's the winners

326
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
who take prisoners.

327
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,100
So he's lost his mind.

328
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,300
Or he's in hiding,
to avoid hard labour.

329
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,800
Stop dreaming, Mathilde!

330
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Face up to it.

331
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,400
You'll find a husband, despite...

332
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Something's off-key.

333
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,400
I'll find the "Mess Hall Marauder",
Célestin Poux.

334
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,200
What can I get for you?

335
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,900
Or the Corsican's whore.
She might know more than me.

336
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Tomorrow, I go to Paris.

337
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,900
What for?

338
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,300
To find a survivor
from Bingo Crépuscule.

339
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,400
Germain Pire, Private Detective
The Peerless Pry

340
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm used to handling
red-hot affairs.

341
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
I've a cupboard full.

342
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Scandals that would've been
brushed under the carpet...

343
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,900
brought to light by Pire's prying.

344
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,200
Take this big affair...

345
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
very delicate.

346
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,200
In '17, a train derails.
425 soldiers on leave, dead.

347
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,300
The enquiry reveals how
an officer ordered the departure,

348
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,000
despite faulty brakes.

349
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,300
A total cover-up
by Poincaré's government.

350
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,600
The victims' families only hope
of finding the officer?

351
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Germain Pire!

352
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,100
The Peerless Pry.

353
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,200
Peerless, Miss.
I found their officer,

354
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,900
to the military's great displeasure.

355
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,800
Granted, he was dead and buried.

356
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,600
I'll just pack my bags and be on
my way to track down Poux Célestin

357
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,200
and the Corsican's fiancée.

358
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,400
And your fees, Mr. Peerless Pry?

359
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,800
The Pry only bleeds dry
sitting ducks, Miss.

360
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,700
For you, I can do...

361
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
20 francs a day.

362
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,300
Plus expenses, of course.

363
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,000
Why so kind?

364
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,400
Hélène, come and say hello.

365
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Don't worry about expenses.
Germain Pire eats little,

366
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
doesn't drink and tips sparingly.

367
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Notre Dame de Paris?

368
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
Not Notre Dame de Paris!

369
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,100
I'm calling from Paris
about Notre Dame Benoît!

370
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,900
Benoît Notre Dame!

371
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,700
A strapping,
good-hearted farmer.

372
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,700
Died for his country.

373
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,000
I've lost many a parishioner.

374
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,100
Are his wife and Baptistin
still there?

375
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,200
Quiet!
Miss Minet, I can't hear a thing!

376
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,300
No. She upped and left one day,
with no forwarding address.

377
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,600
Is that a choir I hear?

378
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,400
Of course, it's a choir!
We are in a church, Miss!

379
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
But that's no hymn at your end!

380
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Thank you, Father. Goodbye.

381
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,200
Bingo Crépuscule!

382
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,700
I can't make head nor tail of it!

383
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
I thought you liked defending
lost causes.

384
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Your impertinence
was charming at 10, not at 20!

385
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Then start taking me seriously.

386
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,700
You're wasting your money
on a grotesque crusade!

387
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,000
Bingo Crépuscule!
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

388
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,900
I want access to army archives.

389
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,700
Let's say
there's an ounce of truth in this.

390
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
If one man has survived,
he risks hard labour!

391
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,900
And you know it!

392
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Your prying would put him
in great danger!

393
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,400
Be reasonable.

394
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,900
Your parents entrusted me...

395
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,300
"Ashes to ashes..."

396
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,100
That's just it.

397
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,300
They entrusted you
with my happiness.

398
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Goodbye.

399
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,800
Thank you, Pierre-Marie.

400
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,800
Don't be like that,
my dear Mathilde.

401
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm thinking of your future.

402
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Sorry to see your health's worsened,
despite the massages.

403
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll see what I can do.

404
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
It doesn't only happen in Lourdes!

405
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,500
I'm looking for Tina Lombardi.
I knew her when she was little...

406
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,200
Ladies, I'm Tina Lombardi's uncle

407
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,500
and I'd like to know...

408
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,800
Excuse me...

409
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,200
I look after
the Lombardi family's interests

410
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,900
and I'm looking for Tina.

411
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,000
She's come into some money.

412
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,800
You're the one
looking for Tina Lombardi?

413
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,500
Well, actually...

414
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,800
Ever been to Corsica?

415
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,100
Very pretty, very picturesque.

416
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
But Tina's walking the street

417
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,600
somewhere else.

418
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,700
Luckily,
a highly-placed member of the Police

419
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
picked up her trail in Bar-Le-Duc.

420
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,600
Valentina Emilia Maria Lombardi,
aka Tina,

421
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,100
was registered in 1916

422
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,900
near the 23rd regiment's camp
of Marseilles.

423
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,500
Since the Armistice,
the chick has flown the coop!

424
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
I've lost her trail,
but I've been busy.

425
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,500
She's disappeared into thin air.

426
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
So, you're giving up.

427
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,800
Not at all.

428
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,900
Pire never admits defeat.
Pire is stubborn.

429
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,200
Pire's peer doesn't exist.

430
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,200
Perfect! Thank you.

431
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
Just a little bit.

432
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,300
Not my eyes.

433
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,200
Careful with that!

434
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
What can I get you?

435
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
This is my fiancé.

436
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,100
And him,

437
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,500
the carpenter...

438
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
I think you know him.

439
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
My throat's dry.

440
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,600
- "Good glass of wine..."
- "Keeps the doctor in line."

441
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,100
My great-aunt's motto.

442
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,800
Died in 1911 in Besancon,
she was 99.

443
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,700
Never sick a day...

444
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Good luck.

445
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,400
Touch wood.

446
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
The war?

447
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,900
A hyena in the Botanical Gardens.

448
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I was showing off, stroking it.

449
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,400
Bastoche and Biscuit made this.

450
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,200
Biscuit?

451
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,900
His best friend. They met in 1910

452
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,100
during the floods,
saving a lady's life.

453
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,200
Bastoche was talented

454
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
but Biscuit... a genius.

455
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
A magician with a chisel!

456
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,400
He pegged all the articulations.

457
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,500
This is for you.

458
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
"Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

459
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,200
"Shame she won't talk to me.

460
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,900
"Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

461
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,300
"Adieu, my friend. Bastoche."

462
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,700
To patch things up means
they'd argued. You know why?

463
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,100
A mystery.

464
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,200
They went through hell together,

465
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,400
the Marne, the Woëvre, the Somme...

466
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,500
Then one day, and who knows why,
they stopped talking.

467
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
Biscuit was transferred.

468
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,100
He died
in a military hospital bombing.

469
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm glad they finally
patched things up.

470
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,900
They won't be queuing up outside,
today.

471
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,300
Pour me one?

472
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,300
She's thirsty!

473
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,900
A wooden hand, a heart of gold.

474
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,700
To love.

475
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
True love!

476
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,700
But who was Véro?

477
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,300
Véronique Passavant.
His regular, his woman.

478
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
They often came in together.

479
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Why would they have argued?

480
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,500
He may have strayed
and she wouldn't forgive him.

481
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,800
There you go. '17, this way.

482
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,800
What exactly are the red files?

483
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,200
Secret defence.

484
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
You need a mandate
from someone high up.

485
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,900
Of course, they're upstairs!

486
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,300
Go and help him.

487
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,100
Let's say
you were someone high up...

488
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,900
then you could give us the mandate.

489
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,100
If I thought like that,
I wouldn't be an officer.

490
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Consider yourself lucky
you've been allowed in.

491
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,300
It usually takes months.

492
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
It looks tidy
but it's really a mess.

493
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,100
So, the Somme...

494
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,400
The Bouchavesnes sector,
trench 108.

495
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,900
What a state...

496
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,100
Look at this. Appalling!

497
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,900
May I help?

498
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Thank you for replying favourably
to the General...

499
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,300
We're very good friends.

500
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Bouchavesnes...
two friends of mine died there.

501
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,400
Dreadful,
the battles in that trench...

502
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,500
Paris wasn't much better.

503
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,000
Couldn't even find a taxi
after the opera.

504
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,500
So I heard!

505
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
We'd like information on trench 108.

506
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,100
Posting slips, trenches 104, 105.

507
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,700
Trench 107. Where's 106?

508
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,800
Trench 108.

509
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,800
How annoying,
it's written on both sides!

510
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,800
Trench 108.

511
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,600
"Dug by the Germans,
taken by us in 1916 and renamed

512
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
"Bingo Crépuscule."
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

513
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,900
"January 6th, nothing to report.

514
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,000
"The 7th, heavy combat with losses.

515
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
"Killed in action:
Capt. Favourier, history teacher.

516
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
"Lt Benoît Estrangin,
insurance agent.

517
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,100
"Corporal..."

518
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,400
Strange.

519
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,800
Certain losses
are filed confidential.

520
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,400
Confidential? You mean...

521
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,200
Sorry.

522
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Can't you...

523
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Sorry, we can't look any further.

524
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Not even the General.

525
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,400
Please.

526
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Thank you for the time you've taken.

527
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,700
You're welcome.

528
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,700
Nothing here of interest.
Posting slips, commissary bills.

529
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,000
The routine.

530
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,800
I assumed as much.

531
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,600
It was to be expected.

532
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,000
You've gone too far!

533
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,300
I do hope this paper
wasn't filed secret defence!

534
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,600
You must tell me if it's important.

535
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,200
It's nothing.

536
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,400
Just a leave.

537
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,200
From the President?

538
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
That's right.

539
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
President Poincaré
sometimes granted a leave

540
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
to a deserving soldier.

541
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,400
End of story!

542
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,300
I'll see you out.

543
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,100
Corporal Bouquet Kléber...

544
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,400
Corporal Gaignard Francis...

545
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,300
Private Notre Dame Benoît...

546
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
Private Bassignano Angel...

547
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,400
Private Langonnet Manech...

548
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,900
For self-mutilation,
you are sentenced to death.

549
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,800
Lf, before the count of 7,
the train hasn't entered the tunnel,

550
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,100
or the ticket inspector hasn't come,

551
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,800
Manech is dead!

552
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,200
1, 2, 3,

553
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,400
4, 5, 6...

554
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
Ticket, please!

555
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,100
April fool!

556
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,800
When the newspaper strike is over,
we can place your ad.

557
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,100
"Reward for information concerning
Bingo Crépuscule."

558
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,000
Encouraging her
won't bring back her appetite.

559
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,700
Take her to the Quimper Fair.

560
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,300
What for?

561
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,800
A change of scenery.

562
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,400
You might meet a nice boy.

563
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,900
What for?

564
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,600
To get married and have children.
Tell her!

565
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,300
Can you pour me one?

566
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,400
You drink now?

567
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,100
"Glass of wine
keeps the doctor in line."

568
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,900
Where's that from?

569
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,300
Dead-Hand barman
with a wooden hand.

570
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,900
His aunt's motto. Died at a hundred,
in Besancon, 1911.

571
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,400
Repeat that?

572
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
In Besancon, in 1911,

573
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,400
a 99 year-old lady left behind
a wooden-handed nephew,

574
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,400
owner of the Dead-Hand bar,
in Golden Hand St,

575
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,100
to whom she often said
what Sylvain just asked me.

576
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,600
She's already drunk!

577
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,200
Look!

578
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,100
An albatross is stubborn.

579
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,500
He knows he can outlast the wind.

580
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,100
Hey, my gravel!

581
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,700
My gravel!

582
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,800
Véronique Passavant,
17th of July, 1920.

583
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,600
I'm writing from Little Louis' bar.
He told me about you.

584
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,100
I must tell you about an encounter

585
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,600
which left me quite shaken up.

586
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,100
I headed for Bastoche's workshop.
I was feeling down.

587
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,400
I want to talk to Bastoche.

588
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,300
Bastoche?

589
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,400
He died. At the Front in the Somme.
Didn't you know?

590
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,100
I know something else.

591
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
What?

592
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,500
From the hospital,
where I care for dying syphilitics,

593
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,700
a patient sends you this.

594
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,600
If you don't want to die, covered
with oozing sores, answer me!

595
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,000
The comrade hiding
with your Bastoche...

596
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,400
Tell me...

597
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,400
tell me he's Corsican.

598
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,600
I was already traumatized by nuns
when I was little!

599
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,600
Tina Lombardi
knows something we don't.

600
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,900
What?

601
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,500
The Lombardi girl...

602
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,200
she knows something we don't.

603
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,700
That would prove
Bastoche had escaped.

604
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,300
With another condemned prisoner.

605
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,400
That hussy obviously thinks
it's her Angel.

606
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,400
But if Bastoche had escaped,
he'd have looked out for Manech.

607
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,900
If he escaped...

608
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,000
Give me that.

609
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,300
With "ifs",
a flea could carry an elephant.

610
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,700
Maybe.

611
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,400
But without "ifs",
might as well hang myself.

612
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,900
Thanks to you, I spend my time
picking gravel out of the lawn!

613
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,600
When I see gravel, I make it a point
of arriving in style.

614
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,700
For the Miss.

615
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,900
Leprince Hardware,
Paris, 25th of July, 1920.

616
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,300
Sunday lends itself to writing.
I'm replying regarding

617
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,200
Célestin Poux and other survivors
from Bingo Crépuscule.

618
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,100
I knew the fellow.
The smartest thief I ever met.

619
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,800
Thanks to him,
I never went without!

620
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,200
Olivier Nergeton,
Animated Toys.

621
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,200
Célestin Poux was our salvation,

622
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,800
aka the Mess Hall Marauder
or Justa Bit More.

623
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,200
He falsified losses,

624
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,600
making up numbers
to give double rations.

625
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,700
If you should see him,
tell him we'll never forget him.

626
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,000
Etienne Morillon, teacher,
3rd of August, 1920.

627
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,200
He always had us laughing.

628
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,400
He had even trained
the company's mascot for us!

629
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,000
Good morning. What weather!

630
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,700
Germain Pire, private detective.

631
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,500
Mathilde has spoken of you.

632
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,500
Sylvain!

633
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,900
Tell Mathilde to come down.

634
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,200
That Mr. Pry is here to see her.

635
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,900
Poux's been hopping around.

636
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,100
Two days in Dreux,
then Troyes, Castre,

637
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,500
five days in Sète.

638
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,900
It'll take luck and patience
to land him.

639
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,400
Too bad.

640
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,300
Hélène, some savoury biscuits.

641
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,900
Taste them.

642
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,700
Tell me what you think.

643
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,700
The kitchen's more comfortable.

644
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,400
Thank you, Bénédicte.

645
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,600
I'll leave you.

646
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,800
Poux can't stay in one place,
whereas Tina Lombardi...

647
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,800
she's got us running in circles.

648
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,600
I know.
And she's the queen of disguise.

649
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,500
Anything new on Biscuit?

650
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,400
That's Benjamin Gordes.

651
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
The day he won

652
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,300
the Carpentry Prize
for the sixth consecutive year.

653
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,300
That's right.

654
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,800
Biscuit,

655
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,700
Bastoche's best friend,

656
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,600
is none other than Benjamin Gordes.

657
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,000
A soldier from their company

658
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,800
said they were like brothers
before it went sour.

659
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,900
- Why won't you tell me?
- Stop it!

660
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,100
Tell me!

661
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't want to fight you,
so stop it!

662
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
Why won't you talk?

663
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,000
Whose idea was it?

664
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,900
Mine?
No, it was your idea!

665
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,100
Bastard!

666
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,600
It was his idea!

667
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
All because of a woman!

668
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,600
Véronique Passavant
finished with Bastoche in June '16.

669
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,600
And just after, he fought like
a mad dog with Benjamin Gordes.

670
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,800
Don't need to be Pythagoras!

671
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,600
They didn't meet again
before Bingo Crépuscule?

672
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,400
Where it all ended!

673
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,300
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.

674
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,100
Where it all begins...

675
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,200
Tina Lombardi is sure
Bastoche is alive.

676
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,900
What made him different
from the others that evening?

677
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,200
He was the only carpenter?

678
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Something made Bastoche
different from the others.

679
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,500
His German boots!

680
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,700
He was the only one
with German boots!

681
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,600
Of course. You're right!

682
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,200
Tina Lombardi's discovered that
a man with German boots survived!

683
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,700
I bet he was seen with a comrade!

684
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,800
I saw two soldiers
who looked like tramps.

685
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,000
One wore boots taken from a Jerry.

686
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,100
He was holding up the other.

687
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,700
We also know Bastoche had patched
things up with his best friend!

688
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,900
Exactly!

689
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,200
Did it change the course of events
that night?

690
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,100
If I don't break the peel,

691
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,100
Gordes managed to save
Bastoche and Manech.

692
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,100
I'm never going to get that pie
in the oven!

693
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,900
I must go back to Paris.

694
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,500
I must go back to Paris.

695
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,800
Again?
That money's going up in smoke.

696
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,100
"Ashes to ashes..."

697
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,100
Pilot fish!

698
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,400
Excuse me, Elodie Gordes?

699
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,300
Over there, selling carrots.

700
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,200
Thank you.

701
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,400
Never seen him!

702
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
Which one don't you know?

703
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,000
Him, by any chance?

704
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,600
Why did Bastoche and Biscuit argue?
Was it over you?

705
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,800
I have nothing to say!

706
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
- I want to know!
- Leave me alone!

707
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,200
They last met at Bingo Crépuscule.

708
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,000
My fiancé was also there.
With Bastoche.

709
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,600
In that shithole of a trench!

710
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,400
I want to understand.

711
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,600
I want to understand!

712
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,500
It's not what you think.

713
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,700
I can't talk about it.
Give me your address.

714
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,400
My spelling's terrible

715
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,300
but I'll explain it all in a letter.

716
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,400
I promise.

717
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,600
Go ahead! My gravel!

718
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,800
Nothing for me?

719
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,600
What?

720
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,200
Nothing for me?

721
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Just the newspaper.

722
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,500
They talk about everything
except Elodie Gordes.

723
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,600
Very funny!

724
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,900
You should read it,
one can learn things!

725
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,200
Has the President opened an inquest
on Bingo Crépuscule?

726
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,800
He might have done,

727
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,300
if he hadn't fallen from a train
in his pyjamas.

728
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,700
Well, he wears pyjamas!

729
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,400
He wears pyjamas!

730
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,300
We recovered five stiffs.

731
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,100
Conclusion...

732
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,500
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

733
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,700
All for me?

734
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,600
No. Just this one.

735
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,400
If I'm not picking up gravel,
I'm picking up the postman!

736
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,900
The gravel's gone? A fair fight.

737
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,500
Fighting is never fair.

738
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,000
- Can I offer you a short one?
- Won't say no.

739
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,800
Miss, I beg you to keep my secret
to yourself.

740
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,200
When I met my husband,
he already had four children.

741
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,500
None were his.

742
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,100
Out of kindness,
he'd married a widow with TB.

743
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,900
She was Polish, like me.

744
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,300
He adopted her children
before her death.

745
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,300
I was also an unmarried mother.

746
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,900
He then found himself
the father of five,

747
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
though he couldn't have any
of his own.

748
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,400
You're going to run me over!

749
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
We had four years of tenderness.

750
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,500
We had plans.

751
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,300
We dreamt
of seeing the sea together.

752
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,100
Then the war came.

753
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,700
I thought Bastoche
would take care of him,

754
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,200
their being posted together.

755
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,300
But during his leave,
in September, 1915,

756
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,300
just after the battle of Artois,

757
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,700
I knew
nothing would ever be the same.

758
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,000
Over there,
it's all we have to keep going.

759
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,700
Once, in a burning field,
I saw some comrades...

760
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,700
Their cartridge belts
exploded like fireworks.

761
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,500
Once, we even had to use
the body of a friend

762
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,300
as a shield.

763
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,300
There had been something
on his mind.

764
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,100
He came out with it
on the second night.

765
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,000
If I desert, the gendarmes
will come and get me.

766
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,100
My only way out
is to have a sixth child.

767
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,300
If you have six children,
they send you home.

768
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,300
As I said,
he couldn't have children.

769
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,900
I didn't dare think
what was on his mind,

770
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,200
but he just wouldn't let it go.

771
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,700
It's not betrayal if I'm asking you.

772
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,600
Especially if it's with Bastoche.

773
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,400
Don't touch!

774
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,400
The five aren't mine,
so why not a sixth?

775
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,100
You'd have nine months to wait.
The war will be over by then.

776
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,900
It will never be over. Never!

777
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,300
They'd be nine months of hope.
Have you no heart?

778
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,300
And then one day, I found a note
from Kléber Bouquet,

779
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,200
known as Bastoche,

780
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,700
saying to tie a coloured cloth at
the window if he wasn't to come up.

781
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,600
Coffee?

782
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,300
I'd love some!

783
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,200
- After you.
- Please.

784
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Thank you.

785
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,200
Sugar?

786
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,000
No, thank you.

787
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,400
It's mother of pearl?

788
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Yes, Benjamin made it.

789
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,200
- It's odd...
- How strange we never met.

790
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,300
The children aren't here?

791
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,700
Yes, but...

792
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,900
they're playing outside.

793
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,600
- A pick-me-up?
- Please.

794
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
No, no... Sorry.

795
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,400
I don't fancy one.

796
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,700
Neither do I.

797
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,500
Elodie, we'll say we've done it.

798
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,500
It'll calm him down.

799
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,500
It will make things easier
for you, for me...

800
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,700
for everybody.

801
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,200
Funny how your smile
opens the parentheses.

802
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'll close them
as late as possible...

803
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,200
In two days, at the train station.

804
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,800
Come on...

805
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,500
give me one last smile.

806
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,700
To close the parentheses.

807
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,600
I didn't even get pregnant!

808
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,300
But soon, fear no longer tormented
my husband.

809
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,700
It was jealousy.

810
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,700
"Where? When? Often?
Which positions?"

811
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,800
"Did you enjoy it?" It became
a living hell for both of us.

812
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,900
Now, Bastoche is dead,
as you know,

813
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,500
and my husband was killed
in a hospital bombing.

814
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,900
It's a relief to confide in you.
At times, I think I'm going mad.

815
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,500
Elodie Gordes.

816
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,900
Matti! Hurry up.

817
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,800
Mr. Rouvière is on the phone.
He's waiting.

818
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,100
Come on!

819
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,800
Mathilde? Pierre-Marie here.

820
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,800
I have some bad news.

821
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,300
Not really bad... News you're
already supposed to know.

822
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,800
But news you can no longer ignore.

823
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,700
You were right about one thing...

824
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,900
Manech and his four comrades
were in that absurdly named trench.

825
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,400
They were buried
in the Herdelin cemetery,

826
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,800
after being temporarily buried
under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater.

827
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,700
That's that, my dear Mathilde.

828
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,900
In June, 1909,
Mathilde is 9 years old.

829
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,500
Manech Langonnet is 10.

830
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,300
Does it hurt when you walk?

831
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,900
It's Friday, or Saturday...

832
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
Mathilde can't remember.

833
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,400
Do you have any friends?

834
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,900
I can be your friend.

835
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,500
Do I stink of fish?

836
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,900
Ever been
to the top of the lighthouse?

837
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,200
I can carry you
to the top of the stairs.

838
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,100
Because my dad's the keeper!

839
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,600
Be stuck-up then! Church mouse!
Country bumpkin!

840
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,100
Do you want a kick in the pants?

841
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,500
Can you see far from the top?

842
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,400
I'm going to gobble up your ears!

843
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,200
I'll throw you in the dungeon!

844
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,900
I am the squid's servant!

845
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,800
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart!

846
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,500
Manech's Marrying Mathilde!

847
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,500
Mathilde's Marrying Manech!

848
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,400
- I don't smoke.
- I know, but take it...

849
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,100
It'll help you make new friends.

850
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,400
If I reach the bend before the car,

851
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,500
Manech will come back alive!

852
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,200
If I reach the bend...

853
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,100
If I reach the bend
before the car...

854
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,700
Manech will come back alive...

855
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,800
If I reach the bend...

856
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,400
You used to brag
about being one year older than me.

857
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,900
Now I'm older than you.

858
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,600
The man who gave you his glove
is called Poux.

859
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,700
Célestin Poux.

860
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,600
Funny, isn't it?

861
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,700
The man I hired to find him is Pire.

862
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,000
Germain Pire.

863
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,900
Strange name, too.

864
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,900
Either way, he hasn't found him.
Nor the Corsican's whore.

865
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,700
The wire's snapped, Manech,

866
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,200
but I'm not giving up.

867
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,900
I still believe
that Tina Lombardi's a lead.

868
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,800
I need to be sure.

869
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,500
You understand, right?

870
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,900
That's why
I must find Célestin Poux.

871
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,100
You can be really annoying,
you know.

872
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,600
We would be
so much better in Brittany.

873
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,300
Let's go, Mathilde.

874
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,700
You'll catch cold.

875
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,400
Thouvenel!

876
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,100
What do you want?

877
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,100
Who are you?

878
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,900
Was it you who phoned?

879
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,800
Who are you?

880
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,600
The days go by.
Still no news of Célestin Poux.

881
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,700
Mathilde's sadness is overwhelming.

882
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,500
She must eat.
She's making herself ill.

883
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,500
Leave her the marrowbone.

884
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,000
Her sadness is beginning
to rub off on us.

885
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,600
And so,

886
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,100
in the middle of the night
on the 15th of September, 1920,

887
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,000
the wire is re-tied.

888
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,600
"Victory!
I've finally found the roaming Poux.

889
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
"Sent by the grace of God
and Davidson motors.

890
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,800
"All expenses paid, of course.
Germain Pire."

891
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,300
Célestin Poux, Terror of the Tarmac!

892
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,200
The ad was yours?

893
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,100
Mathilde tightly clasps her hands,

894
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,800
to keep from shaking and crying

895
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,400
and making a fool of herself.

896
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,200
I didn't actually see
your fiancé get hit.

897
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,600
I went to get the stew

898
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,900
and ran into Lebègue,
a guy I met in the Vosges.

899
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,000
A native of the Meuse.
Or rather a naïve of the Meuse.

900
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,600
Even so, he could tell good coffee
from a stomach remedy.

901
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,400
I know. I tried to sell him
a mixture of coffee and charcoal

902
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,300
in exchange for
some Dutch tobacco.

903
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,200
So, the last time you saw Manech,

904
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,400
he was alive?

905
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,400
You couldn't miss him.

906
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,700
Carving Ms on a burnt tree trunk,

907
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,000
smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

908
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,600
He carved three Ms
before the albatross got him.

909
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,400
Albatross!

910
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,400
"Albatross.

911
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,800
"Great sweeping sea bird,

912
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,700
"indolent traveling companion,

913
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,100
"gliding with ships

914
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,800
"upon bitter deep."

915
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,200
It's a poem by Baudelaire.

916
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,500
It was also a Jerry bomber.

917
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,500
The machine gun was at the rear.

918
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,200
We couldn't shoot yet
through the propeller.

919
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,400
It was you who gave him the glove?

920
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,500
A thick woolen red one.

921
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,300
My fiancée spent her time
knitting scarves and mittens for me.

922
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,300
I traded them
with frostbitten Senegalese

923
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,700
in exchange for Germans' gold teeth.

924
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,400
I melted them down
after the Armistice.

925
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,800
They paid for my Harley.

926
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,600
But...

927
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,600
are you sure Manech's dead?

928
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,300
A comrade told me,
with a wound like that...

929
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,800
he didn't stand a chance.

930
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,000
I only saw three of them get killed
with my own eyes.

931
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,400
I surrender!

932
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,300
I surrender!

933
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,600
Don't shoot!

934
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,000
I beg you! I surrender!

935
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,300
Let me through!

936
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,100
I'm on your side!

937
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,700
I'm not French, I'm Corsican!

938
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,600
I've nothing against you!

939
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,400
Poor bastard.

940
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,400
So, he's not French!

941
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,400
Let's cancel his birth certificate.

942
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,400
A French corporal dealt with him...

943
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,600
Thouvenel. A trigger-happy swine!

944
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,300
He had a heart made of stone,
but a sharp eye.

945
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,800
Poor bastard!

946
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,300
I guess you like it.

947
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,800
I'd kill my parents for a good stew!

948
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,000
Don't worry, he's an orphan.

949
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,800
The same goes for truffles.

950
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,200
If you like truffles,
I have one from Périgord...

951
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,400
Which ones did you see die?

952
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,900
The one with gangrene.

953
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,000
Six-Sous.

954
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,800
Yes, the welder.

955
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,500
Comrades...

956
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,800
Before dying...

957
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,600
I have a final request.

958
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,200
I want to piss standing up.

959
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,900
Like a man!

960
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,700
And then, you can fire away
to your heart's content!

961
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:53,300
So long to life, so long to love

962
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,100
So long to all those women

963
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,900
It's all over

964
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,900
Done forever

965
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,200
This shameful war

966
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,300
At Craonne, on the plateau

967
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,200
That's where we'll leave our skins

968
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,400
For we've all been sentenced

969
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:23,800
We are the sacrificed

970
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,400
And Bastoche?

971
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,200
He was so well hidden,

972
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,200
we couldn't locate him.

973
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,700
Even at dawn,
when he answered roll call,

974
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,400
no one knew where he was.
A ventriloquist!

975
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,300
No, he was a carpenter.

976
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,700
No matter.

977
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,700
He was shot down by the Albatross,
along with your fiancé.

978
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,000
The Albatross caught fire
and crashed on the enemy line.

979
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,500
Return to sender.

980
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,000
What about the Dordogne farmer?

981
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,200
He played dead from the beginning.
Not that it saved him.

982
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,200
The Jerries didn't appreciate
the grenade.

983
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,300
Don't look!
Lt'll only make it worse.

984
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,800
When I got back with the stew,
bullets were flying everywhere.

985
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,500
Heavy shelling had begun.

986
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,200
Damn! No one can imagine
what it's like.

987
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,400
Can't move your legs, your heart
beats like a scared animal.

988
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Then I saw the Dordogne farmer
shatter into pieces.

989
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,800
Attack,
before we're all slaughtered.

990
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,600
Prepare bayonets!

991
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,200
All that was nothing
compared to what followed.

992
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,800
For France!

993
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,900
Charge!

994
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,000
We'd passed
the five prisoners bodies

995
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,500
when the Jerry machine guns
started spitting bullets.

996
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,200
We were wiped out!

997
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,900
That Lavrouye bastard!
He kept the paper to himself.

998
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,400
Stretcher-bearers!

999
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,300
What paper?

1000
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,700
That's all he said.

1001
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,500
That evening, there was enough food
to feed an army.

1002
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:04,900
Favart and Chardolot
were counting losses.

1003
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,200
Why do those five
show up on our battalion list?

1004
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,000
We're only following orders.

1005
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,900
Something stinks here.

1006
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,600
Something stinks?
Lavrouye stinks.

1007
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,600
This food doesn't.
Dig in before it gets cold.

1008
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,900
It's cold!

1009
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,800
So you only saw
three of them get killed.

1010
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,000
With your own eyes.

1011
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,800
False hope
will only make you suffer.

1012
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
They're not false!

1013
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,600
You'll taste my cake?

1014
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,100
I don't know if I should.

1015
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,000
With a bit of fresh cream.

1016
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,800
If you insist...

1017
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,800
I like people
who appreciate my food.

1018
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,800
I'll put her to bed.

1019
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,400
Let's all get some sleep.

1020
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,100
Slow down!

1021
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,000
You lack control, no style...

1022
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,900
You're better at raking
than skidding!

1023
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,800
Hey, Postman! I'll drop you off
at the next letterbox.

1024
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:23,800
And my bike?

1025
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,400
Leave it to me. I fought in the war!
I don't have a desk job.

1026
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,700
It's not my fault. I'm asthmatic!

1027
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,600
An asthmatic who rides a bike!

1028
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,800
- By the sea.
- Sure, by the sea!

1029
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,100
Célestin, it's not a sidecar.

1030
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,500
Those men, they never grow up...

1031
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,700
As long as they don't play soldiers.

1032
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:50,200
"Tell old Bernay... settle up
by March. His manure's too costly..."

1033
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,100
He wouldn't write such trivialities.
Don't you agree?

1034
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,200
There must be a code.

1035
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,700
Except lovers' codes

1036
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,400
can't be cracked with brains
or divine intervention.

1037
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,900
And Bastoche?

1038
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,000
If he was seen with his German
boots, he must have survived.

1039
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,700
Not so, Miss.

1040
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,700
Gordes didn't let him go over
the top with those boots.

1041
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,100
If the Jerries see these,

1042
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,100
they'll know
you've stripped one of their dead.

1043
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,300
So Tina Lombardi's
on the wrong track.

1044
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,500
The one with the boots

1045
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,500
wasn't Bastoche.

1046
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,000
It was Gordes!

1047
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,200
That's right, Miss!

1048
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,900
He was with a boy,

1049
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,700
from the class of '17...
Desrochelles.

1050
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,600
I'd met some stretcher-bearers
who'd just passed them.

1051
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,200
Are you from Bingo?

1052
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:54,900
Might be.

1053
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,000
Tell them Gordes is wounded.

1054
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,200
- He's with a boy who's worse off.
- Desrochelles.

1055
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,400
- They're off to first-aid.
- With German boots!

1056
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,800
Long Live Anarchy!

1057
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,000
Anarchy.

1058
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,400
What's happened, Matti?

1059
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,100
What did I say?

1060
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,100
Open up!

1061
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,400
Be reasonable.

1062
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,500
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1063
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,700
You've known he's dead
for three years.

1064
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,300
I call that stubbornness.

1065
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,700
No, I call that hope.

1066
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,400
Poux has just killed it.

1067
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,000
If I can do anything...

1068
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,200
You can.

1069
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,600
Take me to Bingo Crépuscule.

1070
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,000
An Indian princess on her elephant.

1071
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,700
With her hunters,
on the Trail of Sorrow.

1072
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,000
It was there!

1073
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,400
Right there!

1074
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,800
At a hundred yards, facing Bingo,

1075
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,100
was Erlangen, the Jerry trench.

1076
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,200
Where's the burnt tree trunk?

1077
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,000
All the stumps and debris

1078
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,800
were used to fill in the trenches.

1079
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:43,800
We found the five over there,
under a tarpaulin,

1080
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
covered with earth.

1081
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,500
- Not a pretty sight.
- No doubt!

1082
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,700
The youngest was only a boy.

1083
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,300
Was he wearing a glove?

1084
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,300
A red, woolen glove?

1085
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,700
They all had
one bandaged hand, but...

1086
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,500
nothing on the other.
I can't remember seeing a glove.

1087
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,300
Athos!

1088
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,900
I don't like him digging like that.

1089
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,400
Around here,

1090
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,900
you never know what junk
you might come across,

1091
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,300
that can blow off an arm or a leg.

1092
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,200
It's the crypt!

1093
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,900
There was a chapel
between the two trenches.

1094
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,600
It was in ruins.

1095
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,300
Incredible.
I don't recognize a thing.

1096
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,200
Could Manech have lost the glove
as he fell?

1097
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,700
It was tightly knitted
and tightly fitted.

1098
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,700
I used the other one in the kitchens
until the end of the war.

1099
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,800
Maybe he took it off to carve?

1100
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,700
I couldn't say.

1101
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,600
But I don't think so.

1102
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,600
What sort of red was it? Bright red?

1103
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,900
A flashy red.

1104
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:20,200
With white dots.
Looked like maggots on an apple!

1105
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,900
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1106
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,700
My husband's family
suffered greatly in the war.

1107
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,900
I didn't want to go over

1108
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:45,000
to a French soldier's table
in front of him.

1109
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,400
What can you tell me?

1110
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,200
Before dying, my brother Gunther

1111
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,500
saw your fiancé carve
those three letters on a tree.

1112
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,900
He was wearing a red, spotted glove.

1113
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,700
A comrade of Gunther's
told me the story.

1114
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,700
When our plane
shot down your fiancé,

1115
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,900
they were sick to the stomach.

1116
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,700
After that,

1117
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,300
it was a nightmare.

1118
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,400
God spared
that French soldier twice.

1119
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,000
Then... your side attacked.

1120
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,600
They killed my brother.

1121
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,100
He was 23 years old.

1122
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,400
I came to see his cross
at the cemetery.

1123
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,700
I'm sorry.

1124
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,500
Time heals all. You'll see.

1125
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,300
I'll get back,
he'll be getting worried.

1126
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,700
Seems I haven't killed it.

1127
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,200
Pardon?

1128
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:20,900
Hope!

1129
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,100
What now?

1130
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,200
Tina Lombardi.
She's going to the guillotine!

1131
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,300
They call her the "Officer Killer".

1132
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,400
She's killed Lavrouye and Thouvenel.

1133
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,100
And planned to kill Maréchal Pétain.

1134
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,800
When I think you sat in a wheelchair
to soften me up!

1135
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,400
I'll talk only to you,

1136
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,800
because I know we're very similar.

1137
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,500
We'll leave them alone.

1138
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,500
What I did,
you could've done, too.

1139
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,700
I don't think so.

1140
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,700
I'd be too scared.

1141
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,700
I'm not scared.

1142
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,400
And I regret nothing.

1143
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,400
Except my hair.

1144
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,300
I'll be treated to a bowl-cut
before the execution.

1145
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,800
I'll look like Joan of Arc
when I see my Angel!

1146
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,900
Why did you want to kill Pétain?

1147
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:14,000
Throwing mutilated soldiers
over the top was his idea.

1148
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,200
Why not Poincaré?

1149
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,000
He refused them a pardon.

1150
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,400
You don't know?

1151
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,300
He did pardon them.
All five!

1152
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,200
It's just a leave.

1153
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,500
Lavrouye kept the paper for himself.

1154
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,800
Why did that dog Lavrouye do that?

1155
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:38,100
Because dirty dogs play dirty.
That's all.

1156
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,900
Trust me on this.

1157
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,600
I took care of him!

1158
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,000
You and I have been running
the same investigation.

1159
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,700
Each in our own way.

1160
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,500
Looking for survivors from Bingo,

1161
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,400
I picked up a male nurse
who'd treated Angel and the others.

1162
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:35,200
This guy, Phillipot,
was sure he'd seen one of them.

1163
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,100
A big man, with a head wound.

1164
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,200
He was a big man.
Head wound, German boots...

1165
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,400
He wore German boots and
was carrying a thin-built soldier.

1166
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,600
I think that's about right.
I'm even sure of it.

1167
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,100
A big man, head wound...

1168
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,500
His superior told him
to keep his mouth shut.

1169
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,300
You can imagine
how overwhelmed with hope I was.

1170
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,800
And then, I met the man
who shattered my dreams.

1171
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,000
Chief Sergeant Favart.

1172
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,900
He told me how that pig Thouvenel
had shot my Angel, just like that!

1173
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,000
Like taking a leak.

1174
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,800
I took care of him, too!

1175
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,300
It was an obsession.

1176
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,100
Kill all those who hurt my man.

1177
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,100
Your Angel left you this.

1178
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,800
"Vengeance is pointless.
Try to be happy,

1179
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,800
"and don't ruin your life for me.

1180
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,800
"Your Angel from Hell."

1181
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,200
Departure for Paris,
Platform 2.

1182
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,700
Gordes, the one who switched boots
with Bastoche...

1183
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,100
was he big?

1184
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,700
Biscuit? He was no athlete.
Just a guy like you or me.

1185
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And you have no news
of Desrochelles?

1186
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,400
He didn't make friends easily.
He lived alone with his mother.

1187
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,800
I must go. I'm boarding in an hour
for Venezuela.

1188
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,200
Good luck, Célestin!

1189
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,500
To you too!

1190
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,500
When I think
you hid Poincaré's pardon!

1191
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,100
I didn't want to throw salt
on the wound.

1192
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,900
I'd like one last favour.

1193
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,100
I suppose it concerns Bingo-thingy?

1194
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,900
Son of bookseller,
Desrochelles Paul,

1195
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,500
born in Sarreguemines,

1196
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,200
died in February, 1897...

1197
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,000
That's it, Desrochelles Jean!

1198
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,200
What?

1199
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:07,900
In Saintes.

1200
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,200
In the Charentes.

1201
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,800
Tell me, Mr. Pire, Tina Lombardi...
You had an inkling

1202
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,400
of what she was up to.

1203
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,800
Luckily, your paths didn't cross.

1204
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,600
He who pries, flies,
when danger lurks.

1205
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,000
He who pries, pries,
but, from a distance.

1206
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,400
I've a new lead for you.

1207
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,900
Jean Desrochelles. Evacuated from
the Front on the 7th of January '17.

1208
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,600
His only next of kin was his mother,
the widow Desrochelles.

1209
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:40,200
She lives at 22 rue de I'Abbaye.
Saintes, in the Charentes.

1210
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,900
All the work's been done!

1211
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,700
You've tried to reach me?

1212
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,000
My brother's comrade,
the one I told you about...

1213
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,300
He remembered something
that might interest you.

1214
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,500
The two French soldiers
escorting him that morning,

1215
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,600
wanted to go back through
no-man's-land.

1216
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,900
They saw the prisoners' bodies.

1217
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,400
One was in a kind of small cellar.

1218
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,300
The French soldiers
seemed surprised.

1219
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't know if that can help you.

1220
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,700
Thank you.

1221
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,000
"Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

1222
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:27,800
"His manure's too costly,
watch out for him."

1223
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,400
"His manure's too costly..."

1224
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,800
There must be a code.

1225
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,500
Your Mr. Pry called!

1226
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,000
He's run into a dead-end in Saintes.

1227
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,200
I know!

1228
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,900
Hello! Go ahead.

1229
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yes, Miss. I remember you.

1230
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,200
Old Bernay? No, never heard of him.

1231
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,300
Benoît Notre Dame
used the manure from his animals.

1232
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,100
He never bought it!

1233
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,000
Thank you, Father.

1234
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,600
I must decode this letter.

1235
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,400
I think we're getting hot.

1236
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,700
Will be - Bernay - March

1237
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,200
Sell - Everything

1238
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,500
Say - Nothing

1239
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,800
Listen - No one

1240
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,300
Benoît

1241
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,900
Excuse me,
the "End of the World" farm?

1242
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,600
The last house
at the end of the road.

1243
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,000
And if he doesn't come?

1244
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,800
He'll come, don't worry.

1245
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,500
Come back in two hours.

1246
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,900
Hello, Mathilde.

1247
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,500
It's dangerous
to want to bring back the dead.

1248
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,800
When I saw your ad in the paper,

1249
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:09,800
I knew, in time,
the gendarmes would come.

1250
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,600
Don't worry.

1251
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,400
I had the chance
to do away with you...

1252
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,000
I let it go.

1253
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,300
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

1254
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,200
I couldn't kill you.

1255
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,300
Now, even the rabbits and chickens,
my wife has to do it.

1256
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,100
The war's taken it out of me.

1257
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,000
You know what I want to hear.

1258
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,200
Is he alive?

1259
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,200
The last time I saw him,
he wasn't doing well.

1260
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,000
But he's stronger than he looks.

1261
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:16,900
Don't stay together.

1262
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:38,800
When things calmed down,
I tried to get some sleep.

1263
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,900
- Gaignard!
- You think we're at the whorehouse?

1264
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,700
- Bouquet!
- What now?

1265
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,300
Notre Dame?

1266
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,300
Then the pimp tried to surrender.

1267
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,900
And the welder
from Paris was killed.

1268
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,300
Your fiancé started carving
on the tree.

1269
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Then, the Jerries' Albatross arrived.

1270
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,000
I came to,
when the ground started shaking.

1271
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,900
I don't know what happened.
I just saw that trapdoor

1272
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,500
the shell had half-opened.

1273
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,700
For France!

1274
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,200
Charge!

1275
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,300
They entered no-man's-land.
At the second German line,

1276
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
the machine guns got them.
A few hours later,

1277
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,900
a voice woke me.

1278
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,800
My God! Bastoche is dead!

1279
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,300
We can't leave him here.

1280
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,500
We'll come back.
He's not going anywhere.

1281
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,300
Bastoche is dead.

1282
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,100
Look, this one's still moving.

1283
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,500
It's the Cornflower.
He's a goner as well.

1284
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,900
A shell had ripped the door off.

1285
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,400
One of the guys arrived,
in bad shape.

1286
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,000
Bastoche is dead!

1287
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,100
We're all going to die.

1288
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,800
I recognized Bastoche's friend.

1289
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:13,400
The one who'd taken
his German boots.

1290
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,300
After eating, I smoked his tobacco.

1291
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,600
Then, I heard more voices.

1292
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,300
Let's go look over there.

1293
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,500
Look here!

1294
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,300
Damn it!

1295
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,700
It's not the Cornflower.

1296
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,900
What's he doing in there?

1297
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,100
Where's the Dordogne farmer?

1298
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,100
- I'm cold.
- Don't worry.

1299
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,400
He was really messed up,

1300
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,800
but your fiancé wanted to live.
I saw it in his eyes.

1301
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,100
I put him on my shoulders
and set off through the trench.

1302
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,000
He was burning with fever.

1303
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,700
I felt the heat on my back.

1304
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,100
And he was delirious.

1305
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,400
Spoke of a heart
beating in his hand.

1306
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:07,600
Hey, Corporal!

1307
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,900
Only 500 yards to the hospital.

1308
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,100
Want us to put your friend
on the stretcher?

1309
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,300
No, thanks.

1310
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,800
If you see any officers from Bingo,

1311
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:20,600
tell them Corporal Gordes has gone
to the hospital with Desrochelles.

1312
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,100
Have it your way!

1313
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,800
I arrived just before the explosion.

1314
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,700
Headquarters had the good idea
of setting up hospital

1315
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,700
in a hangar containing
a hydrogen-packed zeppelin.

1316
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:40,000
The Cornflower
has just been evacuated.

1317
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:43,200
Will he make it?

1318
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:48,200
His hip wound isn't too bad. But
he has a severe case of pneumonia.

1319
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,900
You're both registered
according to your tag numbers.

1320
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,300
I don't want to know anything else.
But good luck anyway!

1321
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,300
Block the pulley!

1322
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:20,400
Please!

1323
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,100
After that, I walked to Bernay.

1324
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:56,400
I had no idea if my wife
had received my letter,

1325
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:59,300
so each day I waited for her
at the bus-stop.

1326
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:09,000
With the money from the sale,
we bought a farm here.

1327
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,100
The most isolated one we could find.

1328
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,800
They call it "The End of the World".

1329
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:23,700
That's it.

1330
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Goodbye.

1331
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,100
How strange.

1332
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:36,500
You shot a hole
right through your lifeline.

1333
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,300
Of course.

1334
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:41,800
I died. At Bingo Crépuscule,
like your fiancé.

1335
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:52,600
If ever you find
Jean Desrochelles alive somewhere,

1336
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,300
let me know.

1337
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,100
You know where to find me.

1338
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:09,100
Make yourself at home!

1339
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:11,100
At Christmas,
come down the chimney!

1340
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,500
For Miss Mathilde.

1341
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,200
I'll give it to her later.

1342
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:17,100
If I were you...

1343
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,100
I would wake her up.

1344
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,500
What is it?

1345
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,000
"He's alive.

1346
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,500
"Stay where you are, Mathilde.

1347
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,600
"Just stay where you are.

1348
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,200
"I'm on my way.

1349
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,000
"Germain Pire."

1350
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:02,400
How silly I am!

1351
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:27,100
Peerless on the prowl,
faster than a whippet!

1352
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:30,900
He's well and truly alive,
but he's lost his memory!

1353
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:35,600
Total amnesia. He even had to learn
to read and write again.

1354
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,900
The psychiatrists treating him
since '17 aren't hopeful.

1355
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,800
But who knows?

1356
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:46,000
There are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1357
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,400
Where is he?

1358
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,000
In Milly-la-Forêt.

1359
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:53,300
Orphaned for the second time.
He's just lost his adopted mother.

1360
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,600
Pierre-Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1361
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,400
By reputation.

1362
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,700
An honour.

1363
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:07,100
Mathilde,
I'll believe it when I see it.

1364
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:08,700
"With my own eyes!"

1365
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,900
When Jean Desrochelles was born,

1366
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,500
his mother was 40,
and had no other children.

1367
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,400
When the gendarmes took him...

1368
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,700
To replenish the troops in Ardennes.

1369
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,400
She became depressed.

1370
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,500
One day,
a comrade of her son visited her...

1371
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Chardolot!

1372
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,100
Unfortunately, it was Jean.

1373
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:31,800
A shell had got him. He'd already
been dead for a few hours.

1374
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,800
I should also tell you...

1375
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,300
Maybe the youngest prisoner
has taken Jean's identity...

1376
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,500
exchanging tag numbers.

1377
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:50,500
She went off her rocker
the day the hospital rang her,

1378
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,900
asking to come to her son's bedside.

1379
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,300
He's sleeping. I'll leave you.

1380
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,100
Who are you?

1381
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:24,500
Your mother, my darling.

1382
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,700
I'm your mother.

1383
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,500
I ran my own little investigation.

1384
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,900
Mrs. Desrochelles died
two months ago.

1385
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:35,800
Run over by a truck
after a fight with a shopkeeper.

1386
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,500
And I'm not guessing!

1387
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:40,500
- It's in the report.
- We already knew that.

1388
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,000
Don't get upset.

1389
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,100
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer,
she died straight away.

1390
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,600
It's not that.

1391
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,900
I feel so guilty!

1392
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:00,100
I didn't believe you,
my dear Mathilde!

1393
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,900
I should have known!

1394
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,200
I'm so sorry.

1395
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:14,300
In what she would refer to as
her "Milly Expedition",

1396
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,000
the sun, the sky
and nature are with her.

1397
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,500
As a true lady, she made
every effort to look her best.

1398
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,700
Dressed in white for freshness,

1399
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,400
lipstick for the occasion,
eyebrows shaped.

1400
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,300
But none of that black
which lengthens the eyelashes.

1401
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,700
She knows that tears
can make a mess of it.

1402
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,100
He knows about your visit.

1403
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:58,400
We said a young girl
he'd dearly loved was coming here.

1404
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,300
He asked your name
and found it very beautiful.

1405
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:04,300
He's in the garden.
He's waiting for you.

1406
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,200
Does it hurt when you walk?

1407
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,800
Want to see what I'm doing?

1408
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,700
I'll show you later,
when it's finished.

1409
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,700
But why are you crying?

1410
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:50,200
Mathilde leans back
against her chair,

1411
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:54,500
folds her hands in her lap
and looks at him.

1412
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:59,200
In the sweetness of the air,
in the light of the garden,

1413
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,600
Mathilde looks at him.

1414
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,900
She looks at him...

1415
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,700
She looks at him...
