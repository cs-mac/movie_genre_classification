1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,640
What's that?

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,480
What you will tell him

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,280
when you are in the cellar.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,240
This?

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,600
This bunch of crap,

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,680
who ever the author

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,880
of the director is,

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,640
it's still crap.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,280
If you are asking for my opinion...

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,800
This is my opinion!

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
You are a poet, Marko!

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,280
Write poems!

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,200
What's wrong?

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,440
The truth!

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,120
The truth?
-Yes, dear.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,520
You know, the truth...

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
No text, dear,

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,280
contains the truth.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
These things only exists in life.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
You are the truth.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,440
You.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,320
You are supposed to be the truth.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,720
There is no truth, except your own believe

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,440
that what you act is the truth.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
Art is a lie.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
One big lie.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,120
We are all liars.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
At least a bit.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
Son of a bitch! Bastard!

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,080
They raped me, hit me...

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,040
What else?

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
Is it this important that these people

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
keep living in the cellar?

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,840
Very important, honey.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,240
You gave yourself the role of the hero,

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,880
and I can play the whore!

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,000
Everybody may fuck your wife!

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
Get yourself dressed and made up.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,400
I promissed them to rescue

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,240
you for the wedding.

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
Could you please get dressed and made yourself up.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
I said no.

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,720
I said no!

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,320
I can't play a role

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,000
in which I don't believe.

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,640
Look what they did to her.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Bloody Fascist swines.

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
I love you...

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
Did you hear that?

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,160
She told me that she loved me.

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,440
What?

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,240
Did you hear it?

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
And you?

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
She said she loved me.

55
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
Exactly my portrait.

56
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Welcome at the wedding of my son.

57
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,280
Stop it!

58
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,760
The day has finally been reached.

59
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Son, I bought you these golden rings.

60
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
Give one to the bride.

61
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Forgive us the modesty

62
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
of the banquet.

63
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,400
What can we do about it? It's war after all.

64
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,040
But what we gave

65
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
came from the heart.

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
If it wasn't war,

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,880
if it were better times,

68
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
and if his mother still would be alive...

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
Keep it cheerful!

70
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Thank you, old pal.

71
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Comrades...

72
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
This is the moment where

73
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,200
we thank all together

74
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,320
comrade Marko

75
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,400
for all the past years

76
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
that he toke care of us,

77
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
and gave us a meal

78
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
and made sure we were healthy.

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
With all my heart I thank you, Marko.

80
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,400
Thank you, comrade Marko!

81
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,000
Be seated. Last month

82
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,200
we made 200 light weapons.

83
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,640
Was that a mere fleabite?

84
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,840
No!
-Congratulations!

85
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Thank you, Marko.

86
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,520
But our greatest success

87
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
is our tank.

88
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Which we made ourselves.

89
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm happy and proud to know

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
that the moment comes

91
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
when we will use it

92
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,680
to liberate our country.

93
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,400
Tank... forward!

94
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,760
Congratulations, comrades.

95
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
My compliments.

96
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Thank you, uncle Marko.

97
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
Whose are these pickles?

98
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,640
From us all? Play, rascal!

99
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,160
We made it together.

100
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,880
That wasn't necessary. Thank you, Ivan.

101
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
Come on, I have to tell you something.

102
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
I have to tell him something.

103
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Listen...

104
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
when everybody is drunk,

105
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
we will attack from the outside.

106
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,520
Not a drop until the Liberation.

107
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,880
Marko will be angry.

108
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,840
I have been waiting 15 years for Marko,

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the Russians, Tito, and the Party!

110
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
Enough! The moment has arrived!

111
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,440
We will end the war!

112
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,120
Yes, my son!

113
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,160
Forward!

114
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
Let me go!

115
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,800
Rascals!

116
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,840
Quit drinking, Natalija.

117
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,680
Give me that bottle.

118
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes, I'll give you the bottle.

119
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,080
Here!

120
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Quit drinking

121
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,520
if I ask you to.

122
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
If I'm sober,

123
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,280
I can't watch your face.

124
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,960
But you can watch him.

125
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,640
I thought so,

126
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,160
but even that doesn't work no more.

127
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,320
Do you see this?
This is for you.

128
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,480
And this...

129
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,400
is for him.

130
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
I drink alcohol,

131
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,720
but you are drinking my blood

132
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,200
for the last 20 years, son of a bitch!

133
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,040
Natalija, you filthy whore!

134
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,440
I fuck you

135
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,320
and your mother at the same time!

136
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
Where did Blacky go?

137
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,520
Everything okay, my friends?

138
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
Honey...

139
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,360
What's the matter, darling?

140
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,440
You are crying...

141
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,560
Why are you crying?

142
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,560
I don't know.

143
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
Are you happy?

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes, I'm happy.

145
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,840
Are you crying because you are happy?

146
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,680
Moonshine at noon?

147
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,800
Or sunshine at midnight?

148
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,280
From heaven above

149
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
shines a light

150
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,120
Nobody knows

151
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
Nobody knows

152
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,160
Where that light comes from...

153
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,880
Son of a bitch!

154
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,440
What's wrong, Natalija?

155
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,920
My time has come!

156
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,400
Stop it, goddammit!

157
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,760
You as well! Where were you?

158
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,080
You sick of both of you!

159
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Sick! Sick!

160
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
Crook!

161
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,920
What do you want? What's the matter?

162
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,560
I have thrown away my youth!

163
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,280
What are you saying, Natalija?

164
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
Twenty years!

165
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
Twenty years of my

166
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,280
with blood soiled  life!

167
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
What a catastrophe!

168
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
Excellent brandy.

169
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
But strong stuff.

170
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,600
The monkey is climbing into the tank...

171
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,160
What a catastrophe!

172
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,480
The barrel is moving...

173
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,400
He is turning the barrel... A catastrophe.

174
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Wine, Natalija?

175
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,600
All is going to the devil!

176
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,080
They got me this time.

177
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,920
If there wasn't a war...

178
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,760
Otchy

179
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
tchernye...

180
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,760
Otchy strasnye...

181
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
...would I be the star

182
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,480
of the Theatre of Moscow.

183
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,920
I would have played

184
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
in my mother tongue.

185
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
You are producing a lot of nonsense.

186
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,800
Since when was

187
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,120
your mother Russian?

188
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
You are drunk.

189
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,840
Listen...

190
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,840
She is not your wife, don't talk

191
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,040
to her like that, do you understand?

192
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
You are completely right.

193
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,960
No party without a Russian number.

194
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,320
If there wasn't a war, I would have been

195
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
by now the Yugoslavian Majakowki.

196
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,240
I could  salute his tomb in Moscow

197
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,120
and say:

198
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,840
"You echoed from the heavens

199
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,680
Like thunder.

200
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,200
We marched right behind you."

201
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
Left! Left!

202
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,560
Nobody listens to me.

203
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,080
The monkey is in the tank.

204
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,360
He's trained.

205
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
What a disaster.
-Get lost!

206
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,640
What did you want to confess to me?

207
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Something terrible.

208
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
Speak up.

209
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,800
Later,

210
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,400
I don't want to spoil the wedding.

211
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,800
Say it anyway.

212
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,800
What?

213
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,280
That you love Marko? I know.

214
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,560
That's not it.
-Oh, yes, it is!

215
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
No!
-Yes, it is.

216
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,120
No, I wanted to tell you

217
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,320
that it's all a lie.

218
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,880
Our whole life is a lie.

219
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,400
And I can't live without you.

220
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,200
Not live without me?

221
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,160
Music!

222
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,000
Stop the music!

223
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Did you hear me?

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Son,

225
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,120
listen carefully to my words.

226
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Never trust a woman who lies.

227
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
You may rest assured, daddy.

228
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,760
Are you scared,

229
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,480
colonel?

230
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,400
Stop drinking. You are talking nonsense.

231
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Are you afraid, colonel?

232
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm going to kill you.

233
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,720
How?

234
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm dead for 20 years.

235
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,640
Try it.

236
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
You will be general of the Secret Service.

237
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,480
Shut up!

238
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,400
You couldn't give me a child,

239
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
so kill me.

240
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
Yes, you can.

241
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,400
You are a scoundrel!

242
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
What did you call me?

243
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,560
A murderer. A criminal.

244
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,080
A thief.

245
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,360
So I'm a scoundrel?

246
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,480
Even worse.
-Worse?

247
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,560
Do you know why I'm a scoundrel?

248
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
Do you know why?

249
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Do you know why?

250
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
Because you are cursed!

251
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,640
Because I love you.

252
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
I love you.

253
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,120
When you fell in love with me,

254
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,160
you locked them up down here

255
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,600
to live, to die and to work for you!

256
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,800
Because I love you, do you understand?

257
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,560
I can't live without you.

258
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,840
What are they missing?

259
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,360
A lot.

260
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,160
Did you drag me into your crimes...

261
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,320
because you love me?

262
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,360
Yes, that's the only reason.

263
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,960
What else do I have?

264
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
Children? Friends?

265
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,080
You got nothing.

266
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
I've got nothing, except you...

267
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,400
if you want to.

268
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
God...

269
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
you can lie so beautifully.

270
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,040
I never lie.

271
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
What are you doing, old friend?

272
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,560
Nothing. We are talking a bit.

273
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Talking?

274
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,360
And that has to happen in darkness?

275
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,560
The racket was bothering us.

276
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
The racket was bothering you?

277
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,960
Does the music bother you?

278
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
Does the wedding of my son bother you?

279
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
You don't understand.

280
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,560
I understand it very well, believe me.

281
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,320
I have a headache.

282
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,280
What a surprise.

283
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
Look at them.

284
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,560
Give...

285
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
Old friend...

286
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,360
Here ends the tradition in which

287
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,960
the friend kills his best friend.

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,080
Here is the gun.

289
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,120
You have to do the rest yourself.

290
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Do you know why?
-I know why.

291
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,440
I think it's appropriate.

292
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm a free woman!

293
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,040
What a disaster.

294
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,280
We shall see which

295
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,480
mother is now mourning.

296
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,120
Daddy!

297
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
Jovan, my son!

298
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Get the rifles!

299
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,720
We leave!

300
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,840
Where to?

301
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,040
Outside, finishing the war.

302
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,360
The Germans will kill us.

303
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,560
But daddy...

304
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,920
Stop saying "daddy"!

305
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
We are going to war,

306
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,160
not to some brothel!

307
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,000
But the germans will kill me.

308
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
That's true.

309
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,000
Women and Revolution

310
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
were never combined succesfully.

311
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,560
Don't cry, Natalija.

312
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,040
We will soon meet again.

313
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,960
I'll wait for you.

314
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
I'll wait for you!

315
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,640
Jovan, my son!

316
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,360
Do you smell the Donau?
-No.

317
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,240
You are getting on my nerves.

318
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
Come on!

319
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,640
One small question.
-What?

320
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,960
The colour.

321
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
Do you call that green?

322
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Dark green.

323
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,120
Do you call that green?

324
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,360
Green?

325
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,680
Swindlers!

326
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,040
Fiddlers!

327
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,800
He doesn't like the colour.

328
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,640
Green? Green?

329
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,120
To hell with that green of yours!

330
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
He tortures people!

331
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,320
Bastard!

332
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
Come on, the director is waiting!

333
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,920
Pee, pee!

334
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,560
Pee, pee!

335
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
While you can!

336
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,000
Hit them!

337
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,560
Not me, idiot!

338
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,640
How dare you to pee on my city?

339
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,400
Daddy's city!
-My city!

340
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,640
62, 64, 66, 68...

341
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,920
Blast!

342
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,440
Madam, where is Jovan?

343
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
Outside.

344
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,640
Somebody has been shooting.

345
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,880
They will betray us.

346
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
They won't betray us.

347
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,680
They have been killed.

348
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,480
Ringe, ringe, raja

349
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
Here comes uncle Paja...

350
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,280
We are standing on the historical place

351
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,480
where in the year 19...

352
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,800
1944...

353
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,560
dastardly criminals

354
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,000
murdered our national hero,

355
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Petar Popara Blacky.

356
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,000
Don't be afraid, boy.

357
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,600
What was that, daddy?

358
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,320
A pheasant.

359
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,520
Is that dangerous?

360
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,640
A pheasant? Dangerous?

361
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,440
That's a wild chicken.

362
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,720
There is the sun.

363
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,200
That's the moon, my son.

364
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,760
The moon.

365
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,520
Where is the sun?

366
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,600
The sun is asleep.

367
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,600
She is resting.

368
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
Come!

369
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Make sure they don't see you.

370
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,640
I'm only saying

371
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,200
that you look like Franzi.

372
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,080
And Franzi is the nickname

373
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
of Franz.

374
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,600
The "i" is the smallest character.

375
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,920
Franz!

376
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
Do you see that blond man?

377
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
That's Franz.

378
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,440
Look at him.

379
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,160
He hasn't changed in 15 years.

380
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,320
Typically German.

381
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,440
Did he torture you?

382
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,040
And he sent Natalija to a camp.

383
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
It fits perfectly.

384
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
Does he think that

385
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,560
I wouldn't recognize him?

386
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,360
And who is the other one?

387
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,040
A collaborator.

388
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,240
What's all that smoke needed for?

389
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,560
Sabotage?

390
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Blacky...

391
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,440
make sure that the execution

392
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,040
looks as real as possible.

393
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,320
What do you mean?

394
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,360
Look how he resembles you.

395
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,160
Who?
-That one.

396
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,280
The skinny one?

397
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,400
You are getting on my nerves.

398
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,440
I could spank you.

399
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Just like your mother.

400
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,960
Do I have to act as naturally as possible?

401
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,560
I didn't say that.

402
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,040
Do you think I'm a fool?

403
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,360
You said so.

404
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,840
Come on...

405
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't be so sensitive.

406
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,640
To be honest, I don't

407
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,160
know what to do!

408
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,800
Wait...

409
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Is this naturally enough?

410
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,760
Hey...

411
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,520
Come over here and execute me.

412
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,920
Okay!

413
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Here is the rifle and the camera.

414
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,960
Come on, kill me.

415
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,280
He looks very brave.

416
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,240
Logically, he resembles me.

417
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,880
Are you soldiers or ballerina's?

418
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
Look at you!

419
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,880
Camera!

420
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,880
Where is the smoke?

421
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,720
Never at the right time!

422
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,680
Piss off!

423
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,680
To be honestly, he would

424
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,360
go all the way through. Oh boy.

425
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,400
Yes, but then again he's

426
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,520
a great director.

427
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,320
I've seen much, but this...

428
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
Piss off!

429
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,200
I can't concentrate this way!

430
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,680
Tell her!

431
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,720
Everybody, please at your position!

432
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,760
"The spring is coming", 32a, Take 1.

433
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,400
Action!

434
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,160
Get rid of that!

435
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,400
Get rid of it!

436
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,360
I want to look death in the eyes!

437
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,560
A last puff?

438
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
Long live the Communist Party

439
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,520
of Yugoslavia!

440
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,080
Aim!

441
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,480
What's happening?

442
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,400
This is what I call naturally!

443
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,560
This is naturally!

444
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,120
Continue!

445
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
What do you mean, continue?

446
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,920
This wasn't in the script.

447
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
Continue!

448
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
Don't stop! Act!

449
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,400
Do you call this directing? Jesus!

450
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,880
Long live the Communist Party

451
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,680
of Yugoslavia!

452
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,360
Under the leadership of comrade Tito!

453
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,480
Bloody fascist swines!

454
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,120
Do not cut the scene!

455
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,120
Bloody idiots!

456
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
Throw it, boy!

457
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Attack!

458
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,400
Exactly my resemblance.

459
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,480
Guards!

460
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,720
Are you coming with me to West-Germany?

461
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm looking...

462
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
my monkey...

463
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,760
Soni...

464
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,840
Did you see him

465
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
by any chance?

466
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,560
Are you looking for your monkey?

467
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Yes, his name is Soni.

468
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
A horse!

469
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,320
A deer, son. That's a deer.

470
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,080
A deer?

471
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,240
But that's the way you draw horses.

472
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,880
It's a deer.

473
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
Jelena!

474
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,440
That can't be Jelena.

475
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
Calm down, son.

476
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,320
What is it?

477
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,360
Nothing. Just a fish.

478
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,440
I catched whoppers of a hundred

479
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,440
pounds here before the war.

480
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,720
God, I was terrified.

481
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,720
I was afraid something happened to Jelena.

482
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,760
You don't have to be afraid, my son.

483
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,200
I want to go back to the cellar.

484
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,440
When will they protect artists?

485
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,440
Who minds us?

486
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
We work night and day

487
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,000
for our comrades!

488
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,840
Our life is a real hell!

489
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,840
Caml down.

490
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,320
What do you mean, calm down?

491
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
Everybody could have been dead!

492
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,280
You do your work,

493
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,040
I'll do mine.

494
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,360
I can't do my work!

495
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,560
Make sure I can film and live!

496
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,880
My life was at stake!

497
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,080
I have to tell you something.

498
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,720
I wouldn't have said it while he was present.

499
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,440
He is responsible.

500
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,080
He is guilty.
-Who?

501
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,720
The director.

502
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
He was always yelling; "Be naturally.

503
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,880
The more naturally, the more frightning."

504
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,640
And you can see, he got it his

505
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,520
natural and frightning way.

506
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,760
Bloody hell.

507
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,960
The world is beautiful, isn't it?

508
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,840
Bravo.

509
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,480
Watch out, you will drown!

510
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,440
Swim!

511
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,160
Come on, son!

512
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,720
Come on!

513
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,240
Do you hear me?

514
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,440
Jovan, my son!

515
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,440
Come over here!

516
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,240
I can't swim!

517
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,680
Don't be afraid, son.

518
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,440
Daddy is here with you.

519
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
Come on, swim!

520
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,720
First your leg.

521
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,480
Then your arm.

522
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
First left.

523
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
Then right.

524
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,280
I can swim!

525
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,800
Sure, I'm holding you.

526
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,800
Close your mouth.

527
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,120
Where is that boy?

528
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,800
He can really get on my nerves.

529
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,840
Son!

530
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,800
You can't live anymore in this country.

531
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,800
No, my dear.

532
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,280
You can't live here anymore...

533
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,440
with these lunatics,

534
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,360
mental cases,

535
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,080
psychopaths,

536
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,280
maniacs,

537
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,000
liars,

538
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,120
thieves,

539
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,920
criminals,

540
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,080
murderers...

541
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,440
Isn't it?
-No.

542
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,960
No, my love.

543
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,080
There.

544
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,240
There is nothing left

545
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,640
for an honest man in this country.

546
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,280
Nothing.

547
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,280
Under that supporting wall.

548
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,760
Are you sure?

549
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,120
Affirmative.

550
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,360
The disappearance of Marko Dren did

551
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,480
coincide with the secrete formula of

552
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,480
Tito's Yugoslavia.

553
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,480
Tito had lost his friends,

554
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,200
got ill,

555
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,160
and died 20 years later.

556
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,240
Third part - The War

557
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,800
1992 - Berlin

558
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,520
Ivan was hoping to find Soni.

559
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,640
Mircovic,

560
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,280
where does that odd patient come from?

561
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,800
Officially he is dead.
-Dead?

562
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,280
He looks very lively to me.

563
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,320
And what do you mean, officially?

564
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,560
According to the Yugoslavian embassy.

565
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,680
A man with the same name

566
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,400
died in 1941

567
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,240
during the bombings on Belgrado.

568
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,760
He was zoo keeper.

569
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,120
Do you know...

570
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,640
Look what he drew for me.

571
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,640
If he was an Indian,

572
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,160
he would be called

573
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,600
Man-who-surrendered.

574
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,240
He told me amazing things.

575
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,080
About being locked in a cellar all

576
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,920
that time.

577
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,400
The communism was one huge cellar.

578
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,280
The whole planet is a cellar.

579
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,800
I want to go to Portugal during the summer.

580
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,840
Maybe he knows an

581
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,920
underground highway.

582
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,760
Happy new year!

583
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,680
Happy new year, Ivan.

584
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,520
It's not happy.

585
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,160
Why are you constantly crying?

586
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,440
I want to go home,

587
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,200
to Yugoslavia.

588
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,080
There is a war going on.

589
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,520
A terrible war.

590
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,760
I know.

591
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,960
Not the Second World War.

592
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,960
Over there, there is only

593
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,760
our war.

594
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,640
The second world war

595
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,240
ended 50 years ago.

596
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,760
And the Germans won.

597
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,600
No, they lost.

598
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
What do you mean, lost?

599
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,680
Why are they celebrating then?

600
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,840
You are lying, doctor.

601
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,520
You are working for the Germans.

602
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,520
Isn't it?

603
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,440
Yes, but these aren't the same Germans.

604
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,840
You are a traitor!

605
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,640
What do you call me?

606
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,800
A traitor?

607
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,880
You shall see who is the traitor.

608
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,920
I didn't want to show you,

609
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
but look for yourself.

610
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,800
Who's on the arrestation orders

611
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,200
of Interpol? Look! Who is it?

612
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,840
My brother Marko...

613
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,520
and Natalija.

614
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,360
The police from the whole world is

615
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,440
looking for them for 30 years.

616
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,760
They killed people in a basement,

617
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,560
did weapon traffic...

618
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,080
The boxes carried the symbol of a monkey.

619
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,040
Maybe your Soni.

620
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,520
Where are you going? Ivan!

621
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,320
What's wrong?

622
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,200
He lied to me!

623
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,320
Who lied to you?

624
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,320
My own brother!

625
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,280
Don't act like an idiot.

626
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,600
We are no children. We are going back.

627
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,200
Come back!

628
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,440
Dammit!

629
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Don't be stupid.

630
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,200
Come back.

631
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,520
Wait, Ivan!

632
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,680
I can't go any further.

633
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,120
I can't go any further.

634
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,880
I'm dying.

635
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,800
Wait...

636
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,520
Stop, please.

637
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,520
How do we get to Italy?

638
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,840
We are lost.

639
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,440
Where are you from?
-From Bosnia.

640
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Where are you heading?

641
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,520
Yugoslavia.

642
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,840
That doesn't exist anymore.

643
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,400
What do you mean, anymore?

644
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,120
The end. No Yugoslavia anymore.

645
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,200
Can we join you?

646
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,240
Yes, for a thousand marks.

647
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,400
They paid as well.

648
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,400
Ivan, wait...

649
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,400
Let's go to Italy.

650
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,320
We shall eat spaghetti

651
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,040
and drink wine.

652
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,800
Let's go with them.

653
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,360
What does he mean,

654
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,680
there is no Yugoslavia anymore?

655
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,440
I can't go on, Ivan.

656
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,280
I'm going to Italy or to hell.

657
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,600
I can't go on.

658
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,360
Wait!

659
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,400
Wait for me!

660
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,320
Take care of yourself, Ivan!

661
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,440
Where...

662
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,080
have you been?

663
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,240
Blood...

664
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,760
Has anyone seen my Jovan?

665
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,480
No.

666
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,200
Load!

667
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,760
Fire!

668
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,600
I can't find him...

669
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,040
Bloody fascist swines.

670
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,840
I don't have the time to bargain

671
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,600
for some percents.

672
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,920
I came to help you,

673
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,720
not connected to our religious,

674
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,680
national or political disagreements.

675
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,760
I ask only one thing:

676
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,040
don't yell at me. Be polite.

677
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,360
We'll sign an agreement

678
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,040
like civilized people.

679
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,400
You need me, not vice versa.

680
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,040
Don't worry.

681
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,160
The Serbs kill the Croats,

682
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,000
the Croats kill the Serbs.

683
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,800
-You don't have to thank me.

684
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,680
You are young, you don't understand.

685
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,560
I understand it very well.

686
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,600
You have been abroad for so long,

687
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,480
you forgot our language.

688
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,840
To expensive. Do you understand?

689
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,360
You are asking to much.

690
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,200
I only ask the minimum.

691
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,200
3marks for a bullet?

692
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,120
The minimum.

693
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,440
100$ for a granade?

694
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,720
Buy it from teh Hungarians, idiot!

695
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,800
Ivan...

696
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,280
My brother...

697
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,600
What are you doing, Ivan?

698
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,280
Are you out of your mind?

699
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,760
Fratricide is a sin.

700
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,600
No, Ivan!

701
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,480
Forgive me, Ivan.

702
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,240
I have saved your life three times.

703
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,240
I have saved your life three times.

704
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,520
You are hurting me! Stop it!

705
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,480
Forgive me, Ivan.

706
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,200
God is watching everything, Ivan.

707
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,640
God will punish you.

708
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,720
He will punish you!

709
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,680
Lord, please forgive me.

710
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,120
What are you doing?

711
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,320
Darling...

712
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,960
A war

713
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,280
is no war

714
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,280
until the brother

715
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,360
kills his brother.

716
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,800
Darling.

717
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,280
Come on, bitch!

718
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,400
Mister, this is my husband.

719
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,880
Move, I said!

720
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,960
What are you waiting for?

721
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,200
Lay down!

722
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,400
Comrade commander,

723
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,160
our prisoners are 16 Tsjetnics,

724
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,480
30 Ustaji's

725
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,440
and 3 blue helmets.

726
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,240
Plus 2 making profits out of the war

727
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,280
with a Mercedes.

728
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,040
What are we doing?

729
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,800
making profits...

730
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,800
Slaughter immediately!

731
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,960
Orders accomplished, comrade Blacky!

732
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,440
Searched their pockets, soldiers disarmed.

733
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,360
The passports of the weapon salers.

734
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,120
What do I do with all these people?

735
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,840
Lead them to the pit.

736
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,960
No trace of Jovan?
-No.

737
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,200
No trace at all...

738
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,600
I protest, sir.

739
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,200
Me too, comrade.

740
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,920
I'm no "comrade", sir.

741
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,920
And I'm no "sir", comrade.

742
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,240
What are you?

743
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,440
A Ustaji, A Tsjetnic, a guerilla?

744
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,880
I'm Petar Popara Blacky.

745
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,320
From what army, comrade?

746
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,560
My own army.

747
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,040
Do you have a superior?

748
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,600
Yes, my fatherland.

749
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,400
Bloody fascist swine.

750
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,880
Marko, brother!

751
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,960
Natalija...

752
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,080
darling!

753
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,360
I can't find Jovan anywhere.

754
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,920
My soul is bleeding.

755
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,160
My soul is bleeding.

756
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Do you see this, boy?

757
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,240
who might have come up with this?

758
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,960
Nobody.

759
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,800
Presume you had

760
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,880
a son as well,

761
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,200
a baby monkey.

762
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,880
And someone takes him from you.

763
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,400
And you are looking for him for years,

764
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,320
but you can't...

765
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,160
find him anywhere.

766
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,760
Then tell me...

767
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,800
isn't that sad?

768
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,720
And what a son I had!

769
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,600
So you remember my Jovan?

770
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,600
What was he like?

771
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,600
A handsome guy.

772
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,320
Exactly my portrait

773
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,720
There is no sun anymore

774
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,680
There is no moon anymore

775
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,560
Daddy! Daddy!

776
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,800
Do you hear that?

777
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,480
Do you hear that?

778
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,000
Jovan!

779
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,480
My son!

780
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,760
Daddy's little sun!

781
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,400
Jovan, my son!

782
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,520
I knew I would find you.

783
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,200
Who has organised all this?

784
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,920
Mummy.

785
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,760
Cheers!

786
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,480
Old chap!

787
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,200
Did she really have to be here?

788
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,760
The wife of my friend? Are you crazy?

789
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,880
Don't you think I can see?

790
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,200
Wat?

791
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,720
I'm not stupid.

792
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,120
They are married.

793
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,600
Old friend!

794
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,840
Natalija has been a bit neglected.

795
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,800
Think about it.

796
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,480
The wife of my friend.

797
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,360
Hello.

798
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,480
Louder, that music!

799
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,760
Bravo, Vera!

800
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,680
We will burry the past.

801
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,680
What did he grow. Look at it.

802
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,400
Nice,huh?

803
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,360
Fifteen, Vera.

804
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,400
What do you mean, fifteen? Twenty.

805
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,160
No, fifteen.
-Twenty.

806
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,680
Fifteen!
-Twenty!

807
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,720
I know how old my son is.

808
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,200
She can really get on my nerves.

809
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,440
Darling!

810
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,200
Sister!
-Bato!

811
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,720
My dearest brother!

812
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,160
You are dancing!

813
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,920
Look, Marko, he's dancing.

814
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,720
Look, Marko!

815
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,480
We dance together!

816
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,600
Do you forgive me?

817
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,000
To forgive I can,

818
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,600
but to forget not.

819
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,920
We build new houses

820
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,640
with red roofs.

821
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,960
where storks make their nest,

822
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,280
and with the doors wide open for our guests.

823
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,960
We thank the eath who feeds us,

824
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,960
the sun who warms us,

825
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,800
and the fields which remind us

826
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,000
of the green grass at home.

827
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,600
With pain, sadness and joy

828
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,760
shall we remember our country

829
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,920
when we will tell our kids stories

830
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,200
which start like all stories:

831
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,760
"Once upon a time there was a land..."

832
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,800
This story never ends...

833
01:19:00,400 --> 01:20:44,400
