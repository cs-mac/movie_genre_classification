Oh, I've got your number.

5
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,452
I know a way you can make
a lot of money real fast.

- Yes.

When do we start?

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,543
Admit it,
you miss this a little bit.

11
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:17,545
You signed me up
to take the S.A.T.'s?

12
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:19,413
- Who are you?
- I'm your sister.

13
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:20,631
It breaks my heart to think

14
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,249
that you're not living
your ideal life.

15
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:23,417
I wanna help you do that.

16
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:24,385
How?

17
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:25,920

25
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:37,965

Thank you.

Kaldrick:
How is he?

71
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:32,630
Without more tests,
it's hard to say.

72
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:36,300
Then why aren't you
doin' those tests?

73
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,417
Your father's
insurance provider

74
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,886
is refusing to cover his care.

75
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,721
They're claiming
he missed a payment.

76
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,473
The hospital needs proof
his bill can be paid

77
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,024
before we continue
to treat him.

Kaldrick:
You want proof?

80
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,112
Do you know who I am?
Do you?

81
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:51,098
Here, you want proof?
Here's your proof.

82
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,099
Take that.

83
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,100
I am just doing my job, sir.

84
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,434
Your job is to take care
of my father!

85
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:56,937
He needs something,
you get it for him.

86
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,123
This is not some bum
off the streets!

87
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,274
Matter of fact,
get him his own room.

88
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,293
I don't want him sharing a room

89
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,276
with these other people.

90
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:04,295
He shouldn't be moved
right now.

91
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,297
Then move them!
Get them another room!

92
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,298
This one belongs
to Walter Dougan.

93

94

95
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,634
Christopher:
Stop!

96
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,088
Just let me handle this.

97
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:19,310
I apologize for his behaviour.

98
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:21,128
He's obviously very upset.

99
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,796
But I assure you
it's in your best interest

100
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:23,847
to provide this patient

101
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,483
with the highest level of care
available.

102
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,601
Do you really wanna be
the reason

103
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:30,270
this hospital gets sued?

104
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:40,748
You wanna help me with this?

105
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,205
Charlotte: What do you mean?
Where did they take him?

106
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,707
All:(Talking all at once)
Uh... well... they um...

107
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,258
You didn't ask?

108
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,660
(Talking over one another)

109
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:54,995
One of you didn't go with him?

110
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,329
I mean, it all happened
pretty quickly...

111
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,715
I think we just need
to concentrate

112
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:59,099
on what to do now.

113
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,300
I'll handle it.

114
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,301
Raquel: I get that you're
upset - I'm upset also...

115
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:04,521
Charlotte: I'll handle it!
(Door bangs shut)

116
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,057
I guess she's gonna handle it.

Ugh!

00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:28,361
These Will Arnett

Nick: Well, you know, it's
today all day, right?

127
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,202
Maybe let them eat breakfast

No! Uh...

It was an accident.

Detective: Why didn't
you try putting it out?

167
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,790
I did.

168
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,992
Not with the fire extinguisher
in your kitchen you didn't.

169
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:50,277
And why were you
drinking a beer

170
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,211
on the front lawn

171
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:52,679
when first responders arrived?

172
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,164
It was hot.

173
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,049
In your statement
you claimed the fire started

174
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,118
while you were making tea.

175
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,953
It was less hot then.

176
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:02,089
So after your kitchen
exploded into flames

177
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,223
you moved towards the fridge,

178
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:06,727
away from the exit,
to grab a beer?

179
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,178
It's illegal to have
bad judgment?

180
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,813
Why didn't you call 911?

181
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:11,464

Connor:
No. I have money.

Why would I commit
insurance fraud?

191

It doesn't make any sense.

192
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,115
You're the star
of a network tv series

00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,829
Oh, well, you'll have
such a great time here.

324
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:18,247
Cameron sure did.

325
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:20,116
But, uh, I should go,
I'm late for a lecture.

326
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,084
Whose class?

327
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:22,151
Mine.

328
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:23,536
Anyway, it was really nice
to meet you.

329
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:24,954
Good luck.

330
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,839
Thanks. Bye, Cameron.
Bye.

331
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:35,030
(Clears throat)
So... campus tour?

332
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,650
Yeah.

333
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,487
Good morning.

334
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,622
Yup.

335
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:43,706
Mark:
Or not...

336
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,791
What's wrong?

337
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:47,243
One of my friends
just got arrested.

338
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,744
For what?

339
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,447
Arson and insurance fraud?

340
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,833
(Laughs)

341
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:54,967
(Laughs)

342
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,752
Sorry, that's not appropriate.

343
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:59,589
No, I don't know what
the appropriate reaction is.

344
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,225
Well, are you okay?
Do you need to leave?

345
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,677
How close are you?

346
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,896
He's an ex-boyfriend.

347
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:09,482
Well, I think he's guilty.

348
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,234
He has family
taking care of it.

349
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,686
I think I just need
to keep busy.

350
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,688
I can keep you busy.

351
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,440
With restaurant-things,
I meant.

352
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,492
I meant restaurant-things,
I swear.

353
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:23,578
(Dull thud of loud
thumping music)

354
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,649
What?

355
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:39,129
Manny: Sup.
Raquel: Sup.

356
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,318
Did I give him a raise
I don't know about?

357
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:47,937
<i>Sabrina:</i>
<i>There's no space in here!</i>

358
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,222
This is not a room
for two people!

361
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:52,525
full of workout gear?

362
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,060
Who are you kidding?
We're throwing this out.

<i>Nick:</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

364
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:56,445
Sabrina: You need to
buy more shelves!

365
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:57,813
You need to buy more shelves,
you need a dresser, or...

366
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:00,316
<i>Nic:</i><i>Okay, calm down.</i>
<i>I'll buy you a dresser.</i>

367

Oh! Everything's so easy

369
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,221
Nothing!

370
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,156
You sound weird.
How's it going?

371
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,358
Has the network guy
got you your own pilot yet?

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,711
<i>Nick:</i><i>Turns out it's his daughter's</i>
<i>bat mitzvah.</i>

373
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,896
Ugh!
That's almost better.

374
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,165
There's probably dozens
of celebrity parents there.

375
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,717
<i>Nick:</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm...</i>

376
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,218
Super-psyched about it.

377
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,087
Planner: No! No, no, no!
No phones!

378
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:22,538
Oh, I-I gotta go.

379
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,039
Uh, sorry, I just...

380
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,675
S-s-s-stop! Stop.

381
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:26,676
No, no, no.
You can't take off your head

382
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:27,977
in front of the children.

383
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,146
But the children
are around all the time.

384
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,848
Well, Chuck never
breaks character.

385
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,100
So? I'm not...

386
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:35,851
Do you see that girl
right there?

387
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,403
This is the most important day
<i>of her life.</i>

388
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,721
Today she leaves
childhood behind

389
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:40,389
and she becomes a woman.

390
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,325
Nick:
If she is a woman,

391
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,359
then she knows full well

392
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,527
there's a man inside
this bunny costume,

393
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,745
who's sweating

394
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:47,613
and would love to take
his head off.

395
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:50,900
You take the head off,
you don't get paid.

396
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,408
Detective:
All right,

397
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,712
give Dr. mcdreamy here
his phone call.

398

<i>He didn't do it!</i>

<i>his house down.</i>

401

Detective:
How do you know?

402
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:09,802
Because I did.

403
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,608
Charlotte: It was me.
I set the fire.

404
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,227
That's not what
your brother says.

405

<i>he's probably saying that-</i>

Connor:
She's lying!

408
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,650
She had nothing to do with it!

409
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,368
It was me!

<i>Detective:</i>
<i>Why'd you set it?</i>

413
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:35,825
A lot of reasons.

414
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:40,297
I suffer from depression,
among other things.

415
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:42,399
Connor: Why would she
set my house on fire?

416
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,449
That doesn't make any sense!

417
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,502
What does she have to gain?

418
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:48,989
Charlotte: Mostly I just
wanted to watch it burn.

419
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,590
Sometimes the only way
I can let go

420
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:51,891
is to release something

421
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,661
that feels more out of control
than I do.

422
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,813
What did my brother say?

423
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,366
Insurance money?

424
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,987
(Inaudible conversation)

425
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,358

426
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,527
Can I talk to you
about the new drink special?

427
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,745
Raquel:
Mm-hmm.

428
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,286
Hey, is Manny running scrips?

429
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,486
Scripts?
Like...

430
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,838
What, do you mean
screenwriting?

431
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,008
No, "scrips" scrips.
Like is he a "pharmacist"?

432
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,293
What do you mean?

433
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:27,427
A drug dealer -
is he a drug dealer?

434
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,828
Does he deal drugs?

435
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,463
Uh, no, I don't think so.

436
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,299
More importantly,
is he dealing drugs in here?

437
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:35,185
No. Where is this
coming from?

438
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,469
The guy makes
$8 dollars an hour

plus tip-out,

440
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,671
how can he afford
that spaceship

441
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,640
sitting outside?

442
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:42,192
Well, I'm sure
it's a lot more practical

443
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:43,676
than it looks.

444
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:46,363
You know, it probably
gets great mileage.

445
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:49,015
(Sighs) No, it doesn't add up.

446
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,117
You don't think
he's stealing from me?

447
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,070
No. (Laughs)
Manny stealing?

448
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:55,238
Come on, no.

449
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,357

472
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:56,049
filling in for a friend.

473
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:58,184

<i>So...</i>

484

Taylor seems... beautiful.

485
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,626
How long did you guys
go out for?

486
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,878
Four years?

487
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,780
And when did you break up?

488
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,799
Six... seven months ago?

489
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,552
Wow, so recent.

490
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,555
What happened?

491
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:39,976
Taylor's...Exhausting -
in a number of ways.

492
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:41,227
Ah.

493
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,729
Uh, not like that.
I mean...

494
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:43,897
She's exhausting emotionally.

495
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,148
Uh-huh.

496
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,066
How old is she?
She's like twenty-three,

497
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,634
and she's already
going after her phd,

498
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:50,236
and giving lectures?

499
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,439
Uh, yeah, I guess.

500
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,324
How can you like
someone like her

501
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:55,942
and someone like me?

502
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,410
I mean, you're clearly
still into her,

503
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:58,478
I'm not-
by the way.

504
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,946
You're both smart.

505
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,247
What is this?
What am I to you?

506
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:03,750
Is this serious
or is this just convenient?

507
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:04,868
What part of our relationship

508
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,454
has been convenient so far?

509
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,172
Okay, yes, I am still
attracted to Taylor...

510
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,040
She's attractive.

511
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:13,042
And a cuckoo-bird -
she's crazy.

512
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,093
I broke up with her

513
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,596
because I wanted
to break up with her.

514

Dr. raynor: You know, the
way he described you

522
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,651
I thought you'd be taller.

523
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,954
He said you had some questions
I might be able to answer?

524

Yeah.

00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:15,961
Is it though?

645
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:16,996
You could get your green card,

646
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:18,063
I'd get a bigger paycheck...

647
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:19,965
Half of which I'd send
to you every month.

648
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,034
Let the air force
pay the bills,

649
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:23,669
you just focus on acting.

650
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:25,537
What happens when you get back?

651
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,705
We buy a house with a fence

652
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:27,890
and have a bunch of kids?

653
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:29,258
I don't know.
I mean, we just...

654
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,927
We figure that out then.

655
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:38,818
<i>You keep this ring...</i>
<i>And you think about me,</i>

656
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,853
cuz I'm gonna be
thinking about you.

657
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:44,023
<i>Maybe it was a mistake</i>
<i>to get married this quick,</i>

658
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,942
but I know, sitting here
looking at you right now,

659
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:51,030
that getting unmarried
would be a way bigger one.

660
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,199
<i>So what do you say?</i>

661
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,868
(Circus music plays)

662
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,170
Nick: So I'm having
sex with this girl

663
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,206
and she informs me
that the only way

664
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,874
she can have an orgasm
is if I choke her.

665
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,042
Stop!

666
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:04,510
You are in a bunny suit!

667
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,262
You gotta do Chuck's material!

668
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,097
Chuck told me I could do
my own material!

669
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,599
You cannot, sir.
You cannot.

670
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:11,934
He didn't leave you a set list?

671
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,435
Yeah, yeah,
he left me set list.

672
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:14,637
You wanna see his set list?

673
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,604
Here it is!

674
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,357
Raccoons, me and Santa,
flippity-flop.

675
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,892
What am I supposed to do
with this?

676
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:21,227
I don't know,
but you cannot go out there

677
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:23,195
and tell jokes about
sexual asphyxiation

678
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,898
to a bunch
of 12-year-olds!

679
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,267
(Smattering of applause)

680
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:29,935
Magician: Francis is done.
You gotta get out there.

681
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:31,620
Nick: Wait! I don't have any material?
What do you want me to do?

682
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,438
Listen, it's not my problem.

683
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,324
Don't do magic.

684
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:40,112
Ladies and gentleman,
girls and boys,

685
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:43,499
direct from carrotsberg,
north hareolina,

686
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,118
<i>please put your paws</i>
<i>together for...</i>

687
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,556
The wacky joke-stylings of
Mr. barnsworth p. Bunnyton!

688
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:53,559
(Kids applaud and cheer)

689
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,563
Magician:
Hop! Hop!

690
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,302
Nick:
Thanks. Thank you...

691
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:05,905
(Mouths "go")

692
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:09,074
Okay, so the other day,
I'm having...

693
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,311
Milkshake the other day...

694
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,496
With this girl
and she informs me

695
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:18,534
the only way she can
enjoy her milkshake is

696
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,369
if I'm holding her hand.

697
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:21,987
(Kids chuckle and snicker)

698
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,673
Uh... so I'm holding her hand
and it's not going great...

699
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:26,158
But in my defense,

700
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,994
what about this suggests
"good at hand holding"?

701
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,329
(Kids laugh)

702
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:33,966
I mean if you're gonna cast
your fantasy hand-holder,

703
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:37,937
why would you pick a James
Franco-looking bunny rabbit?

704
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:41,523
Uh, and not a... dimply,
Justin bieber?

705
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:42,858
(Kids cheer and applaud)

706
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,362
Yeah! Or uh...
The vampire show guy?

707
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,731
<i>(Kids cheer)</i>
<i>Yeah! There it is!</i>

708
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,785
Now imagine those two
holding hands!

709
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,787
(Kids cheer and applaud)

710
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,022
You guys know
what I'm talking about!

711
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,242
<i>Beth:</i><i>Thank you so much,</i>
<i>Professor raynor!</i>

712
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:02,861
Thank you!
I'll see ya!

713
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,163
That guy is amazing!

714
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:05,331
Right?

715
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,632
I can't believe all the things

716
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:07,699
that he's done with his life!

717
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:09,885
And he still finds time
to write books?

718
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:13,589
He's so cool and smart
and funny and sexy.

719
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,673
Hey! Easy.

720
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,041
Are they all like that?

721
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,426
Well, Professor raynor's
on another level,

722
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:18,877
but everyone else
is pretty amazing

723
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:19,895
in their own way.

724
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:21,730
Cam, why are you
doing this to me?

725
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:23,899
Why are you torturing me
like this?

726
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,384
Even if I could get in,

727
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:26,685
and even if I could somehow

728
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:27,736
Beth-
figure out child care,

729
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,656
how could I ever afford tuition
like ever?

730
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:31,723
Oddly enough,

731
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,025
they have a whole department

732
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:36,061
devoted to helping you
figure that out.

733
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:37,863
(Sighs)

734
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:39,448
I just...
I just can't picture it.

735
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,868
I can't picture actually
being a student here.

736
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,869
Come with me,

737
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:46,789
I wanna show you something.

738
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,008
Come on, get in.

739
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,459
Where are we going?

740
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,044
You'll see.

741
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:00,302
Can you picture it now?

742
00:29:00,304 --> 00:29:02,254
<i>Beth:</i>
<i>Oh my God!</i>

743
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:05,224
Cam: I know, so many
boring things to memorize.

744
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,526
<i>Beth:</i><i>Can we go</i>
<i>to the periodical section?</i>

745
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,111
Yeah, sure.

746
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:12,314
Beth:
Isn't this amazing!

747
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:15,901
Cam: Yeah, everyone
else clearly thinks so.

748
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:17,453
I wanna show you something.

749
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,904
Is it a book?

750
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,324
What're you doing?

751
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:24,776
Did you bring your camera?

752
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:27,379
My phone has a camera.

753
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,450
Wait - you're not
just doing this

754
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:33,135
to compete with Taylor,
are you?

755
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,921
Do you honestly care?

756
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:37,840
No. No, I don't.

757
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,809
Nick: You know why?
It's the...

758
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:43,462
Kids:
The United States of bananas!

759
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:45,647
Nick: All right, thank you!
That's my time!

760
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,150
I'm bunny p. Bunnerson
or whatever!

761
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:50,235
Hey, thanks!
You guys have a great night!

762
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:52,404
(Kids cheer and applaud)

763
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,859
You did it, man!

764
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,777
Hey, you better
get back out there

765
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,529
before they start
tearing the place apart.

766
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,030
Go! I don't have
any new material,

767
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:03,782
so I can't-
go!

768
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:04,983
Okay!

769
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:09,088
(Kids cheer and applaud loudly)

770
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:13,158
I think of all my bags,

771
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,544
my favourite bag is the one bag
I keep under the sink.

772
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:16,678
(Kids chuckle)

773
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,163
And all the other bags
know it's my favourite

774
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,631
because they have to inside it.

775
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,016
(Kids laugh)

776
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:23,685
So their like, "man, next time
bunny needs to take a banana

777
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,854
and a juice box somewhere,
I'm a goner!

778
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,855
(Kids laugh)

779
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:28,974
But look at that
old miracle mart bag...

780
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:30,859
He ain't even scared!

781
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,444
(Kids cheer and applaud)

782
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:33,612
(Laughs)

783
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:35,864
Right?! Right?!

784
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,847
Hey, Walter.

785
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:12,818
<i>Hey.</i>

786
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,670
It's Sean, your son.

787
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,890
<i>You had a stroke.</i>

788
00:31:18,892 --> 00:31:22,861
The doctor said the right side
of your body is paralyzed.

789
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:25,197
<i>It's affected your speech,</i>

790
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,766
so you can't talk right now.

791
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,419
<i>But hopefully...</i>

792
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:35,307
<i>That's okay.</i>

793
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,460
You rest, I'll talk.

794
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:47,469
There's something
I need to tell you.

795
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:57,929
(Takes a deep breath,
then sighs)

796
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,599
Dawna came by,

797
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:05,053
she told me to make sure
I told you that.

798
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:08,540
(Tearful)
She says she loves you.

799
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,568
Nick: Ooh! Perfect!
Thanks, girls!

800
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,536
Okay. Bye!

801
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:22,903
Thank you. Thank you now.
See ya!

802
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,238
Here you go.

803
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,957
Five hundred bucks -
worth every penny.

804
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,126
What? Five-
five hundred dollars?!

805
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:30,878
I haven't made this much money
doing stand-up comedy ever.

806
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,580
They usually pay me
in drink tickets.

807
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,599
How great for you.

808
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,634
It is!
Thank you!

809
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:37,918
Hey! You know,
I can talk to the people

810
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,187
who run these things.

811
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,855
We can get you in the regular
rotation if you like.

812
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:41,922
- Yeah?!
- Yeah.

813
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,724
You have to sign this
exclusivity thing,

814
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:45,710
but after that the money
just starts rolling in.

815
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:47,228
Well, I don't know
if I can do that.

816
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,112
I'm still trying to actually...

817
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:49,780
Look, look.
When I started out,

818
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:51,599
I thought I was gonna be
the next Jason latimer,

819
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:53,668
Andrew goldenhirsh,
or Shawn farquhar.

820
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,752
I don't know any of those...

821
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:57,438
But at a certain point,
I realized...

822
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,958
Maybe I'm not world class,
you know?

823
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,776
And once I realized that,

824
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,295
and committed
to this mitzvah circuit,

825
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:06,714
oh, my life got
a whole lot easier.

826
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:07,882
So what I'm saying is,

827
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,717
maybe you set aside your dreams

828
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,802
of being the next Jeff Dunham

829
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:13,421
or Terry factor...

830
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:15,256
Those are both ventriloquists.

831
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:17,975
Just settle into the life
you're meant to have...

(Sighs heavily) I messed up.

949
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,047
I shoulda never started
working with infinite

950

00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:32,177
but I guess he got
a little potential.

Nah, see, it wasn't even like that.

956
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:35,931
So when I heard what
he did to your car,

957
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:37,816
I thought
if I stayed close to him,

958
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,134
then I could watch him,

959
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,686
make sure he didn't do
anything else.

960
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,739
It didn't exactly
work out that way.

961
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,407
Last night, in the studio,

962
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:46,909
he started recording this track

963
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:47,776
calling you out,

964
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:49,528
talking all kinds of nonsense.

965
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,364
And when I shut it down,
and I wouldn't let him,

966
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,366
things kinda went sideways.

967
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:56,084
Sideways how?

968
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,004
I got back to my crib...

969
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,756
He had torn it apart.

970
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,709
He took anything that looked
like it was worth something,

971
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:06,228
even something I took
from you when I left.

972
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,997
What the hell you take from me?

973
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,933
The hard drive.

974
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:15,687
That night at the studio...
With tariq.

975
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,805
You know,
I was mad at Walter...

976
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,106
I thought...

977
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,191
I don't even know
what I thought.

978
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,477
Did you watch it?

979
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,562
Did you watch it?

980
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:29,952
Man, I've known you
since we were four years old.

981
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:32,871
I didn't need to watch it.

982
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:40,412
♪

983
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,030
♪ just a paper cut ♪

984
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:45,834
So now you're telling me
infinite's got it.

985
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:48,470
Yeah. I messed up, man.
I know it.

986
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,372
I'm sorry, man.

987
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,709
Beth: Okay, but if I go,
(Cam's phone buzzes)

988
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,011
What courses should I take?

989
00:39:56,013 --> 00:39:57,479
What would you take
if you were me?

990
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,015
Kevin: Beth! Beth!
They have Simon!

991
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:01,149
Beth: What?!
Simon: Beth! Beth!

992
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,652
Beth:
What? Hey! Hey! Stop!

993
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,942
Who was that?
Who took him?!

994
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,493
Eddie:
Child protective services.

995
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:14,830
Kevin: They showed me their
badges, I didn't know what to do!

996
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,235
Connor:
Here is to my sister,

997
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:21,703
the bravest person that I know.

998
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:23,222
I told you, I don't drink.

999
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:24,873
Come on, come on,
you have to have just one drink,

1000
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,124
celebrate our victory!

1001
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:28,010
I can't!

1002
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:31,129
Okay, all right.
Fine, I'll have yours.

1003
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,347
Mm!

1004
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:39,137
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did today.

1005
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,639
I mean it.
No one's...

1006
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:44,810
Nobody's ever stood up
for me like that.

1007
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:48,063
Connor, there's no one else
in the entire world

1008
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:51,033
I care more about than you.

1009
00:40:51,818 --> 00:40:53,035
What?

1010
00:40:55,071 --> 00:41:00,125
I've just never felt this
close to someone before.

1011
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,661
I love you, Charlotte.

1012
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,668
I love you, too.

1013
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:10,669
