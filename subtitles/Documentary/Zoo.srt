Everybody in the world
knows what I did.

772
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:20,151
I was evil.
I was evil because I...

773
01:04:20,276 --> 01:04:23,780
I had a love for my animals more
than most people do.

774
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:30,620
"Go away.
We don't want anything to do with you.

775
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:31,871
Just get out of our sight."

776
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:38,461
I wanted just to walk away from it
and leave the past in the past.

777
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,132
Because I had it made.

778
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:45,635
I had the job of a lifetime.

779
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:49,556
At 50, it's hard to start over again.

780
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:55,145
I studied Buddhism
for about three years.

781
01:04:57,897 --> 01:05:00,358
It's been around a hell
of a lot longer than God was ever around.

782
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,949
I still chant to this day.

783
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:15,790
So I got my beads out
and my book out.

784
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:19,753
You can wish it away...

785
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:24,382
But you have to concentrate.

786
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:31,598
I still want to do the farm life.

787
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,227
That's going to be me again.

Happy Horseman:
The sex was just a small component of it.

789
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:49,366
And by standing there talking to them,
in a way you're kind of connecting to them,

790
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:53,161
going... "I'm talking to you
on the same level

791
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:56,206
that you're kind of staring at me,

792
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,502
mammal to mammal."

Coyote:
If I sat down and tried to talk to Mr. Hands' family,

794
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,187
I'd find that rather difficult to do.

795
01:06:24,442 --> 01:06:27,737
I can't even fathom what kind of hurt

796
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:30,031
that they're feeling
over the whole thing.

797

H:
I do miss him.

798
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,178
A lot.

Jenny:
We didn't want anybody showing up here

801
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:23,918
who was part of that circle
who would want to adopt him.

802
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:32,010
So we made the decision
to geld him that night.

Jenny:
I was trying to understand about this whole issue.

806
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,469
So I started doing some research.

807
01:08:57,637 --> 01:09:03,393
In some of the things I read,
I came across the term zoophilia,

808
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:09,065
and I started kind of exploring that and, you know, 
doing a little bit more research about it.

809
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,818
And it was really interesting to me...

810
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,362
It was just interesting to me
to learn that there are people

811
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:22,245
who really have a love relationship
for an animal not of their species.

812
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:28,752
These people were talking
about the extreme and loving care

813
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:31,963
that they give their animal partner.

814
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:40,680
I-I don't yet quite know
how I feel about that.

815
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:51,733
But I'm right at the edge
of being able to understand it.
