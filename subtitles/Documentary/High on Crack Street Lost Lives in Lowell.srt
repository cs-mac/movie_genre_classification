4
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,289
They're waiting for you
in the drawing room, sir.

5
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,287
Thank you, Barnsby.

6
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,877
Oh, Barnsby?

7
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,131
I'd rather like you to join us,
if you don't mind.

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,434
Have you found Lady Ridgeley's jewels?

9
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,774
Yes, Inspector,
have you found my cabochon ruby?

10
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:26,193
No, Your Ladyship,
but I have found something else.

11
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,284
The identity of Lord Fenley's murderer.

12
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,083
Inspector, you're not trying to imply

13
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,797
that one of us could have actually
performed such a loathsome deed?

14
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,543
It's quite ridiculous.
I simply don't believe it.

15
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:52,640
Not only do I believe it, Mr Montrose,
but I have the evidence to prove it.

16
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,185
All of you had sufficient motive.

17
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,272
It could have been... any one of you.

18
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:07,438
You, Sir Derek, have been falsifying
the accounts of Finwick Industries

19
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,362
with the help of
your son-in-law Mr Foxwell.

20
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,905
And you were also aware

21
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,906
that Lady Ridgeley
was having an affair with Lord Fenley

22
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,878
which ended abruptly
when he resumed his dalliance

23
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,838
with Lady Foxcroft.

24
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:33,465
You see, she had stumbled upon
the knowledge that Barnsby was in truth

25
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,431
Lord Fenley's half brother

26
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,931
and the illegitimate father
of Mr Peter Montrose,

27
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,775
who was planning to gain control
of Fenley Industries

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,986
with the help of Mr Da Silva,

29
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,983
who risked bankruptcy
if the plot failed.

30
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,996
Yes, you all had motives.

31
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,536
Any one of you could have done it.

32
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,415
But only one of you did.

33
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,133
A person sitting in this room?
At this very moment?

34
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:14,801
Yes, Miss Kate, in this very room.

35
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,886
This ridiculous cat-and-mouse game
has gone on long enough!

36
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,272
Very well, then.

37
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,942
Lord Fenley's murderer...

38
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,863
Oh dear, oh dear.

39
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,032
Lights, Mr Paycock, please.

40
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,626
I'll have it fixed in no time,
no time at all.

41
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,966
I'd say that's highly unlikely.

42
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,712
Oh, dear.
Now we'll never know who did it.

43
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,636
It does seem rather obvious
who the murderer was.

44
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,183
Who, Miss Marple?
Do tell us. Was it Sir Derek?

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,725
I hardly think so, Miss Giles.

46
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,895
It's unlikely he would have
murdered his business partner,

47
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,269
not while he only had
49% of the business,

48
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,815
and the controlling interest

49
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,658
would have reverted to Lord Fenley's
sister, a bitter enemy of Sir Derek's.

50
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,072
I'll bet it was
that young blaggard Lord Peter.

51
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,161
Impossible, Major.
Excuse me, dear.

52
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,374
The only tracks leading to Lord Fenley's
estate that evening were bicycle tracks.

53
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,913
But he hated Lord Fenley.

54
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,661
Yes, but you forget,

55
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:32,257
young Peter had a birth defect which
caused a malfunction to the inner ear.

56
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,844
This loss of equilibrium in his
system would have made it impossible

57
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,589
for him to maintain his balance
on a bicycle.

58
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,262
Good night, Major.

59
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,308
Excuse me, Mrs Morley-Smith.
Good night, Dolly.

60
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,520
Good night, Jane.

61
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,936
I still say it was that awful butler.

62
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,731
It was Barnsby,
don't you think, Miss Marple?

63
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,026
- I most certainly do not.
- But the revolver in his drawer?

64
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,820
Barnsby had never been
to Lord Fenley's estate'

65
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,943
The footprints
on the night of the murder

66
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,662
led directly to the smaller bedroom
off the left wing

67
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,157
where Lord Fenley
frequently sought privacy.

68
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,082
Whoever killed him knew
how to go directly to that room.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,753
Well, then who did do it, Miss Marple?
Who murdered Lord Fenley?

70
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,837
Why, young Miss Kate, of course.

71
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,056
Why do you say Miss Kate?

72
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,392
Because when the body
of Lord Fenley was discovered,

73
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,888
the knife was firmly implanted
in the chest to the left.

74
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,062
A right-handed person
would have clearly been unable

75
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,810
to strike such a thrust
in that direction.

76
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,654
If you'd looked closely,
you would have noticed

77
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,823
Miss Kate was twirling her pearls
in her left hand.

78
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,540
Good night, Vicar. I'm sure you'll have
this contraption running in no time'

79
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,908
Good night, all.

80
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,247
She could be wrong, you know.

81
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,420
She's not. I've seen the picture.

82
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:53,201
I never would have guessed that ending.
That girl, she looked so nice.

83
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,917
Human nature, Cherry dear

84
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,915
The world of the cinema, the village,
it's all quite the same, really.

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,301
Listen to me, Marty.

86
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,265
I don't care what those tea-guzzling
limey sons of bitches are demanding,

87
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,352
those tea-guzzling limey sons of bitches
are gonna make this picture a hit.

88
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,518
So stop playing around
and give them what they want!

89
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,359
Look, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm the director

90
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,980
and if I want three dozen
poker-playing kangaroos with PhDs,

91
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,653
then you'd better damn well
go out and find them.

92
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,653
- Do I make myself clear?
- Absolutely.

93
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,906
<i>- How's Marina?
- Marina?</i>

94
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,452
She's just fine, Marty.

95
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,668
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, Bates.

96
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,749
Mrs Bantry, I really must apologise.

97
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,797
Marina's had to go for
a costume fitting up to town.

98
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,173
Miss Gregg was particularly anxious
that I should tell you how sorry she is

99
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,549
to have missed you today.

100
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,096
Of course, I quite understand.

101
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,267
By the way, what picture
are you over here to make?

102
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:01,735
- It's called Mary Queen of Scots.
- Really? How very interesting.

103
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,526
Marina was especially keen for me
to double-check with you personally

104
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,241
all the arrangements
for the village fete.

105
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,952
She's terrified no one's gonna come.

106
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,537
We are rather intruders here.

107
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,531
My dear Miss Zielinsky,

108
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,456
Miss Gregg's arrival has caused
considerable excitement.

109
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,375
It's not every day
we have a real-life film star

110
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,251
and her director husband living here
at St Mary Mead.

111
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,128
Oh, Jason, we were just
talking about you.

112
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,472
- Mr Rudd, Mrs Bantry.
- Mrs Bantry.

113
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,635
How do you do?

114
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,851
I cannot tell you how happy my wife
and I are to be in your house.

115
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,723
Mr Rudd, you must get it out of
your head that this is my house.

116
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,193
After the Colonel, my husband, died,
it was much too big for me.

117
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,313
And I'm much more comfortable
down at the lodge'

118
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,656
Well, I really must be on my way.

119
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,572
- Would you like some more tea?
- No more tea, thank you.

120
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,537
- Very nice to have met you, Mr Rudd.
- Very nice to meet you.

121
00:10:54,654 --> 00:11:00,332
No, no, no, please, please.
I think I can find my own way out.

122
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,500
Please give my regards to your wife.
Goodbye, Miss Zielinsky.

123
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,214
Mrs Bantry.

124
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,926
- Where's Marina?
- Upstairs, out like a light.

125
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,139
- Is she taking those damn pills again?
- Well, you shake her, she rattles.

126
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,978
I want her to be happy.
God knows, she's been through enough.

127
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,478
She'll be happy. Till she gets bored
playing the lady of the manor'

128
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,650
Ella!

129
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,069
Sorry.

130
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,445
Don't spoil it.

131
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,868
OK?

132
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,962
OK.

133
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,888
Now, boys.
Don't drink this too quickly.

134
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,727
Otherwise, you're going to have
very sore tummies.

135
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,516
Quite a turn-out.

136
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,235
More like Buckingham Palace
than Gossington Hall.

137
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,730
Mind you,
it plays havoc with the lawn.

138
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,075
Ah, good afternoon, Mrs Bantry,
Miss Giles.

139
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,038
- Afternoon, Major, Jane.
- Darling, Miss Giles.

140
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,409
- Do you think she'll come down?
- Who?

141
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,755
Marina Gregg, the film star!
Really, Miss Marple.

142
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,796
Well, I don't know anything
about film stars, Miss Giles,

143
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,967
but if this gathering is
any indication of her local interest,

144
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,308
I'm sure that Miss Gregg
won't disappoint her fans.

145
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,517
I do hope not.

146
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,228
I'm sure Mr Foxley, our dear postman,

147
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:28,100
will herald her arrival
with suitable fanfare.

148
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,286
<i>[brass band plays ”There's
No Business Like Show Business '9</i>

149
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,546
Steady, boys. Don't rush. Don't rush!

150
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,093
Miss Marple, you were right!

151
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,036
Can you turn this way, please?
Just one more?

152
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,379
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.

153
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,504
- Mrs Babcock?
- Yes?

154
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,974
Miss Gregg would like to thank
those of you that worked so hard.

155
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,139
Perhaps you'd like
to come up to the hall.

156
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,355
Yes, indeed! I'd be absolutely thrilled!
Thank you very much!

157
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,224
Isn't it exciting?

158
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,320
- You know, Wendy...
- Yes, I know, you met her once.

159
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,244
Oh!

160
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,869
Major, ladies, we'd be honoured
if you'd join us for refreshments.

161
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,372
- Yes, indeed. Most kind.
- We'd be delighted, wouldn't we?

162
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,383
She's so beautiful.

163
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,056
But not much of a shot, is she?

164
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,352
Oh, thank you, my friends.

165
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:36,353
My new, dear, wonderful, sweet friends,
thank you.

166
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,901
Marina.

167
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,327
Jason's screaming for you,
your guests are piling up.

168
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,327
Oh, but I'm having such fun.

169
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,545
Try a little restraint.

170
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,130
Perhaps I could borrow some of yours.

171
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:00,047
We seem to be sharing
so much these days.

172
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,341
Now, boys and girls,
on your marks.

173
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,887
Ready, steady, 90!

174
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:26,112
Roy! Come here. Come here, Roy!
Come here, boy. Come along.

175
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,738
That's a good boy. Sit. There.

176
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,663
Freddie Hawkins! Would you
kindly take control of your dog?

177
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,539
You know perfectly well
he should be held on his lead.

178
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,758
Sorry, Miss Marple.

179
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,424
Roy! Roy!

180
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:50,302
Oh, Miss Marple!
Oh, goodness. Are you alright?

181
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,851
That'll teach me to be dogmatic.

182
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:58,568
- Can I have one?
- Thank you very much.

183
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,652
- Can I have a spoon?
- Here's a spoon.

184
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,943
I assure you, Dr Haydock,
I'm perfectly alright.

185
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,695
Perhaps you'd care
to join the egg-and-spoon race.

186
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,537
It's just about to start.

187
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,784
- You had a nasty fall.
- Nonsense! I'm not even shaken.

188
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,287
In fact, I'm amazed nothing's broken.
You got away with just a sprain.

189
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,460
I never did discover
the secret of your bone structure.

190
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,175
Long brisk walks <i>as</i> a young woman,
I expect.

191
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,091
Well, you're not walking anywhere
for a few days.

192
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,715
I'll run you back in my car. That's it.

193
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,968
I'll fill you in on all the gossip
you'll miss up at the hall

194
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,437
- when I call round to see you tomorrow.
- Gossip?

195
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,603
I prefer to call it
a healthy interest in human nature.

196
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,986
- Cherry.
- Yes, Mr Bates.

197
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,326
See to that lot upstairs, will you?

198
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,195
They're doing their best
to drink us dry.

199
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,995
I'm afraid, Miss Gregg,

200
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,745
that it would seem that our committee
have always felt

201
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,544
that your films are a little,
how shall I say,

202
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,839
risqué for our monthly soirée
in the village hall.

203
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,389
- How sweet of you.
- Your lemonade, Vicar.

204
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,133
Oh, thank you. Most kind.

205
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,058
Marina honey, the mayor is upstairs.
I think you should...

206
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,024
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Do excuse me.
- Yes.

207
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,518
Excuse me.

208
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,361
Is this your first visit to
the United Kingdom, Mr Rudd?

209
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,946
Why, no, I've been...

210
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,120
Oh, what a divine necklace!

211
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,337
Well done, Mr Rudd.
First-rate show.

212
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,506
Ah, Mrs Babcock.
Mrs Babcock is our untiring secretary.

213
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,379
The Women's Institute
would be quite lost without her.

214
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,471
I'm sure she's been wonderful.

215
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,432
Now, Miss Giles. How about your cat?

216
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,302
- I keep forgetting its name.
- Matthew.

217
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,476
- That's right!
- </i> Your dear wife had a cat.

218
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,146
Yes, but it always
suffered from eczema.

219
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,237
Carrots. Mashed carrots
and a little warm milk works wonders.

220
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,951
Marina? Mrs Babcock, Miss Gregg.

221
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,285
Miss Gregg, Mrs Babcock.

222
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,282
- Mrs Babcock, lovely to see you.
- Oh, Miss Gregg.

223
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,710
I know this is very silly,
and I'm sure you don't remember,

224
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,087
not with all the millions of people
you meet...

225
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:35,137
No, no, no, of course not,
How could you? It was ages ago.

226
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,010
It was during the war.
I was in Plymouth in the Wrens

227
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,639
and you came over to entertain
all those marvellous Gls.

228
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,234
Oh, I remember it so well,
just like it was yesterday.

229
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,525
I told you I lost my borage,
last year in the frost?

230
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,445
I'm sorry about that.
You know what to do, don't you?

231
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,489
Cut it right down to the ground
in the...

232
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,830
Oh, Mr Rudd, I understand
that you are a film producer.

233
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:02,453
- No, sir. A director.
- ls there any difference?

234
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:11,428
Yes, sir. The producer supplies
all the money, the director spends it.

235
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,889
Then the producer yells at the director
for spending too much money,

236
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,804
the director doesn't pay attention
and goes on spending.

237
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,724
The director gets the credit,
the producer gets an ulcer.

238
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,518
It's all very simple. Excuse me.

239
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,617
<i>- It's Lola Brewster!
- It is?</i>

240
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,961
<i>Yes!</i>

241
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,462
<i>It is!</i>

242
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,878
Miss Brewster!

243
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:04,222
Uh-oh. Mary Queen of Sluts
and Baby Bernhardt under the same roof.

244
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,644
That's all we need.

245
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,643
Miss Brewster,
look this way.

246
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,733
Oh, I was so thrilled.
Absolutely thrilled.

247
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,656
You were wearing that wonderful
blue sparkling dress.

248
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,657
Do you remember what you sang?
I'll Be Seeing <i>You.</i>

249
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, I was a mad fan of yours.

250
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,461
How sweet.
How absolutely, perfectly sweet.

251
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,832
Oh, but then
the most awful thing happened.

252
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,335
Or I thought it was awful.
I was terribly upset.

253
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,431
Do you mean to say
you actually met Clark Gable?

254
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,723
Is he married at the moment or is it
just a rumour that he's a lonely person?

255
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,096
- Jason.
- Is that the fellow with the big ears?

256
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,393
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Major.

257
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,982
- Lola's here.
- What?

258
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,728
- Marty brought her.
- Why in the hell did he bring her here?

259
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,480
I wasn't ill, just poorly.
You know what I mean?

260
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,778
Then I had this idea.

261
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,197
You see,
I didn't have a ticket or anything“.

262
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,616
Save it for the Oscars.

263
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,742
But this is the most extraordinary part.
You'll never guess who my uncle was.

264
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,585
He was the stage door keeper.
Now isn't...

265
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,795
Jason, darling!

266
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,386
- My Svengali.
- Glad you could make it.

267
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,881
Where is sweet Marina?

268
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,062
Jason, baby. Nice spread you got here.

269
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,103
I ought to spread you across this room
for bringing her here.

270
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:35,196
Publicity, bubbie. That's what keeps
Martin N Fenn Productions in business.

271
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,111
I was in the theatre,
standing in the wings.

272
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,281
It was my first time there.
It was so exciting.

273
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,450
Oh, you were wonderful!

274
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,166
And when the curtain came down,
you gave me your autograph

275
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,457
and you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!

276
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,879
Oh, it was worth it a hundred times.
I've never forgotten it...

277
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:12,312
I do believe it was the most
exciting day of my life'

278
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,493
What a nice little story, dear.
Now what will you have to drink?

279
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,709
Jason makes a wonderful daiquiri,
you'll adore it.

280
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,872
Thank you.

281
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,379
Honey.

282
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,091
Oh, Jason, darling.
We'd like two of your special daiquiris.

283
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,586
Sure. Are you alright?

284
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,923
- I'm fine, Jinks.
- Are you sure?

285
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,642
Yes.

286
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,433
That's great.
Thanks, Miss Brewster.

287
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,022
Marina, darling! I didn't see you.

288
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,315
Why, Lola. What a delightful surprise.

289
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,359
You're looking as lovely as always.

290
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,359
Of course,
there are fewer lights on than usual.

291
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,202
In fact, any fewer
and I'd need a seeing-eye dog.

292
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,620
Oh, I shouldn't bother to buy one, dear.
In that wig you could play Lassie.

293
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,493
Same adorable sense of humour.

294
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,293
And I'm so glad to see you not
only kept your gorgeous figure,

295
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,461
but you've added so much to it.

296
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,676
What are you doing here so early, dear?

297
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,093
I thought the plastic surgery seminar
was in Switzerland.

298
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,638
Actually, darling, I couldn't wait
to begin our little movie.

299
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,850
You know the saying,

300
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,517
"Once an actress,
always an actress."

301
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,983
Oh, I do know the saying.
But what does it have to do with you?

302
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,478
Cute angel.

303
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:43,950
So do tell, how does it feel
to be back after being away so long?

304
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,992
Love your outfit, darling.

305
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,865
Drink, Mrs Babcock?

306
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,334
Mr Rudd is getting me one himself,
thank you.

307
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,124
What are you supposed to be,
a birthday cake?

308
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,668
Too bad everybody's had a piece.

309
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,011
- Can we have a big smile, ladies?
- Chin up, darling. Both of them.

310
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,130
A little bit closer, please, ladies.

311
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:13,187
Lola, dear, you know there really are
only two things I dislike about you.

312
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,647
Really? What are they?

313
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,984
- Your face.
- Thank you.

314
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,731
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you very much.

315
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,200
- I've never really tried one before.
- Enjoy it.

316
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,829
- Here you are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

317
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,290
How are my two favourite <i>stars</i>
getting along?

318
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,411
What are you trying to do,
give Marina another breakdown?

319
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,004
Why would I want to do
a thing like that, pumpkin?

320
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,500
Come on. Remember they used to grind
glass in each other's cold cream.

321
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,423
One would only kiss the other
if she had viral pneumonia.

322
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,297
They're professionals.
They take their job seriously.

323
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,766
- So did Attila the Hun.
- Marina, baby!

324
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,806
Oh, Marty, darling.

325
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,726
How thoughtful of you
to bring Lola to my party.

326
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:04,231
You know, I've always thought of Lola
<i>as</i> one of my oldest, oldest friends.

327
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,987
Jason, darling, I'm certainly looking
forward to working under you again.

328
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,531
Watch it, Lola.

329
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,033
Jason, how about a drink
with an old pal'?

330
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,207
- I only drink with friends.
- What am I, chopped chicken liver?

331
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,956
Bad enough forcing me
to use your wife in this picture,

332
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,005
but bringing her here with Marina
in the condition she's in.

333
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,672
- Think of the picture!
- I am!

334
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,638
- And the sanity of my leading lady!
- Bubbie, listen to me.

335
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,100
She's gonna be fine.
I'm looking out for our best interests.

336
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,140
Our best interests?

337
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,104
Hey, De Mille,
why don't you face reality?

338
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,270
When was the last time
Marina made a movie?

339
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,937
The advent of sound?

340
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,232
When did you direct a movie
that was any good?

341
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,525
- Well...
- Listen to me.

342
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,241
If Martin N Fenn wants to get
publicity for his two leading ladies,

343
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,282
he's gonna get it,
without any dissent.

344
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,656
Because the esteemed director
and his wife are only here

345
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,124
because of his good wishes.

346
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,337
And if he wishes, he can pull the plug
any time he wants, you got it?

347
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,705
- Whoopee.
- Good.

348
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,208
- So go and enjoy the party.
- You know what?

349
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,005
- What?
- You're a bastard.

350
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,675
Of course I'm a bastard.
I'm the producer.

351
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,140
Oh, Mr Rudd. I believe I've reached
some understanding

352
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,636
about the difference between
a producer and a director.

353
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,559
But who chooses the leading lady?

354
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,308
Whoever's sleeping with her.

355
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:27,814
Er, Vicar, may I introduce
our noted producer Mr Martin N Penn'?

356
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,067
I'm sure he'll tell you
everything you want to know.

357
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,330
What would you like to know,
Vicar, baby?

358
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,666
I'm sorry about your ulcers, Mr Fenn.

359
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,036
What?

360
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,960
Jason, we've got a problem upstairs.
That woman.

361
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,131
Marina.

362
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,242
Then the police came.

363
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,041
They took everybody's name.
They kept us there for hours, they did.

364
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,883
I just couldn't believe it.
I mean, she seemed as right as rain.

365
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:34,347
She was only five years older than me.
There was an awful flap.

366
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,262
Poor Mrs Babcock.

367
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,103
I mean, she just had one drink
and about five minutes later,

368
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,396
she sits down, sort of gasps...

369
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,359
...and then she's dead, poor thing.

370
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,195
What do you think of that?

371
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,236
Don't forget under
the curtains, Cherry dear.

372
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,993
- Miss Marple, I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

373
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,914
Well, me doing Saturdays
up at the hall,

374
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,258
I did so want to see
all those film stars.

375
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,346
- It's not going to upset you?
- No, Cherry dear. It won't upset me.

376
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,511
In fact, it might even prove useful.

377
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,009
Really?

378
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,058
Put that duster away and sit down
and tell me everything that happened.

379
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,682
- Well...
- Exactly as it happened.

380
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,481
Well, I was moving about...

381
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,945
Yes, of course,
but what precisely did you see?

382
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,073
Well...

383
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,694
<i>The whole village was there,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

384
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,242
<i>And there was a girl taking pictures.</i>

385
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,413
<i>Just about everybody. There was</i>
<i>Marine Gregg and her husband</i>

386
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,413
<i>Oh, I liked him.
I think he's smashing.</i>

387
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,086
<i>- Cherry, dear.
- Oh, sorry.</i>

388
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,801
<i>Then the secretery girl came up</i>
<i>with Heather Babcock</i>

389
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,920
<i>and Heather shook hands
with Miss Gregg</i>

390
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,095
<i>and then she went into a boring old</i>
<i>story about how they'd met years ago.</i>

391
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,847
<i>On and on she went. I thought</i>
<i>Miss Gregg was gonna fall asleep-</i>

392
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,975
Honestly, she did go on, so.

393
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,273
Then a few minutes later,
you served Heather a drink

394
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,237
and not long afterwards, she dies.

395
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,574
Oh, no. No, I didn't serve her.

396
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,692
<i>It was Mr Rudd.</i>

397
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,491
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you.

398
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,158
Enjoy it.

399
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,585
<i>I don't think she really liked it.</i>

400
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,130
Thank you, Cherry dear,
you've been very helpful.

401
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,427
- Have I?
- Extremely.

402
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,767
<i>- Oh, good.</i>

403
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,227
Oh, I'll get it.

404
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,447
- Morning, Cherry.
- Morning, Doctor.

405
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,361
Morning, Miss Marple. How's the leg?

406
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:06,207
Good morning, Dr Haydock.
You know, I think it's very much better.

407
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,162
Shall I do upstairs now,
or finish here in the lounge?

408
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,883
- This is the drawing room, Cherry dear.
- Sorry, drawing room.

409
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,923
- Upstairs, I think.
- Right.

410
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,797
Oh, later on, I'll bring you in
a nice cup of tea.

411
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,896
Poor Heather Babcock.

412
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,066
Mmm.

413
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,367
She was a patient of yours, wasn't she?

414
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,078
She was on my list.

415
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,290
- Heart trouble?
- Nothing wrong with her heart.

416
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,039
- Which does rather...
- Stick out your tongue.

417
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,006
- Say "aah".
- Aah.

418
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,048
- Put it back.
- Which does rather suggest poison.

419
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,012
I think we should leave that
to the coroner, don't you?

420
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,225
Glad to see you started my treatment.

421
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,847
Treatment?

422
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,395
Unravelling, aren't I right?

423
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,985
You will have your little joke,
Dr Haydock.

424
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,823
You can't pull the wool
over my eyes, dear lady.

425
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,615
Look at you. Your cheeks are pink,
your eyes bright.

426
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,113
You're enjoying yourself.
Isn't that so?

427
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,993
Dr Haydock, I would be very distressed

428
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,496
if I thought you believed
that the only excitement in my life

429
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,840
was predicated on the unfortunate fate
of helpless victims

430
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,427
who somehow seem to fall into my path.

431
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,299
Upon examination,
the deceased's body was found to contain

432
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,425
massive traces of a barbiturate.

433
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,851
Phenobarbital.
Unquestionably the cause of death.

434
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,646
Had she a medical history for which
such a drug could have been prescribed?

435
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,143
Virtually none, sir.

436
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,989
Apart from chickenpox as a child
and German measles during the war.

437
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,779
According to her doctor,
she was in excellent health.

438
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,159
Thank you.

439
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,085
Bearing in mind the evidence
we have heard,

440
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,799
I have no choice but to record
a verdict of murder by poison

441
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,510
at the hand of person
or persons unknown.

442
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,103
- Dermot!
- Hello, Aunt Jane.

443
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,354
My favourite nephew.
What a pleasant surprise.

444
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,727
What are you doing here?

445
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,481
- Why, I've come to see you.
- Or to enquire about Heather Babcock.

446
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,280
What would a chief inspector from
Scotland Yard be doing in St Mary Mead

447
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,779
if poor Heather
had died of natural causes?

448
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,655
Well, he might have been passing by

449
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,909
and suddenly had a craving
for some of your special peach jam.

450
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,503
Now, Dermot, you know very well
I haven't made peach jam

451
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,794
since Taphrina <i>deformans</i>
attacked my Russell reds.

452
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,965
Now come and sit down
and let's have a little chat, shall we?

453
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
<i>It was poison, wasn't it?</i>

454
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,261
Aunt Jane, you wouldn't mind very much
I suppose if I anyway began

455
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,685
by asking the question, would you?

456
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,150
The poison was apparently
an American barbiturate,

457
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,770
marketed under the name of Calmadon.

458
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,647
It appears the principal ingredient
of it is...

459
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,274
Phenylethylmalonylurea.

460
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,369
I know it from my days
at Bridge Hampton Hospital in the war.

461
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,238
Mixed with alcohol,
it causes respiratory depression.

462
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,368
A drop in blood pressure.
Feeble heartbeat. Quite deadly, in fact.

463
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,088
And you naturally knew the victim,
Babcock?

464
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,129
Ooh, yes. Of course.
She was a simple soul. Friendly enough.

465
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,299
A bit of a bore,
but you don't kill someone for that.

466
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,014
If you did,
there'd be no one left in the village.

467
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,438
Well! So you're not being
much help, Aunt Jane.

468
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,101
No, I realise that.

469
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,477
So Mrs Babcock refused
your offer of a drink?

470
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,228
Yes, she said Mr Rudd
was getting her one. I told you that.

471
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,946
- And Miss Gregg?
- It's funny you should say that.

472
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,236
- Funny?
- Well, not funny.

473
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,530
Kind of strange, really.

474
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,451
Go on, Cherry. Slowly.
Try to remember everything.

475
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:43,748
Well, it... it was a sort of look
on Marina Gregg's face.

476
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:50,046
What kind of a look?
Sad? Angry? Surprised? Frightened?

477
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,509
I don't know.

478
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,550
Cherry, dear, take your time.
Think back.

479
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,550
Try to remember the precise look.

480
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:03,147
Well, it was sort of... frozen.

481
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,358
<i>She was staring over
Heather Babcockfis shoulder</i>

482
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,852
<i>like she wasn't listening
to what she was saying.</i>

483
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,024
<i>Go on.</i>

484
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:14,150
<i>She was looking towards the
stairs. There's a religious picture.</i>

485
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,824
<i>Then Lola Brewster arrived with
her husband, the producer. Funny man.</i>

486
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,992
<i>Wouldn 't be surprised
if he dyes his hair.</i>

487
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,582
<i>The girl took a photo.</i>

488
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,451
<i>Heather Babcock was rattling on</i>

489
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:29,047
<i>and Miss Gregg had
this sort of strange frozen look.</i>

490
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,418
What specifically was she looking at'?

491
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,386
The people? The picture?

492
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,677
- Obviously one of the people.
- Oh, why do you say that?

493
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,302
Really, Dermot,
she sees the picture every day.

494
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,772
Absolutely. I'm so sorry, Aunt.

495
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,895
Er, now, how long did Miss Gregg
remain looking at that picture?

496
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,113
<i>The Lady of Shalott.</i>

497
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,321
Aunt Jane?

498
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,990
"Out ﬂew the web and ﬂoated wide -
The mirror crack'd from side to side;

499
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,785
'The curse has come upon me,' cried
The Lady of Shalott."

500
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,041
Tennyson, of course.
I do have a weakness for Tennyson.

501
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,835
And it does seem a rather
suitable description.

502
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,378
Go on, Cherry dear.
Continue with your story.

503
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,886
Nothing much more to tell, really.
Lola Brewster came up to Miss Gregg.

504
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,680
I don't think they like each other much,
if you ask me.

505
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,977
They had some pictures taken
and then Mr Rudd came up.

506
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,348
He's so handsome.

507
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,273
Cherry, we want to hear about
Miss Babcock and Miss Gregg.

508
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,895
Did anything else happen?

509
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,739
No, I don't think
I've left anything out.

510
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,484
Heather spilled her drink
and Miss Gregg walked away.

511
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,864
Spilled?
You say Heather spilled her drink?

512
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,368
Oh, yeah. Oh, didn't I say that?
Oh, I must have forgot.

513
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,211
I <i>am silly, aren't I?</i>

514
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,003
- Oh, Miss Gregg! I'm so terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly alright.

515
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,467
- Oh, will it stain?
- I'm sure not, I'm sure not.

516
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,838
Here, you take mine,
I haven't touched it.

517
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:00,964
Oh, no. I couldn't.

518
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,514
Please, it's no problem.
I'll get another.

519
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,490
So...

520
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,079
...Heather Babcock drank
from Marina Gregg's glass.

521
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,003
Fate was rather unkind
to poor Heather Babcock.

522
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,798
Seems we've been dealing
with the wrong murder.

523
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:43,264
I suggest you proceed to Gossington Hall
first thing in the morning.

524
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,852
To put to use all those cunning skills
I've inherited from a certain relative?

525
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,434
You know, Dermot,
you really are my favourite nephew.

526
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,781
I'll let Mr Rudd know you are here, sir.

527
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,666
- Inspector Craddock?
- Yes.

528
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,174
Mr Rudd will be with you
<i>as</i> soon as he can,

529
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,389
but I must warn you,
he's awfully tied up.

530
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,506
Tied up?

531
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:30,103
Inspector, have you any idea
what making a movie entails?

532
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,063
We have wardrobe tests,
we have make-up tests,

533
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,353
we have lighting tests.

534
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,774
<i>- Rainbows End.
- I beg your pardon?</i>

535
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:42,821
Yes, it was Marina Gregg's
first Academy Award, wasn't it?

536
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,195
- Yes.
- I'll never forget that last scene.

537
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,492
So vivid, real.

538
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,493
Vulnerability, Miss Zielinsky.
Her <i>modus</i> operandi

539
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:57,874
<i>Journey Home, Paradise Road.
Absolute conviction.</i>

540
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,467
This indestructible ability
to make us care.

541
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,924
- Now, they were facing this way.
- Inspector?

542
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,177
I'm sorry.
The guests when they were introduced.

543
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,348
Yes, that's right.

544
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,106
Those eyes.
Violent. Mesmerising.

545
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,774
It's a copy, of course.

546
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,445
No, no.
I was referring to Miss Gregg's eyes.

547
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,536
Yes, my earliest memory of those eyes
was in Tomorrowfis <i>Dawn.</i>

548
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,078
She played a young socialite
heiress who came from...

549
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,202
Now, where was it she came from?

550
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,999
- Boston.
- Boston, that's right!

551
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,999
She came from Boston
and inherited land in California.

552
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,170
<i>Do you mind...?</i>

553
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,090
Do you remember that scene where
they threatened to dig up her land?

554
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,634
The way she stood up to
those gold-miners,

555
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,885
that sweet, helpless young butterfly.

556
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,855
Tell me, might I speak to her, please?

557
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,351
- I'm sorry, she's resting.
- Oh.

558
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,480
- Well, perhaps later?
- Perhaps.

559
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,029
But sweet, helpless young butterflies
do need their rest.

560
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,655
That snake-eyed son of a bitch,
Marty Fenn!

561
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,282
He always did have the class of a toad!

562
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,627
And he's putting up the money
for your comeback, so calm down.

563
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,920
And putting that peroxide ﬂoozy
into my film!

564
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,293
And <i>as</i> the virgin queen!

565
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,967
She's in two lousy scenes,
neither of them with you'

566
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,136
Lola Brewster, actress.

567
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,887
If she's read the script,
I'd see a blister on her finger.

568
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,732
It's your picture all the way. Nobody
will remember anyone else in it.

569
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,569
Oh, Jinksy.

570
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,316
- Do you really mean that?
- I'll make sure of it.

571
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,660
Oh, God. God, it has been so long.

572
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,499
You don't think there's
any chance I have lost it, do you?

573
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,119
Oh, you'll be better than ever.
I promise.

574
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,585
My love. You're so good for me.

575
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,635
You always have been.

576
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,760
Oh, damn her! That bitch!
If you look at her carefully,

577
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,390
there's so many lines on her face,
you could drive a train on it!

578
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,482
Maybe I won't shoot her
through a filter.

579
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,070
Filter? Try using an Indian blanket.

580
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,155
You're gonna have to
dub her voice in too.

581
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:34,029
Or write a line in the script that
Elizabeth is from Hoboken, New Jersey.

582
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,378
Bags, bags, go away-

583
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,089
Come right back on Doris Day.

584
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,719
<i>- Hello?
- Jason, where the hell are you?</i>

585
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,185
Lola's been sitting here for 20 minutes
waiting for you.

586
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,271
She likes the feathers so much,
she wants them in the costume.

587
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,517
I told her, a queen only wears feathers
if he lives in Hollywood,

588
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,234
but she won't believe me.

589
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,571
<i>Jason, you get your ass over here!</i>

590
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,862
- I've been thinking, poopsie.
- Oh, that's a new experience!

591
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,032
Maybe we should bring in Alexander
for my hair.

592
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,999
Lamb chop, if I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times:

593
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,459
Queen Elizabeth was bald.

594
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,920
- Not in this movie, she ain't.
- It's history.

595
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:28,792
So is Lola Brewster.
I'll be majestic.

596
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:33,092
Awesome. Inspiring.

597
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm going to wipe that cow
right off the screen'

598
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,480
Let's see, we're gonna need
some scenes with the two of us together,

599
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:47,319
so the world can see
how much younger and thinner I am.

600
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,735
Lola, baby.
Elizabeth and Mary never met.

601
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,903
Oh, maybe they meet at the market.

602
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,073
No, of course not,
she'd never do her own shopping.

603
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,664
The beauty parlour?
No, they'd come to her.

604
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,830
Wait a minute.

605
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,329
I've got it.

606
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,833
I come to see her
at the Tower of London.

607
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:16,590
It's right before the beheading
and the rats are crawling all over her.

608
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,809
She's in rags, looking like shit.

609
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,806
And in walks... me.

610
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,285
- Inspector, I do have things to do.
- Yes, of course.

611
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,904
Miss Gregg and Miss Brewster,
are they very close?

612
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,030
Close?

613
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,250
If you put the two of them together
in a tank with a shark,

614
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,711
the shark would have an identity crisis.

615
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,172
Tell me, I'm curious, who's younger?
Marina Gregg or Lola Brewster?

616
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,087
- Neither one.
- Bless you.

617
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,755
<i>Oh.</i>

618
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,095
- You alright?
- Hay fever.

619
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:01,343
Those are maddening things, allergies.
I'm allergic to wool.

620
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,222
I find a tranquiliser helps me.
I use a drug called Calmadon.

621
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,599
- Do you know of it?
- We ship it in by the barrel.

622
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,317
Oh. Does Miss Gregg take it?

623
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,526
By the time this movie's over,
there may be a world shortage.

624
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,275
- Do you take it?
- Do I have a choice?

625
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,577
Ah, I think it must be very exciting
working for someone like Marina Gregg.

626
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,871
I'm sure she's a grand person.

627
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:30,418
Inspector, Marina Gregg can make
Medusa look like St Bernadette.

628
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:34,918
- Why don't you change your job?
- What, and quit show business?

629
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,465
I used to work for Jason
before they were married.

630
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,465
I've learned to live with her tantrums
and her breakdowns.

631
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:45,095
Breakdowns? But the image she projects
on the screen is so rational.

632
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,892
Tell me about them.

633
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,562
- It's all rather turgid.
- Really, I'm fascinated.

634
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,357
Well, you can't mention illness
or insanity

635
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,730
or anything to do with children.

636
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,530
That's most interesting. Why not'?

637
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,073
Inspector, I really can't go into it.

638
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,165
I'm sure that Mr Rudd
is a tower of strength to her.

639
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:14,883
- Devoted beyond the call of duty.
- And Mr Penn?

640
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,843
Marty Fenn is a producer.
He only lies when he speaks.

641
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,591
I should think they've been
pretty unsettled by the murder?

642
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:26,436
Murder?
Inspector, we have a picture to make.

643
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,271
We can't be bothered
by little local difficulties.

644
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,231
Ah, Mr Rudd.
Could I ask you a few questions?

645
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,526
I'm in a rush. Talk to my secretary,
she'll arrange an interview.

646
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,694
But I'm not a reporter.

647
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,443
Mr Rudd.

648
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:49,250
Yes? Tell him I'm on my way, damn it.
Ten minutes!

649
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,914
- Mr Rudd.
- I told you, not now.

650
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,754
I'm Inspector Craddock,
Scotland Yard.

651
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,543
Everything we're doing
is according to form.

652
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,716
British crew, extras.
I've waivers on my two leading ladies.

653
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,716
- We're in total compliance.
- If I might interrupt you.

654
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,184
I'm sure you're going to make
a very fine picture

655
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,928
without the aid of Scotland Yard.

656
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:12,603
I happen to be here
on a minor matter of murder.

657
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,476
<i>Oh, yes. Er, Miss...</i>

658
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,228
Babcock, Heather Babcock.

659
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,617
- I'm truly sorry.
- If I might talk to your wife?

660
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,409
I'm sorry, no one may see her.
She's resting' Doctor's orders.

661
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,747
If you'll excuse me.

662
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,414
Mr Rudd, it's very important
that I talk to her.

663
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:37,336
Inspector, my wife is about to start
the most important role of her career.

664
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,756
Every ounce of energy is being
devoted toward preparing this role.

665
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,095
She is going to win
her third Academy Award

666
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,431
and I will not distract her with...

667
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,142
Mundane matters like murder.

668
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,559
- Whatever you say, Inspector.
- Jinks.

669
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,773
That's all very well and good.

670
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,189
I firmly believe your wife
deserves a third Oscar.

671
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,153
I think she should have got it
for Summer Rain, actually'

672
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,990
But has it occurred to you
the death of Heather Babcock

673
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,984
wasn't entirely accidental'?

674
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,908
That the intended victim
was, in fact, your wife?

675
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,873
Now may I see her, please?

676
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,747
No, you may not.

677
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:22,628
My wife has been through a lot and I'm
not only talking about last Saturday.

678
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,301
I'm sorry, but you're not going
to give her a nervous breakdown.

679
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,471
Now, if you will excuse me.

680
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,391
I believe
she's had several all ready.

681
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,435
- Several what?
- Breakdowns.

682
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,435
- Who told you?
- I thought it was common knowledge.

683
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,112
Ah, it's nice of you
to let them play here.

684
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,073
What? Oh, the gardener's kids.

685
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,411
I thought they might
have upset Miss Gregg.

686
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,781
Alright, Inspector,
let's stop playing games.

687
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,708
There was a time years ago
when Marina wanted children, badly.

688
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,206
The doctors told her
she could never have any,

689
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,800
so she adopted two.

690
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,888
Then a few years later... She was
still married to her first husband.

691
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,635
She found out she was actually
going to have one of her own.

692
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:17,061
Unfortunately, the child
was born mentally retarded. An imbecile.

693
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,902
Marina had a complete breakdown.
She hasn't worked since.

694
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,270
I see.

695
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,615
Now maybe you can understand
what this film means to her.

696
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,282
That she actually has the guts to
appear in front of a camera again.

697
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,325
Yes, indeed.

698
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,495
This film's gonna turn
everything around for her.

699
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,125
That's why if she ever found out,
even suspected,

700
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,748
she was the intended victim...

701
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,466
You don't believe the thought
has entered her mind?

702
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,590
Not for a minute.

703
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,225
The idea of someone wanting to murder
your wife doesn't bother you?

704
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,846
You've been seeing too many
Charlie Chan movies, Inspector.

705
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:00,851
Look, I'll be here the whole time.

706
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,774
When I'm not, my secretary
won't let her out of her sight.

707
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,363
- You trust Miss Zielinsky?
- Of course I trust her.

708
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,824
She was there.
She had the opportunity.

709
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,616
- Ella is devoted to my wife.
- And to you too?

710
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,330
Jason, Marty phoned again!

711
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,543
He said if you're not there in
ten minutes, he's getting John Houston!

712
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,965
Will there be anything else, Inspector?

713
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,306
<i>Is that the Martin N Fenn
who produced the Terror in Trinidad?</i>

714
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,221
The one and only.

715
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,390
I've always wondered
what the N stood for.

716
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,138
No idea.

717
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,142
How about "knockwurst"?

718
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:47,898
- Oh, Mr Rudd.
- What?

719
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,026
<i>I was really most impressed
with The Last Brigade.</i>

720
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,993
Particularly, if I may say so,

721
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,410
with your very subtle use
of low-key lighting.

722
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,875
Why, thank you.

723
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,190
Shouldn't you be resting that foot,
Aunt Jane?

724
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,275
Old Edward's got his rheumatism again.

725
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,896
I really can't let the garden
become like a jungle

726
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,240
Do you think Mr Rudd
is fond of his wife?

727
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:35,157
- I'd say he adores her.
- What about Miss Zielinsky?

728
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,747
Business-like. Efficient.
Seemingly loyal.

729
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,537
Suffers from hay fever.

730
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,912
- Attractive?
- Yes, in a uncalculated sort of way.

731
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:48,291
- That's a very austere assessment.
- Maybe, but what are you implying?

732
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,088
I'm implying absolutely nothing.

733
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:53,679
I just find your lack of emotion,
shall we say, a bit studied.

734
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,800
Oh, alright.
If you prefer I were more direct,

735
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,019
then I'd say that given the right time,
the right place,

736
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:04,265
that Miss Zielinsky is probably...
hotter than a pistol.

737
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,519
Hmm, perhaps
we should return to austerity.

738
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,271
Well, you brought it up.

739
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,741
Seriously, do you believe
she was telling the truth?

740
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,907
Well, let's say, I think she allowed her
loyalties to become quite transparent'

741
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,577
- Her feelings for Mr Rudd.
- Exactly.

742
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:25,545
- A prime suspect, I'd say.
- Oh, would you, now? Well, well.

743
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,833
Where are you off to?

744
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,174
I'm off to the glamorous world
of movie making.

745
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,921
I see this is not a particularly
taxing case for you, Dermot.

746
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,343
<i>Show business is just
a business, Aunt Jane.</i>

747
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,514
What we need is a little more business
and a little <i>less</i> show.

748
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,435
In fact, there's a wonderful saying
I read not too long ago about Hollywood.

749
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,606
"Underneath all that phoney tinsel
lies the real tinsel."

750
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:54,153
- That's very profound, Aunt Jane.
- Better be careful, Dermot.

751
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:58,244
They're liable to mistake you for Leslie
Howard and put you in the picture.

752
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,705
Well, I do have a certain charm,
or so I've been told.

753
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,870
Perhaps it's time
it was discovered.

754
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:08,417
Dermot! First discover
Heather Babcock's murderer.

755
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:12,383
Well, I'd better work fast
before someone else does it for me.

756
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,099
Shooting next time!
Let's have a shooting bell.

757
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,560
<i>Very quiet, everybody!

758
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,974
Roll the camera!

759
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,689
- Speed. Mark it.
- Forget the board.

760
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,811
Lola Brewster, make-up test.
Take one. Board on end.

761
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,531
Alright, Lola honey, turn left.

762
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,653
Slowly.

763
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:44,954
Lovely. Now hold it there a moment.

764
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,662
Down with the chin a little.

765
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:57,922
Up with the eyes. Good.
Now, keep the chin down. Lovely.

766
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,389
Excuse me, gov. Could you check this?

767
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,507
Yeah.

768
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:07,639
Dimmer on the key light.
Down a bit. Whoa.

769
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,312
It's not dark enough.
Don't you have Italian blood?

770
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,278
It's the stuff we always use.
Kensington Gore.

771
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,737
It looks like water.

772
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,528
Don't you people know
that blood is thicker than water?

773
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,868
I want it thick like tomato juice.

774
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,955
Excuse me, sir, could you have
a look at the guards, please?

775
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,838
They're supposed to be the queen's
soldiers, not her ballerinas.

776
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,960
Yes, sir. Leave it to me, sir.

777
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,429
Now turn your head right.

778
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:51,015
No, dear. Not your shoulders,
just your head.

779
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,268
Right. No, dear. Your right.

780
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,273
- Jason!
- Cut.

781
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,445
Save the red.

782
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,785
<i>- Yes, my dear.</i>

783
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,745
Lest we forget, you do have
an actress in this movie,

784
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,412
one who also happens
to be married to the producer.

785
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,330
No, I haven't forgotten.

786
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,205
I think it's important we discuss the
queen's relationship with her father.

787
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,378
When the picture begins,
the father's been dead over 30 years.

788
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:22,005
Why don't you go to your dressing room
and put on a nice new costume, OK?

789
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,632
I told Marty we should
have got George Cukor.

790
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,179
Swords and blood,
that's all he thinks about.

791
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,804
That and that over-stuffed psycho
of a wife.

792
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:34,274
Will you get your paws out of my hair?
Where did you get this wig, Woolworths?

793
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:38,612
Calls himself a director.
Did you see his last picture?

794
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:43,826
I could eat a can of Kodak
and puke a better movie.

795
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,864
Oh, why, you must be Inspector Craddock.

796
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,959
They told me you'd be here.
How sweet of you to come.

797
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,248
Miss Brewster,
I'm a great fan of yours.

798
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,916
Isn't that nice?

799
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,712
And I now you'll excuse me
while I change.

800
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:03,258
Yes. Yes, of course.
Please, you carry on.

801
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,761
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,
what's on your mind?

802
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,816
I have a few questions regarding
the murder of Heather Babcock.

803
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,187
- Who?
- The woman up at Gossington Hall.

804
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,564
Oh, yes. Who was she, an extra?

805
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,612
Ow! The zipper, you moron.
It's caught in my rump!

806
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,985
I'm sorry, Miss Brewster.

807
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,114
If I might digress for a moment.
I'd <i>like...</i> Oh, so sorry.

808
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:34,038
...to erm, ask about your relationship
with Marina Gregg.

809
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,663
Gregg? Gregg, that name rings a bell.

810
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:41,133
- Come now, Miss Brewster.
- I'm just teasing you, Sherlock.

811
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,126
Of course I know Marina Gregg.

812
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,255
Isn't she that aging,
broken-down ex-star

813
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,633
trying so desperately for a comeback?

814
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:52,261
Here, try combing this out;
they may find Amelia Earhart.

815
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,855
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,

816
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:58,693
why don't you ask me
some more of those searching questions?

817
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:04,191
I just love being examined,
especially by someone as cute <i>as</i> you.

818
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,276
Erm, what I'm particularly...

819
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:11,451
Are you really from Scotland Yard?
A real-life Inspector?

820
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,198
I can just hardly believe it.

821
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,997
A real-life Inspector
in my dressing room.

822
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:21,090
Oh, just think of me as a...
what you call a cop.

823
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,301
Only if you brought
your nightstick, honey.

824
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,684
- Miss Brewster.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I've upset you.

825
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,850
Forgive me,
I promise I'll be a good girl.

826
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,440
Now, about Marina.

827
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:43,859
Well, what can I say?
She was a great star. Was.

828
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,573
I mean, when I was just
a teensy-weensy little girl,

829
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,445
my grandmother used to take me
to see all of her movies.

830
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:54,790
And then about ten years ago,
around my 16th birthday,

831
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,250
she had this awful collapse, poor thing.

832
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,792
Drugs, alcohol, insanity.

833
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,461
It's not easy
when you've hit rock bottom.

834
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:07,758
Marty and I felt the least we could do
was to give her a part in my picture.

835
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:13,430
- Yes, that's very charitable.
- Ow, not so tight.

836
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,930
- Erm, Miss Brewster?
- Inspector?

837
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,025
Wasn't there some kind of trouble
between you and Miss Gregg

838
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:25,066
- a few years ago?
- Trouble?  Why...

839
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,030
Whatever do you mean?

840
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,447
When Miss Gregg began seeing Mr Rudd,
weren't you and Mr Rudd...

841
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,912
Now, Inspector.
That's ancient history.

842
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,579
Besides, Jason and I
were ending it anyway.

843
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:43,047
I was only too happy to see
Marina find a little companionship,

844
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:46,042
lonely and pathetic creature
that she was.

845
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:52,094
Is that why you aimed and fired
a short-barrel 9mm Luger at her skull

846
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,887
missing it by two and a half inches?

847
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,760
- Did the bitch tell you that?
- No, Miss Brewster.

848
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:59,513
The Beverly Hills Police Department.

849
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,939
Alright, so I got a little miffed.

850
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,564
I may be a great star,
but I'm still human.

851
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:13,114
Human enough to try it again?
Only this time with poison?

852
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,491
Are you insinuating?

853
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,492
Merely exploring the possibility.

854
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,585
Er, ready, Miss Brewster.

855
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:26,711
Well, it seems
that I must take my leave.

856
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:30,086
Thank you for our little... chat,
Miss Brewster.

857
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,633
And jolly good luck with your picture.

858
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,095
Miss Brewster, we're waiting.

859
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,644
Screw Scotland Yard!

860
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,780
Sorry, ma'am!

861
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,036
I was just taking a walk
down to the village.

862
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,460
It's that way, ma'am.

863
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,419
Ah.

864
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,804
Cherry dear, are the post office
playing with the telephone lines again?

865
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,046
Don't think so, ma'am.

866
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,941
Gossington Hall.

867
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,734
Hello? Hello?

868
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,990
What is that girl up to?

869
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,738
I saw you.

870
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,701
I saw you put the poison
in Marina's glass.

871
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,672
<i>I saw you.</i>

872
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:35,795
Look, that part's been cast.
Why didn't you call last week?

873
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:40,049
Leave your name and address with
my secretary and we'll call you when“.

874
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,936
<i>Actors.</i>

875
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:49,684
You know about actors, don't you?
They all live up there somewhere.

876
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:53,813
I knew a broad once.
I was making a Civil War epic.

877
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,531
We were supposed to shoot
a big scene that day.

878
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:01,870
She comes to me and tells me
she can't work that week. Know why?

879
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:08,541
Because her astrologist...
tells her it's not in the stars.

880
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,882
So, I, er,
pay this little creep a visit.

881
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,923
I give him a grand, right?

882
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,843
He tells her the stars
have made a sudden shift

883
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,343
and if she doesn't report to work
every morning on time,

884
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,640
she's gonna lose her sex drive.

885
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,230
The next morning
she was there before the janitor.

886
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,065
Won't you sit down?

887
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,903
- Yes, <i>fields of Glory,</i> wasn't it?
- Yeah, did you see that?

888
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,320
Yes, I found it a bit melodramatic.
It's not a very positive...

889
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,410
The only thing positive thing
about it was the negative.

890
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:47,120
Inspector, what's on your mind?

891
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,743
Erm, how long have you known
Miss Gregg?

892
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,166
Marina? We've been friends
a long time.

893
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,666
Have the two of you been,
er, intimate?

894
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,341
Intimate?

895
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,885
Yeah, we've been intimate.

896
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:06,260
Everybody in Hollywood is intimate.

897
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,941
Swifty! How are you, Swifty?
What are you doing?

898
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,480
Oh, things are great.

899
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,901
The girl's got the best spot in the
picture. What do you want me to do?

900
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,651
I can't, Swifty. You gotta
give me a break. Come on!

901
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,029
Wonderful. I owe you one.
Thanks, pal.

902
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:29,283
Agents. He thinks
he's got a lot of class.

903
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,705
He once sold me an actress,
said she was great.

904
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,830
I called her in the morning,
she'd been dead for six months.

905
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,842
- Please go on. I'm sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

906
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,383
Erm, now then, about Miss Gregg.

907
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:50,304
Let me tell you something about Marina.
Secure, she ain't.

908
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:55,104
Under all that jewellery
is a sad, insecure lady'

909
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,525
ls there anyone you could think of
who might want to harm Miss Gregg?

910
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,363
Yeah, Hedda Hopper.

911
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,327
No, I mean anyone involved
in the picture. You, for instance.

912
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,492
Me? I'm the producer.

913
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,492
I'm coming up with $3.5 million
to make this movie.

914
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,039
You think I'm going to bump off
my leading lady

915
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,538
two days before I start
shooting the picture?

916
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,792
I've got contracts at Radio City
Music Hall for Christmas!

917
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,214
Unless, of course,
someone else bumps her off.

918
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,930
If someone else bumps her off,
I'll prop her up and dub her

919
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,142
to get her at the Radio City Music Hall
at Christmas.

920
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,056
Harry, I want those pictures
up here right now.

921
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,104
I don't care if she's having tea
with Mickey Mouse,

922
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,444
tell her to bring
the pictures up here now!

923
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,024
Excuse me.
Anything else I can help you with?

924
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,742
I've got a picture to make.

925
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:50,035
- Errn, yes. Oh, just one thing, Mr Penn.
- Sure.

926
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:53,705
- I've always been curious about...
- What?

927
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,919
What does the N stand for?

928
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,754
You want to know what it stands for?

929
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,625
I'll tell you what it stands for.
Nothing.

930
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,719
But it sure looks great on
that big silver screen, doesn't it?

931
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,713
<i>Yes.</i>

932
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,930
Goodbye.

933
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,846
- And thanks for your time, Mr Fenn.
- Any time.

934
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:17,558
Get me the coast.
What do you mean, what coast?

935
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,787
Chief Inspector Craddock, madam.

936
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,211
Miss Gregg?

937
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,546
That man is working
on the lawn with such dedication.

938
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,301
I'm Marina Gregg.

939
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,430
- At least what's left of her.
- Miss Gregg.

940
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,728
I understand you were here earlier.

941
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,227
I'm sorry for having
to make you come back.

942
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,276
Please, please don't apologise.
I quite understand.

943
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:10,903
I hope you realise
the, er, chaos of film making.

944
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,906
It really is rather
a wretched business, you know.

945
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,078
I don't get to the cinema very often.

946
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,082
Ah, of course.

947
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,796
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

948
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,510
- Please.
- Thank you.

949
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,806
- Milk'?
- No milk, no sugar.

950
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:35,894
You know, it's funny.
I never drank tea in America.

951
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,058
Now I'm slowly becoming an addict.

952
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,109
Well, there's a little shop
in the village, Hedgeworth,

953
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:47,151
offers an extraordinary selection.
The most exotic brews.

954
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,115
Oh, I'll have to check it out.

955
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,953
"Check it out."

956
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,370
You're probably thinking
how hopelessly American she sounds.

957
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:04,169
You're here about that poor woman,
aren't you?

958
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:08,214
Who would want to kill her'?
Do you have a clue?

959
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,678
Can you tell me about her'?

960
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,889
Me?

961
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,933
How would I know anything about her?

962
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,771
People said that the two of you
spent some time talking together.

963
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:25,485
Ah, well, she spent time talking,
I spent time listening.

964
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,355
Can you be more specific, Miss Gregg?

965
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,287
Do you know what fans are like,
Inspector? I mean, real fans.

966
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:39,158
No. Why don't you tell me'?

967
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,830
Well, it seems...

968
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,753
Let me think,
I want to get this straight.

969
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:53,472
It seems we had met once,
years ago during the war.

970
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,761
She remembered every detail of it,

971
01:08:55,882 --> 01:09:00,183
even down to the song I was singing,
the dress I was wearing.

972
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:05,892
Funny thing is, I remember it too.

973
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:10,113
Anyway, I was entertaining the troops
and she was sick or something,

974
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,778
but she was determined to see me.

975
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:17,905
And she got out of bed, got dressed,
got into the stage door.

976
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,158
Her uncle or someone
was the door keeper.

977
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:25,253
And she waited in the wings
until after my curtain call,

978
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:30,001
and I signed her autograph or something.

979
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:35,847
She said it was
the most exciting night of her life.

980
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:41,602
And you know, it probably was.

981
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm so sorry. Erm, yes.

982
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:55,113
I understand there was a moment when
you seemed startled about something

983
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,952
or maybe even frightened.

984
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,029
Frightened?

985
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,624
It was about the time when
Mr Fenn and his wife appeared.

986
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,664
You looked at a picture on the landing.

987
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,873
Oh, that.

988
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:15,094
Yes, of course.
There... There was a moment.

989
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,714
I was talking to that woman,
that fan,

990
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,888
and she was going on and on,
gushing.

991
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,136
I was feeling run out of thank yous

992
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:30,145
and I just didn't know how to get
out of it and <i>I...</i> just went blank.

993
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,817
Miss Gregg,
I hope you won't find this upsetting

994
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:37,909
but can you think of anyone
who might want to kill you?

995
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:45,242
- Why do you ask that?
- I must explore every possibility.

996
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,921
How do you get along
with Miss Zielinsky?

997
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,836
Why are you asking these questions?

998
01:10:54,250 --> 01:11:00,007
A local woman was murdered.
What does it have to do with me?

999
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,975
I came here to make a movie.

1000
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,268
I came here with friends.
I came here with people that love me.

1001
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:11,234
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

1002
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,820
I'm trying to pull my life together.

1003
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:19,317
They're behind me. My husband, Ella.

1004
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:24,118
They won't let it happen.
They'll stand up for me'

1005
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,832
Why are you doing this? Why?

1006
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,084
Oh, God!

1007
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,636
It was me, wasn't it?

1008
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:41,928
It was me they were trying to poison,
wasn't it'?

1009
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,762
Who am I kidding?

1010
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,397
Somebody is trying to kill me,
aren't they?

1011
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:58,106
Somebody is trying to... poison me,
aren't they?

1012
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,905
Somebody is trying to kill me,
aren't they?

1013
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,278
Aren't they? I know it! I can...

1014
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:07,123
"I can feel it.
I can almost hear them coming."

1015
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,789
<i>- Danger in the Dark.</i>

1016
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,456
MGM, 1932.

1017
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:19,673
The scene when you thought your husband
and your sister were trying to kill you

1018
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,013
and you broke down
in front of the police.

1019
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:26,885
Why, you sneaky little chief inspector.

1020
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,558
I bet you've seen
every one of my movies.

1021
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,683
Oh, at least twice.

1022
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,150
That one was a real dog.

1023
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,362
But you were most compelling
in that scene, though

1024
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,901
The critics didn't seem to think so.

1025
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,399
If they'd been here today,

1026
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,277
I'm absolutely certain
they would have succumbed.

1027
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,155
You didn't.

1028
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,750
Well, I'm a detective, Miss Gregg.

1029
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,589
It's my job to analyse behaviour
off screen.

1030
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,425
Well, I'm an actress. I act.

1031
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:04,764
Yes, I think the performance
was a little overdone, if I may say.

1032
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,304
I would have settled
for simple sincerity.

1033
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,182
I didn't think you'd believe me.

1034
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,944
I still don't think you believe me.

1035
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,668
"You won't escape next time."

1036
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,965
"Prepare to die."

1037
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,056
One came here,
the other was sent to the studio.

1038
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,767
- When?
- This morning.

1039
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,852
- Who delivered them?
- We don't know.

1040
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,439
- We?
- My husband and I.

1041
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,560
At first I thought it was a joke.

1042
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,778
Some kind of joke, huh?

1043
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:13,833
I don't think I've been so scared
since I was a kid in Oklahoma City.

1044
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:21,670
Shirley Bookbinder.
Prettiest little girl in town.

1045
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,887
I really thought I was something.

1046
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:33,641
Till one day I found...
I think I was around ten.

1047
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:38,483
I found in my desk a note saying...

1048
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,321
"Nobody likes you, Shirley."

1049
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,493
I cried for three days.

1050
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,791
I never did find out who wrote it.

1051
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,551
See, the tough thing about having it,

1052
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,423
there's always somebody
who wants to take it away.

1053
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:16,896
And you know, they usually do.

1054
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,237
Help me, Inspector, please.

1055
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:32,078
- And I'm sure you will, Dermot.
- Well, I'll certainly try.

1056
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,824
I suspect you're rather smitten
with Miss Bookbinder.

1057
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,871
Nonsense, Aunt Jane.

1058
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,498
Trouble is, of course,

1059
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:44,374
I now have enough suspects
with enough motives

1060
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,967
to fill every shop in this high street.

1061
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:51,305
Please make sure that you
and little Jeremy John

1062
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:54,016
and the godparents are on time,

1063
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:58,559
because at 3:30 I have Mrs Cracknell
and her little Jeremy John.

1064
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,355
No, no, that's wrong. Mrs Cracknell's
little Michael Jeremy John.

1065
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,979
No, that's wrong too.
Mrs Michael's John.

1066
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,526
No, that's not right either.

1067
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:13,278
So confusing.
But I must get it right, mustn't I?

1068
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,702
Well, see you Saturday, 3:30.

1069
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,794
Ah, Miss Marple! Great news!

1070
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:27,338
Mr Edwards down at the garage
has been able to diagnose the problem.

1071
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,179
We shall, therefore, hopefully no longer
have to call upon you

1072
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:35,801
to resolve next Friday night's
little extravaganza, Two <i>Girls</i> from...

1073
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:39,270
I've forgotten where.
But I do hope to see you anyway.

1074
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,138
Somewhere in America I'm sure.

1075
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,688
Idaho. You can safely
give that one a miss, Aunt Jane.

1076
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:46,777
If you say so, Dermot.

1077
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,070
Jamie.

1078
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,740
Oh, Jamie.

1079
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,952
How I've longed for you.

1080
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:04,955
To take you in my arms
and to clasp you to my bosom.

1081
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,509
Jason, will you get that creep
out of my eye line?

1082
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,254
- Cut.
- Who? Who, me?

1083
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,347
Was I in your eye line?

1084
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:19,264
Oh, but I just wanted Jason
to see my costume.

1085
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,686
Dear, will you put the virgin queen
back into her cage?

1086
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,936
Lola, why don't you go study your lines?

1087
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,939
Anything you say.

1088
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,942
Anybody got a script breakdown?

1089
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,320
Oh, I am so sorry.

1090
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,993
I shouldn't have used that word.

1091
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,006
<i>- Tee's up!</i>

1092
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,967
Don't all rush. Plenty to go round.

1093
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,964
Don't walk in front of the camera,
for goodness' sake! Load of animals.

1094
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,053
Are you OK?

1095
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,266
Hmm?

1096
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,774
I'm fine, Jinks.

1097
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,773
That's my girl.

1098
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,114
Excuse me.

1099
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,785
- Coffee, Marina.
- Oh, thank you.

1100
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:19,324
Jason, shall I get you a cup?

1101
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:23,200
Could you come and look at this?
See if you can strike it? Thanks'

1102
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,162
Thank you.

1103
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,928
Jason, when do I get to play
my scene with Sir Walter Raleigh?

1104
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,844
- What?
- Jason! Jason!

1105
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,428
- What is it?
- The...

1106
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,601
The coffee.

1107
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:54,443
There's nothing wrong with it,
it's just a little strong.

1108
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,110
- You're lying.
- Honey, come on.

1109
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,031
You're lying! It's poisoned!

1110
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:19,089
I'll see you in the morning,
Miss Marple. I've laid everything out.

1111
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,887
And don't forget,
I left your dinner in the oven.

1112
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,884
Thank you, Cherry dear.

1113
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,510
Remember me?

1114
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,427
I saw you, murderer.

1115
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:18,022
Good evening, miss.
Mr Rudd has been asking for you.

1116
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,925
<i>- Where have you been?</i>

1117
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,553
I've been out for a walk.

1118
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,557
What's the matter with you?
You look terrible.

1119
01:20:56,477 --> 01:21:01,654
The coffee Marina
almost drank on the set.

1120
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,026
I had it analysed.

1121
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,450
- Arsenic.
- Arsenic?

1122
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,909
- How?
- I'm asking you.

1123
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,913
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You made it, you poured it.

1124
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,883
- You gave it to her.
- Do you think I tried to poison her?

1125
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,127
Yes!

1126
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,345
No. I don't know.

1127
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,591
I don't know what to think.

1128
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,267
You really do love her,
don't you, Jason?

1129
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:44,241
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find him.

1130
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:49,580
- Him?
- Whoever did it.

1131
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:56,128
Oh, for God's sake,
do something about that cold.

1132
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,981
- ls the doctor here?
- Yes, sir.

1133
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:01,443
Mr Rudd called the station at 8:55, sir.

1134
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,075
You'll have my report in the morning.

1135
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,042
Alright, girls, you can go now.

1136
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:25,134
Bates, if you'll stay, Constable Arnold
will take your statement now.

1137
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:36,763
Inspector, who would want to kill her?

1138
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,645
The same person
that tried to poison your wife.

1139
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:47,069
Did you know that Miss Zielinsky
was making a series of phone calls

1140
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,283
from the box in the village?

1141
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:55,202
She was apparently playing detectives.
Phoning every suspect.

1142
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,292
Telling them that she'd seen them
poison Miss Gregg.

1143
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,502
Waiting for a reaction.

1144
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:05,967
If whoever she was talking to had
took the bait, she'd find the murderer.

1145
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,174
She obviously did.

1146
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,812
You've seen the coffee analysis?

1147
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:24,732
Yes. Mr Rudd, why didn't you
tell me about these notes?

1148
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,111
I obviously forgot about them.

1149
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,450
Somebody threatened to kill your wife
and you forgot?

1150
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:46,083
- I thought I could handle it.
- Not very effectively, it seems.

1151
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,346
What are you doing?

1152
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,314
- I'm getting out of here.
- Marina.

1153
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,561
I'm sorry, Jason,
but I'm not staying here another night.

1154
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,438
- What about the picture?
- To hell with the picture!

1155
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,861
Somebody out there
is trying to kill me.

1156
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,737
- Think I'm gonna sit and wait for them?
- No one is going to hurt you.

1157
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:23,248
- Oh, Jinks. I'm so scared!
- I know, I know.

1158
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,872
But I'm here with you.
The police are on guard.

1159
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:30,547
Why? Why would somebody
want to hurt me?

1160
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,761
Shh.

1161
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,633
Why didn't you tell me
about those notes?

1162
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:44,477
What's the point?
Scare the hell out of you too?

1163
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,271
Please, let's get out of here.

1164
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:53,115
OK, we'll check into a hotel
in the morning.

1165
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,111
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1166
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,283
And we'll be together always.

1167
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,078
Till death do us part.

1168
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,076
Why'd you say that?

1169
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:10,625
Seems we can eliminate
Miss Zielinsky as a suspect.

1170
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,127
Murder is a very dangerous business.

1171
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:18,052
If one gets mixed up in it, one must
be prepared for the consequences.

1172
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,267
She wasn't a pretty sight.

1173
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:23,809
Prussic acid
is a most unpleasant death.

1174
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,145
So, where do we go from here, Aunt Jane?

1175
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,236
Our most likely suspecfs
become our latest victim.

1176
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,106
Do you realise there were
at least 40 people at that party

1177
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,905
and no one saw the poison
being put into the glass?

1178
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,746
Come now, Dermot. At least three people
could have quite easily.

1179
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,207
One, the unobservant soul
preoccupied with other thoughts,

1180
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,043
- completely unaware of what he saw.
- Hmm, second?

1181
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,834
The person who may have seen it
and thought nothing of it

1182
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,582
because it seemed quite natural.

1183
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,801
In my day,
it was considered bad manners,

1184
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,841
but people today are always
putting things in their drinks.

1185
01:26:56,962 --> 01:27:00,808
- Pills, medicine. All sorts of things.
- I suppose. And third?

1186
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,473
We have the person
who actually did it.

1187
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,812
The same person
who murdered Ella Zielinsky.

1188
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:11,106
Exactly. You know, Dermot, I always
think that murder is like a jigsaw.

1189
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:15,823
Until you've fitted in the final piece,
you can't see the whole picture.

1190
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:19,364
Obviously,
we still have a piece missing.

1191
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:31,540
Now, what was that awful women's name?
Brown boots, sort of Cheltenham type.

1192
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,291
- Colethorpe.
- Cynthia Colethorpe, right.

1193
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,636
And I distinctly remember it
wasn't till halfway through the case

1194
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,597
when you reminded me about
her smelly little Pekingese.

1195
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:43,843
What was its name?
It smelt revoltingly.

1196
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,145
Aunt Jane?

1197
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,943
Frozen. That frozen look.

1198
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:01,368
What was it that Heather Babcock
said to Marina Gregg

1199
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:04,705
just before she gave the frozen look?

1200
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,792
You mean all that interminable nonsense
about how she was ill?

1201
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:10,877
Marina gave her an autograph

1202
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,543
and it was
the most exciting moment of her life.

1203
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:16,212
Yes, it was before
she spilled the drink.

1204
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,052
- Here it is.
- It's not good enough.

1205
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,672
We've got to know Heather's exact words.

1206
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,641
I'm not sure that I follow you.

1207
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,937
- Alice Wetherby's cousin.
- Alice Wetherby's cousin?

1208
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:32,684
She went into a back room one day
and found her husband had hung himself

1209
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,527
from a hook at the top of the ceiling
eight feet high'

1210
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,114
There was absolutely nothing else in
the room except the hook, the body

1211
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,529
and a small puddle of water
beneath his feet.

1212
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:45,371
Nobody could understand how he'd
manoeuvred himself to perform the deed,

1213
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:48,741
until it was discovered
he had purchased a two-foot block of ice

1214
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,335
from the local fishmonger,
Mr Croswell.

1215
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,251
To this day,
Alice Wetherby's cousin shudders

1216
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:58,091
at the mere suggestion
of an ice cube in her gin.

1217
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,342
Yes, Aunt Jane.

1218
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:04,806
Don't you see, Dermot?

1219
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,518
Something as trivial as
the suggestion of an ice cube

1220
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,354
when it becomes associated
with another experience,

1221
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,394
something that caused great grief,

1222
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,064
it fixes in the mind,
stays with you forever.

1223
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,740
Yes, but I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

1224
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,861
If only we knew what
Heather actually said.

1225
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:34,711
Cherry!

1226
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:39,083
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
At least for now. I've sent her away.

1227
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,584
Whatever for?

1228
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,464
Dear boy,
I don't want her to be murdered too.

1229
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:20,674
Marina, honey.
I brought you something warm to drink.

1230
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,389
Hot chocolate.

1231
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:34,684
Do you remember when we used to drink it
on those cold nights in Sun Valley?

1232
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,727
When there was nothing else to do.

1233
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,859
I mean, afterwards.

1234
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,496
Sleep tight.

1235
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,132
I'll take these.

1236
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,674
You won't be needing them any more.

1237
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,894
Jason?

1238
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,887
Hmm?

1239
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,481
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1240
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:19,679
Of course, the vicar!

1241
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,940
Thank you, Inch.
If you'll wait, please.

1242
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:24,167
I'm sorry, Miss Marple,
Miss Gregg is not available.

1243
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:27,037
But it is imperative
that I see her at once.

1244
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:30,006
My apologies, madam. I have my orders.

1245
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,927
Then I shall wait.

1246
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:47,141
- There is a lady here, sir.
- What kind of a lady?

1247
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,063
A somewhat elderly lady, sir.

1248
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,734
A Miss Marple.
She refuses to leave. Shall I...'?

1249
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,573
No. I'll get rid of her.

1250
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,036
Mr Rudd. Good morning, Mr Rudd.

1251
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:11,415
Look, Miss, er, Marble,
or whatever your name is,

1252
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,509
I don't know what you're doing here,
but you cannot stay.

1253
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,926
It's Marple, and I won't keep you long.
I'm correct, am I not,

1254
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,720
that that is where your wife stood
the day of the murder?

1255
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,311
She looked in that direction
and then her face froze.

1256
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,430
I think you'd better leave.

1257
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:31,059
<i>Bellini's Mother and Child.
A very fine painting.</i>

1258
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:34,814
A present of the Brera Institute
in Milano, I believe.

1259
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:39,819
The whole thing
is really quite simple, isn't it?

1260
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,911
I don't know what you're talking about.

1261
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:44,030
I think you do.

1262
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:47,580
- Ah, Dermot.
- Good Lord, Aunt Jane.

1263
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,577
I might have guessed you'd be here.

1264
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,211
This is the spot where it happened,

1265
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:58,007
which makes it
so much easier to understand.

1266
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:03,509
It's very simple, if only
one looks at it the proper way.

1267
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:07,683
It all began, you see, with the kind
of person that Heather Babcock was.

1268
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,227
Damn it, that's enough!

1269
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:14,478
The two of you come busting
into my house. I want you out. Now!

1270
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,230
Perhaps you should call the police,
Mr Rudd.

1271
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,982
Let us go back, shall we,

1272
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:21,906
<i>to the moment when</i>
<i>Heather greets Miss Gregg</i>

1273
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,620
<i>and launches into
her efiusive little tale?</i>

1274
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:28,037
<i>Poor Miss Gregg listened patiently
as Heather rattled on,</i>

1275
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,704
<i>or at least she appeared to.</i>

1276
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:35,674
<i>And then suddenly
Marina turned her head away.</i>

1277
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:40,136
<i>A strange look came over her face.
A look of doom.</i>

1278
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:43,598
It had nothing to do
with Lola Brewster's arrival.

1279
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:47,219
Marina wasn't even looking at her
or poor Heather.

1280
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:50,187
She was looking at the Madonna.

1281
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:56,778
A picture of a serene mother
holding a beautiful happy baby.

1282
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,315
I still don't see the connection.

1283
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,865
Of course not, you don't know
what Heather actually said.

1284
01:37:03,985 --> 01:37:07,205
Yes, but haven't we
been through all that last night?

1285
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,290
<i>She got out of bed, powdered her nose,</i>

1286
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:13,207
<i>slipped out of the barracks
determined to see her idol</i>

1287
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:16,628
<i>then proceeded to the theatre
where some relative let her in</i>

1288
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,921
<i>and allowed her to watch
from the wings.</i>

1289
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,009
I still don't see where that gets us.

1290
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,932
Neither did I.
And then I thought of the vicar.

1291
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:17,438
I telephoned him in the middle
of the night. I wasn't at all popular.

1292
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:21,153
He remembered Heather's convalescence.

1293
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,900
She had been ill and spent her sick
leave in the village with her mother.

1294
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,241
You see,

1295
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,488
<i>when Heather Babcock
went to the theatre that evening,</i>

1296
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,580
<i>she was infectious.</i>

1297
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:35,247
<i>She was suffering from rubella.</i>

1298
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:38,793
<i>More commonly known
as German measles.</i>

1299
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:55,100
Your wife had a child
that was born mentally retarded.

1300
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,349
She never recovered from the shock.

1301
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:05,445
Marina... contracted German measles
during the pregnancy.

1302
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,527
And she never knew how.

1303
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:13,248
And then one afternoon, a perfect
stranger tells her with pleasure,

1304
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:16,709
with pride even, what she has done.

1305
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:21,377
And you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!

1306
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,923
What a nice little story, dear.

1307
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:31,466
- Now, can I get you a drink?
- Oh, thank you, yes.

1308
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:33,468
<i>A rather perfect murder.</i>

1309
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:38,190
Not exactly as Cherry described it.
I was wrong about one thing.

1310
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,775
I deduced that one of the guests
at the party

1311
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,486
took the risk of putting
the poison in the glass.

1312
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,981
But it was unnecessary.
No one would have noticed

1313
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:50,201
<i>the hostess taking a momentary leave
of absence to visit her bathroom</i>

1314
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:51,695
<i>to prepare the fetal potion.</i>

1315
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,913
<i>As an actress used to handling props,</i>

1316
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:57,034
<i>she would have had no trouble
jogging Heather's elbow,</i>

1317
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:01,379
<i>accidentally spilling her drink
and offering her her own.</i>

1318
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:05,171
<i>Marina had to insist that
she was the intended victim,</i>

1319
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,091
<i>that the murder was aimed at her
to support her plot.</i>

1320
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:11,510
<i>She wrote the notes herself</i>

1321
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:17,434
Even doctored her coffee at the studio.
It deceived nearly everybody. Nearly.

1322
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,726
But one person saw through it.

1323
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,560
You knew, didn't you, Mr Rudd?

1324
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,563
It was the notes
that made you finally realise.

1325
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:30,191
The notes your wife forgot
to tell you about.

1326
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:34,071
If they had been real,
she would have informed you at once.

1327
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,822
So you decided to protect her.

1328
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:42,208
Mr Rudd,
I'd like to speak to your wife.

1329
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:45,582
Would you mind
if I saw her first?

1330
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,800
Thank you, dear. Mr Rudd.

1331
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,738
- Miss Marple.
- Yes, Mr Rudd?

1332
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,662
She's dead.

1333
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:21,125
I rather suspected as much.
Couldn't you?

1334
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:22,869
I killed her.

1335
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,504
I put poison in
her hot chocolate last night.

1336
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,679
It was inevitable
she would have been discovered.

1337
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,846
I couldn't let her face the humiliation.

1338
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,935
She's suffered enough.

1339
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:50,730
You must have loved her very much.

1340
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:10,834
Mr Rudd,
I think you better come in here.

1341
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,236
Marina?

1342
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:39,075
Mr Rudd.

1343
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,771
She's given
the performance of her life.
