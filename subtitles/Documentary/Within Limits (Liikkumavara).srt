1
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,235
Are you ready?

2
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,028
Everything's cool?

3
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,159
Good.

4
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,588
Use your imagination...

5
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,091
and your skills.

6
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,184
Everything is subjective.

7
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
Don't elaborate.

8
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,249
He who thinks he's bigger than the rest...

9
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,543
must go to the cemetery.

10
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,264
There he will see what life really is.

11
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,061
It's a handful of dirt.

12
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,217
Pay attention.

13
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,427
I am paying attention.

14
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,762
Give him the keys.

15
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,233
Go to the towers. Then go to the café.

16
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,901
Wait for a couple of days.

17
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,114
Look for the violin.

18
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,255
The universe has no center and no edges.

19
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,924
Reality is arbitrary.

20
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,929
You want me to translate that?
I don't fucking get it.

21
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,263
Forget it.

22
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,057
He gets it.

23
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,887
What can I get you?

24
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,892
A double espresso?

25
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,751
Here you are, sir.

26
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,034
Here you go.

27
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,246
Two espressos...

28
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,913
...in separate cups.

29
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,791
The customer is always right.

30
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,125
You don't speak Spanish, right?

31
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,141
It's very loud here.

32
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,534
I believe that musical instruments,

33
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,953
especially those made out of wood --

34
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,749
Cellos, violins, guitars --

35
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,335
I believe that they resonate, musically,

36
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,004
even when they're not being played.

37
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,464
They have a memory.

38
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,842
Every note...

39
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,177
that's ever been played on them...

40
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,516
is still inside of them...

41
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,355
resonating in the molecules of the wood.

42
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,366
I guess, like everything,

43
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,537
it's just a matter of perception, no?

44
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,430
You don't speak Spanish, right?

45
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,314
You don't speak Spanish, right?

46
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,492
Something for the señorita?

47
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,493
A bottle of water, please.

48
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,939
...for the beautiful señorita.

49
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,386
That leaves one more night

50
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,680
for our beautiful love story.

51
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,787
You don't speak Spanish, right?

52
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:13,103
The universe has no center
and no edges.

53
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,561
Excuse me.

54
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,397
Are you an American gangster?

55
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,904
He says he's not.

56
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,702
Maybe he's just saying that...

57
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,668
We're closed.

58
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,882
We're not open now,

59
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,549
they're just rehearsing something.

60
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,474
You don't speak Spanish, right?

61
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,981
<i>He who thinks he's bigger than the rest...</i>

62
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:41,615
<i>must go to the cemetery.</i>

63
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,165
<i>There he will see</i>

64
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,335
<i>what the world really is.</i>

65
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,260
<i>It's a handful of dirt.</i>

66
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,752
You don't speak Spanish, right?

67
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,802
You don't speak Spanish, right?

68
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,492
You don't speak Spanish, right?

69
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,653
Son of a bitch.

70
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,448
She's crazy beautiful.

71
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,824
So beautiful.

72
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,959
The old men in my village used to say,

73
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,336
"Everything changes by the color

74
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,130
of the glass you see it through."

75
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,946
Do you know who the Huicholes are?

76
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,092
Okay.

77
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,468
I get it.

78
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,554
It's cool.

79
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,218
Go ahead, get in, get in.

80
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,807
Okay, cool. Crazy. Cool.

81
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:26,635
Those who think they're
bigger than the rest...

82
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,095
should go to the cemetery.

83
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,138
There,

84
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,975
they will see what life really is.

85
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,898
<i>There...</i>

86
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,649
<i>he will see...</i>

87
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,611
<i>what the world really is.</i>

88
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:51,155
<i>It's a handful of dirt.</i>
