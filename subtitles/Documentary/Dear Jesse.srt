1
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,599
He was growing into middle age...

2
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:14,148
...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.

3
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:18,087
He installed himself in a rocking chair...

4
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:20,226
...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...

5
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,176
...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...

6
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,406
...and reported happily
on their two children.

7
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,600
His children knew his legs...

8
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:36,964
...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.

9
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,722
They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.

10
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:46,214
They didn't even know
their father's name.

11
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:52,134
He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.

12
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:54,628
And he went everywhere unrecognized...

13
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:57,727
...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...

14
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,118
...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...

15
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:05,407
...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.

16
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,685
He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...

17
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,342
...and another in his thigh.

18
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,932
He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...

19
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:19,201
...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.

20
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:24,480
He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...

21
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,515
...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...

22
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:32,222
...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.

23
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,252
Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.

24
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,367
Rains fell straighter.

25
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,226
Clocks slowed.

26
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,040
Sounds were amplified.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,782
He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...

28
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:49,795
...in a Civil War that never ended.

29
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:55,103
He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.

30
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,403
He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...

31
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,694
...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...

32
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:13,338
...he was 34 years old.

33
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:23,614
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,679
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,083
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

36
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,311
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,935
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,207
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:45,684
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,098
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,074
He did his duty by her.

42
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:54,769
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:58,967
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:03,570
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:08,625
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:11,631
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,988
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,766
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,650
Chow!

50
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:28,239
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,233
You're right about that.

52
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,879
The river... You jump in the river.

53
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,191
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,692
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,247
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,699
Excuse me.

57
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:22,668
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,542
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,945
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,471
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,227
Yeah.

62
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,859
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:55,117
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,113
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:02,859
...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,358
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:09,038
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,096
...I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,908
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:32,234
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:37,832
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,031
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:51,239
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:53,163
Well, Charley...

75
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:57,868
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,540
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,424
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:07,717
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,752
...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:15,014
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:16,936
No.

82
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:19,399
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:24,265
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,161
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,630
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,614
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,064
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,469
Well...

89
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,342
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,020
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:49,860
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,573
You may as well quench your mind of it...

93
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:57,659
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,497
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,724
...as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:26,619
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:29,154
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:32,511
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:39,480
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.

100
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,826
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

101
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,732
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:49,977
Sidekick?

103
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,185
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:53,978
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:57,079
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,983
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,581
You understand?

108
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:09,820
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,790
All right.

110
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,837
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,795
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,340
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,763
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,770
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,749
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,974
Boy, you... You talk good.

117
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:44,694
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,962
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

119
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,757
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:56,087
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,782
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

122
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,752
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,132
She...

124
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,152
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:14,137
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,184
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:21,998
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,804
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,943
...but the kind of things she said to me...

130
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:32,110
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:35,219
My love said she would marry only me

132
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,957
And Jove himself could not make her care.

133
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,615
For what women say to lovers, you'll agree

134
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:45,710
One writes on running water or on air.

135
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:50,573
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,103
No.

137
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,698
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:00,652
How do you do?

139
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,971
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:08,653
How'd you know?

141
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,376
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,029
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,603
Is you?

144
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:21,577
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:25,740
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:28,913
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...

147
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:31,343
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,388
Dumplings?

149
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,244
Noodles.

150
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,828
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:46,703
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:50,121
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,525
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,883
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,513
I don't like to harp on a subject...

156
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,167
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,823
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,272
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:15,588
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,152
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,007
The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...

162
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:35,467
...from 1867 to 1881.

163
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,307
But except for Frank and Jesse James...

164
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:42,437
...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.

165
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:47,236
- Mine eye
All my soul and all my every part

166
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:50,758
And for this sin, there is no remedy

167
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,116
It is so grounded inward in my heart.

168
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,486
So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...

169
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,098
...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...

170
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,817
...culled from the local hillsides.

171
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,662
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,201
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,013
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:29,177
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:11,404
Fan out!

176
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,630
Hold your fire!

177
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:20,656
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,755
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,862
Hold your fire!

180
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,222
Let me in.

181
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,687
Buck! Boys!

182
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,826
Buck, this way!

183
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,003
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,100
No, I don't.

185
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,433
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,416
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,354
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

188
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,414
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,703
Hey, friend.

190
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,060
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,594
This shit. Nope.

192
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,570
Nope.

193
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,450
You got anything good here?

194
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:55,660
It could be.

195
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,691
Open that safe.

196
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,306
Do it!

197
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,642
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,145
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,696
...and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,309
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:41,030
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,205
Dig deeper.

203
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:47,905
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,888
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,706
What have you got?

206
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,068
Speak English.

207
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,582
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,495
Give me your money!

209
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,405
There's some receipts.

210
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,860
I got fives.

211
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,701
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,786
Don't look good.

213
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:35,042
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,049
Get down on your knees.

215
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:47,672
Why?

216
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,338
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,607
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,707
Get at!

219
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,158
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:08,858
All right.

221
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:37,337
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,641
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,212
Round them up!

224
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:22,998
Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...

225
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:25,072
...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...

226
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,591
...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.

227
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,519
Hey.

228
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:34,134
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,745
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,104
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,405
No.

232
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:45,872
You superstitious?

233
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,975
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:43,949
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:48,145
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,264
How old are you?

237
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,023
Twenty.

238
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:01,132
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,689
Till January, so...

240
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,285
I'm 19.

241
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:11,625
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,931
Yeah, I do.

243
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:34,504
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:39,078
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,624
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,888
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:50,086
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:54,820
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,158
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,462
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:05,538
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:10,017
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

253
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:13,734
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,623
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:19,202
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,790
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:25,160
You can jot that down in your little diary.

258
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:29,893
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:32,444
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,253
Wait.

261
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,219
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:51,270
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,686
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

264
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:06,018
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:07,970
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,547
...l've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,855
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:17,085
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:26,911
What's this?

270
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,733
Oh, yeah.

271
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,753
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:38,844
...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,988
Want me to read it?

274
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:42,681
Go on.

275
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,779
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,789
Here. Here.

277
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:53,912
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,271
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

279
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,783
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:03,327
...and great effort.

281
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:07,317
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,548
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:15,355
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,082
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:34,549
Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.

286
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:37,532
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,021
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,222
...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:46,901
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,058
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,261
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:23,447
Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...

293
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,122
...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.

294
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:44,430
He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.

295
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,880
But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...

296
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:53,901
...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.

297
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:34,158
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,677
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,166
Are you scared?

300
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,978
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:54,599
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,701
...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,621
...mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:03,980
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,615
I give them names.

306
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,340
Such as?

307
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:16,322
Such as enemies.

308
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,912
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:35,075
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:37,955
All right.

311
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,801
Me too?

312
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,747
You can stay.

313
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:48,576
All right.

314
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,167
Hey.

315
00:29:58,313 --> 00:30:00,899
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,586
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:06,174
...get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,381
And me to stick around.

319
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:13,600
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,428
...l'll have you know.

321
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:17,665
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,161
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,807
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:27,204
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,023
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,288
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:35,427
...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,761
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:43,936
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:48,251
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:51,874
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:53,763
All right.

333
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:57,849
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:03,193
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,177
See?

336
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:08,345
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,523
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:17,917
They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...

339
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:22,337
...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.

340
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,556
Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...

341
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:28,991
...and a daydreaming goodbye.

342
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:34,775
But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...

343
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,853
...Bob thought he might never go...

344
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:41,340
...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...

345
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,370
...and a gentleman helper to Zee.

346
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,947
He went everywhere with Jesse.

347
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,283
They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...

348
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:56,092
...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...

349
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:59,353
...and still complain about feeling tipsy.

350
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:02,867
Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.

351
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,420
If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.

352
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:11,028
If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...

353
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:14,808
...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...

354
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,040
...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...

355
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:21,020
...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.

356
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,073
Go away.

357
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:44,372
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:47,926
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:52,019
I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.

360
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:06,964
I can't figure it out.

361
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:09,902
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:11,757
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:19,602
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,266
Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...

365
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:26,860
...with a goodbye from Jesse...

366
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,804
...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.

367
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,948
It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.

368
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:42,319
And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.

369
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:47,147
Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...

370
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,773
...just after becoming a widow.

371
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,846
And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...

372
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:57,964
...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...

373
00:33:58,132 --> 00:34:00,519
...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.

374
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,317
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:05,331
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,939
Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...

377
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,691
...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...

378
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:13,681
...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.

379
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:17,007
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,151
Howdy!

381
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,077
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

382
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,957
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,844
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,947
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:30,448
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,997
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:36,942
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

388
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,893
Howdy!

389
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:42,477
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,193
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,301
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:58,246
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:02,636
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,690
How long you been there?

395
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,639
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:54,599
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:58,119
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,188
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,430
No.

400
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,622
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:08,797
What was the reason?

402
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,659
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:20,349
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:22,589
Is that so?

405
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:26,532
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,860
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,449
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

408
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:39,450
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:42,302
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,290
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,740
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,875
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:56,733
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:36:56,993 --> 00:37:01,019
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:09,149
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:21,816
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:24,221
...boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:27,253
You had better believe that.

419
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:29,365
And I'll look you up.

420
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:34,237
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:37,014
I will be hot.

422
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,498
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,918
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:56,533
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:24,302
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:26,099
Mister.

427
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,301
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:39,735
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

429
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,953
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,121
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,556
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,053
Let me see that picture.

433
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:54,832
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:57,102
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:38:57,271 --> 00:39:00,337
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

436
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,609
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:06,223
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,131
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:13,012
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:15,120
Boy, you...

441
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,318
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:22,378
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:26,028
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,499
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,994
...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,651
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:34,707
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:39:34,868 --> 00:39:37,584
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,917
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:40:04,689 --> 00:40:06,379
You see something?

451
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:09,292
Just a bird.

452
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,732
The month of October came...

453
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:18,190
...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...

454
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:22,575
...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.

455
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,172
On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...

456
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,369
...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.

457
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:39,660
Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.

458
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,261
Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...

459
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:55,144
...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.

460
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,525
How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.

461
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:17,952
Theirs was a wandering existence.

462
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:19,748
Men who choose to be outlaws...

463
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:23,690
...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.

464
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:36,451
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,754
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,334
Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...

467
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:47,260
...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...

468
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:50,432
...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.

469
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:00,254
You stay away from this one.

470
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:02,939
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,122
You got it?

472
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:29,628
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,973
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:37,976
How's that?

475
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:45,470
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,127
Did you?

477
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,583
No.

478
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:01,759
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,256
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

480
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,361
I'm glad.

481
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:37,947
How come?

482
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,397
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:45,617
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:50,969
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:57,364
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

486
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:05,588
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,346
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:14,645
...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:19,151
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:23,346
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,180
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:32,600
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,498
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:45,011
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:49,043
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:03,763
Good night.

497
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,665
Would you stop?

498
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,591
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:34,350
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:04,653
This is embarrassing.

501
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:09,188
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:14,211
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:46:14,381 --> 00:46:15,843
I ain't strange.

504
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,924
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:24,516
You look awful pretty.

506
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,559
Do I?

507
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:32,389
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:41,698
Is Wood awake?

509
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,061
It's just me.

510
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:56,359
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:47:41,254 --> 00:47:43,489
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:48,317
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:52,253
Why not?

514
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:21,185
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:48:45,184 --> 00:48:47,159
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:48,828
Yeah.

517
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:50,811
I suppose.

518
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:57,146
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

519
00:48:57,313 --> 00:49:00,540
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:04,475
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:07,575
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,525
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:49:11,263 --> 00:49:13,148
Your crops come in?

524
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,188
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:49:21,373 --> 00:49:23,641
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:25,947
So...

527
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:30,295
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,035
Why?

529
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:37,972
You're acting queer.

530
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:49,652
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:53,554
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:49:55,803 --> 00:49:57,360
You hear talk, though.

533
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:00,749
Talk?

534
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:06,547
People tell you things.

535
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:15,792
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:21,967
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:24,819
Jim Cummins.

538
00:50:25,973 --> 00:50:28,178
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:34,161
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:40,589
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:47,050
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:50:48,822 --> 00:50:50,991
Why would I do that?

543
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:54,891
That's just talk probably.

544
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:02,417
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:06,480
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:51:16,466 --> 00:51:18,766
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:51:22,257 --> 00:51:25,007
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:51:25,713 --> 00:51:27,654
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

549
00:51:28,272 --> 00:51:31,142
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:34,126
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:39,044
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:41,420
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:51:59,022 --> 00:52:01,509
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:05,931
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:10,572
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:16,800
Well...

557
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:20,447
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:47,168
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:52:51,914 --> 00:52:54,662
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:58,403
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:08,672
Okay.

562
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,284
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:25,693
We going to your place?

564
00:54:30,336 --> 00:54:32,375
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:35,733
Nobody has.

566
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,878
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,994
I'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,698
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:03,674
I guess so.

570
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:46,263
Howdy.

571
00:55:56,696 --> 00:55:58,736
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:56:03,606 --> 00:56:05,362
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:12,115
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:14,253
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:22,064
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,116
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:32,937
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:47,047
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:56:47,218 --> 00:56:48,910
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:56:50,802 --> 00:56:53,551
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:56:54,225 --> 00:56:56,168
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:56:57,008 --> 00:56:57,993
Shut up.

583
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,549
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,991
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:04,168
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,344
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:10,250
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:12,619
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:14,376
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:18,024
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:22,404
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,485
Just a little more here to get her started.

593
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:27,306
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:29,477
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,700
Where's Jim?

596
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,276
Where's Jim?

597
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:37,325
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:40,716
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
00:57:41,038 --> 00:57:43,208
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

600
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,995
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

601
00:57:46,156 --> 00:57:48,905
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

602
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,979
You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!

603
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,562
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

604
00:57:55,724 --> 00:57:58,057
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:50,790
I'm worn out.

606
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,763
I can't. No, see...

607
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:59,133
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:02,970
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

609
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:25,115
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,270
Jesse was sick...

611
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:58,711
...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.

612
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,716
Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.

613
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:06,390
He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...

614
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:10,967
...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.

615
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:16,500
And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.

616
01:00:56,508 --> 01:00:58,963
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

617
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:03,190
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

618
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,417
It still don't seem fair.

619
01:01:12,922 --> 01:01:14,383
Martha.

620
01:01:16,057 --> 01:01:18,545
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:24,371
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:31,317
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

623
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,811
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

624
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,531
Cover the kettle, Ida.

625
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:47,795
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

626
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:55,340
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

627
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,739
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

628
01:01:58,902 --> 01:02:00,362
...so I shot at him.

629
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:09,461
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

630
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:15,565
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

631
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,619
...has instigated such malice.

632
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:21,556
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

633
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:27,568
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

634
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,534
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,837
You mean he's here?

636
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:39,083
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:43,623
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:48,169
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

639
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:55,805
He's still sucking air.

640
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,038
But I think he's a goner.

641
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:11,936
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

642
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,038
Wood?

643
01:05:41,378 --> 01:05:43,548
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:47,125
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

645
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:51,258
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

646
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:54,647
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

647
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:56,855
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:03,478
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

649
01:06:04,509 --> 01:06:05,523
Why not?

650
01:06:06,942 --> 01:06:09,396
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:13,275
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

652
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:16,698
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

653
01:06:26,203 --> 01:06:29,717
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

654
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,856
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

655
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,441
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:39,952
...up to its utmost length in my body."

657
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,247
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

658
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,425
What chapter you on?

659
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:55,726
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

660
01:06:55,896 --> 01:06:58,101
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:07:00,345 --> 01:07:01,719
How's that leg?

662
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:06,482
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

663
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:53,037
Blessed are the poor in spirit...

664
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:55,375
...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

665
01:07:56,755 --> 01:08:02,091
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

666
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:06,002
Blessed are the...

667
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:10,856
Meek.

668
01:08:13,043 --> 01:08:14,799
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:51,269
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

670
01:08:51,438 --> 01:08:54,340
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

671
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,812
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

672
01:08:56,975 --> 01:09:00,770
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. With Mattie.

673
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:07,016
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

674
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:10,956
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

675
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:13,931
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:18,342
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

677
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:23,171
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

678
01:09:23,341 --> 01:09:24,834
Good thinking.

679
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:32,871
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:09:35,307 --> 01:09:37,250
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

681
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:40,866
...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

682
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:43,587
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

683
01:09:43,752 --> 01:09:46,307
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

684
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:52,774
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

685
01:09:58,536 --> 01:10:01,852
There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

686
01:10:02,024 --> 01:10:04,326
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.

687
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:08,830
It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.

688
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:23,261
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

689
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:33,502
Oh, yeah.

690
01:10:34,246 --> 01:10:38,303
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.

691
01:10:57,123 --> 01:10:59,905
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

692
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:03,295
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

693
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,492
...and you were by far
his most admired personage.

694
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,088
He couldn't get enough.

695
01:11:08,256 --> 01:11:12,283
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"
and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.

696
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:13,529
Fascinating.

697
01:11:13,697 --> 01:11:15,355
No, there's more. This is cute.

698
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:20,093
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

699
01:11:20,257 --> 01:11:23,833
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

700
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:26,902
Bob says... He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"

701
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:30,105
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

702
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,995
...for a man 5'8"tall?"

703
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,836
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

704
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:38,967
So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."

705
01:11:39,134 --> 01:11:40,596
That's a really stupid story.

706
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:45,173
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

707
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,959
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

708
01:11:54,556 --> 01:11:57,109
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

709
01:11:57,918 --> 01:12:00,338
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

710
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:12,568
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

711
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:22,388
I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...
It's the one about your...

712
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:24,376
Let Bob tell it.

713
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,413
All right.

714
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:35,597
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

715
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,598
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

716
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:44,113
Go on, Bob.

717
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,169
Yeah, come on, Bob.

718
01:12:46,872 --> 01:12:49,043
Tell us a story.

719
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:55,312
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

720
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,437
Come on.

721
01:13:10,038 --> 01:13:13,780
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

722
01:13:13,942 --> 01:13:17,836
...it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.

723
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:21,742
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

724
01:13:21,909 --> 01:13:24,755
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

725
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:29,456
...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

726
01:13:30,836 --> 01:13:34,992
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

727
01:13:36,723 --> 01:13:39,275
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

728
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:41,385
...with six letters in his name.

729
01:13:41,715 --> 01:13:47,081
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.

730
01:13:47,282 --> 01:13:50,860
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.

731
01:13:52,145 --> 01:13:54,218
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

732
01:13:54,387 --> 01:13:58,215
You're 5'8"tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

733
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:07,919
Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

734
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:11,375
...I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

735
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:30,982
Ain't he something?

736
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:47,076
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

737
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:49,194
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.

738
01:14:49,354 --> 01:14:51,939
He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.

739
01:14:52,392 --> 01:14:54,814
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...

740
01:14:54,985 --> 01:14:57,407
...so he could get in the gang.

741
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:00,576
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

742
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:05,054
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

743
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:10,014
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

744
01:15:10,183 --> 01:15:14,786
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

745
01:15:15,686 --> 01:15:18,686
One morning, George rides into camp...

746
01:15:18,855 --> 01:15:20,959
...and about 20 guns open up on him.

747
01:15:24,613 --> 01:15:28,891
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

748
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:36,541
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

749
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:39,967
You brought him to mind.

750
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,073
Well, it's not very flattering.

751
01:15:48,805 --> 01:15:51,488
Sure is good eating, Martha.

752
01:15:52,323 --> 01:15:54,462
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

753
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:56,699
How come George
had a grudge against you?

754
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:05,339
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

755
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:15,357
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

756
01:16:15,522 --> 01:16:17,662
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

757
01:16:17,826 --> 01:16:22,232
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

758
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:26,110
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

759
01:16:26,272 --> 01:16:29,850
"It was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."

760
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:36,767
It was just mean gossip, was it?

761
01:16:38,495 --> 01:16:41,660
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

762
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:48,828
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

763
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:52,633
I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before is all.

764
01:16:52,797 --> 01:16:55,832
Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.

765
01:16:55,998 --> 01:16:57,974
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

766
01:16:58,142 --> 01:17:00,728
Woman, shut your face for once.

767
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:09,690
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

768
01:17:09,852 --> 01:17:12,273
...without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

769
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:15,191
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...

770
01:17:15,356 --> 01:17:17,810
...you had to slap our cousin Albert around?

771
01:17:30,873 --> 01:17:32,630
I come by...

772
01:17:32,794 --> 01:17:36,056
...to ask if one of you two Fords...

773
01:17:36,249 --> 01:17:39,480
...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

774
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:43,093
I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.

775
01:17:43,256 --> 01:17:45,941
You've been acting sort of testy.

776
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:17,904
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

777
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:21,773
No. Not at all.

778
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,983
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

779
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:34,735
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

780
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,333
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

781
01:18:37,494 --> 01:18:39,467
You've seen me once or twice before.

782
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,611
I got a letter from George Hite.

783
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,002
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

784
01:18:47,443 --> 01:18:49,549
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

785
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,293
No, l... I can't imagine where he could be.

786
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:20,553
Yeah?

787
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:23,753
You finished with your sleeping?

788
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,620
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

789
01:19:38,799 --> 01:19:40,293
Yeah.

790
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:48,046
I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.

791
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,758
My good side won out and...

792
01:19:51,919 --> 01:19:54,700
Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.

793
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:59,752
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

794
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:04,522
I could use a little...
A little more sleep.

795
01:20:06,956 --> 01:20:08,900
You know I went to Kentucky?

796
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:11,211
Yeah.

797
01:20:11,883 --> 01:20:14,217
I come back through Saline County and...

798
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:17,352
...I think to myself:

799
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:22,439
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

800
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:26,181
So I do.

801
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:33,063
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

802
01:20:35,114 --> 01:20:37,763
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

803
01:20:39,242 --> 01:20:42,372
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

804
01:20:45,577 --> 01:20:48,545
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

805
01:20:49,033 --> 01:20:51,716
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

806
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:54,853
Let's go for a ride."

807
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:59,365
You understand what I'm saying?

808
01:21:00,552 --> 01:21:03,399
Going for a ride is like...

809
01:21:04,421 --> 01:21:07,422
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

810
01:21:09,318 --> 01:21:10,977
Exactly.

811
01:21:15,273 --> 01:21:16,678
So...

812
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:21,059
...Ed and Jesse...

813
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:25,535
...they argue on the road.

814
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:32,033
Did you ever count the stars?

815
01:21:35,364 --> 01:21:39,139
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

816
01:21:40,932 --> 01:21:43,833
I don't even know what a star is exactly.

817
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,541
Well, your body knows.

818
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,778
It's your mind that forgot.

819
01:22:01,154 --> 01:22:04,088
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:22:42,654 --> 01:22:44,410
It's okay.

821
01:23:06,301 --> 01:23:09,617
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

822
01:23:12,507 --> 01:23:14,874
And when push came to shove...

823
01:23:21,465 --> 01:23:23,767
...Jesse shot and killed him.

824
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,759
Jesse did.

825
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,789
You got it.

826
01:23:34,746 --> 01:23:36,056
You...

827
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,846
So, you see, your...

828
01:23:54,038 --> 01:23:56,407
Your cousin, he got off easy.

829
01:23:56,567 --> 01:23:58,095
I was just playing with Albert.

830
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:03,056
Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.

831
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:06,285
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

832
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:20,011
You got a tale to swap with me now?

833
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:30,737
I don't get your meaning.

834
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:37,808
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...

835
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,044
...it'd only be right...

836
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:44,110
...that you'd spit it out now.

837
01:24:55,442 --> 01:24:57,482
I can't think of a single thing.

838
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:02,923
About Wood Hite, for example.

839
01:25:03,088 --> 01:25:07,725
I'm not gonna... I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.

840
01:25:07,888 --> 01:25:10,822
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

841
01:25:10,992 --> 01:25:13,578
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

842
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:15,559
Bob.

843
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:19,748
That's just his way. He's antsy.

844
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:21,869
You know?

845
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:39,876
You go on back to sleep now.

846
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:44,453
You got me agitated now, you see?

847
01:25:50,606 --> 01:25:54,631
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

848
01:25:55,147 --> 01:25:58,016
You ought to pity my poor wife.

849
01:26:00,587 --> 01:26:02,658
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

850
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:06,123
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

851
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,690
I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.

852
01:26:13,066 --> 01:26:15,454
You ought to pity me too.

853
01:26:59,143 --> 01:27:02,916
As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...

854
01:27:03,174 --> 01:27:06,522
...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...

855
01:27:06,694 --> 01:27:09,410
...while his ruined leg mended.

856
01:27:14,212 --> 01:27:17,890
And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...

857
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:24,030
...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.

858
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:26,875
Right, you boys are cornered!

859
01:27:27,043 --> 01:27:31,385
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!

860
01:27:36,323 --> 01:27:37,305
Don't shoot!

861
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,638
Come on out and show yourself!

862
01:27:58,079 --> 01:27:59,542
Hello.

863
01:27:59,872 --> 01:28:01,433
We got him.

864
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:03,766
Give me that Colt, son.

865
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:10,966
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

866
01:28:11,135 --> 01:28:14,005
...I have a warrant here
for your arrest...

867
01:28:14,174 --> 01:28:18,365
Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...

868
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:21,395
...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.

869
01:28:22,973 --> 01:28:25,591
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

870
01:28:25,758 --> 01:28:29,237
- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

871
01:28:29,406 --> 01:28:31,196
Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...

872
01:28:31,358 --> 01:28:33,660
...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...

873
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:36,787
...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.

874
01:28:36,956 --> 01:28:40,373
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

875
01:28:40,539 --> 01:28:42,450
...to recognize publicly...

876
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,173
...the intelligent and effective assistance...

877
01:28:45,339 --> 01:28:49,943
...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

878
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:53,422
...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...

879
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,706
...of the James band.

880
01:28:55,867 --> 01:28:58,387
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...

881
01:28:58,555 --> 01:29:02,515
...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

882
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:05,496
...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.

883
01:29:06,617 --> 01:29:11,090
Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.

884
01:29:11,257 --> 01:29:13,527
However, before I sit...

885
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:16,688
...I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

886
01:29:17,114 --> 01:29:20,658
...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...

887
01:29:20,824 --> 01:29:24,500
...my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

888
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:38,224
Yes.

889
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:40,915
Just let my attorney know.

890
01:29:48,245 --> 01:29:51,376
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:29:51,701 --> 01:29:53,197
Get out of the way now.

892
01:30:02,771 --> 01:30:06,700
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

893
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:08,492
I was just gonna say hello.

894
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,758
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

895
01:30:11,923 --> 01:30:16,974
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

896
01:30:17,138 --> 01:30:21,198
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.

897
01:30:21,363 --> 01:30:24,112
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

898
01:30:29,393 --> 01:30:31,434
Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...

899
01:30:31,601 --> 01:30:35,628
...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.

900
01:30:35,792 --> 01:30:38,608
And he was never consistent
in his recollections.

901
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:46,667
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

902
01:30:47,312 --> 01:30:49,451
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:30:51,249 --> 01:30:52,709
Liddil.

904
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:55,278
I beg your pardon?

905
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,092
I spell it with two D's.

906
01:30:57,262 --> 01:30:59,532
He's given us a full confession, governor.

907
01:30:59,695 --> 01:31:01,701
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,254
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

909
01:31:05,421 --> 01:31:09,133
...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

910
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,881
You Robert Ford?

911
01:31:15,246 --> 01:31:16,490
How old are you?

912
01:31:18,477 --> 01:31:19,851
Twenty.

913
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:22,562
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

914
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:26,475
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

915
01:31:26,636 --> 01:31:29,254
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

916
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,875
He's just acting in capacity as a...

917
01:31:33,996 --> 01:31:36,070
...private detective.

918
01:31:37,196 --> 01:31:39,137
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...

919
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:42,340
...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.

920
01:31:42,506 --> 01:31:45,026
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

921
01:31:45,194 --> 01:31:47,583
...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

922
01:31:47,755 --> 01:31:49,609
I'll wreck his train first.

923
01:31:56,874 --> 01:32:00,868
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

924
01:32:01,035 --> 01:32:03,269
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

925
01:32:03,432 --> 01:32:06,116
...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

926
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,419
...killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:12,032
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...

928
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,850
...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

929
01:32:15,016 --> 01:32:19,555
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

930
01:32:20,038 --> 01:32:22,625
I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.

931
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:25,344
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:28,097
I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...

933
01:32:28,391 --> 01:32:31,174
...and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:32:34,376 --> 01:32:37,342
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:32:53,028 --> 01:32:55,199
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:32:55,747 --> 01:32:57,310
Come on, now.

937
01:33:39,871 --> 01:33:42,327
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:33:44,288 --> 01:33:49,405
I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.

939
01:33:50,431 --> 01:33:56,061
Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.

940
01:33:56,223 --> 01:34:00,444
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

941
01:34:06,942 --> 01:34:09,657
I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

942
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:13,617
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

943
01:34:17,244 --> 01:34:20,147
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

944
01:34:20,316 --> 01:34:22,684
...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:34:28,922 --> 01:34:31,607
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

946
01:34:31,771 --> 01:34:36,179
...I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

947
01:34:36,346 --> 01:34:39,827
...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.

948
01:34:42,203 --> 01:34:46,991
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...

949
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,416
A savings bank or a...

950
01:34:57,081 --> 01:34:58,738
A railroad.

951
01:35:05,817 --> 01:35:08,979
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

952
01:35:09,143 --> 01:35:11,793
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.

953
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:15,059
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

954
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:19,314
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

955
01:35:21,335 --> 01:35:23,954
You forget I already met the kid.

956
01:35:25,205 --> 01:35:27,823
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:35:28,342 --> 01:35:30,992
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:34,769
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...

959
01:35:34,933 --> 01:35:37,005
...whenever you need a third man.

960
01:35:40,372 --> 01:35:43,274
I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.

961
01:35:43,444 --> 01:35:45,549
That's my main intention.

962
01:35:54,259 --> 01:35:56,813
Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...

963
01:35:56,978 --> 01:36:00,392
...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.

964
01:36:01,012 --> 01:36:02,060
During this time...

965
01:36:02,228 --> 01:36:06,089
...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...

966
01:36:06,259 --> 01:36:09,192
...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.

967
01:36:09,615 --> 01:36:11,788
All right, three cans...

968
01:36:11,954 --> 01:36:15,532
...peaches. Two cans...

969
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:19,176
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:21,033
One bottle...

971
01:36:23,727 --> 01:36:26,793
...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...

972
01:36:29,744 --> 01:36:32,199
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,302
I'll be right with you.

974
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:52,874
I haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:36:54,285 --> 01:36:56,555
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:36:57,615 --> 01:36:58,923
No.

977
01:37:00,046 --> 01:37:01,419
No?

978
01:37:04,044 --> 01:37:06,695
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

979
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,984
...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

980
01:37:11,147 --> 01:37:15,272
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

981
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:21,473
And he will kill you if he gets the chance.

982
01:37:24,585 --> 01:37:27,041
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:37:31,466 --> 01:37:33,124
Yes, I am.

984
01:37:36,073 --> 01:37:37,733
I've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:37:38,635 --> 01:37:40,389
I was the baby.

986
01:37:40,649 --> 01:37:43,944
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

987
01:37:45,095 --> 01:37:49,602
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

988
01:37:52,903 --> 01:37:55,074
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:37:55,946 --> 01:37:58,017
...and I'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:37:58,248 --> 01:38:00,255
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

991
01:38:00,423 --> 01:38:03,204
...and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

992
01:38:14,726 --> 01:38:15,740
Well...

993
01:38:16,901 --> 01:38:18,812
...wait for your chance.

994
01:38:19,301 --> 01:38:22,563
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...

995
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,699
...let him get behind you.

996
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:53,820
You been chosen.

997
01:38:58,594 --> 01:39:00,120
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:39:01,346 --> 01:39:03,734
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.

999
01:39:03,906 --> 01:39:07,103
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

1000
01:39:10,273 --> 01:39:12,247
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

1001
01:39:12,896 --> 01:39:15,451
I been crying myself to sleep every night.

1002
01:39:24,608 --> 01:39:26,516
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

1003
01:39:26,687 --> 01:39:30,364
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

1004
01:39:31,038 --> 01:39:32,762
- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.

1005
01:39:32,928 --> 01:39:37,205
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.

1006
01:40:16,506 --> 01:40:20,566
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

1007
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:00,819
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:41:04,533 --> 01:41:05,996
For what?

1009
01:41:07,893 --> 01:41:09,684
For arresting him.

1010
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:17,103
You and me, huh?

1011
01:41:20,596 --> 01:41:23,728
It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.

1012
01:41:23,892 --> 01:41:26,380
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

1013
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:29,712
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

1014
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:33,289
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.

1015
01:41:34,675 --> 01:41:39,115
It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.

1016
01:41:40,564 --> 01:41:42,831
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

1017
01:41:44,819 --> 01:41:49,093
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't
go any further than that right now.

1018
01:41:52,531 --> 01:41:53,904
You'll come around.

1019
01:41:54,994 --> 01:41:57,360
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:41:57,522 --> 01:42:00,717
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

1021
01:42:08,273 --> 01:42:10,509
He's just a human being.

1022
01:42:18,414 --> 01:42:21,414
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

1023
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:26,533
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

1024
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:24,294
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.

1025
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:26,374
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

1026
01:43:26,537 --> 01:43:29,570
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

1027
01:43:39,368 --> 01:43:41,190
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:43:45,286 --> 01:43:48,156
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.

1029
01:43:52,583 --> 01:43:55,135
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:44:04,455 --> 01:44:06,657
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:44:07,013 --> 01:44:11,040
...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

1032
01:44:13,798 --> 01:44:15,651
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:44:17,285 --> 01:44:20,001
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:44:21,573 --> 01:44:25,980
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...

1035
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:30,690
...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

1036
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,113
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,943
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:03,200
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

1039
01:45:03,424 --> 01:45:05,843
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

1040
01:45:06,622 --> 01:45:09,918
...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

1041
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:12,468
...but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:15,642
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:21,180
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:45:22,974 --> 01:45:26,835
You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...

1045
01:45:27,005 --> 01:45:30,900
...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

1046
01:45:34,171 --> 01:45:35,547
Yeah.

1047
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:41,402
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

1048
01:45:42,236 --> 01:45:44,276
...and make me wonder...

1049
01:45:44,668 --> 01:45:46,937
...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.

1050
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:50,575
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

1051
01:46:07,355 --> 01:46:09,208
You two having a spat?

1052
01:46:14,264 --> 01:46:16,654
I was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:46:21,913 --> 01:46:24,148
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:27,506
Come on.

1055
01:46:38,198 --> 01:46:40,435
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:46:41,077 --> 01:46:42,900
Me and the kid...

1057
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:46,858
...will walk into that bank
just before noon.

1058
01:46:48,662 --> 01:46:51,181
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:46:51,702 --> 01:46:54,800
...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

1060
01:46:54,966 --> 01:46:57,716
...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...

1061
01:46:57,876 --> 01:47:00,113
...and I'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:01,354
And I'll say:

1063
01:47:01,524 --> 01:47:04,143
"How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...

1064
01:47:04,308 --> 01:47:06,480
...when so many of mine
are in coffins?" I'll say:

1065
01:47:06,645 --> 01:47:09,839
"How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"

1066
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:14,001
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

1067
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:17,194
...he will flop on the floor like a fish.

1068
01:47:20,723 --> 01:47:22,991
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:47:31,857 --> 01:47:35,086
Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...

1070
01:47:35,379 --> 01:47:38,606
...hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

1071
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:40,079
What's happening to me?"

1072
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:43,661
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:46,343
You were white as spit in a cotton field.

1074
01:47:46,863 --> 01:47:49,231
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:47:50,799 --> 01:47:54,693
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.

1076
01:47:59,983 --> 01:48:02,351
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:48:02,991 --> 01:48:04,747
I was. I was.

1078
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:09,698
"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking. "That done ruined my day."

1079
01:48:17,165 --> 01:48:18,540
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:48:48,235 --> 01:48:51,944
Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.

1081
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:55,680
And Bob remained awake.

1082
01:48:58,409 --> 01:49:01,638
He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.

1083
01:49:02,474 --> 01:49:06,302
He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...

1084
01:49:07,178 --> 01:49:10,525
...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.

1085
01:49:40,389 --> 01:49:42,395
I need to go to the privy.

1086
01:49:43,558 --> 01:49:46,820
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:11,164
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:50:12,066 --> 01:50:15,263
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

1089
01:50:15,428 --> 01:50:16,987
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

1090
01:50:17,153 --> 01:50:20,121
Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?

1091
01:50:22,915 --> 01:50:24,921
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.

1092
01:50:25,089 --> 01:50:27,358
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:50:28,258 --> 01:50:30,232
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

1094
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:34,044
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

1095
01:50:35,904 --> 01:50:37,148
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:50:37,313 --> 01:50:40,957
And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...

1097
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,696
...merry, moody, fey...

1098
01:50:44,863 --> 01:50:46,869
...unpredictable.

1099
01:50:48,351 --> 01:50:51,350
He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...

1100
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:55,347
...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...

1101
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:58,168
...and goodwill towards others.

1102
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:03,289
But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...

1103
01:51:03,454 --> 01:51:06,934
...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...

1104
01:51:07,102 --> 01:51:10,898
...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.

1105
01:51:13,594 --> 01:51:16,116
Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...

1106
01:51:16,284 --> 01:51:18,836
...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...

1107
01:51:19,003 --> 01:51:22,833
...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...

1108
01:51:23,004 --> 01:51:24,761
...and was only acting the innocent...

1109
01:51:24,924 --> 01:51:29,659
...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.

1110
01:51:50,458 --> 01:51:52,563
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:51:54,394 --> 01:51:57,009
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:52:04,599 --> 01:52:05,745
How do you mean?

1113
01:52:14,615 --> 01:52:16,274
It's a present.

1114
01:52:20,758 --> 01:52:22,252
It's heavy.

1115
01:52:22,806 --> 01:52:24,846
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:52:26,357 --> 01:52:28,081
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

1117
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:30,386
It ain't no joke.

1118
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:39,084
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:52:40,563 --> 01:52:43,150
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:52:43,349 --> 01:52:44,841
It's more than I could hope for.

1121
01:52:45,011 --> 01:52:47,695
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

1122
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:50,510
...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.

1123
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:53,041
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:52:53,523 --> 01:52:56,044
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:59,112
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:52:59,282 --> 01:53:01,487
I might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:53:04,627 --> 01:53:07,013
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

1128
01:53:08,018 --> 01:53:10,735
He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...

1129
01:53:10,898 --> 01:53:13,450
...and even them I was cautious around.

1130
01:53:14,226 --> 01:53:16,134
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:53:18,033 --> 01:53:20,902
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

1132
01:53:21,073 --> 01:53:24,552
...I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

1133
01:53:25,263 --> 01:53:29,736
...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.

1134
01:53:32,016 --> 01:53:34,700
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

1135
01:53:34,864 --> 01:53:37,831
No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.

1136
01:53:39,567 --> 01:53:42,949
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

1137
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:48,292
I go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:53:48,463 --> 01:53:52,390
...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

1139
01:53:53,134 --> 01:53:56,713
...and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

1140
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,234
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:54:15,371 --> 01:54:16,680
Well...

1142
01:54:23,052 --> 01:54:27,492
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1143
01:54:40,298 --> 01:54:43,113
The day before he died was Palm Sunday.

1144
01:54:44,105 --> 01:54:47,268
And Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...

1145
01:54:47,432 --> 01:54:49,406
...and their cousin Charles Johnson...

1146
01:54:49,575 --> 01:54:54,530
...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.

1147
01:54:56,841 --> 01:54:59,043
Bob remained at the cottage...

1148
01:54:59,206 --> 01:55:02,469
...and slyly migrated from room to room.

1149
01:55:04,967 --> 01:55:06,724
He walked into the master bedroom...

1150
01:55:06,887 --> 01:55:10,499
...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.

1151
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:19,746
He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.

1152
01:55:21,989 --> 01:55:26,081
He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.

1153
01:55:33,668 --> 01:55:35,773
His fingers skittered over his ribs...

1154
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:39,649
...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.

1155
01:55:43,299 --> 01:55:47,707
He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.

1156
01:55:54,850 --> 01:55:57,664
He imagined himself at 34.

1157
01:55:59,586 --> 01:56:02,456
He imagined himself in a coffin.

1158
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:06,107
He considered possibilities...

1159
01:56:06,273 --> 01:56:09,437
...and everything wonderful
that could come true.

1160
01:56:36,095 --> 01:56:37,947
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
01:56:42,973 --> 01:56:45,047
Yeah, he is.

1162
01:56:47,261 --> 01:56:49,651
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
01:57:02,459 --> 01:57:04,794
You're imagining things.

1164
01:57:16,538 --> 01:57:18,428
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:22,609
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,500
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
01:58:12,726 --> 01:58:14,252
Morning.

1168
01:58:17,909 --> 01:58:19,371
Charley.

1169
01:58:47,986 --> 01:58:50,319
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
01:58:54,642 --> 01:58:56,976
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
01:59:15,406 --> 01:59:17,774
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
01:59:19,183 --> 01:59:21,966
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

1173
01:59:22,127 --> 01:59:23,883
...so all creation can see your guns?

1174
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:42,282
Hi.

1175
01:59:52,172 --> 01:59:54,954
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

1176
01:59:56,043 --> 01:59:58,083
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:00:02,058 --> 02:00:05,093
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

1178
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:09,219
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

1179
02:00:10,666 --> 02:00:12,639
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:00:14,186 --> 02:00:16,642
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

1181
02:00:19,595 --> 02:00:22,244
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

1182
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:41,541
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

1183
02:00:41,799 --> 02:00:43,554
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, l...

1184
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,921
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:01:10,595 --> 02:01:13,857
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

1186
02:01:14,819 --> 02:01:16,544
Mary?

1187
02:01:20,164 --> 02:01:22,584
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

1188
02:01:25,476 --> 02:01:27,101
Nothing.

1189
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:30,335
I was talking about his mind, not yours.

1190
02:01:31,234 --> 02:01:32,893
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:01:33,314 --> 02:01:34,941
Oh, I get it.

1192
02:02:28,093 --> 02:02:29,982
Well, hello now.

1193
02:02:30,367 --> 02:02:33,267
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1194
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,374
You don't say so.

1195
02:02:54,107 --> 02:02:56,113
That's very strange.

1196
02:02:56,539 --> 02:02:59,321
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.

1197
02:02:59,483 --> 02:03:01,969
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.

1198
02:03:02,618 --> 02:03:05,138
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

1199
02:03:15,896 --> 02:03:18,830
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

1200
02:03:57,844 --> 02:03:59,470
You two ready?

1201
02:04:03,029 --> 02:04:05,580
I will be, by noon.

1202
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:39,689
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1203
02:04:39,856 --> 02:04:42,507
She's loaded deep
As deep can be

1204
02:04:42,674 --> 02:04:44,811
But not as deep
As the love I'm in

1205
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,842
I know not if I sink or swim

1206
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,466
The water is wide

1207
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:58,853
I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly

1208
02:04:59,278 --> 02:05:02,923
Give me a boat
That can carry two

1209
02:05:03,088 --> 02:05:05,838
Both shall row
My love and I

1210
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,315
For love is gentle
And love is kind

1211
02:05:09,486 --> 02:05:12,356
Sweetest flower
When first it's new

1212
02:05:12,527 --> 02:05:15,973
But love grows old
And waxes cold

1213
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:19,239
And fades away
Like the morning dew

1214
02:05:19,406 --> 02:05:22,306
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1215
02:05:22,476 --> 02:05:25,128
I guess I'll take my guns off...

1216
02:05:25,451 --> 02:05:27,361
...for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:05:59,305 --> 02:06:01,641
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:07:39,552 --> 02:07:42,423
What have...? What have you done?

1219
02:07:44,767 --> 02:07:46,329
Jesse.

1220
02:07:51,646 --> 02:07:52,629
Jesse?

1221
02:07:53,727 --> 02:07:55,768
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:07:56,481 --> 02:07:58,267
Jesse!

1223
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:01,237
No!

1224
02:08:05,245 --> 02:08:07,482
No. Jess...

1225
02:08:08,062 --> 02:08:12,283
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:08:14,332 --> 02:08:18,326
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:08:18,813 --> 02:08:22,555
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:08:22,749 --> 02:08:25,016
I swear to God I didn't.

1229
02:08:25,978 --> 02:08:27,353
It was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:08:29,467 --> 02:08:32,696
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:09:16,182 --> 02:09:17,326
Put my name.

1232
02:09:17,494 --> 02:09:19,862
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

1233
02:09:26,774 --> 02:09:28,717
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:10:05,106 --> 02:10:07,113
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:10:14,929 --> 02:10:17,317
The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...

1236
02:10:17,489 --> 02:10:21,895
...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.

1237
02:10:27,217 --> 02:10:32,201
Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...

1238
02:10:32,559 --> 02:10:36,902
...or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.

1239
02:10:37,776 --> 02:10:42,085
The man who offered 30,000 dollars for
the body of President Garfield's assassin...

1240
02:10:42,254 --> 02:10:45,997
...sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...

1241
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,362
...for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...

1242
02:10:48,524 --> 02:10:51,177
...so that he could go around the country
with it...

1243
02:10:53,484 --> 02:10:58,242
...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.

1244
02:11:02,157 --> 02:11:05,124
Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...

1245
02:11:05,292 --> 02:11:07,778
...nestled in his bed of ice.

1246
02:11:07,948 --> 02:11:12,039
And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...

1247
02:11:12,204 --> 02:11:15,716
...to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...

1248
02:11:15,883 --> 02:11:19,712
...the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.

1249
02:11:43,881 --> 02:11:45,768
Hello, here!

1250
02:11:45,961 --> 02:11:48,449
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1251
02:11:48,616 --> 02:11:53,538
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

1252
02:11:53,704 --> 02:11:57,412
You mean he did? I didn't know.

1253
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:00,101
But I knew I had not fooled him.

1254
02:12:00,263 --> 02:12:03,940
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.

1255
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:08,256
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.

1256
02:12:08,422 --> 02:12:11,521
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.

1257
02:12:14,629 --> 02:12:17,182
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:12:18,982 --> 02:12:21,764
It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...

1259
02:12:21,925 --> 02:12:24,097
...and Charley, not a jot.

1260
02:12:24,261 --> 02:12:27,076
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:12:27,845 --> 02:12:30,845
Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...

1262
02:12:31,014 --> 02:12:35,485
...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.

1263
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:05,470
And that's...

1264
02:13:06,017 --> 02:13:08,569
...how I killed Jesse James.

1265
02:13:11,905 --> 02:13:15,288
By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...

1266
02:13:15,457 --> 02:13:19,548
...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.

1267
02:13:20,192 --> 02:13:24,730
He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.

1268
02:13:24,894 --> 02:13:27,000
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:13:27,519 --> 02:13:32,058
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

1270
02:13:32,222 --> 02:13:34,230
Charley was increasingly superstitious...

1271
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:36,983
...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...

1272
02:13:37,151 --> 02:13:41,013
...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.

1273
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:44,313
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

1274
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:51,098
Shit.

1275
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,714
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:01,817
Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.

1277
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:04,404
His gait seemed more practiced.

1278
02:14:04,573 --> 02:14:07,735
His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.

1279
02:14:07,901 --> 02:14:10,200
His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...

1280
02:14:10,363 --> 02:14:13,265
...to a script Jesse might have originated.

1281
02:14:15,962 --> 02:14:18,297
He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...

1282
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:20,978
...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...

1283
02:14:21,147 --> 02:14:25,489
...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.

1284
02:14:26,778 --> 02:14:28,534
Murderer!

1285
02:14:28,857 --> 02:14:30,516
Cur!

1286
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:32,819
Coward!

1287
02:14:36,217 --> 02:14:40,558
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

1288
02:14:40,953 --> 02:14:44,565
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:14:49,016 --> 02:14:50,804
Nobody.

1290
02:15:04,789 --> 02:15:06,514
Coward!

1291
02:15:30,675 --> 02:15:36,012
By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.

1292
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:39,790
He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...

1293
02:15:39,954 --> 02:15:43,019
...recapitulated an act of betrayal.

1294
02:15:48,017 --> 02:15:50,668
Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...

1295
02:15:50,833 --> 02:15:53,650
...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.

1296
02:15:53,907 --> 02:15:57,518
He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...

1297
02:15:57,682 --> 02:16:00,647
...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...

1298
02:16:00,817 --> 02:16:02,921
...begging her forgiveness...

1299
02:16:04,176 --> 02:16:06,665
...none of which he mailed.

1300
02:16:33,390 --> 02:16:38,756
Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.

1301
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:48,490
Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men

1302
02:16:49,643 --> 02:16:53,900
He robbed the Glendale train

1303
02:16:54,125 --> 02:16:59,720
And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor

1304
02:16:59,948 --> 02:17:04,683
He had a hand
And a heart and a brain

1305
02:17:05,452 --> 02:17:10,719
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1306
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:15,777
Three children
They were brave

1307
02:17:15,945 --> 02:17:21,314
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1308
02:17:21,545 --> 02:17:26,401
Has laid Jesse James in his grave

1309
02:17:27,432 --> 02:17:32,223
It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward

1310
02:17:32,937 --> 02:17:37,157
I wonder how does he feel

1311
02:17:37,318 --> 02:17:42,817
For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed

1312
02:17:42,982 --> 02:17:47,807
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave

1313
02:17:48,263 --> 02:17:53,566
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1314
02:17:53,734 --> 02:17:58,436
Three children
They were brave

1315
02:17:58,597 --> 02:18:03,998
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1316
02:18:04,166 --> 02:18:08,158
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave

1317
02:18:19,237 --> 02:18:21,176
I'm Robert Ford.

1318
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:35,035
It was two children, not three.

1319
02:18:45,953 --> 02:18:47,230
Hey.

1320
02:18:48,096 --> 02:18:50,551
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:18:51,232 --> 02:18:55,095
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

1322
02:19:25,566 --> 02:19:27,669
He thought, at his angriest...

1323
02:19:27,836 --> 02:19:31,447
...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:

1324
02:19:33,339 --> 02:19:36,470
Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...

1325
02:19:38,878 --> 02:19:41,843
...the Wymore family in Clay County...

1326
02:19:46,778 --> 02:19:50,903
...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.

1327
02:19:53,849 --> 02:19:56,719
He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...

1328
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:59,736
...the man who killed Jesse James.

1329
02:20:01,114 --> 02:20:04,049
He imagined they would
be grateful to him.

1330
02:20:52,917 --> 02:20:57,706
It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...

1331
02:20:57,878 --> 02:21:02,131
...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.

1332
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:26,793
He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.

1333
02:21:26,961 --> 02:21:30,671
He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...

1334
02:21:31,378 --> 02:21:35,239
...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...

1335
02:21:35,409 --> 02:21:37,830
...as if they'd happened a long time ago.

1336
02:21:39,343 --> 02:21:41,384
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:21:45,521 --> 02:21:47,463
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:21:52,463 --> 02:21:55,561
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?

1339
02:21:58,191 --> 02:21:59,532
Yeah.

1340
02:21:59,982 --> 02:22:01,958
And the reward money.

1341
02:22:07,534 --> 02:22:10,217
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:22:18,093 --> 02:22:20,328
You know what I expected?

1343
02:22:21,324 --> 02:22:23,233
Applause.

1344
02:22:25,709 --> 02:22:29,703
I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.

1345
02:22:33,645 --> 02:22:36,196
I was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:22:37,229 --> 02:22:39,115
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:22:42,411 --> 02:22:44,199
He was ashamed of his boasting...

1348
02:22:44,362 --> 02:22:47,113
...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.

1349
02:22:47,403 --> 02:22:51,015
He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...

1350
02:22:52,586 --> 02:22:56,809
...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:

1351
02:22:59,273 --> 02:23:02,175
That he truly regretted killing Jesse...

1352
02:23:02,919 --> 02:23:05,790
...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...

1353
02:23:06,312 --> 02:23:09,313
...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.

1354
02:23:27,975 --> 02:23:29,982
Even as he circulated his saloon...

1355
02:23:30,152 --> 02:23:33,761
...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.

1356
02:23:34,822 --> 02:23:36,579
He received so many menacing letters...

1357
02:23:36,742 --> 02:23:40,037
...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.

1358
02:23:43,686 --> 02:23:48,288
He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...

1359
02:23:49,732 --> 02:23:54,042
...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.

1360
02:23:58,084 --> 02:24:02,208
Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. On the 8th.

1361
02:24:03,619 --> 02:24:07,394
He had no grand scheme, no strategy...

1362
02:24:07,555 --> 02:24:09,858
...no agreement with higher authorities...

1363
02:24:10,019 --> 02:24:12,669
...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...

1364
02:24:13,699 --> 02:24:17,788
...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.

1365
02:24:25,251 --> 02:24:28,380
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

1366
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,830
The other one.

1367
02:24:35,232 --> 02:24:37,882
Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...

1368
02:24:38,048 --> 02:24:40,830
...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.

1369
02:24:40,994 --> 02:24:43,642
Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...

1370
02:24:43,807 --> 02:24:45,979
...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...

1371
02:24:46,144 --> 02:24:50,932
...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.

1372
02:24:51,519 --> 02:24:55,741
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

1373
02:24:57,118 --> 02:25:01,142
My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.

1374
02:25:02,046 --> 02:25:03,420
I hear you.

1375
02:25:16,443 --> 02:25:18,234
There would be no eulogies for Bob...

1376
02:25:19,868 --> 02:25:23,796
...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...

1377
02:25:24,475 --> 02:25:28,666
...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...

1378
02:25:30,331 --> 02:25:33,180
...no biographies would be written
about him...

1379
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:35,794
...no children named after him.

1380
02:25:37,307 --> 02:25:41,846
No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.

1381
02:25:46,202 --> 02:25:47,860
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:53,266
The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...

1383
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:57,553
...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...

1384
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:00,109
...the light going out of his eyes...

1385
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:02,897
