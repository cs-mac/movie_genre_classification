Translation by 神マヌエル.

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Thanks for taking me to this place, it's pretty.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,020
I know isn't it just beautiful.

4
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,020
I'm really enjoying it here with you.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,720
Hey Asuna you want to leave?

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,420
Hey Kirito why would you say that?

7
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,020
*Giggles* I'm just playing around, why would I want to leave this place, When I get to be here with you.
Hey Kirito why would you say that?

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,290
*Giggles* I'm just playing around, why would I want to leave this place, When I get to be here with you.

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,890
Even though we're different it was fate that brought us together.

10
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,290
I know.
Even though we're different it was fate that brought us together.

11
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,390
I know.

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,390
But this view can never be made in any game creation.

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,000
I hope you like your surprise present.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,300
This is my new mission.

15
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,560
And make a new world.

16
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:31,040
A world similar to sword art online, the game created by Kayaba Akihiko where you can't log out.

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,530
A game where death in the game means death in real life.

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,180
A game created for survival.

19
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,880
Where suicide is allowed, and where a player can kill another player.

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,880
A world that's in a calling for an end.

21
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,880
One stud up, and heard they're calls.

22
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:09,880
The one player to end they're suffering in the virtual world.

23
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,280
In results of 6000 minimum survived.

24
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,360
And 4000 people died because of Kayaba Akihiko.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,700
That one player, or well known as a SAO Survivor.

26
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,520
Now living a normal life with his friends and family.

27
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm sorry but did you get that last night?

28
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,220
Can you please tell me what that is?

29
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh yes, this? This is the new Augma.

30
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,080
Introducing the grand revival of the new Augma. Showing a brand new world right in front of your eyes.

31
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,260
A device that's worn on your face, that uses augmented reality. To make things virtual, come to life.
Introducing the grand revival of the new Augma. Showing a brand new world right in front of your eyes.

32
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,080
A device that's worn on your face, that uses augmented reality. To make things virtual, come to life.

33
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:43,320
You may be saying, how does it stack against the virtual reality goggles? and can you give me the differences, between both of them.

34
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:54,440
To answer how it stacks up against the virtual reality goggles, the price of the VR goggles is 10,000 yen and the price of AR head gear is 7,000 yen.

35
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,700
Also, the AR headset doesn't use full dive technique but instead. It uses, augmented reality.

36
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you use the AR Headset, to play games?

37
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, on the but there is one game that stands out, called "Ordinal Scale".

38
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Ordinal Scale is a AR game with a complex ranking system. It gives players a rewards and a random score after killing a certain enemy. And with that score you can increase your rank and get real life prizes.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can purchase stuff like electronics, gift cards, accessories, food, and much more.

40
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think I'll give this a try, and try pick up some very pretty women.

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There are drones around the area, that is used to spawn bosses, enemies, and to change the environment. Into, a fun virtual world. And to show our favorite star yuna.

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But many wonder if yuna is an AI, Program, or a real person. Because, she seems to disappear, every time after every battle and every concert. She is such a mysterious person.

43
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,840
But getting back on track, 1 month from now Yuna will be having her first big concert in the stadium.

44
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,640
I really need to get me some tickets. I need to watch her performance.

45
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Can we get back to track on Ordinal Scale.

46
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,380
Nice one Silica.
Yes, I cleared the stage.

47
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,680
Nice one Silica.

48
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Nice Good, Lis.
Yes, we win some free cakes. We're lucky.

49
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes, we win some free cakes. We're lucky.

50
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,680
You think that's a games, it isn't even fun.

51
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Kirito-San why are you such a downer.

52
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,380
Why do you have to be such a downer, that means no cake for you. Sucks for you.

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,380
Come on kirito, cheer up will you.

54
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:28,380
By the way Asuna did you hear Yuna is having a big concert, and tickets are being sold out fast. Oh Yui do you want go to?

55
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,380
Yes!

56
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,480
Do you think we could get any tickets?

57
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Don't worry about it, I can find some way to get it.

58
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Excuse me, here is your cakes that you have won.

59
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,480
I want that cake.
I want that cake.
I want that cake.
Excuse me, here is your cakes that you have won.

60
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,000
I want that cake.
I want that cake.
I want that cake.

61
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:02,000
And I'll take this one, I feel so happy right now.

62
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That cake has to much way to calories for you?

63
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Go ahead Silica you can have strawberry shortcake, you get to choose first because you won.

64
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Wait up Liz

65
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Asuna

66
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,560
I just want to see Yuna live, but the tickets are sold out.

67
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,400
I know I want to see her live too, but getting tickets now is impossible.

68
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
What are those 2 doing, they are far behind.

69
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
They are having a private talk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

70
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Wait Liz do you know what they are talking about.

71
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm just playing around, can you stay right there real fast I want to do something.

72
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:40,600
*Silica Singing*

73
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Silica you can sing good.

74
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,380
Oh, Kirito-San did you like the performance?

75
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, I liked the performance...

76
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,560
You really thought it was good?

77
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah, thought it was good.

78
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,700
By the way why do you think this head set use made, it seems strange to me. much like the nerve gear.

79
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Why, so?

80
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,700
I don't know its just the feeling of the newer technology that is being used here.

81
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,700
You are just being crazy?

82
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:34,700
That reminds me of a rumor that the creator of Oridnal Scale had added in the bosses from SAO to fight.

83
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Is that so, now that's pretty interesting...

84
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,700
You can't be serious, was that in the promotion.

85
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,700
I didn't see it either, so it has to be fake. but if it were true where do you think the boss will be?

86
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,700
How should I know.

87
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Kirito...

88
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
There are so many people here.

89
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I agree with you, do you think we can find people we know?

90
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm sure we might know someone.

91
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Stop real fast boys

92
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Well isn't it Asuna.

93
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
So you were the one to tell Kirito about the boss.

94
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,600
You know that, you boys ready to kick butt.

95
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Kirito, don't forget your headset.

96
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,900
Ordinal Scale On!

97
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,900
It's Kagachi the Samurai Lord, Aincrad's 10th Floor boss.

98
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
I guess the rumors of the SAO boss rumor was true.

100
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
This is going to be real fun, knowing the rumors are true.

101

102
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Its Yuna...

103
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,300
Hi everyone, I hope you all have a good time, Let's start it.

104
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
So you ready Kirito?

105
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Good job, distracting him we're going to lower his HP.

106
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Yeah, I know...

107
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's get it!

108
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now it's your turn.
Let's get it!

109
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,500
Let's get it!

110
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why thank you.

111
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Tank!!!

112
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
They match the info.

113
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I'm moving so slow, it's not like the virtual game.

114
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Move now.
I'm moving so slow, it's not like the virtual game.

115
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Move now.

116
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It really isn't like a game.

117
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
You shouldn't push yourself to hard.

118
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
I have to try.

119
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Look at that.

120
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Who is he?!?!

121
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Everyone attack at once.

122
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Attack!

123
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm going

124
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Switch

125
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
You guys defeat the monster within the time, you all get points.

126
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
But the one that killed the monster gets a kiss from me, and 10,000 points.

127
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Congratulation on killing the boss. See you next time.

128
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Good job killing the boss.

129
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
So what rank are you know?

130
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Did you see my ranking, it increased.

131
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,100
*You background characters aren't important*

132
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,100
So kirito how much did you rank up?

133
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
I didn't rank up at all, what about you?

134
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,100
I moved up a lot, Asuna did you rank up at least.

135
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah.

136
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,100
WooHoo, a crystal chest, score.

137
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
What is going on?

138
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,400
You over there you want to duel.

139
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,700
Sure, if you aren't going to run.
You over there you want to duel.

140
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Sure, if you aren't going to run.

141
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:46,700
One of the boys didn't answer phone call, when I tried to call him. So i'm guessing he's sleeping.

142
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
I'm sure he is sleeping to.

143
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:55,700
All that running would make someone tired, I would want to sleep too.

144
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Kirito doesn't need the sleep, he did nothing.

145
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Hey I'm not in shape like you.

146
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,000
By the way, I won some tickets to Yuna's concert.

147
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Brother you won some tickets!

148
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you serious!

149
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Kirito take me with you.

150
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You guys are such babies who would want to go to her concert.

151
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,500
That reminds me, I don't even play Ordinal Scale and I won tickets too.

152
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,700
Wait you too...

153
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
You have tickets too.

154
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Hey, hey, let go of me...

155
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I won tickets too.

156
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
So your going to take me, but wait I having something to do...

157
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Isn't it suspicious that you all won tickets, when the tickets been sold out for awhile. Plus You guys don't even play Ordinal Scale.

158
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
If you say it like that, It is kind of suspicious.

159
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,800
I agree with you, it does seem kind of weird, plus they are using old SAO bosses.

160
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Do you it because one of the SAO survivors like big brother.

161
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
If you look at it this way, it does seem really weird. Plus, the dude from earlier does remind me of someone from some where.

163
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,000
Kirito do you remember him from somewhere?

164
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Asuna, if he really was an old SAO survivor. Then we must have some history with him.

165
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If he was in the game, we should all remember his movements.

166
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But wasn't that guy moving like he was in a game.

167
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,340
Yui can do a data scan.
But wasn't that guy moving like he was in a game.

168
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,000
Yui can do a data scan.

169
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,600
Yui, can you also do a data scan on Yuna, and see if she was in SAO.

170
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I agree with you.

171
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Please do scream like that, that scared me.

172
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I forgot there was still the data.

173
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,600
If you data scan me you would find a samurai and see his the stories of his legacy, his heroic acts.

174
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
About the one that saved you?

175
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I was talking about myself.

176
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
You like it Yuna.

177
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
What is it?
You like it Yuna.

178
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Just a little something to make you feel alive.

179
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
So what exactly?

180
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Lets just say a promise, I'm keeping.

181
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
So who is next?

182
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm leaving big brother.

183
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
To where again?

184
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
To my kendo camp for the weekend.

185
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
oh... I forgot about that.

186
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,300
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone. Like putting on that nerve gear.

187
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Yeah, yeah I won't... shouldn't you be leaving.

188
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Just be careful... don't think about it either.

189
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I'm going, good bye.

190
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Who is he?

191
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Link Start

192
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
So only your here Asuna.

193
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Hello, Kirito so did Leafa(Suguha) leave.

194
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Yeah, she had to go to kendo camp.

195
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
So about that boy.

196
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:13,300
I didn't find anything out.

197
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
So do you want something to eat?

198
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
No, I just ate earlier.

199
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,300
Are you sure, Kirito you have to have your right meals.
No, I just ate earlier.

200
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Are you sure, Kirito you have to have your right meals.

201
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Papa you should eat, before you get beat up again.

202
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,300
Fine, but i'll only take tea.

203
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Kirito, he might be targeting you , Kirito.

204
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
are you sure...

205
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Yeah...

206
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,300
An alert from my Augma.

207
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Is that so?

208
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Are you sure they aren't targeting mama?

209
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,300
I think you shouldn't play Ordinal Scale.

210
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,300
if so, I won't if you don't want me too.

211
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,100
"Hey Asuna theres a new rumor about a boss at this location, can you join because we're one person down" -Klein

212
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:08,730
Hey Asuna, thought you weren't coming. Because it's pretty late out.

213
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,730
No its fine, so when is it coming.

214
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,730
Huh what's wrong.

215
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,730
I don't think you can compete with us men. So you should stay in the back.

216
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,430
If you say so, as long as I can get all the points.

217
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,430
I was just playing around, Asuna.

218
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:09,430
Hey there fighters, are you ready. let the music Start!

219
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,430
Dang it, we're missing Yuna's new song. Lets beat the boss fast, so we can watch the rest.

220
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,430
This boss isn't going to be that easy.

221
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,430
Where is it anyway?

222
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,430
What is that?

223
00:27:53,430 --> 00:28:00,430
Now lets see how they do, against the boss.

224
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,230
Now it's time to finish it.

225
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,230
I'm going to free her at last.

226
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,230
This won't hurt.

227
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,230
Put this on right now.

228
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,230
Hey boss take his life.

229
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,230
Tanks. go in the center and attract the boss to you guys. So the others can attack it.

230
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,230
Don't waste your bullets shooting it when it's moving. Instead aim for its wings when it's still.

231
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,230
When is hits the ground, attack it.

232
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:14,230
Good job with the good distractions.

233
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,230
So it was you again, hello there.

234
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,230
You don't want your kiss?

235
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,230
Oh well, see you later Ms.Asuna.

236
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:40,230
So that is Asuna, I'm wondering why she is playing Ordinal Scale. Doesn't she know its dangerous.

237
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:12,230
It seems that the new AR game called, "Ordinal Scale is taking the gaming world by a storm. But with the twist of using bosses from the old game Sword Art Online.

238
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,230
It won't seem like a a big surprise, because of the games mascot. Yuna she is the worlds, newest rising star. I want to meet her in real life.

240
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:36,230
Back on topic, the VR world is still getting massive hate . Because of the incident with Sword Art Online, and it's history of many deaths.

241
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,230
It was because of this game, people wanted started to hate the virtual world and also wanted it to be shut down.

242
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:51,230
There were also the incidents with with ALO and GGO. The ratings of players on those VR games had dropped massively.

243
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,230
Do you think the others are okay with this drop in players?

244
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,230
Here are some interviews with some peoples thoughts on the matters of the low rates in the VR community.
Do you think the others are okay with this drop in players?

245
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,230
Here are some interviews with some peoples thoughts on the matters of the low rates in the VR community.

246
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:10,230
I could care less on the matters, that means more hunting for me. And but there isn't any competition anymore for me.

247
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,230
Hey, I could compete with you any day.

248
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:18,230
I'm not worried about that, I'm worried that my friends won't return to me.

249
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:29,230
Less players mean less people to deal with. So, I wouldn't care on the matter. Also, that means less trolls and more relax time.

250
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:37,230
I really want players to return, I want more money. I want to more girls.

251
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,230
Leafa-Chan!!!

252
00:33:46,230 --> 00:34:04,230
Hello, guys and girls just 2 more weeks until my concert starts. So I hope you got your tickets.

253
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,230
Good Morning, papa.

254
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,230
Good Morning, Yui.

255
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,230
Wheres mama?

256
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,230
Asuna will come later, she had to finish some work.

257
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,230
I want to see mama today.

258
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,230
Me too.

259
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,230
Papa what is that date for?

260
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,230
That date is for Yuna's concert.

261
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,230
So we are going to the concert. Because I really want to go.

262
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,230
Yes, Yui we are going.
So we are going to the concert. Because I really want to go.

263
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,230
YAY, thanks papa.

264
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:17,230
thank you for helping us, in SAO. is because you Asuna and I are around.

265
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,230
That reminds me you should train for Ordinal Scale.

266
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,230
Ordinal Scale On.

267
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Yup this is heavier in real life.

268
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,230
You can't compete with others if you don't train.

269
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,030
So lets start training papa.
You can't compete with others if you don't train.

So lets start training papa.

271
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:53,230
Yui... I'm sorry about that.

272
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,230
Who are you?

273
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,230
Yui did you see that?

274
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,430
Yes.

275
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,430
Was that an NPC?

276
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,430
There wasn't no cursor over their head, so it's not a player.

277
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,430
Are you sure, because it couldn't be a roaming ghost.

278
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,430
It could be.

279
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,430
Anyway, did you catch what it said?

280
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:44,430
It was showing a direction to something, but I couldn't get it's data papa.

281
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,430
What the...

282
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,430
Kirito you are looking good.

283
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,990
So wait, what did you say you saw.

284
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:03,990
It was like a roaming ghost, also it was pointing a direction. I guess it wants me to follow it.

285
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,990
mhm, it must not be a player then.

286
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,990
This is confusing.

287
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,990
I just found out who that boy is.

288
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:24,990
See, in SAO he was a commander in the knights of the blood oaths. He stayed in the back lines because he was afraid of death.

289
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,000
So he had a different play style.

290
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,990
In the game he was weak. But now he is strong.
So he had a different play style.

291

292
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,990
It was Nautilus, but I don't know if it was actually him.
In the game he was weak. But now he is strong.

293
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000

294
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,770

Whats his name?

295
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:45,990
It was Nautilus, but I don't know if it was actually him.

296
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,990
We will find out soon.

297
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,990
Look at the flowers.

298
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,990
Hey Asuna, what did you want to talk about?

299
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,990
I mostly forgot about it, I want to tell everyone about it.

300
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,990
ohhhh, okay..

301
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:18,990
Say say kirito, have you found anything about the creator?

302
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,990
ehh, no nothing really.

303
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,990
It's ok you'll find something soon, I believe in you.

304
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,990
Hopefully.

305
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,990
Papa, Mama. Call everyone.

306
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:37,990
Everyone, I just found a clue on where every boss will take place.

307
00:38:37,990 --> 00:39:17,990
I followed the direction where the first boss to place, Then after where the other two bosses took place. Then I followed the directions on where the ghost told us to look. And all of the locations of the bosses spawn shown makes a map of the Aincard.

308
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,990
Doesn't that map bring back a lot of memories of SAO. I want to help out now.

309
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,990
But are you okay with all the bad memories?
Doesn't that map bring back a lot of memories of SAO. I want to help out now.

310

But are you okay with all the bad memories?

311
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:29,690
Me, I'm okay. I'm okay. But there were many good memories for me too.

312
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,690
I'm going to tag along.

313
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,690
Hey kirito, do you have any ideas on what's going on.

314
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,690
I'm still thinking on what's going on.

315
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,690
You'll get it soon, but lets take a break.

316
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:57,090
Yes, lets make a party like the old times.

317
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:04,090
Are you sure you want me, I haven't play Ordinal Scale yet.

318
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:13,690
That reminds me, I haven't heard from Klein lately, have you heard from him?

319
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,690
I haven't heard from him either?

320
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:23,690
I haven't seen Klein log in either so I don't know where he's at, but have you heard mama and papa went on a date.

321
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,690
A date you say.

322
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:38,690
Yui, don't tell them about it. They might get jealous.

323
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,690
I'm sorry papa.

324
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:47,690
It's okay, just don't do it again. But i'm going to go. Tell me when you find something new.

325
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,690
Yes papa I will.

326
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,690
Hello, Kirito.

327
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,690
Hey, Asuna. One second let me set this down.

328
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,690
Are you making yourself pasta?

329
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,690
It's the only thing we have, because we ran out of food.

330
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,690
Why don't get food then.

331
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,690
I'm too lazy, and it's to far.

332
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:45,690
Whatever, are you going to come tonight?

333
00:41:49,690 --> 00:42:07,690
Hey, Kirito if anything happened to me again, from like another player, would you be there to save me? You know like if I lost my memory of the past, do you think you could find a way to save me?

334
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,690
Be serious...
mhm, sure.

335
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,690
Be serious...

336
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,690
Oh Course, I would save you I would find anyway possible to save you.

337
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,690
Is that so.

338
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,690
Yes, I would you should know that already.

339
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:29,690
Thank you, Kirito for making me feel safer. You're my favorite.

340
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,690
Yeah.

341
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,690
I trust, anything you say.

342
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,690
Kirito, the black knight.

343
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,000
Thank you for bringing more jewels I'm starting to feel alive.

344
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,690
Is that so, do you want more jewels?
Thank you for bringing more jewels I'm starting to feel alive.

345
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,990
Is that so, do you want more jewels?

346
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,990
Yes, Yuna?

347
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,300
What is that book?
Yes, Yuna?

348
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,990
What is that book?

349
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,990
It's just something of my past.

350
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:06,990
Can, I take a little look into your book?

351
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,990
Just kidding, but can you tell me little story from it?

352
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,990
Why are you following?

353
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,990
I'm just here to warn you about danger.

354
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,990
You look really familiar.

355
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,990
Who are you exactly, may you please tell me?

356
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,990
Come down here, It's going to start.

357
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,990
What boss is it going to be?

358
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:46,990
I don't know just come, and tell me if Yui was correct.

359
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:58,990
I can't answer anymore questions, just come now the battle is going to be huge.

360
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,990
I see I'm coming right now.

361
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yuna, is just so talented.

362
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:30,990
Silica do you think Yuna is program or a human?

363
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:38,990
I think Yuna is a person, for thats what I want to believe.

364
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,990
Hey, Silica she doesn't seem human to me.

365
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,990
Don't tease my Idol.

366
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,990
You see, I was just playing around.

367
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,700
Liz then don't joke around like that.
You see, I was just playing around.

368
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,990
Liz then don't joke around like that.

369
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please forgive me.

370
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,990
Look its starting.

371
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:20,490
Hey everyone, lets begin. Music start.

372
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,490
Look Yuna.

373
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,490
Its her.

374
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,490
So what do you say, lets end this fast.

375
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,490
This thing is strong.

376
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,490
Good job, tanking it.

377
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,490
You did so much damage.

378
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,490
Yes, lets go to.

379
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,490
Ordinal Scale On!

380
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,490
Who is she?

381
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:20,490
Aren't you Nautilus from SAO.

382
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,490
I don't go by that name anymore, Asuna. Its Eiji now.

383
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,490
So your him.

384
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,490
I told you, I don't go by that name anymore. Its in the past.

385
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,490
I see.

386
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,490
Indeed, glad you noticed though.

387
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,490
Its starting.

388
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,490
What is happening?

389
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,490
Its Pina.

390
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,490
Are you ready to fight?

391
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:07,490
Papa that dragon its the floor 91 boss.

392
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,490
Pina why would you do that.

393
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,490
Sorry, about that.

394
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,490
Silica, watch out.

395
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,890
Asuna, are you okay?

396
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,890
Asuna, are you okay?

397
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,890
You Prick, why do you!

398
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:28,890
You really are weak, you really aren't yourself like in the games.

399
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,890
You bitch.
You really are weak, you really aren't yourself like in the games.

400
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,890
You bitch.

401
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:37,890
Hey, your not suppose to hurt another player.

402
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:53,890
Times up.

403
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,990
Thank you, lord dragon.

404
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,990
Hey, what about Asuna.

405
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,990
Asuna, are you okay?

406
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,990
better luck next time, Asuna.

407
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,990
I'm sorry, Asuna that I caused trouble.

408
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,990
So what do we do know.

409
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:45,990
Let me take her home okay, whats wrong Asuna?

410
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,990
Its nothing, promise.

411
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,990
See you tomorrow okay.

412
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:07,990
Kirito, can you tell me where we first meet.

413
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:13,990
The first place we meet, was Aincard. From what I can remember.

414
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:17,990
Is that so, Kirito was I in your party.

415
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:23,990
Yeah, I have to head out Good night.

416
00:52:41,990 --> 00:53:02,990
*Random flash back*

417
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,990
Kirito where you go?

418
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,990
Kirito.

419
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,000
Who are you?

420
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What happened, to kirio.

421
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
What is happening?

422
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Hey, Asuna?

423
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:40,000
What's wrong Asuna, is there something you want to talk about?

424
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm sorry for waking you up this late.

425
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Its alright, so whats bugging you.

426
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Do you remember anything from the past, on who we meet?

427
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, it all started in Aincard.

428
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,300
Are you sure?
Yeah, it all started in Aincard.

429
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,300
Asuna...
Are you sure?

430
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,300
Asuna...

431
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,300
Just as I imagine...

432
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,300
Imagine what?

433
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:23,300
Thank you Kirito, for trying... but theres stuff I can't remember.

434
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,300
What do you mean, can't remember.
Thank you Kirito, for trying... but theres stuff I can't remember.

435
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,300
What do you mean, can't remember.

436
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:35,300
I can't remember anything about SAO. I can't remember the moments we had.

437
00:55:53,300 --> 00:56:04,000
The data shows that her brain waves are stabilized, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Asuna from the brain scanning.

438
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,700
Can you check again, and because she can't remember anything from SAO.

439
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,700
If you look there, we can't find the problem to that. So we don't know why she can't remember anything about SAO.

440
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:31,700
Also, the nerve gear transmitted electrical shocks, you manipulate the brains neural system. So it would be dangerous, to do the same thing.

441
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:39,700
So for now, we don't know why she's like this, but it could have been because of that AR game.

442
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,000
Ordinal Scale.
So for now, we don't know why she's like this, but it could have been because of that AR game.

443
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Ordinal Scale.

444
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,700
Exactly, thats it.
Ordinal Scale.

445
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,200
Exactly, thats it.

446
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Is Asuna be alright?

447
00:56:50,700 --> 00:57:03,700
She will be alright. Also. If it's because Ordinal Scale we don't have any proof of it, but we will still monitor her brain and see if anything is wrong.

448
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,700
I'm sorry Kirito.

449
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,700
It's alright Asuna, do you think you can walk.

450
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:36,700
You'll remember SAO, so don't worry.

451
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,700
Asuna, are you alright?

452
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:47,700
Sorry, Kirito I still can't remember, this just seems to be apart of ALO. I still can't remember anything of SAO.

453
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,700
I'm sorry Yui, for making you worry.

454
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,700
I know mama will get back her memory soon.

455
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,700
I know Kirito will get it back.

456
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,700
I'm going to go make me something.

457
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,700
No, I can make it for you, it's the least I can do for you.

458
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,700
I'm so close to fulfilling my promise.

459
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,700
I will avenge your death.

460
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:37,700
Klein do you remember anything of SAO?

461
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:53,700
Not really, things are blur when I try to remember. But, I feel like it was a horrible experience.

462
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,700
*Damn he can type fast*

463
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Ordinal Scale Ranking

464
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
*Sora and Shiro*

465
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:19,700
So, the data on Asuna's memory is still the same. But, her emotion level's seem to be dropping.

466
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:29,700
All the SAO Survivors who played Ordinal Scale, had lost their memory. Much like Asuna, and Klein.

467
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:41,700
There was something, that came out of her head gear. To make her forget all the time we spent together.

468
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:50,700
Papa, sorry but I couldn't find that player you wanted me to find.

469
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:59,700
I won't give up I will help find that data.

470
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Thank you, Yui.

471
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,700
You look swell.

472
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,700
Sinon, surprise visit. *Cough Cough* Best Girl *Cough Cough*

473
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:11,700
I didn't have to work, so I came to help.

474
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:19,700
But aren't you worried about losing your memories? Like how Asuna lost hers.

475
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:25,700
It's alright I'm not an SAO Survivor, I came because the scans said the next boss would appear in Kayoko park, is that right Yui.

476
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,700
So you remembered Sinon.

477
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,700
I still to repay you for saving me.

478
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,700
Papa, I'll start looking.

479
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,700
Ordinal Scale On!

480
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,700
Its the boss from the 18th floor. *I don't know his name, so can't translate*

481
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,700
I was wrong there, are more then one boss happening.

482
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:14,700
*Japanese names are hard to type, so I can't translate it*

483
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,700
Everyone is just rushing without a plan.

484
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,700
Just go I got your back.
Everyone is just rushing without a plan.

485
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Just go I got your back.

486
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,700
Yui, now.

487
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,700
I'll get your back.

488
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:59,700
*DAMN JESUS KUN HE STRIKES AGAIN*

489
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,700
Dang, Nothing happened..

490
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Nice job, Kirito.

491
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,700
Wouldn't have done it without you.
Nice job, Kirito.

492
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,700
So it looks like I have paid you back.

493
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:36,800
Yuna?!?!? hey wait up you.

494
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:52,800
Sorry, papa I couldn't get it. There was a block in the system. But, I found here the memories of the players go. It goes to some type of program, but I don't know where it is.

495
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,200
Yui, do know the direction of where the person pointed.

496
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Yes, I caught here it pointed.

497
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Yui, can you open a map.

498
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,200
What is that building?

499
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
Yui, can you tell me what building is that.

500
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
Its the Touto Institute of Technology in Ookayama.

501
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,200
Are you serious!

502
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:55,200
That's where the creator of the Augma Professor Shigemura Tetsuhiro, is located. But, I don't know why that person was pointing that way.

503
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:38,200
The Augma uses Augmented Reality and brings the world of technology to a new level. It was also created for the use of games, communication, browsing, and data productions for the average everyday person. At a reasonable price.

504
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:47,200
This concludes the presentation, any final questions for me to answer.

505
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:56,200
Can the AR Head set affect the users, memory or any nerves with in the brain.

506
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:03,200
It doesn't have the composite, of affecting the users brain or nervous system.

507
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Are you sure it doesn't affect the user, because my friends had lost their memories while using it. So, did the ones we get. Were they just prototypes.

508
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,200
This presentation is over no more questions, you meet me in my office.

509
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:29,200
You are the brilliant creator of the Ordinal Scale, do you have any connections with Eiji.

510
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
No.

511
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Then, how can you not answer my question.

512
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
I have many students that come to me, so it isn't possible for me to remember them all, and your question has no possibility of being true.

513
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:48,200
But my friends had lost their memories playing Ordinal Scale. So can you answer my question, can the Augma affect the users memories and brains.

514
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:54,700
No it doesn't, because it doesn't have the ability to scan a brain.

515
01:10:54,700 --> 01:11:10,700
As the creator of the Augma, you should know your flaws and should know how to fix it. Because, you give me the same feeling. That Kayaba, and you are stole his work, and used it in your game.

516
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:38,700
Yes, I know but it doesn't matter because he's died. But I'm sure that all the SAO Survivors would want to forget their experiences and memories of the game. This, decision is over you can leave. Because you didn't schedule for an appointment.

517
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,700
Good day, sensei.

518
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:09,700
We found that he had a daughter.

519
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:18,700
This is his daughters name, Yuuna Shigemura. And we found out she had died in SAO.

520
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,000
You can't be serious, she must have left the safe zone.
This is his daughters name, Yuuna Shigemura. And we found out she had died in SAO.

521
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You can't be serious, she must have left the safe zone.

522
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
We also, found out that he was working with a SAO Survivor.

523
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,400
You know what, he probably made the Augma to bring her back. But, why does he have to compete with Go.Why can't he just let her rest in peace.

524
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:46,400
He is probably using it, for something like a big test project. To bring back her back from the dead.

525
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:56,400
If she is in Ordinal Scale then she must be an SAO survivor. But I must have seen her some where, in Aincard.

526
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:07,400
That can't happen, becasue the data says she had died, in SAO. All the reports of everyones deaths are in the Kayoko hospital.

527
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Kirito there has to be more to this story that we don't know of, like why he is using the SAO bosses. Instead of self made bosses.

528
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Hey, Asuna what did you want to talk about.

529
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,100
I was just asking if you could come over to my house.

530
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:56,100
Sure I have a spare time,  I can come right over.

531
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:03,100
I'm interrupting anything.

532
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,100
Make yourself at home.

533
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:11,100
This is starting to seem like trespassing, don't I have to ask to come in.

534
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,600
Don't worry my parents aren't home.                                 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). And I live here, so your welcome inside.

535
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:26,600
I found out that he had daughter that had died in SAO, and that some SAO survivor might be working with him.

536
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Is that so, that seems really strange.

537
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:37,600
But, if she was in SAO you might remember her from where.

538
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:50,600
So this is how your room looks. It looks so futuristic.

539
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Stay here please, while I get us some drinks. Don't leave.

540
01:15:30,600 --> 01:16:56,600
My memories are starting to get really blurry, I can't remember anything from SAO. Wish I could remember what happens, but it hurts my head. It starting getting like this after losing in the Ordinal Scale game. I'm so happy Kirito is taking me to Yuna's concert in Saitama. I'm so happy that I have meet him, I want to be with him forever.

541
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,600
So you found my diary, its okay if you read it.

542
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:17,600
*Its happy hour*

543
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Asuna, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

544
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:39,600
It's okay Kirito, I love you. Even, if I don't get my memories of SAO back I know I will still love you.

545
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:45,600
I love you too.

546
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:06,600
Asuna, I promise I will get back your memories. And, after that I will give you a present.

547
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:18,600
Thanks for  Eiji  getting, more of this they are really pretty. Soon, I'll be singing to a huge audience. Are you going to watch it?

548
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,600
Of course.

549
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:29,600
That reminds me, this big concert will make me an even bigger star in the world. I'm going to shine.

550
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,000
Yes, you are going to shine. You will be the number 1 star.

551
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Hey, Eiji can you read me another story from that book.

552
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Sure.

553
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So what is it going to be about this time? Is it going to be about the black knight again?

554
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:53,000
No, its a new story, about me and a old friend.

555
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Is our mission going as planned, because there's something that had come up?

556
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,000
We will soon, have enough memories. To move into our next phase.

557
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Is that so, will we have enough people to complete the plan.

558
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And then we can see both see the results of plan before our very own eyes. But do you think there will be any challenges ahead.

559
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:30,000
If there are any challenges ahead you will have to stop it.

560
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I got that.

561
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,900
Yuna, did you do this?

562
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:05,900
No this was already here, this was in the previous world.

563
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:20,900
This place was already made in Aincard, so you must have already know this.

564
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't know what this place, I see this place must be in SAO. So that game, hasn't been truly defeated yet?

565
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Can you please tell me what this place is, because I've already beaten SAO, and I have never seen this place. Or is my Augma just going crazy.

566
01:21:45,000 --> 01:22:09,000
*I speak Japanese not sing it, find the translations online*

567
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I'm the just memories of Yuuna Shigemura, I've being created from others memories.

568
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So thats whats going on, you are using Asuna's memories too become real again.

569
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Asuna is just a small part of it, there are many more that lost their memories because of me. With, your ranking you won't be able to beat Eiji to get her memories back. You'll need to fight more bosses, and rank up to get stand a chance against him. It seems, like the next boss it coming.

570
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Hey, kid you okay.

571
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,700
Oh, a Augma game set, the parks closed. I would be home, its pretty late, stay safe.

572
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:02,000
She looks likes comfortable, so what did you want to talk about?

573
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Do you remember what happened at the battle?

574
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:12,500
As much as I know, I can't remember anything that happened

575
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:21,500
Kirito might know the answer to that, because he found some strange stuff that is going wrong in ordinal scale.... *BEST GIRL TALKING*

576
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:28,500
It's not like I'm worried about him  playing a stupid game or anything.

577
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,500
It sounds like your really worried.

578
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:38,500
Liz did you even listen to me sing, I was singing live. Anyways, your next.

579
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,500
So whats up with you.

580
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
I'm just worried worried about Asuna.

581
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:55,500
*Just enjoy the fighting scenes, I'll translates the funny and important parts*

582
01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:03,500
Hey, everyone you all get a special boost.

583
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:48,500
Congratulations, on making it far up the ranks in this game, Kazuto.

584
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Wow this place is really big.

585
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Put yourself together.

586
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:08,000
Silicia, thank you for taking me.

587
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Where is Kirito though?

588
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Didn't he say he was coming late.

589
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Lets make a deal, if I beat you hall tell me how to get Asuna's memories.

590
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
What if I win.

591
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:37,000
and if you beat me, you can have my memory for your sick plan.

592
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Shut up.

593
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:48,000
You think I'm doing this for myself, I'm doing this for my lost love.

594
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Do you think you she would want this?

595
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
So you know you know about that promise I made to Yuuna.

596
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yes I know about the promise.

597
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
You know you can't beat me you, because you have such a low ranking. And my ranking is higher.

598
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
We won't know until we try.

599
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Ordinal Scale On!

600
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:57,000
*Such an epic song, no need for reading. Well yet.*

601
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:20,000
My plan is almost complete, the Augma is almost at the frequency as the nerve gear. All I need to do release all the SAO bosses now. I will bring back my daughter.

602
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yuuna

603
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,000
This isn't SAO so you can't move like you were in a game anymore.

604
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Is that all No. 2 can do?                                                  It doesn't amount to much!

605
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:49,000
In the end, people only remember the players who fought on the front lines. Weaklings like Yuuna and Me are always overlooked!

606
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
You were with Yuuna in SAO?

607
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
yeah, I was.
You were with Yuuna in SAO?

608
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
yeah, I was.

609
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Even when someone precious to me was in danger, I couldn't even move an inch!

610
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:11,530
Yuuna's brain was so damaged by the Nerve Gear, it was impossible to save or repair it.

611
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:16,530
But if I can acquire memories of Yuuna from the other SAO players.

612
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:21,530
and combine those fragments, I can use deep learning.

613
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:25,530
And resurrect Yuuna as an AI.

614
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:43,530
The numbers in the ordinal system are absolute. The one given No.1 becomes immortal.

615
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,530
It was you who designed it that way, wasn't it, Kayaba?

616
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:55,530
Therefore, she's un. Latin for "one," then?

617
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,530
In contrast to the Cardinal System, which controlled Aincard using cardinal numbers.

618
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:03,530
the Ordinal System controls using ordinal numbers.

619
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:07,530
You discovered the system I'd discared during the early development stage of SAO,

620
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,530
and resurrected it into a new game.

621
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,530
True, the man I was before might have done the same.

622
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:19,530
But you see, Professor, the man I am now believes...

623
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:25,530
in the existence of a power that transcends the system itself.

624
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:31,530
Who cares if we take away memories of that crap game, SAO?

625
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:36,530
so this is the secret behind your powers.

626
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:43,530
Dammit

627
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:59,530
I can't lose to someone who denies his past self just because he suffered once.

628
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,530
All right , tell me how to get Asuna's memories back!

629
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:45,530
That was fun!

630
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,530
Its too late now.

631
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,530
Almost all of the SAO survivors are here.

632
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:30,530
We're going to scan the brains of every SAO survivor in this venue. To bring Yuuna back to life.

633
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:32,530
What are you talking about?

634
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:34,530
It has already started.

635
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:48,530
This is what I learned from Kamura, the manufacturer of the Augma.

636
01:33:48,530 --> 01:34:03,530
The drones that are flying inside the stadium are equipped with a wireless power feed function. It's scanning the Survivors brains right now.

637
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:15,530
So it has just the same functions, and same frequency as the nerve gear. It's just as dangerous.

638
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:27,530
So all you have to do is tell the players too, take off their Augma's. Because it can't scan their brains, if they don't see it.

639
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,530
What the hell is going on?

640
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:38,530
The door won't open.

641
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:02,530
Asuna are you alright.

642
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:11,530
The door seems locked. Kirito, can handle what's inside, we need to find the Professor.

643
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,530
Yuuna

644
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:20,530
Father, why are you doing this?

645
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,530
You aren't the real Yuuna.

646
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:26,530
I am your daughter.

647
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:32,530
You are wrong you are just programmed to think you are alive.

648
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:35,730
My real daughter is dead, and can't return.

649
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,130
Father.

650
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:37,730
You are nothing, until you become a fully functional AI.
Father.

651
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,130
You are nothing, until you become a fully functional AI.

652
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:43,130
The plan is almost complete.

653
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:46,130
The frequency of the scans are almost at its peak.

654
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:54,130
Father, you can't do that. Scanning there brains at a high frequency can kill them. This isn't who you truly are.

655
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,130
Shut it, you aren't Yuuna.

656
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:27,130
I'll do anything to get Yuuna back, I would even sell my soul to the devil to get her back. It's like I failed as a father.

657
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:44,130
*LOL you have a GUN!!*

658
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:58,130
It looks like he escaped, we need to find where he went.

659
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:03,130
So we have some visitors.

660
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:16,130
Sorry, the player had beat me, It looks like he's on his way to get the memories. Did you get enough to make Yuuna yet?

661
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:20,130
There are isn't enough yet. But there is one last thing you can do for me.

662
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:39,130
I want you, too give me your memories. You are a SAO survivor, and you have the most memories with Yuuna. But, you let her died so this is revenge.

663
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:42,130
You are going against our deal.

664
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,130
Is that so...

665
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:46,130
*HE TOOK THE BIGGEST L*

666
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:14,130
Kirito you need to release the memories of the SAO survivors. Because the frequency of your Augma's are the same as a Nerve Gear. And if the Augma scans your brain, that could mean death.

667
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:19,130
Everyone take off your Augma's!!!

668
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:29,130
I can't hold back the boss for much longer. Save those who lost their memories.

669
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:36,130
The only way to get you can get back everyones memories, is by defeating the final boss in Aincard.

670
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:43,130
Your going to have to do a full body dive.

671
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:45,130
But we only have Augma's.

672
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,130
The Augma's has a limited time a full dive function, so hurry and beat the game.

673
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,130
*Badass fight coming over*
The Augma's has a limited time a full dive function, so hurry and beat the game.

674
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:56,130
*Badass fight coming over*

675
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:05,130
Yui, protect Asuna.

676
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:13,130
I'm sorry but you might get hurt. So I want you to stay here. If I don't come back just know. I love you.

677
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:25,130
Link Start!

678
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:37,130
Is this seriously the final floor on Aincard?

679
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:41,130
This kind of looks like a ruby palace.

680
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
So this is the true final boss of SAO!

681
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:30,130
SWITCH!!!

682
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:45,130
*WOW*

683
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:53,130
There is no chance of beating that thing.

684
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:21,130
I'm sorry Asuna. You are having information extracted from your brain, specifically anything that happened in Aincrad.

685
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:27,130
My father is inflicting the terror of being killed by a boss monster onto every SAO survivor.

686
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:31,130
to run a simultaneous high-output scan on their memories.

687
01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:35,130
If it happens, it will leave your brain with irreparable damage.

688
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,130
It can even kill them.

689
01:41:37,130 --> 01:41:39,130
no way.

690
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,130
No Mama.

691
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,130
If I remove this, Kirito will be saved.

692
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:49,130
But then Kirito won't be able to save the people he's trying to save.

693
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:06,130
Yuna, if you lost your life in SAO. It was because you left the safe zone.

694
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:07,130
It was because you fought a monster and tried to clear the floor!
Yuna, if you lost your life in SAO. It was because you left the safe zone.

695
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:09,130
It was because you fought a monster and tried to clear the floor!

696
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:11,130
I'm going to fight again.

697
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:15,130
Yui, I'm going to join Kirito.

698
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,130
Okay, Mama. I'll catch up as soon as I can.

699
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:23,130
Link Start!

700
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:41,130
F**K

701
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,130
I'm sorry, It's all my faults.

702
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:00,130
I was feeling guilty all this time.

703
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:13,160
I'm so sorry, I'm late.

704
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:20,160
I'm going to fight, too. I can fight, too.

705
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,160
Big brother, I'm sorry for making you wait.

706
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,160
Papa, Mama, I brought everyone.

707
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,160
This looks like a lot.
Papa, Mama, I brought everyone.

708
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:48,160
This looks like a lot.

709
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,160
I do a lot better in the Virtual World.

710
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,160
That thing is massive.

711
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:08,160
It's all right everyone use it.

712
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:26,660
I've loaded the saved data left on the SAO server onto all

713
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,660
Sinon, yours is a special bonus!

714
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,660
Everyone Now!

715
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:20,660
Lets go Asuna.

716
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,660
I missed.

717
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,660
Switch.

718
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,660
With this, I can do it now...

719
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,660
*It's Yuuki if you didn't know*

720
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:09,660
We did it!

721
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:29,660
Now you've cleared it completely, eh, Kirito?

722
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,660
Kayaba?

723
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:33,660
But isn't there something you still need to?

724
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:28,660
*I love the song*

725
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,660
*Damn JESUS-KUN OP MUCH!!!*

726
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,660
What..Why?

727
01:47:56,660 --> 01:48:00,660
I was so close, Yuuna!

728
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:15,660
Thank you, Father! I'm here in your memories, forever.

729
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:59,660
That was a great performance, Yuuna.

730
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,660
Thank you.

731
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:09,660
The data for my main body was partially base on the Aincrad floor100 boss's resource script.

732
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,660
Its language engine is what enabled me to move.

733
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:16,660
But the boss has been defeated, and its saved data will be reset.

734
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,660
So I have to say goodbye to you all.

735
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,660
No Way!

736
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:21,660
I really enjoyed myself.

737
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:25,660
My fream of singing before a huge crowd was realized, So I couldn't be happier.

738
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,660
i'm going return something I borrowed from you.

739
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:34,460
The fear of death caused your memory impairment.

740
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:40,460
But you overcame that and fought.                 So I'm sure it'll all come back to you.

741
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,300
You remembered my dream.

742
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:48,300
as reported at the live concert, at the New National Stadium Arena. It's said several monsters from Ordinal Scale appeared in the venue.

743
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:52,300
But it was actually a surprise stage, according to its promoter's ammouncement.

744
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:57,300
Next story, Kamura Inc. the company that operates the Augma, has announced.

745
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:02,300
the resignation of its head of development, one of the Institutes professors Shigemura.

746
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,300
Congratulations on being discharged.

747
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,300
Are you sure you're all right?

748
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:12,300
Yeah, man, that was an ordeal.

749
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,800
I'd rather do VR for games after all.

750
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,800
But isn't there more of a chance of meeting girls through AR?

751
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,800
It's no big deal! Games aren't for meeting girls.

752
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:26,700
Is that a crack about me and my wife?            And you wasted the ticket I gave you.

753
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,700
What? Ow! What the hell!

754
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,700
You got a problem

755
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,700
Hey, now. Here are some souvenirs.

756
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,700
Come to think of it, where did you go?

757
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:40,700
Shimane. There weren't any computers at our lodgings, but thank goodness I smuggled my Amusphere along!

758
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,700
Anyway, where are Kirito and Asuna?

759
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,700
They said they had somewhere to go, Have you heard anything.

760
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:52,000
Well, now, it's all good. Just forget about them.

761
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,500
What the hell?

762
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,500
Not showing up to celebrate his best friend in SAO being discharged? What a jerk!

763
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:02,000
I think I'm going to charge just you today. For wasting that ticket.

764
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:07,500
What? I thought it was free! You are such a greedy merchant!

765
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,500
It's not like I'll meet any cute girls on a quest, while I'm playing any game.

766
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,000
No, you'll still pay.

767
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
It really gets pitch dark, huh?

768
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

769
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,900
Yes, papa. I can see just fine!

770
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:26,090
Though it is a little greenish overall.

771
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:29,700
I never thought us three                                               would really make it here.

772
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,700
In the end, I left the house without telling my mom.

773
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:35,700
Are you sure that's okay?

774
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,700
When we get back, I'll go meet her.

775
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Asuna, do you remember? What we promised each other in Aincrad?

776
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Yes, I remember.

777
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Well, then.

778
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,370
So, what about it, Kirito?

779
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:05,370
Here Kirito.

780
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:10,370
Kirito, take this it's for getting back my memories. So I have to reward you.

781
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:12,370
Thank you.

782
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:20,370
So, aren't you going to put it on me?

783
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:36,370
A shooting star!

784
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,500
It's amazing!

785
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:15,500
In the second edition of "The Complete SAO Incident Records," the following text was added. There was a diva who gave courage to the swordsmen before they set off to fight... We must never forget any of the nameless players.."
