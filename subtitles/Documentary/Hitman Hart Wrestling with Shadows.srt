19

surgeon like my dad.

30

Always thinking about himself.

42
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,168
He wanted to be here, but he
couldn't get out of Germany.

162
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,117
What rock you been living under
the last four months?

163
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,426
Harley passed away.

164
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,504
What?

165
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,305
He just sent me a postcard.

166
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,226
Are you Zoe Hart?

167
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,394
Yeah.

168
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,432
He told me if I kept
sending you his postcards,

169
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,483
eventually you'd show up.

170
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,693
Guess he was right.

171
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,029
Why would he want me to show up?

172
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:11,699
'Cause Harley left you his practice.

173
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:29,467

174
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,043
Okay. It's beyond weird.

175
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,879
Why me?

176
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,347
Harley never really explained.

177
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,885
Well, clearly, the man was one
avocado short of a Cobb salad.

178
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,337
But oddly, it works in my favor.

179
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,572
This is the catch of the day?

180
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,657
What were you expecting?

181
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,727
Sous-vide grouper
with a yuzu-mint gelée?

182
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,979
It's a gulf.
We got catfish. It's fried.

183
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:00,115
Ugh.

184
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,375
You... Hmm.

185
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,654
Look, Chief says I have
to spend a year as a GP,

186
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,540
and I don't want to waste a day,

187
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,792
so notify the town crier or whatever,

188
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,794
and let him know
I'm open for business.

189
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,379
Oh, no, no.
The thing is...

190
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:16,198
See, technically, Harley only
left you half the practice.

191
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:18,918
And he shares it with Dr. Breeland.

192
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:21,003
And Brick... he's been
waiting a long time

193
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:23,271
to get BlueBell all to himself.

194
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,007
Okay, well, let's just find him.

195
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,560
Tell him I'm here for only a year,

196
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:30,729
and then he can be the big fish
in the world's smallest pond.

197
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:31,981
No. Brick's hunting.

198
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,531
And that ain't the sort of news

199
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,434
you tell an Alabama man

200
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:38,203
when he's got his hog rifle
locked and loaded.

201
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,655
Whoa.

00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:49,839
that's it's 2011.

Dancing in celebration

00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,265
No. Dr. Hart, the Belles
are elite young ladies

208
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,043
chosen to keep our history alive.

209
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,519
You mock all you want, but,

210
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,096
actually, I wouldn't do it out loud,

211
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,480
because, uh, they're meaner
than they look.

212
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,016
The Belles?
Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,183
Emmeline, come on.

00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, you can call me

215
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:10,919
Mrs. Hattenbarger.

216
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,055
And my husband put the
satellite in last year.

217
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,057
We watched every
episode of <i>The Sopranos,</i>

218
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,951
and believe me, that family
has got nothing on these girls.

219
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,787
When I heard there was a new

220
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,914
lady doctor in town, I painted myself

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,543
quite a different picture,
but you are just so pretty!

222
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,837
Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

223
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,290
Oh, okay.

224
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:32,840
You're Brick's daughter?

225
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,160
All right. Um, yeah,

226
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,712
it's really nice to meet you.

227
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm dying to talk to your dad.

228
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:39,832
I know he's hunting or whatever,

229
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,683
but you must have a way
to contact him?

230
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,086
Oh.
Honey, there's no need for that.

231
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,787
He knows that you're here.

232
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,141
And if I were you, I'd be gone
by the time that he returns,

233
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,143
because Daddy can be quite...
imposing.

234
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,407
Well, you tell <i>Daddy</i>

235
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,410
that if my medical career
hasn't been killed by my mother

236
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,855
or the Chief of Surgery
at New York Hospital,

237
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:05,240
it most certainly won't be
by some Southern xenophobe

238
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,958
dressed up like a stick of butter.

239
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:10,863
Well, you have a good day.

240
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:17,302
I'm gonna see some patients.

241
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,971
Could you get me a venti soy
latte so I don't fatigue?

242
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,041
The nearest
high-falutin' coffee place

243
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,725
is 11 miles away.

244
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,227
Thanks. That is so nice of you.

245
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,624
Mom. Hi.

246
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,786
Sorry I haven't been answering.

247
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,087
No, actually, there's
something I need to tell you.

248
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,741
I moved to Alabama.

249
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:56,716
Mom?

250
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,728
Are you there?

251
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,307
Is Dr. Breeland around?

252
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,308
He's hunting.

253
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,555
Uh... my mom.

254
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,757
Freaking out.
I told her I moved here.

255
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:12,857
What's up? You sick?

256
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,478
Oh, I feel as good
as anyone my age would.

257
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:19,864
But there's been a little
mix-up down at the DMV.

258
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,075
Don't suppose you could sign this

259
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,409
for me?

260
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:26,329
Let me give you an eye test first.

261
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,252
Mom. Uh...
E, F, P,

262
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,462
T, O, Z...

263
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,248
No, you know

264
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:37,499
what happened with the fellowship.

265
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,841
It's a GP position.

266
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:39,842
...P, E, C, F...

267
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,969
Alabama, Mom.
The state?

268
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,180
- E...
- No, I'm not having a nervous breakdown,

269
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,874
okay? I...
D, F, C,

270
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,725
- No, it's the TV. Good-bye.
- Z, P.

271
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,796
All right.

272
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:54,565
Eh...

273
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:57,777
Thank you very much.

274
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,564
Oh, my latte.

275
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:11,374
Oh, yeah. Got thirsty
on the way and drank it.

276
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,951
You got a patient.

277
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:15,503
Oh.

278
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,791
I'm using subcuticular sutures.

279
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,243
So there will barely be a scar.

280
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:24,762
Well, it's not like I'm gonna
catch a fella now.

281
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,599
Hey, maybe you could give some
dating tips to my daughter here.

282
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,219
You know that thing
about the potato chips,

283
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,269
how you can't eat just one?

284
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,438
Big Mabel feels that way about lunch,

285
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,307
don't ya, honey?

286
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:39,068
She's always been chubby, but
she's put on a good half ton

287
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,319
since that boyfriend of hers

288
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,697
dumped her.
You'Yo all set.

289
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,032
Use the antibiotic cream twice a day.

290
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,536
Mabel, those dark
patches on your face,

291
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,239
how long have you had those?

292
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,664
I told her to use sunblock.

293
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,499
Come on.

294
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:57,830
No offense, but we'll be seeing
Dr. Breeland from now on.

295
00:13:57,864 --> 00:13:59,648
You understand.

296
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,538
<i>Clearly, I needed someplace to live.</i>

297
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:07,847
<i>Mrs. H. arranged for me</i>

298
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,475
<i>to stay at the mayor's plantation.</i>

299
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,477
<i>I was like, I'm not sleeping</i>

300
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,812
<i>at some old confederate guy's house.</i>

301
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:17,049
<i>But she said it was either that
or the sidewalk.</i>

302
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,691
<i>So...</i>

303
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,905
No way!

304
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,865
You're the mayor?

305
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,176
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

306
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,011
Two Super Bowls, five Pro Bowls.

307
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,287
Four actually.

308
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,955
Well, I rounded up.
You got robbed in '06.

309
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:35,901
Oh, Lavon Hayes likes your math.

310
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,418
You must be Zoe.

311
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,378
- Yeah.
- Let me show you to your quarters.

312
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,906
All right.

313
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,173
- I got it.
- Are you sure?

314
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,076
Lavon Hayes will get your bags.

315
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,219
Thank you.

316
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,380
You know, you being the mayor here

317
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:50,699
is the first thing about
BlueBell that I actually like.

318
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:51,849
Thank you.
How'd that happen?

319
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:55,420
Well, after ten years in the NFL,

320
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,314
I was a little lost.

321
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,262
So, Lavon Hayes moved back home.

322
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,731
Having played for the Crimson Tide,

323
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,933
I was quite popular around here.

324
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:10,827
I ran, I won.

325
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,038
Here it is.

326
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,075
Let me get the door for you.

327
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,584
- Watch your step.
- Thanks.

328
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,630
Well, sorry about the
look of the place.

329
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,009
I think you could put your bags
in the back room there.

330
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,932
Huh, it's not my loft in Soho, but

331
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,260
I'll order some stuff
from Barney's online.

332
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:36,519
Make the place more homey.

333
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,397
You share a generator
with the guy in the gatehouse.

334
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:42,525
Looks after the place...
Wade Kinsella.

335
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,279
If you've got your curling iron
going while he's got his AC. on,

336
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,406
could be trouble.

337
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,701
Oh, if you do

338
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,830
decided to wander, um, keep your
eyes peeled for Burt Reynolds.

339
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,166
All right.

340
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,786
What?

341
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,123
♪ ♪

342
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:40,833
That sounds good.

343
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,878
I'm crushing the solo, ain't I?

344
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,080
Whoo!

345
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,300
- I'm killing it.
- You overheated the generator.

346
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,787
Nice nightgown.

347
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,262
I'm Wade.

348
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,374
Well, that smile might
make all the girls

349
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,184
at the church social swoon, but
it's not going to work on me.

350
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,347
Well, if you're not going
to be polite,

351
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm not going to show you
where the fuse box is.

352
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:07,068
Good night.

353
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,111
All right, Wade.

354
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,522
Keep going, ladies, come on.

355
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,323
I'm just getting warmed up now.

356
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,172
Shh, shh, shh.

357
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,465
George?

358
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,877
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, what?
- Alligator.

359
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,245
- What?
- An alligator!

360
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:35,497
I'm sorry, I must have got
some mud in my ear.

361
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,999
An alligator.
And alligator?

362
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,933
Why didn't you say so?
That is an emergency.

363
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,935
Just stay, stay back.

364
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,481
Beat it, Burt.

365
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,406
That's Burt Reynolds,
the mayor's pet alligator.

366
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,450
His favorite movie's
<i>Smokey and the Bandit,</i> so...

367
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,386
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

368
00:17:58,404 --> 00:17:59,554
All right.

369
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,788
Oh, come on.

370
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,724
Hey, hey.

371
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,443
I know you're a New Yorker
and everything,

372
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,279
but down here in Alabama, when
somebody interrupts their nightly jog

373
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,414
to climb into the mud
to save our well-toned ass,

374
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:10,840
we, you know, we say thank you.

375
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,341
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

376
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:13,592
Oh.

377
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,970
Well, thank you.

378
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,057
I guess I'll be seeing you around.

379
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:21,576
Yeah.

380
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:24,603
See? Hey, small towns
have their perks, huh?

381
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,527
<i>BlueBell isn't so horrible, Dad.</i>

382
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,106
The people here aren't so bad.

383
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,358
Maybe I can make a difference.

384
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:38,593
I have another call.

385
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,480
Call me.
Are you getting my messages?

386
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,898
Bye.

387
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:44,039
Hello.

388
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,085
Did you sign Old Man Jackson's
eye exam for the DMV today?

389
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,463
Yeah. Why?

390
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,041
'Cause he just ran someone over.

391
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,584
Can't you tell a legally blind man

392
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,311
when he's right in front
of your face?

393
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,354
All you had to do was open his file!

394
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,483
Everybody knows Old Man Jackson
memorized the eye chart.

395
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,443
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.
I was distracted.

396
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,695
Well, you should be.

397
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,072
He nearly killed George Tucker.

398
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,076
If you wanted to see me again,
you could have just asked.

399
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,328
It's my shoulder.

400
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,939
Just...
All right.

401
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,207
Ready?

402
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,360
It's dislocated.

403
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,837
It's no big deal. I just
have to put it back into place.

404
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:36,967
What the hell?!

405
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,402
That's just the morphine.

406
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,970
It's the easy part... baby.

407
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,557
Eventually,

408
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,959
you're going to find out

409
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,510
this whole
getting-run-over-by-a-car thing

410
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:47,645
was kind of my fault.

411
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,513
Ow! You did it again!

412
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:51,816
Okay, have you never heard
of bedside manner?

413
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,359
Why is everyone so obsessed
with that?

414
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,820
Because it's nice!

415
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,154
George?

416
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:01,575
Good. Morphine's working.

417
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,245
OMG, it's true.

418
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,748
Rosie, honey, come on,
it's time for bed.

419
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:10,167
Aunt Emmeline, this is breaking news.

420
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,486
Rose Hattenbarger,
BlueBell beat blogger

421
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,738
for the otherwise torpid
official town Web site.

422
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:17,133
So, how does it feel
to be responsible

423
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,885
for maiming George
Tucker, town golden boy?

424
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,054
He is not maimed.

425
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,307
Off the record-- why would
anyone ever leave New York?

426
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:26,917
New York is everything, and I know.

427
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:27,977
Read the <i>Daily Intel,</i>

428
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,254
own all the <i>SATC</i> DVDs.

429
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:31,639
I bet you're a Carrie.

430
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,774
I'm a Charlotte, but
I wish I was a Carrie.

431
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,061
You guys really like
your classic HBO, huh?

432
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:39,989
But I am a Miranda who also
wishes she was a Carrie.

433
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,324
I knew you and I were
going to be friends.

434
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,827
Well, I guess I could use a friend.

435
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
Damn straight.
Brick's here.

436
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,793
Hello, Pickle.

437
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,745
Hi, Brick.

438
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,147
Um, I'll see you later.

439
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,649
We haven't met.

440
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,009
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

441
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,785
As far as I'm concerned,

442
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:03,053
you're just the girl
who almost killed

443
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,390
two people and spoiled
my hunting trip.

444
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,684
How dare you see my patients.

445
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,021
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

446
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,715
Miss Hart, I'm not going
to share this office...

447
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:16,191
not for one minute.

448
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:18,819
I see you have met my lawyer.

449
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:22,823
When he's conscious, he doesn't lose.

450
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,826
I'm going to be contesting the will.

451
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,120
Harley wasn't in his right mind.

452
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,663
You haven't even given me a chance.

453
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,415
I believe I can do some good here.

454
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,651
Well, bless your heart.

455
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:36,537
But thingsave been working
just fine here in BlueBell.

456
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:38,789
We survived Katrina, we survived BP,

457
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,758
by boarding up the windows
and piling up the sandbags

458
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,577
to keep the rot outside

459
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:45,346
from fouling our community.

460
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,224
And believe you me, Zoe Hart,

461
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,729
we are going to chase you away
from our waters.

462
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,060
<i>Well, my night
had quickly gone downhill.</i>

463
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:02,062
<i>But in times like this,</i>

464
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:04,406
<i>I find one thing
really helps me through.</i>

465
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:09,703
Wine! Tell me you have
a nice dry chardonnay.

466
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,455
Yup. Come on.

467
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,692
You're Mabel, right?

468
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:16,910
Bad day?

469
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:18,629
You have no idea.

470
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,114
Ugh. Oh, yes, I do.

471
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,590
You met my mama?

472
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,200
Oh, yeah.

473
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,803
Yeah, my mom isn't
exactly supportive, either.

474
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:30,374
Mabel, I know
it's none of my business,

475
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:32,743
but the dark patches
on your forehead and face...

476
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,228
you have melasma.

477
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,679
You know you're pregnant, right?

478
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:37,097
I don't know that.

479
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:39,082
I haven't taken a test.

480
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,084
Well, I'm sure you can get one here

481
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:43,237
over by the Slim Jims and duck calls.

482
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,532
Long day.

646
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,697
- Uh, Zoe? Is everything okay?
- What are you doing here?!

647
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,532
I came with the mayor.

648
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,351
Lavon?

649
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,036
Okay, well, uh, welcome.

650
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:34,192
And the bar is over...
that way.

651
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:37,629
Thought you said she
was leaving town.

652
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:39,337
I thought she was.

653
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:48,722
Mabel?

654
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,975
Thank you so much for coming.

655
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm having these bad pains.

656
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:54,978
Oh, my God, there's another one.

657
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,646
Okay.

658
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,607
Oh, they're getting worse.

659
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,718
Mabel, how long has it been exactly

660
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:01,985
since your last period?

661
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,153
Not sure.

662
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:06,031
Another one?

663
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,365
They're 15 seconds apart.

664
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,661
Okay, Mabel, stay calm.

665
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:12,037
Look, we're not gonna make it
to the hospital.

666
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,414
You're having a baby,
and you're having it now.

667
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,251
Come on.

668
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:26,176
What is going on here?

669
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,677
Brick, she's ten centimeters,
ready to push.

670
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,137
Contractions are on
top of each other.

671
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:30,555
We need to deliver this baby.

672
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:32,891
No, I need to deliver this baby.

673
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,143
Have Emmeline get me my
medical bag, my drug box.

674
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:36,620
- Get me some towels.
- No, no, no, no, no,

675
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:37,604
don't you come near me!

676
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,190
Dr. Hart and I,
we're in this together.

677
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,525
<i>She's</i> my doctor.

678
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,402
Guess I'll be needing the towels.

679
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:47,697
Okay, Mabel, Mabel,

680
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,082
are you ready?

681
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm gonna need you to
start pushing, okay?

682
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,887
I'm gonna come check on you later.

683
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:55,088
Make sure you're all right.

684
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,007
All right.

685
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:01,228
So, Mr. Mayor, is it true?

686
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:05,173
You're here on a date
with that, uh... Dr. Hart?

687
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:09,570
How is that any of your business?

688
00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:11,255
I mean, if I do recall,

689
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:14,307
we are at your engagement party.

690
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:17,661
Lavon...

691
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,030
come on.

692
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,940
You know how difficult
this is for me.

693
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,837
Difficult never stopped me.

694
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,370
You're doing great, okay?

695
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,513
I see the head.

696
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:37,681
Another contraction.

697
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:40,467
I need you to push again
on the count of three.

698
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:42,961
One, two, three.

699
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,546
Go, go. Push!

700
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,463
Oh, no!

701
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,303
Brick, the shoulder.

702
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,304
It's lodged in the pelvis.

703
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:55,732
Push her head back in, I mean...

704
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,317
The ambulance is on the way.

705
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:58,893
They'll have to do
a C-section in Mobile.

706
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,061
Isn't that 20 miles away?

707
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,152
All right. Mrs. H, I need you
to hand me my scalpel.

708
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,296
- What are you doing?
- A symphysiotomy.

709
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,239
No, I can't let you slice
open her pelvis like that.

710
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:12,616
It is way too dangerous.

711
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,800
We have no choice, okay?

712
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:15,535
This baby comes out now,
or we lose both of them.

713
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,625
Okay, Mabel?

714
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,543
I'm going to give you
a local to dull the pain,

715
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:26,046
but I can't have you numb
r when you need to push.

716
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,648
You're going to feel a little pinch.

717
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,341
Ready?

718
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,759
Ahh!

719
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,055
Now, I need you two

720
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,182
to hold her steady until
it's all over, no matter what.

721
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,975
And after she delivers,

722
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,111
I'm going to close her
up as soon as possible.

723
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,497
Brick, that means the baby's
all you. Are you with me?

724
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:44,439
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

725
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,066
Okay. Ready?

726
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,734
Hang on, hang on.
Come on.

727
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,736
I... ow, ow, no,

728
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,197
please, please, it hurts too much!

729
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,574
Losing way too much blood.

730
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,742
Come on, Mabel.

731
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,577
Mabel, don't you pass out on me.

732
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,079
Mabel, come on.
I need you to push.

733
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,597
Hey.

734
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:02,082
I know you're tired, and
I know you're in pain,

735
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,667
but I need you to be strong.
Stronger than you've

736
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,802
ever been in your entire life.

737
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,712
You can do this.

738
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,140
Now give me one big push.

739
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,091
- Here you go.
- Okay?

740
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,807
♪ ♪

741
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,524
Oh...

742
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:33,238
Is she okay?

743
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,531
Yeah.

744
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,536
She got ten fingers and ten toes,

745
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,081
and those lungs that would
make Carrie Underwood jealous.

746
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,084
You got yourself
a healthy baby girl.

747
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,884
Nice job.

748
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,220
You know, it's too bad you're
not going to be staying.

749
00:34:57,238 --> 00:34:59,639
George told me you were going
to sign the practice back over.

750
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,163
Well, I'll go tell the
paramedics we're fine.

751
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,858
Mabel,

752
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,119
what you did for your daughter...

753
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,279
you were amazing.

754
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,948
Don't ever forget
how much strength you have.

755
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:26,708
A baby?!

756
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:30,628
You have got to be kidding.

757
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,172
I have a patient recovering here.

758
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,173
Dr. Hart, it's okay.

759
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:38,595
Look, Mama...

760
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:45,769
I made a beautiful, perfect person.

761
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:47,103
How she grows up,

762
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:50,940
how she looks at herself,

763
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:52,275
that's on me now.

764
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,156
And I'm not gonna
expose my baby to you.

765
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:03,161
So, please...

766
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,413
get out.

767
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,188
Yeah...

768
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:29,162
You ju...
You just can't leave now.

769
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:34,484
Thank you, Mrs. H.

770
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:36,069
That means a lot, coming from you.

771
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,239
I was happy I could help.

772
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,676
It was nice.

773
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,244
Great, actually.

774
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,097
But I mean, come on.

775
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,498
BlueBell?

776
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,434
I don't fit in here.

777
00:36:50,468 --> 00:36:52,436
Everybody hates me.

778
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,420
Plus the humidity is
really ruining my hair.

779
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:59,943
I'm not a family doctor.

780
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,553
I'm gonna be
a cardio-thoracic surgeon.

781
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,972
I've known since I was nine.

782
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,933
I just have to figure out
another way.

783
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:12,823
You asked me before why Harley
left you his practice.

784
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:16,526
I didn't tell you the whole truth.

785
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,736
I didn't think it
was my place. But...

786
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:22,299
I've been carrying this
around since, uh...

787
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,334
since you got here.

788
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:30,140
Didn't know if I should
give it to you, but...

789
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:31,749
Here.

790
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,897
That's my mom.

791
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:37,922
And...

792
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,550
Harley?

793
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,153
Yeah, Zoe.

794
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:46,306
Harley Wilkes was your father.

795
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,602
Wha...?

796
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:54,698
You're here! Great!

797
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:57,584
There's a superb Sancerre
chilling in the car.

798
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:00,086
We need to talk.

799
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:03,423
Oh, my...
Oh my God.

800
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:04,741
Zoe, I can explain.

801
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,426
What's there to explain?

802
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,620
That my entire life has been a lie?

803
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,831
This is the answer to
everything, isn't it?

804
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,934
Why Harley left me the practice,

805
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:15,376
why Dad stopped loving me?

806
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,273
Because I wasn't his to love.

807
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:22,383
He knew, didn't he?

808
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:27,447
When you were ten,
you fell off the swings,

809
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:29,849
they thought you would
need a transfusion.

810
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,985
But when he donated blood...

811
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,773
He tried to stay in your life,

812
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,107
but I guess it was too hard.

813
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:39,943
That's why he left?

814
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:42,487
And what about Harley?

815
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,798
Why not tell me about him?

816
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:46,658
Was he a psycho?
A pedophile? What?

817
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,752
He was a mistake.

818
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:50,587
I met him on a cruise.

819
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:51,838
It was Greece.

820
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,423
He was handsome, older, a gentleman.

821
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,666
It was a fantasy.

822
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,593
But I was engaged.

823
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:59,262
To someone real.

824
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,431
Did you love him?

825
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,934
It doesn't matter.

826
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:07,512
I did not belong with him,
just as my child

827
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,107
does not belong in a place like this.

828
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,184
I gave you a father
who was from our world.

829
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,779
I protected you.

830
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,355
That should've been my choice.

831
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,525
I am sorry, Zoe, okay?

832
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,453
I am truly, deeply sorry.

833
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,489
But, please, can we just go home

834
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:28,491
and discuss this in therapy
like normal people?

835
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,618
You go.

836
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm staying here.

837
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,590
<i>Growing up, I was told</i>

838
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:47,051
<i>that to be a surgeon,
I couldn't let myself feel.</i>

839
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:49,804
<i>But then, I came to BlueBell.</i>

840
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,682
All the food here is fried.

841
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,153
The whole town smells like mold.

842
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,398
And clearly, the sex
education system is lacking.

843
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:05,111
They could use a good doctor.

844
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,239
One who cares about her patients.

845
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,967
Maybe, even though you're gone,

846
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,852
there are still some things
you can teach me.

847
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,514
No one ever believed
in me like you did.

848
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:28,184
You kept sending me
those postcards...

849
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,927
knowing one day I'd be lost.

850
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:35,859
And maybe following in your...

851
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,770
my real father...

852
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,033
your footsteps for a while, um,

853
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,786
I might find my way.

854
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,711
Thanks.

855
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,136

856
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:20,394
Hi.

857
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,772
Zoe, where are you?

858
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,240
I got the Tark Twins here again.

859
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,775
Let me guess.
They were wrestling

860
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,276
in poison oak?

861
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,361
You got it.

862
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,321
I'll be right there.

863
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,198
See you soon, Dr. Hart.
