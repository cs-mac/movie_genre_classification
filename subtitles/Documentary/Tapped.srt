1
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:23,107
Feet together, bow.

2
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,244
- Osu!
- Yoi!

3
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,059
A little bit of exercise, a little bit
of basics here today, guys. Ready?

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,183
Let's go. Jumping jacks to
start. Go, jumping jacks!

5
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:34,354
That's it, that's the one.
Pop and snap.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,321
Good stuff. Push-ups! Go, push-ups!

7
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:39,190
That's it, nice and low.

8
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:41,158
Try to get that chin
all the way down.

9
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,926
Good stuff. Nice push-up.

10
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,162
Now let's get everyone standing up.

11
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:47,931
Feet together. Bow.

12
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,133
Osu!

13
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:51,135
Okay, ready, guys? Single punches.

14
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,669
1!

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,238
2!

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,540
3!

17
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,673
4!

18
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:59,143
5! 6!

19
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,045
7.

20
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,513
8!

21
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:04,048
9!

22
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,484
Go!

23
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:07,918
Feet together! Bow!

24
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,453
- Osu.
- Osu!

25
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,789
Yoi.

26
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,157
Ready? Put that one foot forward.

27
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,762
Ready? We'll face this way.
Feet together. Bow!

28
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,962
Grab that bo. Here we
go, nice and strong.

29
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,298
- Step, punch, one!
- Hah!

30
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,766
Up-down! Side-to-side!

31
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,169
Big reverse! And lift it up.

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,703
- Big punch! Kiai!
- Hah!

33
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,172
Excellent. Back to steep.

34
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,410
And give these guys
a hand, nice work.

35
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:37,214
Next belt: black.

36
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:38,848
Keep training as hard
as you did in blue,

37
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,218
you'll be taking my job some day.

38
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,187
There you go, ready. Feet together.

39
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:44,688
- Bow.
- Osu.

40
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,091
Let's give Michael a hand,
guys, our newest brown belt.

41
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,529
- Congratulations, buddy.
- I'm so proud of you.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,089
You know...

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,059
we did all right with this one.

44
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,295
Yeah, we did.

45
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,609
Open the door.

46
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,943
Open the fuckin' door!

47
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:42,580
Michael, Michael,
get down, get down!

48
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,761
- Stay here, stay here.
- Open the fuckin' door!

49
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,885
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Open the fuckin' door!

50
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,187
- Hey!
- Phil!

51
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,821
- Okay okay okay.
- Move it!

52
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,025
- Phil, Phil!
- Listen, I'll blow your head off.

53
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,127
Please, don't hurt us, okay?
I have money in my wallet.

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,194
Tell this bitch to unlock the door!

55
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:58,295
- Unlock it!
- Credit cards.

56
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,197
- Open the fucking door.
- No, Carol, no no!

57
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:02,099
No no, Carol!

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,668
- Unlock it right now!
- No!

59
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:06,337
No no no no!

60
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:08,575
Phil!

61
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:13,546
No.

62
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:21,352
What did you do, man?

63
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:23,254
What the fuck did you do?

64
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,022
Take her out.

65
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:27,724
Kill her right now! Take her out!

66
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,105
- Fuck that! I didn't sign up for this.
- Get off me!

67
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,864
- Please don't kill me.
- Don't look at me.

68
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:36,866
- I don't want to die.
- Don't look at me.

69
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:41,074
- Please please, I don't want to die.
- Shut the fuck up!

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,221
Hold on.

71
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,992
Where the fuck you guys been?

72
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,452
Sorry for party rockin'

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,496
Michael!

74
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,531
Go after him.

75
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:17,171
And models in the VIP...

76
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,038
There he is! There he is!

77
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,344
Out for the whole damn club to see

78
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,080
Sorry for party rockin'

79
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,450
When they talk shit,
we just be like

80
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,754
Sorry for party rockin'

81
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:40,524
People always say
that my music's loud

82
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,727
Sorry for party rockin'

83
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:47,464
Neighbors complain,
saying "Turn it down"

84
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:50,035
Sorry for party...

85
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,311
- Morris.
- Len.

86
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,213
There was a disturbance call.

87
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,381
- House party.
- Hmm.

88
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,585
The ringleader here
gave us some flak.

89
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,521
A couple of the kids say that
the booze came from him.

90
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:12,356
I don't know what to say.

91
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:15,496
He's just lucky he didn't get picked
up by one of the other patrols.

92
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,469
Morris, I'm doing all I can here.

93
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,438
I know it hasn't been easy for him,

94
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,377
but I can't keep getting
him off the hook.

95
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:36,647
He gets picked up again,

96
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:39,149
he's gonna have to go
through the system.

97
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,285
You've done more than enough, Len,

98
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,887
and I appreciate it.

99
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:44,958
You have yourself a good night.

100
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:02,610
Can't you see my
heart is breaking...

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,901
I don't even know why I
show up to school, man.

102
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:34,705
- It's a waste of my time.
- Guess who got some after the party.

103
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:37,441
Dude, jerking off a cop to let
you go doesn't count, man.

104
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,710
Yeah yeah.

105
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,879
Remember that chick?

106
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
- No way.
- Way, dude.

107
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:44,415
She got separated from her friends

108
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,583
- and she needed a ride home.
- You don't even have a car.

109
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,919
I know. We wandered around
forever trying to find it.

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,055
- Dude, smell my fingers.
- Aw, you're sick, man.

111
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,989
Dude, a brother's gotta eat, right?

112
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,025
Michael Shaw, please
come to the office.

113
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:56,327
- Oh.
- Shit.

114
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,062
Again?

115
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:59,663
Man, I'm sorry. Yeah, I gotta go.

116
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,068
Let's go, guys.

117
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,205
Whoo, oh, that's nice.

118
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,174
Oh ho, sorry, dude.

119
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,677
Nice hat.

120
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:17,050
Principal Vanhorne is
ready to see you now.

121
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,520
Ah, Mr. Shaw.

122
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,558
Join us please.

123
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,866
I can understand your frustration.

124
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,602
I mean, it must be very difficult
having all your friends

125
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,804
in college and you're still here.

126
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,306
But that falls on you.

127
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:44,742
Your grandfather and
I are very concerned

128
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:46,877
about your extracurricular
activities.

129
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:49,446
- Well, you don't need to be.
- Really?

130
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:52,284
- Yeah.
- What'd you do this weekend?

131
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:02,062
Go go go go!

132
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:13,404
According to this you're
barely passing, Michael,

133
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:16,777
and you haven't even started
your community service hours.

134
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,782
You can't take a third
victory lap, son.

135
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,083
Your grandfather and I
have a possible solution.

136
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,952
Your father's old friend
Reggie runs that doji...

137
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,321
- Dojo.
- He's agreed to let you

138
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,490
do your community
service hours there.

139
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,726
You'll go there every day after
school starting tomorrow.

140
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,761
Keep up a passing grade average

141
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,497
and you could walk out of
here having earned a diploma.

142
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,336
You have an opportunity
here, Michael.

143
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,304
And we are willing to help you.

144
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:50,544
But only if you're willing
to help yourself.

145
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,483
No shoes on the floor.

146
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:40,450
Michael, right?

147
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,686
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

148
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,523
You look like him.

149
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,426
This is the main dojo floor.

150
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:50,694
The only time you'll be on it

151
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,065
is when you're cleaning it.

152
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,566
The mirrors

153
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,204
need to be wiped down every night.

154
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,338
You're not a narcissist, are ya?

155
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:03,307
No.

156
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,342
And right here,

157
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,511
that's the master.

158
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,183
He looks over the place.

159
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,789
Your arsenal.

160
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,563
What'd you expect, wax on, wax off?

161
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,805
The kids have a hard
time hitting the bowl,

162
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:38,446
so you'll probably spend
a lot of time in here.

163
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:46,150
- Hey, where're you going?
- Home.

164
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,585
So I'm your janitor.

165
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:50,554
Look, kid,

166
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:52,656
I'm doing you a favor.

167
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,529
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

168
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,667
You might need those to lock up.

169
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,201
You actually trust me?

170
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,939
What's there to steal, the mirrors?

171
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:09,207
He's watching.

172
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:35,834
This is bullshit.

173
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,229
Whew!

174
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:02,053
Tough guy, are you?

175
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,420
Come here.

176
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,789
He really isn't our chi...

177
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:20,808
- So how was it?
- Great.

178
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,147
Now there was a time

179
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,486
When you loved me so

180
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:38,459
I couldn't do wrong

181
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:42,329
Now you need to know

182
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:48,532
See, I've been a bad
bad bad bad man

183
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,170
And I'm in deep

184
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,404
Yeah

185
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:56,706
And I found a brand-new
love for this man...

186
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,609
- Oh.
- And can't wait till you see

187
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,713
How you like me now?

188
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,982
How you like me now?

189
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,350
How you like me now?

190
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:07,684
How you like me now?

191
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,187
I know.

192
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,255
How you like me now?

193
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,923
How you like me now?

194
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:15,194
Remember the time

195
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,432
When I eat you up?

196
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,768
Yeah, I was a line

197
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,139
- That you can't give up...
- Oh man.

198
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,343
I've asked you all to
reread pages 62 to 65

199
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:34,479
because your test
scores were very low.

200
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,014
So we are going to
review this information.

201
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,452
Come on, people. It's on the board.

202
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:43,155
Come on, people, it's on the board.

203
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,522
Michael?

204
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:47,824
- H-C-N?
- Yes.

205
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,761
So how you like me now?

206
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,396
How you like me now?

207
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:55,099
How you like me now?

208
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,502
How you like me now?

209
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:05,476
Does that make you love me, baby?

210
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:09,250
Does that make you want me, baby?

211
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:17,288
Oh mercy

212
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,956
Yeah

213
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,825
Oh yeah

214
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:25,399
Oh yes, I said

215
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:29,799
Oh yeah, hey

216
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,104
Oooh yeah

217
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,377
Oh yeah, oh

218
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,609
Oh yeah

219
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,013
Oh so

220
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:44,718
All right.

221
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:58,029
Higher. Attagirl.

222
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,367
Calf... that's great.

223
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:04,770
Higher.

224
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,541
Attagirl.

225
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,623
Hai! Hai!

226
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:28,259
Hai!

227
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,795
Hey.

228
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:34,398
Make sure when you punch you
gotta take it out, okay?

229
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,334
- Okay.
- Up here, you don't wanna get it caught

230
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,102
'cause otherwise
you're gonna break it.

231
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:40,237
- You don't wanna break it, right?
- No.

232
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,508
Let's try it.

233
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,148
Here, hit it.

234
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,884
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

235
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,554
- Good.
- Nice to see you.

236
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:58,055
How is school going?

237
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,191
I know.

238
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:01,727
Good job.

239
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,901
- Bye Bye.
- Hey, thank you.

240
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,970
- Bye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sensei.

241
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:15,705
- Bye.
- Jimmy!

242
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,642
Bye.

243
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:19,377
See you tomorrow.

244
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,445
Bye. Bye. Thank you.

245
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,814
Bye.

246
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,251
You work well with kids.

247
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:30,089
Looks like you remember
a thing or two.

248
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,789
That was a long time ago.

249
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,924
I'll tell you what,
you divide your time

250
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,926
between keeping this place spotless

251
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,329
and helping me with the kids,

252
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,598
and let's see if we can
get you back into a gi.

253
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,668
Look, I'm just here to
finish my hours, okay?

254
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,206
Yeah, I can see that.

255
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:49,939
Look, this isn't...
it's not me anymore.

256
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,575
Well, when it is you,

257
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:53,713
I'll see you on the floor.

258
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,416
Oh, and don't even
think about it...

259
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:00,052
she's my niece.

260
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,159
Hyah... ya!

261
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:10,756
Get changed.

262
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,799
Gotta earn it.

263
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,450
You look good. How does it feel?

264
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,449
It feels pretty good.

265
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,553
Let's see your front stance.

266
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,459
Needs a little work.

267
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,363
Again.

268
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,066
Better.

269
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,435
All right. Shoulders back,

270
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:01,842
chest out, chin up.

271
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:06,880
Okay, let's see a front punch.

272
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,915
Okay, this... chamber hand?

273
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,917
Always even with the belt.

274
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:15,988
All right? Again.

275
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:20,359
Good. Breathe.

276
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:22,926
You're not breathing.

277
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,528
Breathe. Go!

278
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:25,797
Louder.

279
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,699
From your gut. Never
mind how it sounds.

280
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,668
It's gonna protect
you, all right? Again.

281
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,070
- Hyah!
- There you go. Again.

282
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,772
Hyah!

283
00:22:34,773 --> 00:22:36,843
Good. Keep working on it.

284
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:23,554
Ha-aaa.

285
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:25,725
Not bad.

286
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:30,160
I didn't think anybody
was watching.

287
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,932
You can just pretend I'm not.

288
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:35,000
You'll get in trouble.

289
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,703
I'm Jen.

290
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:41,705
Michael.

291
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:43,973
- You're Reggie's niece, right?
- Uh, yeah.

292
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,044
- Is he around?
- Nah, he just took off.

293
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:49,415
Thanks.

294
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:52,917
Is there something I
can help you with?

295
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:55,255
I don't think so.

296
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,591
Wait, you came all the
way here for nothing?

297
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:02,026
How do you know I don't
live across the street?

298
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:04,994
- A girl like you?
- Oh, smooth.

299
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:06,531
Does that normally work?

300
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,967
So is this what you're
gonna be doing all night?

301
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:13,970
You mean standing in front of a
mirror making an ass out of myself?

302
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,307
Yeah, pretty much.

303
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:18,442
Get changed.

304
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:20,780
I wanna show you something.

305
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:42,399
Do me a favor? Don't tell my
uncle I brought you here.

306
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,201
He's old school.

307
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:45,803
Okay.

308
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,005
Buckle up, get strapped in

309
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:49,840
We're getting wild in Moscow now

310
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,476
We'll keep it cool like
Aspen, trans-Siberian

311
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:53,811
- And off the tracks...
- Hey.

312
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:54,979
- How's it going?
- Good.

313
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,050
Hi sweetie.

314
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:01,218
- Ladies, this is Michael.
- Hey, Michael, how's it going?

315
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,021
He's a janitor.

316
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,689
Come on.

317
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,291
Okay, let's go.

318
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,660
Everybody get your hands
in the Soviet dance

319
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:11,228
Now drop, keep it moving, man...

320
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:13,499
We've been doin' this
for 3 hours.

321
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:16,200
What time are we gonna get in?

322
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:18,972
- The fights are gonna be over.
- Come on, man.

323
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:22,608
Come on.

324
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:27,045
Jesus.

325
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:30,581
What is this place?

326
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,216
You'll see.

327
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,852
Who's that guy? Come on.

328
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,653
- You'll get your turn.
- That was our turn.

329
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:38,434
We're freezing our
asses off out here.

330
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,695
- We'll meet you guys inside.
- Okay.

331
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,866
I guess we're taking two.

332
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,780
- Fighting?
- Yeah. It's awesome, right?

333
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:04,848
Might drop like blocks in Tetris

334
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:07,184
Man, I'm purple in the eye
'cause we're rockin' it

335
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:09,820
Sing it, sunrise in the a.m....

336
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:11,223
Hey!

337
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:14,525
- Hey, thanks.
- No worries.

338
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,096
Oh my God, who's winning so far?

339
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:21,467
This is insane.

340
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:28,808
Hang on, tighten it!

341
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:31,844
Don't lose him now. Tighten!

342
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,919
Whoo!

343
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:50,327
Yo, how crazy was
that fight, y'all?

344
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:51,830
What's up?

345
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:58,936
All right, y'all. All right, yo!

346
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,604
All right, check this out.

347
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:02,873
Yo, this next match

348
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,541
is balls to the walls.

349
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,376
No holds barred.

350
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:10,948
This... yo, this is what
you are all here for.

351
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,816
- What?
- He's crazy.

352
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,418
First we got

353
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,155
Nick Maynar-rrrrd!

354
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:21,060
- Go home, go home!
- Whoo!

355
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:23,660
This guy's huge.

356
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:25,796
And his opponent

357
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:27,397
Dominic

358
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:30,770
Motherfuckin' Gray-yyy!

359
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:33,905
Yeah!

360
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:39,012
He is the sickest fighter.
Oh my God.

361
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,715
Go to your corner.

362
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,753
Stop it, no! Stop it, no!

363
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:51,989
Stop... no no no! No no no!

364
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,893
No-ooo!

365
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,998
Now I know you're ready.
Let's do this, baby.

366
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:15,246
Hey, what's up?

367
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,027
Are you okay?

368
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,969
Michael?

369
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,712
- Come on!
- Get off him.

370
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:52,583
- Oh shit, Dom-ination, baby!
- Whoo!

371
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:56,491
Dominic Gray, a bad bad man.

372
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:10,434
Hey. Ahem, I wanna report a crime.

373
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:13,270
I mean, I have some
information about a crime.

374
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:15,606
Okay, sir. Can you tell
me exactly what happened?

375
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:19,077
It was a... it was a carjacking,
but there was a murder involved.

376
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:22,379
- And where was this?
- Well, it was a long time ago.

377
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,549
- I don't really remember.
- Why are you only coming forward now?

378
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,151
No no, because...

379
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:29,419
because I got new
information, okay?

380
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,425
Do you... do you have a
case number or a reference?

381
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:35,795
The victims were my parents.

382
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:39,599
It was a carjacking and...

383
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:42,699
I saw the guy tonight! Okay?

384
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,736
I need one of you guys to go down there
and arrest this guy right fucking now!

385
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:48,305
As you know, we can't just go
out there and arrest him, okay?

386
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:51,109
We need a warrant for that. Now if
you'd just calm down for a minute

387
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,148
and properly explain
the situa... sir? Sir?

388
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:12,332
You, uh, forgetting something?

389
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:20,240
When you step into this dojo you
leave everything else outside.

390
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,574
The only thing you bring in
here is your concentration.

391
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,780
- Where are you right now?
- Leaving.

392
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:35,555
40, 60, 80, 100.

393
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,789
Oh man, I'm losing count, man.

394
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,857
I need a bigger drawer, Big D.

395
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:44,498
Woo! Man, we made a
killing last night, yo.

396
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,497
Hey, boss.

397
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:49,568
It's all right, man.

398
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,510
Is there somethin'
I can do for you?

399
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:01,946
I wanna fight.

400
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,748
And you are...?

401
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:06,284
Michael Shaw.

402
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,353
And I care why?

403
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:10,724
'Cause I have an interest
in one of your fighters.

404
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:14,593
Look, a fan.

405
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:18,528
Oh...

406
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,999
I don't have time for this, man.

407
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,303
Hey! Hey, man, I'm serious.

408
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:27,774
- I wanna fight.
- It's cool, man.

409
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:32,176
Okay, Michael Shaw,
let's start with this.

410
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:34,914
Where do you train?
What's your record?

411
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,615
That's what I thought.

412
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:41,352
Man, I'll fight anybody, okay?

413
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:42,953
Listen, pretty boy,

414
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:44,821
I'm pretty sure you got
all kind of reasons

415
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,523
why you wanna become
a fighter, man.

416
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:49,693
But if I let every kid who walked up
in that office a shot in the cage?

417
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:53,264
Man, I'd be on a street corner somewhere
begging for change from people like you.

418
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,966
- And I know you ain't got none.
- Yeah, but you don't understand...

419
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:58,136
Look, kid! It's brave of you,

420
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:00,707
but the answer is simply no.

421
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,374
I'll tell you what though,

422
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,976
since you did take the trouble of
coming all the way down here, man,

423
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:08,545
here's two tickets
to tonight's fight.

424
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:10,281
It's gonna be a good one.

425
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:12,716
Bring one of your
girlfriends or something.

426
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:14,285
Okay.

427
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:30,836
Hell yeah, man.

428
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,138
He really knows how to
put on a fucking show.

429
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:36,773
He really knows how to
put on a fucking show.

430
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:40,710
Man, great fights, great eye candy.

431
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,047
You just gotta understand.

432
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,249
- I'm sorry, boys, let's go.
- See you at my place.

433
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,019
Follow us. Absolutely. Let's go.

434
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:04,230
Let's go inside.

435
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,674
It's my jam!

436
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,843
Motherfuck's my jam, man!

437
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,513
All right, three. It's Jaeger.

438
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:24,584
Everybody, everybody,

439
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:28,207
Yo!

440
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:32,009
What are you doing?

441
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,279
You snooping around
here or somethin'?

442
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:40,454
I asked you a question, kid.

443
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:45,225
Yo, get Dom out here.

444
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:12,551
The kid was snooping
around out back.

445
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:16,755
Look at me, kid.

446
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:21,528
You know you're trespassing, right?

447
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:27,868
Do you know what that means?

448
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:31,937
Do you?

449
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:48,220
Do you wanna know something funny?

450
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:55,459
I can cut your eye out right here,

451
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,661
right now

452
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,867
and nobody would think twice.

453
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,936
I can kill you

454
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:08,472
and nobody would care.

455
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:11,110
Remember that.

456
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,550
And get the fuck off my property.

457
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,358
Stupid-ass kid.

458
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:36,601
Hey, keep it moving.

459
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:40,837
Here.

460
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,808
This is the address of the man
that I saw kill my parents.

461
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:45,276
And there's my number.

462
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:48,749
Give me a call when somebody decides
to do their job around here.

463
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:51,549
Michael!

464
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:54,152
Hey!

465
00:38:58,056 --> 00:38:59,123
What did he want?

466
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:00,924
Uh, it's his second time in here.

467
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,560
The kid's all over the place.

468
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:05,763
Wants us to go pick up some guy on
a 7-year-old murder charge.

469
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:07,901
Here, he gave me this.

470
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:21,911
Hey.

471
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:24,448
Look, I know I lost
my cool the other day

472
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,886
and I shouldn't have.

473
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:29,823
This place means a lot to me.

474
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:33,157
I want to help you.

475
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:35,027
I wanna help the kids.

476
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:38,028
And I want to keep on
training, you know,

477
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:41,267
- provided that's okay with you.
- Okay.

478
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:45,604
That's it?

479
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:50,241
Look, I said I'm sorry.

480
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,777
I thought this place was
supposed to be about

481
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:56,148
honor and respect.

482
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,384
- Hit this.
- What?

483
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:02,555
Hit this.

484
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:10,828
Deep breath,

485
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:12,563
focus

486
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:14,066
and strike.

487
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,646
Hai!

488
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:33,120
The makiwara defines
the essence of karate.

489
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:36,053
Your punch can bounce off

490
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:38,756
just as easily as it can puncture.

491
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:43,227
The only thing that
factors into it is you...

492
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:44,862
your mind,

493
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:46,330
your focus

494
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,598
and your form.

495
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,800
You wanna get angry,

496
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:53,106
you wanna hit something, hit this.

497
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,507
4:00 every day,

498
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:58,742
same as before.

499
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,679
Keep at it.

500
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:46,090
Osu, stand, yoi.

501
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,227
All right, jumping
jacks, 10 fast... go!

502
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:54,064
Other hand here, punching.

503
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,400
Here we go, ready? And...

504
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:59,536
watch out, guys. 1, 2...

505
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:01,805
as fast as you can. 5...

506
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:03,174
6...

507
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:12,085
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi.

508
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:14,184
Oh, how you doing?

509
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,386
- Good.
- Good.

510
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,624
Come on in.

511
00:42:22,293 --> 00:42:24,262
Here we go!

512
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,912
Don't, no no no no no!

513
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:03,068
1, 2, 3, karate!

514
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:04,701
Good job last night. Good job.

515
00:43:04,702 --> 00:43:06,004
- What's that there? Oh!
- What?

516
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:07,805
Good job.

517
00:43:07,806 --> 00:43:09,509
Good job.

518
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,473
And it's on!

519
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,991
Oooh.

520
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:44,035
Ladies and gentlemen, get
ready for another crazy one.

521
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:47,337
Right about now we got my
man Bullet inside the cage.

522
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:49,107
My dude is quick, but yo!

523
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,308
His opponent, the undefeated

524
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:54,146
Dominic Gray-yyy!

525
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:01,785
- Go to your corner.
- Whoo!

526
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:04,055
Yo, I know my man got
some speed on him,

527
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:07,524
but I'm telling you, I don't know how
he's gonna get himself outta this one.

528
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:09,426
I hope he can respond.

529
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:13,230
Dominic Gray is a
bad bad man, y'all.

530
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:15,532
You all know how he does it.

531
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:17,970
Y'all ready for this one or what?

532
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:21,105
- You ready?
- Excuse me.

533
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:22,606
All right, let's do this.

534
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:25,809
This gonna be crazy 'cause
you know it always is!

535
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,645
Get ready to fight, baby!

536
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:30,914
- Let's go!
- Come on!

537
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,749
Here we go!

538
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,922
- Whoo, middle of the war, y'all!
- Whoo!

539
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,922
- Off him.
- Come on, come on, come on.

540
00:46:10,189 --> 00:46:13,757
Dominic Gray, people, 13 and 0.

541
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:17,995
It's for this reason and
out of popular demand,

542
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:21,065
that your kind promoter
and our sponsors

543
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:25,236
have decided to host a
tournament starting May 15th.

544
00:46:25,237 --> 00:46:28,206
We want the best fighters
inside this cage.

545
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:31,679
No weight class. And
the awarded prize?

546
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,549
$50,000 cash!

547
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:40,484
Oh shit. Hey, and to get it?

548
00:46:40,485 --> 00:46:42,986
Fight your way through
to this motherfucker

549
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:44,723
and try knockin' him out!

550
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:50,161
Dominic Gray, y'all!

551
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,530
Undefeated!

552
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:11,515
Yeah, man, I was just
tellin' Big D, man,

553
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,417
this is gonna be our
wildest one yet, man.

554
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:15,419
Oh, it's gonna be crazy.
Dom can't wait.

555
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,255
He's just ready to kill
motherfuckers, man.

556
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:19,456
You should've seen him
tonight, man... 10 seconds.

557
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:21,225
I don't even think it
was 10 seconds, man.

558
00:47:21,226 --> 00:47:23,994
Yo, it's gonna be off the hook,
man. It's the best tournament...

559
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:26,030
I'll call you back, man.
I gotta call you back.

560
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:27,998
It's all right. Cool,
man, it's cool.

561
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,835
I gotta call you back.

562
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:32,636
Jesus Christ, man, you again?

563
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:35,439
- Didn't I comp you already?
- I wanna fight in the tournament.

564
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,574
Yeah, let me guess:

565
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:39,743
You hear 5 sexy numbers
and all of a sudden

566
00:47:39,744 --> 00:47:42,646
you're seeing a nice little hatchback
and affordable girlfriend, right?

567
00:47:42,647 --> 00:47:44,282
It's not about the money.

568
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:46,017
I just wanna fight.

569
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:48,353
Look, I appreciate your
dedication here, man,

570
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:50,754
but the shit's wearing thin.
It's not cute no more, man.

571
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:53,415
- Now get outta my office.
- I don't think you're listening.

572
00:47:54,692 --> 00:47:56,695
Apparently neither are you.

573
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,537
Oh shit!

574
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:07,671
All right. Ha ha!

575
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:10,640
Cool. But I can't throw you
in just like that, man.

576
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:13,410
You need some crowd time
and at least one win.

577
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:14,946
You gotta be likeable.

578
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:21,585
Ahem. Okay, I got one fighter
who just backed out last minute

579
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:24,488
at one of the other circuits.
Street match... amateur hour.

580
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:26,923
Fine. When is it?

581
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:29,395
Tomorrow night.

582
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:39,071
Don't make me regret this, kid.

583
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,510
Huh.

584
00:48:47,879 --> 00:48:49,415
Get your ass up, man.

585
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:16,140
Hey.

586
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:18,610
Hey.

587
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:24,883
I...

588
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:27,820
Thanks for meeting up.

589
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:31,824
I was kind of a dick before.

590
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:35,895
I figured, um...

591
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:39,863
maybe I was too forward

592
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:40,964
and scared you off.

593
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:43,134
No. No, not at all.

594
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:44,268
Really?

595
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:46,370
Yeah, it's...

596
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:47,804
it's refreshing.

597
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:50,343
Mm, interesting.

598
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:53,512
So...

599
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:56,180
You're a part-time janitor,

600
00:49:56,181 --> 00:50:00,218
a part-time karate
instructor and full-time...?

601
00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:01,486
I'm a student.

602
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,690
Mmm. What school do you go to?

603
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:06,523
Crescent Valley.

604
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,627
Isn't that a...

605
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,395
Yeah.

606
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:14,365
- You're not, like, 15, are you?
- No.

607
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, right on.

608
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:18,535
So you're just a perfectionist
with your grades.

609
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:21,172
So are you ever going to move
out of your parents' basement

610
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:23,974
or are you gonna be that guy
that stays there till he's 30?

611
00:50:23,975 --> 00:50:27,844
Uh, my parents died
when I was 12, so I...

612
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:30,314
I live with my grandfather.

613
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:32,383
Shit, I'm...

614
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:33,850
I'm sorry.

615
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:36,320
So looks like you got
me all figured out.

616
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:38,324
How about you?

617
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:41,591
I grew up out west.

618
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:45,096
Um, I came here a few years
ago just to visit my uncle

619
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:47,198
and kind of fell in
love with the city.

620
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,866
So I took a year off
after high school

621
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:54,838
and applied for some programs
here in criminology.

622
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,508
And soon as I got in I was
on the first plane out.

623
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:59,643
So you're looking to
catch the bad guys, huh?

624
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:02,446
Oh well, you know, I do
live in the student ghetto

625
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:06,183
so I am looking to catch the perp
who stole my bike in freshman year

626
00:51:06,184 --> 00:51:09,520
and subjecting him to the full power
of the criminal justice system.

627
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:12,089
Your parents must be proud.

628
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,925
Mm, yeah. Reg is even prouder.

629
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:18,129
You know, he can be
pretty over-protective,

630
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,265
so I think he likes the fact that
I'll be able to stand up for myself.

631
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,336
Nice.

632
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,736
So I got this thing tonight.

633
00:51:26,737 --> 00:51:28,239
I've got a fight.

634
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,473
You?

635
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:31,175
Yeah.

636
00:51:31,176 --> 00:51:34,245
- Like a fight fight?
- Yeah, like a fight fight.

637
00:51:34,246 --> 00:51:36,947
Oh, I didn't even know you
were into that kind of thing.

638
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:39,319
Is there a lot of money on it?

639
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:41,685
It's not really about the money.

640
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:43,620
Does my uncle know?

641
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,524
I keep your secret, you keep mine?

642
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:49,966
Okay.

643
00:51:52,064 --> 00:51:53,763
Reggie's Karate.

644
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:55,799
Leave a message.

645
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,537
Hey, Reg, it's... it's Michael.

646
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:02,939
Uh, I'm not gonna be able
to make it in today, man.

647
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,377
I'm... I think I'm coming
down with something.

648
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:07,913
I'll see you Monday.

649
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,482
Sorry.

650
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,703
Go ahead.

651
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:37,074
Every Friday night just like that.

652
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:38,742
Oh, he gets...

653
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:40,077
Oh!

654
00:52:40,078 --> 00:52:41,580
Come on, man.

655
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:13,312
Come on, man!

656
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:17,381
Gotta keep your eyes open, brother.

657
00:53:17,382 --> 00:53:18,915
He's too fast for you.

658
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:21,718
Oh, bitch, you just
got head-butted.

659
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,288
- Oh oh, and another one.
- Kid!

660
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,157
Yo, come on, man, you're next.

661
00:53:26,158 --> 00:53:29,826
- You can do better than that.
- What the hell is this for?

662
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:32,563
Dawg, the only thing you're
gonna need are your fists

663
00:53:32,564 --> 00:53:35,366
- and a heavy sack...
- Get up, come on!

664
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:38,035
It's over, it is over!

665
00:53:38,036 --> 00:53:39,905
and a fucking prayer.

666
00:53:42,441 --> 00:53:44,945
All right, all right, bring it in.

667
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,447
Give it up, give it up!

668
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:53,787
Squaring off against Jimmy D-DDD!

669
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:58,089
Come on, give it up!

670
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,625
Ha ha!

671
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:01,893
Michael Shaw.

672
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,535
All right, check it, check it.

673
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:14,405
No biting, no groin
shots, no eye gouges.

674
00:54:14,406 --> 00:54:16,741
You can't get up, you lose.

675
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:18,743
You tap, you lose.

676
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:20,077
You ready?

677
00:54:20,078 --> 00:54:22,348
Ready?

678
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:24,816
Let's do this.

679
00:54:34,126 --> 00:54:36,293
Yeah, Jimmy, knock
this kid the fuck out.

680
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:39,029
I got shit to do. Oh!

681
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,532
Send this kid home, man!

682
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:44,635
Ha ha! Oh...

683
00:54:44,636 --> 00:54:46,472
Sorry, Mike!

684
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,042
Oh, don't kill him, Jimmy.

685
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:54,547
Stay down, man.

686
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:01,085
Oh oh...

687
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:02,720
Oh!

688
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:04,324
The boy got some moves.

689
00:55:05,157 --> 00:55:06,492
Come on, Jimmy.

690
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:28,180
Oooh.

691
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,215
Give it up for the kid,

692
00:55:31,216 --> 00:55:32,449
Michael Shaw!

693
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,917
Yo yo!

694
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,853
That was fucking incredible, kid!

695
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:40,928
- So am I in or not?
- Yeah, you're in. You got 6 weeks.

696
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:49,701
Whew!

697
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,055
Hello.

698
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:12,389
Hey.

699
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,391
- Did you win?
- Yeah,

700
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:16,996
but my hand's gonna look
like a watermelon tomorrow.

701
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,832
Look, I don't want to overstep
my bounds or anything,

702
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:24,802
but...

703
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:26,739
I know what happened
to your parents.

704
00:56:28,106 --> 00:56:30,140
The carjacking...

705
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:32,511
and how they never found the guy.

706
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:40,987
Michael, why do you really
want to fight in this thing?

707
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,321
You didn't see it, did you?

708
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:46,690
The way they looked
at him it was like

709
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,830
they think he's some hero.

710
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:53,099
They don't even know.

711
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:56,767
It was him, wasn't it?

712
00:56:56,768 --> 00:56:59,904
Look, I gotta get on a
better sleeping schedule.

713
00:56:59,905 --> 00:57:02,773
Yeah yeah, of course.

714
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:05,109
- I'll let you go.
- How about dinner though?

715
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,544
Yeah.

716
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:09,113
Dinner's good.

717
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:12,185
- Good night.
- Good night.

718
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,867
What are you doing here?

719
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:32,436
Just thought I'd come
a little bit early.

720
00:57:32,437 --> 00:57:35,205
You think I'm gonna let you teach
the kids looking like that?

721
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:36,973
- I had an accident.
- Honor!

722
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:39,043
Respect.

723
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:41,045
That's what this is
all about, right?

724
00:57:41,046 --> 00:57:43,080
Well, I thought forgiveness
was a part of it too.

725
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:45,082
Not if you take advantage of it.

726
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:47,685
What are you really
training for, Michael?

727
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:50,821
If you wanna dance around in a
cage and hurt people for money,

728
00:57:50,822 --> 00:57:53,694
you're in the wrong place.

729
00:57:55,226 --> 00:57:56,894
Yeah well, you know what?

730
00:57:56,895 --> 00:58:00,764
These... these mind games,
all this bowing and shit,

731
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:02,599
nobody wants to see this
stuff anymore, man.

732
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,336
Then what are you still doing here?

733
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:07,838
You could've walked away any time.

734
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,174
You're here because you
made the wrong choices

735
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:13,243
and you chose to stay because
you're looking for something more.

736
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:15,713
You're right. You know what?

737
00:58:15,714 --> 00:58:17,348
I can leave whenever I want.

738
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:21,185
Then go right ahead. You
finished your hours weeks ago.

739
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:24,288
I'm not training you so you can
go out and fight in some circus.

740
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:27,858
- you understand me?
- Well, it's too late for that.

741
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:29,896
Then get out, Michael.

742
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:33,534
- Your choice.
- Fine.

743
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:36,735
Hey.

744
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:39,305
What?

745
00:58:40,138 --> 00:58:42,508
Uncle Reg!

746
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:47,644
- Why don't you just tell him?
- Tell him what?

747
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:50,447
Why you're fighting.
Just tell him the truth.

748
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,716
I-I know he can be a hard-ass,
but at least he'd understand.

749
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:54,952
You know I'm right.

750
00:58:54,953 --> 00:58:57,625
Why do you care so much anyways?

751
00:59:59,284 --> 01:00:00,951
Mr. Shaw.

752
01:00:00,952 --> 01:00:03,120
Come in, come in.

753
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:05,792
You're a very difficult
man to find these days.

754
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:10,061
I've been reviewing your, uh...

755
01:00:10,062 --> 01:00:11,995
your grades as of recent.

756
01:00:11,996 --> 01:00:15,365
You could use some
improvement in some areas.

757
01:00:15,366 --> 01:00:20,038
But they are exemplary in
comparison to last semester's.

758
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:22,543
And as promised...

759
01:00:24,342 --> 01:00:26,443
here's your letter
of recommendation

760
01:00:26,444 --> 01:00:28,445
and a few suggestions
for some schools

761
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:30,314
that would be good
for you to look at.

762
01:00:30,315 --> 01:00:32,316
Applications go out this month.

763
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:36,553
If there's anything there
that you want me to change,

764
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:38,722
just let me know.

765
01:00:38,723 --> 01:00:40,291
My GPA?

766
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,427
I wish I could.

767
01:00:43,428 --> 01:00:46,230
Best of luck.

768
01:00:46,231 --> 01:00:47,966
Thank you.

769
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:02,980
Michael, this is fantastic.

770
01:01:02,981 --> 01:01:05,482
Yeah.

771
01:01:05,483 --> 01:01:07,484
And I was wondering if you could

772
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:09,254
help me out with something.

773
01:01:13,658 --> 01:01:16,894
You know, Len Riley paid
me a visit a few days ago.

774
01:01:16,895 --> 01:01:18,562
Oh, yeah?

775
01:01:18,563 --> 01:01:20,900
It looks like he's
reopening the case.

776
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,102
Do you know anything about that?

777
01:02:26,232 --> 01:02:29,169
Hit that board any harder and
the other wrist is gonna burst.

778
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:34,608
- What are you doing here?
- Came to see how you were...

779
01:02:35,673 --> 01:02:38,243
and where you've gone
with my dinner plans.

780
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:42,579
- I'm sorry, I've been...
- It's fine.

781
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,783
It's not like I stopped eating.

782
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,885
So your grandfather
gave me the grand tour.

783
01:02:48,886 --> 01:02:50,520
Oh, he did?

784
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,258
Looks like you've got your
own place to train now.

785
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,333
- How's Reg doing?
- That's why I'm here.

786
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:08,841
Let's take a walk.

787
01:03:14,113 --> 01:03:17,414
You know, kid, sometimes
it helps to let people in

788
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:20,651
instead of coming across
like you don't care.

789
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:22,919
Would it have mattered?

790
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,189
Probably not.

791
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:28,259
But at least we could've gone
about it in a different way.

792
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,197
Reggie, the man killed my parents.

793
01:03:32,764 --> 01:03:34,931
A man that I finally
found after 7 years,

794
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,933
standing within a few feet.

795
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:40,604
- Now I have my chance at him.
- A chance at doing what?

796
01:03:40,605 --> 01:03:43,440
You gonna kill this guy in front
of a couple of hundred people?

797
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:45,509
I've thought about it.

798
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,713
Sit down, man.

799
01:03:57,455 --> 01:03:59,892
You know when I was your age...

800
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:02,961
I was in the military.

801
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,735
There's a reason those poor
bastards don't sleep at night.

802
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,601
Killing a guy

803
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,770
lets him off easy.

804
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:16,274
But letting him live

805
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:19,246
with what he's done...

806
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:22,682
that's torture.

807
01:04:23,815 --> 01:04:26,520
After I got back...

808
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:29,087
I started drinking.

809
01:04:31,422 --> 01:04:33,623
Your father's the one
who saved my life.

810
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:36,596
And the whiskey you
saw in the drawer?

811
01:04:38,063 --> 01:04:41,132
Yeah, I saw you looking.

812
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:42,835
It's a reminder.

813
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:45,535
It tests my will.

814
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:47,504
I haven't taken a sip in 15 years.

815
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:49,840
Your father was my friend, Michael.

816
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:52,743
And I think he turned you
into a damn good kid.

817
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:55,346
You want a shot at this guy?

818
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:57,014
I can't stop you.

819
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:59,616
But when you step in there,

820
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:02,552
everything else goes
out the window.

821
01:05:02,553 --> 01:05:05,525
It's about survival.

822
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:09,726
And that's how we're
gonna train you for it.

823
01:05:09,727 --> 01:05:11,895
I'm not doin' this to help you win.

824
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:15,099
In fact, I don't care if you do.

825
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,602
I just don't want to
see you get hurt,

826
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:21,372
especially not by him.

827
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:23,307
Wait, I thought you said that...

828
01:05:23,308 --> 01:05:24,574
Shut up...

829
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:26,511
before I change my mind.

830
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:30,383
We start training
tomorrow, 6:00 a.m.

831
01:05:40,058 --> 01:05:42,160
We've only got 3 weeks.

832
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,629
I can't teach you to be
better than these guys,

833
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:48,632
but I do have time to teach
you how to beat 'em.

834
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:51,102
The fighters you're going
up against are strong.

835
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,936
They're athletic

836
01:05:52,937 --> 01:05:55,373
and they know how to take a punch.

837
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:57,541
You can't afford to miss.

838
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:59,776
You need to rely on your speed

839
01:05:59,777 --> 01:06:03,613
and distance, and take as
little damage as possible.

840
01:06:03,614 --> 01:06:07,452
With the right timing and
the right placement,

841
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:09,656
you can end it with a single punch.

842
01:06:12,157 --> 01:06:14,925
Your karate's there. But
after watching these guys,

843
01:06:14,926 --> 01:06:17,094
I can tell that won't be enough.

844
01:06:17,095 --> 01:06:20,031
We're gonna mix it up a bit. This
way, when you're in close range

845
01:06:20,032 --> 01:06:21,998
you can open up like
a son of a bitch.

846
01:06:21,999 --> 01:06:24,168
In the beginning
moments of that fight,

847
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:26,337
you need to study him,

848
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:30,107
learn his range, know what
his next move will be.

849
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:32,779
Harder! Double kick!

850
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:36,047
When you step in there,

851
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:38,216
nothing else matters.

852
01:06:38,217 --> 01:06:40,084
Focus on your opponent.

853
01:06:40,085 --> 01:06:42,086
- You gotta watch out for the legs.
- Okay.

854
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:44,255
'Cause if you can't stand,

855
01:06:44,256 --> 01:06:46,590
- you can't fight, right?
- Yeah.

856
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:49,028
- Okay, so watch. Ready?
- Yeah.

857
01:06:51,163 --> 01:06:52,196
You all right?

858
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:53,832
- Yeah.
- All right.

859
01:07:03,808 --> 01:07:05,842
When these guys get tired

860
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:07,777
they start swinging for the fences.

861
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:10,714
So I want you... bang!
Right down the pike.

862
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:12,649
- Okay.
- Right down the pike, all right?

863
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,951
- Yeah.
- All right.

864
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:18,822
Keep your hands up, all right?

865
01:07:18,823 --> 01:07:20,559
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

866
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:28,367
Stop.

867
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:32,306
All right, you know that control
I've been teaching you?

868
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:35,074
Lose it.

869
01:07:40,878 --> 01:07:42,480
Hey!

870
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:43,782
Nice.

871
01:07:46,084 --> 01:07:48,152
Now there's these guys
I want you to meet.

872
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:50,587
They'll be able to help you
with your ground game.

873
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:51,688
- Hi.
- Hi.

874
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,524
If you got a fighting chance,

875
01:07:53,525 --> 01:07:55,692
it's because of them.

876
01:07:55,693 --> 01:07:57,896
Just try to keep up with them.

877
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:29,529
Good, bud.

878
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:37,767
Are you Reggie's guy?

879
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:39,437
Yeah. Michael.

880
01:08:39,438 --> 01:08:41,875
Michael.

881
01:08:47,412 --> 01:08:48,479
What's up?

882
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,082
Hey, Lyoto. This is the kid.

883
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,285
You can't be serious. He's
tiny and looks malnourished.

884
01:08:54,286 --> 01:08:55,319
I know.

885
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,821
It's impossible. He
doesn't stand a chance.

886
01:08:57,822 --> 01:09:02,993
Well, we've seen worse.
Impossible is what we do.

887
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:05,596
Guess we can try.

888
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:08,299
- You ready?
- Yeah.

889
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,833
All right then.

890
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:11,337
Let's do it.

891
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:15,406
All right. Your first lesson today

892
01:09:15,407 --> 01:09:18,842
is the sprawl. This is
very very important.

893
01:09:18,843 --> 01:09:20,713
Okay.

894
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,185
Okay. Let me introduce
you to my little friend,

895
01:09:28,186 --> 01:09:30,354
the medicine ball.

896
01:09:30,355 --> 01:09:32,090
Let's go, sprawl.

897
01:09:32,857 --> 01:09:35,326
Go, sprawl!

898
01:09:35,327 --> 01:09:36,993
Go! Fast!

899
01:09:36,994 --> 01:09:38,029
Come on, boy.

900
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,297
This is bad position for you.

901
01:09:40,298 --> 01:09:42,866
You need to change faster.

902
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:46,537
You need to move
your hips like this,

903
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:50,512
and you put your arm
inside and... choke.

904
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,412
And...

905
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:56,447
One more.

906
01:09:56,448 --> 01:09:58,551
Let's go! Fast!

907
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:08,927
Hai!

908
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:13,364
For this kick,

909
01:10:13,365 --> 01:10:16,167
you have to bring your
knee up like a fake

910
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:19,072
and kick with the
other leg. Like that.

911
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:21,740
Try it.

912
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:30,181
No no, you need more force.

913
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:32,450
- So you need to put your arms in here...
- Okay.

914
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,354
- Put your legs here.
- Uh-huh.

915
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:39,156
You have a lot of position
here for the choking.

916
01:10:39,157 --> 01:10:40,890
First one.

917
01:10:40,891 --> 01:10:43,028
And this one.

918
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,407
No no, you have to... more force.

919
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,090
You need to keep your working more.

920
01:11:26,204 --> 01:11:27,238
Great job.

921
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,607
Dentists love this kick.

922
01:11:29,608 --> 01:11:30,943
Go!

923
01:11:31,743 --> 01:11:33,244
Kick.

924
01:11:33,245 --> 01:11:35,112
Drop-kick.

925
01:11:35,113 --> 01:11:36,980
Nice. Good job.

926
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:39,383
You ready for the real test?

927
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:42,088
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

928
01:11:50,162 --> 01:11:51,797
Okay. Up your hands.

929
01:11:53,598 --> 01:11:54,966
Keep moving.

930
01:12:02,107 --> 01:12:03,475
I like this kick.

931
01:12:18,256 --> 01:12:20,224
I like it. Good job, buddy.

932
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:22,793
- Good.
- I love it.

933
01:12:22,794 --> 01:12:25,732
Oof! Aw.

934
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:34,408
So, uh, I think he might be ready.

935
01:12:35,607 --> 01:12:37,675
Thanks.

936
01:12:37,676 --> 01:12:39,612
- Thank you.
- Good job.

937
01:12:42,147 --> 01:12:43,547
Well?

938
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:45,083
We'll see.

939
01:12:53,058 --> 01:12:55,359
Oh no. No no.

940
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,663
Yes.

941
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:06,770
Let's go, huh? Let's go.

942
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:10,210
Oh me, oh my, man

943
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:14,578
Didn't hesitate

944
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:15,847
At all...

945
01:13:17,182 --> 01:13:20,117
Not a fool for fate

946
01:13:20,118 --> 01:13:21,485
At all

947
01:13:21,486 --> 01:13:24,992
He'd just take my hand

948
01:13:26,858 --> 01:13:29,493
I didn't understand

949
01:13:29,494 --> 01:13:32,733
Oh me, oh my, guy

950
01:13:33,798 --> 01:13:37,003
Oh, it's sportswear for you

951
01:13:38,536 --> 01:13:40,838
- But I've got one or two...
- Hold on.

952
01:13:40,839 --> 01:13:42,942
One second, one second.

953
01:13:45,777 --> 01:13:47,914
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

954
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:51,448
He's watching.

955
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:55,590
Maybe if it all works out

956
01:13:57,389 --> 01:14:00,990
We can get a two-bedroom house

957
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:04,695
With a king-size bed

958
01:14:04,696 --> 01:14:09,003
And a spare room there for guests

959
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:14,307
Oh, but it didn't last.

960
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:30,854
This place is really falling apart.

961
01:14:30,855 --> 01:14:32,556
Yeah.

962
01:14:32,557 --> 01:14:34,792
It's been pretty tough on Reg.

963
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:39,201
He can't afford the repairs, so he
insists on fixing it up himself.

964
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:43,068
He just works so hard, you know?

965
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:46,170
And people don't
want karate anymore.

966
01:14:46,171 --> 01:14:47,972
They want what they see on TV.

967
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:52,309
Which is a shame because I see what
my uncle does for these kids...

968
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:54,680
and for you.

969
01:14:59,484 --> 01:15:01,219
How do I look?

970
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,061
I know you think that
you need to do this,

971
01:15:11,062 --> 01:15:13,364
and that's fine.

972
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:16,433
But after tomorrow I really
hope that you can make peace

973
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:18,969
with everything that
you've been holding onto.

974
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,107
You've earned that.

975
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:27,506
Shake it off.

976
01:16:29,974 --> 01:16:33,514
Wait here. I got something for you.

977
01:16:46,157 --> 01:16:48,292
If I'm not mistaken,
your father said

978
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:50,863
that you were just a few
months away from earning...

979
01:16:52,064 --> 01:16:53,999
this.

980
01:16:57,969 --> 01:17:00,637
Tomorrow is what it
all comes down to.

981
01:17:00,638 --> 01:17:03,108
Don't lose your focus.

982
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,776
You're there for one purpose.

983
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:09,313
Whatever you choose to do...

984
01:17:09,314 --> 01:17:12,018
don't forget what
they'd expect of you.

985
01:17:13,651 --> 01:17:15,552
Go home, get a good night's sleep.

986
01:17:15,553 --> 01:17:17,356
I'll see you there.

987
01:17:19,424 --> 01:17:21,727
I'm not gonna let you
coach yourself, am I?

988
01:17:49,454 --> 01:17:51,455
All right, y'all. All right, yo!

989
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:53,290
Today is the day!

990
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:57,261
We've got a sweet lineup
of fights comin' atcha

991
01:17:57,262 --> 01:18:00,031
that are sure not to disappoint.

992
01:18:00,032 --> 01:18:03,433
This is the tournament of
all tournaments, baby.

993
01:18:03,434 --> 01:18:05,869
Woo! This is gonna be crazy.

994
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,007
This is gonna be live!
This is gonna be wild!

995
01:18:09,008 --> 01:18:12,376
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
now this is how it works.

996
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,578
Once the preliminaries
are outta the way,

997
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:18,815
we'll break and reconvene for
the final match-up at 6:00.

998
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:21,919
The fighter who manages to keep
himself in the game until then

999
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,024
will get his shot at the $50,000

1000
01:18:26,025 --> 01:18:29,060
against our very own
undefeated champ

1001
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:30,963
Dominic Gray!

1002
01:18:37,602 --> 01:18:41,108
Let's go to war-rrr!

1003
01:18:46,878 --> 01:18:50,114
All right, y'all, this is our
first fight of the night!

1004
01:18:50,115 --> 01:18:52,819
We got Chino-ooo!

1005
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:56,687
And his opponent...

1006
01:18:56,688 --> 01:19:00,829
Rotansky. Make some noise!

1007
01:19:03,928 --> 01:19:05,929
Corner, sir.

1008
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,631
Thank you. Mouthpiece?

1009
01:19:07,632 --> 01:19:10,904
Cup? Good to go.

1010
01:19:13,172 --> 01:19:14,571
Are you ready, sir?

1011
01:19:14,572 --> 01:19:16,207
You ready?

1012
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,511
- Fight!
- Let's get it on, y'all!

1013
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,549
Oh, this is crazy already!

1014
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:28,318
Oh, damn, oh!

1015
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:30,255
Oh oh!

1016
01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:33,093
Oh, that's big trouble now... oh!

1017
01:19:36,095 --> 01:19:37,363
Oh!

1018
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:42,803
Chino-ooo!

1019
01:19:54,213 --> 01:19:55,615
Come over here, guys.

1020
01:19:56,714 --> 01:19:58,949
Protect yourself at all time.
Obey my command at all time.

1021
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:01,770
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corner.

1022
01:20:03,255 --> 01:20:04,289
You ready?

1023
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,725
Fight!

1024
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,478
See, look at him. See him?

1025
01:20:37,122 --> 01:20:38,824
Yeah yeah!

1026
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:49,901
Yeah!

1027
01:20:53,705 --> 01:20:56,673
Yo, this next match is gonna
be real interesting, man!

1028
01:20:56,674 --> 01:20:58,375
We got a newcomer to the cage!

1029
01:20:58,376 --> 01:21:01,882
Check it out, y'all!
We got Michael Shaw!

1030
01:21:03,148 --> 01:21:06,383
Taking on Abraham the Firearm!

1031
01:21:06,384 --> 01:21:07,952
Woo!

1032
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:18,296
Come on in, guys.

1033
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:23,000
Protect yourself at all times.
Obey my command at all times.

1034
01:21:23,001 --> 01:21:25,861
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corners.

1035
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:28,758
Let's go, guys. Step
back, step back.

1036
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:32,342
A'ight, karate boy. Whatever,
man. I hope that helps you!

1037
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:34,278
Nice and relaxed, Michael!

1038
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:36,114
Make sure you keep your hands up!

1039
01:21:39,351 --> 01:21:41,788
Ooh, you gotta watch that
firearm. It might burn!

1040
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:47,158
Attaboy! Focus on the gameplan.

1041
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,930
Who's got it goin' on, man?
Let's brawl, let's brawl!

1042
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,500
Bring him out, around!

1043
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:57,869
Nice!

1044
01:22:03,142 --> 01:22:05,077
Don't just stand there, move!

1045
01:22:06,011 --> 01:22:08,179
Ohhh!

1046
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,014
Michael Shaw, y'all!
Make some noise!

1047
01:22:10,015 --> 01:22:11,548
Yes!

1048
01:22:11,549 --> 01:22:13,986
- God damn, where did that come from?
- Yes!

1049
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:15,552
Yes!

1050
01:22:15,553 --> 01:22:16,921
Yes!

1051
01:22:20,225 --> 01:22:22,459
I'm telling you, we got some

1052
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,930
round-two action for
y'all! Check this out!

1053
01:22:26,398 --> 01:22:29,033
You wanna slap me and call
me out and flatter me

1054
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:31,335
I hope you won't,
but that'll be a joke

1055
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:32,971
But let's go...

1056
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:37,344
Go for broke, crazy mind...

1057
01:22:38,643 --> 01:22:40,980
- Slam slap...
- Go go!

1058
01:22:55,993 --> 01:22:58,129
Straight out of the adrenaline gym,

1059
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,198
my man Stone

1060
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:02,870
- takin' on Shaw!
- Fight!

1061
01:23:07,306 --> 01:23:08,805
I don't know how he's
gonna walk after that.

1062
01:23:08,806 --> 01:23:10,441
Don't check the kick, come into it!

1063
01:23:10,442 --> 01:23:12,545
Use... cover up! Cover up!

1064
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:19,084
Ow! You're gonna feel that
in the morning, homie!

1065
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:28,495
Over-powered! Where
did that come from?

1066
01:23:33,831 --> 01:23:36,101
Left-foot triangle!

1067
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:43,374
There you go!

1068
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:44,743
That's right!

1069
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,282
Yo, are you seeing this?

1070
01:23:52,284 --> 01:23:56,892
- Let him go!
- Oh ho! Unbelievable!

1071
01:23:58,556 --> 01:24:02,597
It's all over, baby! Michael
Shaw does it again!

1072
01:24:12,937 --> 01:24:14,971
Yo, our next fight

1073
01:24:14,972 --> 01:24:19,414
pits Chino versus Michael Shaw!

1074
01:24:20,878 --> 01:24:23,414
Are you ready, sir?
Are you ready? Fight!

1075
01:24:23,415 --> 01:24:25,318
Here we go, y'all!

1076
01:24:26,717 --> 01:24:28,520
Stay on him! Stay on him!

1077
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:34,160
Got some high kicks there! Oooh!

1078
01:24:36,694 --> 01:24:39,399
- Elbows in!
- Oh, you in trouble now.

1079
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:44,335
Whoo, Chino's mad with it tonight.

1080
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:46,103
Go to the body! Go to the body!

1081
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:48,339
He's got a strong chin!
Go to the body!

1082
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,508
Attaboy! Attaboy!

1083
01:24:50,509 --> 01:24:53,814
Wow! We got a fight here,
ladies and gentlemen!

1084
01:24:55,013 --> 01:24:57,181
Put your weight down on him!

1085
01:24:57,182 --> 01:24:59,853
No, that's too much, man.
He ain't gonna get outta that.

1086
01:25:02,254 --> 01:25:04,256
He's about to tap!
I know he's ready to!

1087
01:25:08,793 --> 01:25:11,095
- Yes! Go!
- Wow, man, he's got life, y'all!

1088
01:25:11,096 --> 01:25:13,130
You gotta hand it to him!

1089
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:14,633
Set up your kicks, Michael!

1090
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:20,740
Yo, you wakin' up tomorrow
mornin' with a headache, homie.

1091
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:25,678
Ahhh oooh!

1092
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:30,449
Don't let go!

1093
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:34,019
Nice, Michael, nice!

1094
01:25:34,819 --> 01:25:37,390
Michael, go go!

1095
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:45,929
Man, that's the heart of
a fighter right there!

1096
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:47,900
Hey.

1097
01:25:57,476 --> 01:25:59,078
Oh!

1098
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:02,079
Really?! What?

1099
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,881
I don't know how he pulled
it off again, y'all,

1100
01:26:04,882 --> 01:26:06,816
- but give it up!
- Yes!

1101
01:26:06,817 --> 01:26:09,889
That right there is Michael Shaw!

1102
01:26:16,194 --> 01:26:19,333
Looks like we got ourselves an
underdog up in here, y'all!

1103
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:22,634
Can you believe this?

1104
01:26:24,136 --> 01:26:26,103
All right, y'all. All right, yo.

1105
01:26:26,104 --> 01:26:28,938
We are down to our
final fight of the day,

1106
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:30,940
one hour to go,

1107
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:34,011
and the only thing coming
in between karate boy here

1108
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:36,913
and 50,000 big ones

1109
01:26:36,914 --> 01:26:39,150
is this motherfucker.

1110
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:42,423
Get up here, homie.

1111
01:26:44,022 --> 01:26:46,157
Yeah, this...

1112
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:49,126
is what you've all
been waiting for...

1113
01:26:49,127 --> 01:26:52,663
a new contender to challenge

1114
01:26:52,664 --> 01:26:54,731
the undefeated reign.

1115
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:57,034
All right, so yo. Y'all
can grab your snacks,

1116
01:26:57,035 --> 01:26:59,803
all right, grab some beers.
Hey, make sure y'all tweet

1117
01:26:59,804 --> 01:27:03,043
about how crazy these fights
have been, all right?

1118
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:11,250
That karate shit?

1119
01:27:12,484 --> 01:27:14,219
Ain't workin' on me, kid.

1120
01:27:15,853 --> 01:27:17,921
Costume's cute.

1121
01:27:17,922 --> 01:27:19,523
But this right here?

1122
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:21,991
This right here is the real deal.

1123
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:23,060
Love you!

1124
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:26,099
Luck got you through
those other guys.

1125
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:30,270
It's gonna take God to
get you through me.

1126
01:27:31,869 --> 01:27:33,970
Just try it, kid!

1127
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:36,241
I'm gonna destroy you.

1128
01:27:38,376 --> 01:27:41,145
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah, let's fight!

1129
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:43,783
- Bring it on, turn it up!
- What's he gonna say?

1130
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:47,019
Hey, man, you gotta say something.

1131
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:54,458
Say something!

1132
01:27:54,459 --> 01:27:57,961
When I was 12 years old,

1133
01:27:57,962 --> 01:28:00,634
I watched my parents die.

1134
01:28:01,932 --> 01:28:03,867
A man walked up to our car,

1135
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:06,940
waving his gun in my father's face.

1136
01:28:08,906 --> 01:28:12,376
And he shot him.

1137
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:15,546
My mother was sitting there,

1138
01:28:15,547 --> 01:28:18,716
just crying,

1139
01:28:18,717 --> 01:28:20,887
pleading for her life.

1140
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:25,456
But that didn't make a difference.

1141
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:28,161
And he shot her too.

1142
01:28:30,695 --> 01:28:32,631
And he never saw me.

1143
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:38,372
But I saw him.

1144
01:28:39,538 --> 01:28:41,508
Remember that.

1145
01:28:49,014 --> 01:28:53,120
Well, hey! Whatever makes the
fight more exciting, right?

1146
01:28:58,824 --> 01:29:00,658
Ha ha ha, kid!

1147
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:03,427
Yo, I don't know where that
deep shit came from, man,

1148
01:29:03,428 --> 01:29:05,995
but people are goin' nuts to
watch you fight this guy.

1149
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:09,233
Hey, we can all walk away with
some serious dough tonight.

1150
01:29:09,234 --> 01:29:11,202
I never doubted you, man.

1151
01:29:11,203 --> 01:29:14,271
- I swear, from the moment I met you...
- Would you excuse us?

1152
01:29:14,272 --> 01:29:17,444
No problem. Do whatcha
gotta do, man.

1153
01:29:24,249 --> 01:29:25,716
This is it.

1154
01:29:25,717 --> 01:29:27,351
How do you feel?

1155
01:29:27,352 --> 01:29:29,687
Good.

1156
01:29:29,688 --> 01:29:31,622
Look at me, man.

1157
01:29:31,623 --> 01:29:34,024
I don't care how big this guy is.

1158
01:29:34,025 --> 01:29:36,026
I don't care how mean he is.

1159
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:37,994
I don't care about his reputation.

1160
01:29:37,995 --> 01:29:40,164
You're gonna beat this guy.

1161
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:42,402
You're gonna do it for them.

1162
01:29:43,802 --> 01:29:45,836
- Right?
- Right.

1163
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:47,974
All right.

1164
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:14,198
Look, I don't know
what this is about

1165
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:16,367
and I don't care.

1166
01:30:16,368 --> 01:30:19,336
But if there's even a hint of truth

1167
01:30:19,337 --> 01:30:21,272
to what that kid is saying,

1168
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:24,578
when you hit, you hit
to put him down...

1169
01:30:25,677 --> 01:30:27,077
for good.

1170
01:30:27,078 --> 01:30:29,079
You understand what
I'm tellin' you?

1171
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,614
I gotcha.

1172
01:30:30,615 --> 01:30:32,583
Dominic! Dominic!

1173
01:30:32,584 --> 01:30:35,422
Dominic! Dominic! Dominic!

1174
01:30:47,098 --> 01:30:50,567
All right, y'all. This is it.

1175
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:53,203
This is the one you've
been waiting for, y'all!

1176
01:30:53,204 --> 01:30:56,973
$50,000 is on the line!

1177
01:30:56,974 --> 01:30:59,176
The final match-up!

1178
01:30:59,177 --> 01:31:02,479
We got Michael Shaw

1179
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,815
takin' on your champion,

1180
01:31:04,816 --> 01:31:08,623
the undefeated Dominic Gray!

1181
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,760
We've got a real David vs.
Goliath here tonight, baby!

1182
01:31:16,761 --> 01:31:19,430
Okay, gentlemen, come
over here, please.

1183
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:20,898
Both of you.

1184
01:31:20,899 --> 01:31:23,267
Protect yourself at all time.
Obey my command at all time.

1185
01:31:23,268 --> 01:31:26,503
If you wanna touch gloves, do it
now and go back to your corners.

1186
01:31:26,504 --> 01:31:29,074
Okay, step back,
guys. Let's do this.

1187
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:33,713
Stay on your toes, man,
and watch your chin.

1188
01:31:35,013 --> 01:31:37,848
Are you ready, sir? You ready?

1189
01:31:37,849 --> 01:31:39,318
Fight!

1190
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:46,757
Move, Michael, move!

1191
01:31:46,758 --> 01:31:49,028
A lotta movement. Attaboy!

1192
01:31:54,165 --> 01:31:56,535
Stick and move! Stick and move!

1193
01:31:58,136 --> 01:32:02,242
Yo, kid, you might as well
just tap out now, man.

1194
01:32:03,009 --> 01:32:05,045
Circle away from the power hand!

1195
01:32:11,349 --> 01:32:13,617
For a guy who saw his mother
get shot in the face,

1196
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:15,755
you hit like a little bitch.

1197
01:32:22,994 --> 01:32:25,399
Don't stand in front
of this guy, Michael!

1198
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,707
Hang in there! Hang in there!

1199
01:32:37,542 --> 01:32:39,745
Get up! Get up, Michael! Get up!

1200
01:32:42,247 --> 01:32:44,515
Stay with him, Michael. Hold him!

1201
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:46,653
Hold him down!

1202
01:32:52,323 --> 01:32:54,458
Stop. Step aside.
Don't do that shit.

1203
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:56,829
Dominic Gray is a bad man!

1204
01:32:58,329 --> 01:33:00,933
Next time you do that
I will disqualify you.

1205
01:33:09,974 --> 01:33:11,577
Sit down, Michael.

1206
01:33:12,343 --> 01:33:14,413
Breathe.

1207
01:33:18,516 --> 01:33:20,018
Deep breaths.

1208
01:33:20,752 --> 01:33:23,520
Michael, look at me. What are
you doing out there, man?

1209
01:33:23,521 --> 01:33:25,056
You fighting out of anger?

1210
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,257
Where's your technique, huh?

1211
01:33:27,258 --> 01:33:29,893
Where's your technique? Everything
we worked on in the gym.

1212
01:33:29,894 --> 01:33:31,662
Remember that, right?

1213
01:33:31,663 --> 01:33:33,464
Punch and move! Punch and move!

1214
01:33:33,465 --> 01:33:35,899
Stay away from him! Don't
get into those clinches.

1215
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,068
Look at me.

1216
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:40,105
You can beat this guy. All right?

1217
01:33:40,106 --> 01:33:42,473
Okay, gentlemen, seconds out.

1218
01:33:42,474 --> 01:33:44,675
All right? Relax.

1219
01:33:44,676 --> 01:33:46,713
- Let's go, guys.
- Stay away from him.

1220
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,985
Fight!

1221
01:34:02,427 --> 01:34:03,962
Watch the spacing!

1222
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,399
Attaboy! Attaboy!

1223
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:15,007
Ha!

1224
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,578
Oooh!

1225
01:34:31,422 --> 01:34:33,091
Breathe!

1226
01:34:43,801 --> 01:34:45,903
Oh! Watch the knees, baby!

1227
01:34:45,904 --> 01:34:48,576
Those things will crack
your skull open, y'all.

1228
01:34:53,978 --> 01:34:55,812
Oooh!

1229
01:34:55,813 --> 01:34:57,716
Damn!

1230
01:35:00,685 --> 01:35:02,352
Go to his legs!

1231
01:35:02,353 --> 01:35:04,188
Good! Do it again!

1232
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:09,361
Ahh!

1233
01:35:10,395 --> 01:35:12,329
Get his legs!

1234
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,765
Break!

1235
01:35:15,134 --> 01:35:17,136
Go back to your corner, sir.

1236
01:35:25,476 --> 01:35:29,047
- Sit down, man, sit down.
- It's beautiful, Michael. Beautiful.

1237
01:35:29,048 --> 01:35:32,252
Why the fuck haven't you
finished this kid already, Dom?

1238
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:34,818
This guy's hurt. He's tired.

1239
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:37,554
- You can beat this guy.
- Talk to me, Dom.

1240
01:35:37,555 --> 01:35:38,855
What the fuck is going on?

1241
01:35:38,856 --> 01:35:41,291
- How's the knee?
- Fuck the knee.

1242
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:43,527
- Fuck this kid.
- Stay on his legs.

1243
01:35:43,528 --> 01:35:45,096
You can beat this guy.

1244
01:35:45,097 --> 01:35:46,763
Look at me!

1245
01:35:46,764 --> 01:35:49,000
You're Dominic fuckin' Gray.
Finish this kid right fuckin' now!

1246
01:35:49,001 --> 01:35:50,867
Make him know what it feels
like to lose everything.

1247
01:35:50,868 --> 01:35:53,770
All right? Now go out
there, finish him!

1248
01:35:53,771 --> 01:35:55,739
- Let's go! Seconds out!
- Put pressure on him.

1249
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,641
Use your power. Use your power.

1250
01:35:57,642 --> 01:35:59,710
Make it quick. Let's go go go.

1251
01:35:59,711 --> 01:36:02,679
Go, sir. You have to get
outta here. Get outta here.

1252
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,348
- Let's go.
- Don't worry about it.

1253
01:36:04,349 --> 01:36:05,809
- Get outta here.
- Yeah yeah.

1254
01:36:11,322 --> 01:36:13,859
Stay in your corner, sir.
Stay in your corner.

1255
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:17,195
Your stool.

1256
01:36:17,196 --> 01:36:19,963
- Hey!
- He fucking grabbed my hand.

1257
01:36:19,964 --> 01:36:22,802
I'm okay. Hey, he's
locking the gate.

1258
01:36:27,139 --> 01:36:29,342
- Give me the key.
- Get the fuck outta here!

1259
01:36:30,475 --> 01:36:32,345
- Hey, watch it!
- Back off, back off.

1260
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:36,483
Michael!

1261
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:43,457
- Michael, what are you doing?
- What the fuck's he doing?

1262
01:36:48,826 --> 01:36:50,662
He's staying in the cage.

1263
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:01,341
Take your time!

1264
01:37:09,747 --> 01:37:11,884
You see this kid?

1265
01:37:21,492 --> 01:37:23,194
Nobody escapes.

1266
01:37:34,273 --> 01:37:36,606
Don't fight it.

1267
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:38,910
Don't fight it.

1268
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:43,351
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

1269
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:47,384
Mama.

1270
01:37:47,385 --> 01:37:49,087
Mom.

1271
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,889
Don't worry.

1272
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:55,762
You'll be with your
Mommy and Daddy soon.

1273
01:37:58,097 --> 01:38:00,564
He ain't gonna wake up.
Yeah, that's it, man.

1274
01:38:00,565 --> 01:38:03,704
Grab your right leg, Michael!
Grab your right leg!

1275
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:13,146
No way! No way!

1276
01:38:26,924 --> 01:38:30,296
No way. I don't know what
I'm seeing, but I like it.

1277
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,270
Ooh!

1278
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:55,654
Oh shit.

1279
01:39:42,034 --> 01:39:43,669
Oh fuck!

1280
01:39:47,139 --> 01:39:49,576
Yeah yeah!

1281
01:39:58,317 --> 01:39:59,850
Crazy!

1282
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:01,554
Hey, go ahead. Do your thing.

1283
01:40:12,431 --> 01:40:14,701
Yeah!

1284
01:40:57,543 --> 01:40:59,643
Loser!

1285
01:40:59,644 --> 01:41:01,279
Loser!

1286
01:41:08,753 --> 01:41:09,886
Hey yo!

1287
01:41:09,887 --> 01:41:12,023
We have ourselves a winner, y'all!

1288
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:13,757
Ha ha!

1289
01:41:13,758 --> 01:41:17,094
Hey, $50,000, y'all!

1290
01:41:17,095 --> 01:41:19,497
Every penny, man.
I'm a man of my word.

1291
01:41:19,498 --> 01:41:21,566
It's just like I said,
"If it comes from Lou,

1292
01:41:21,567 --> 01:41:23,900
you know it's true." Hey hey, look,

1293
01:41:23,901 --> 01:41:26,670
but don't touch, baby. Yeah, hey,

1294
01:41:26,671 --> 01:41:28,406
this is all you, kid.

1295
01:41:28,407 --> 01:41:29,839
You earned it, man.

1296
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,879
It's all you, baby.

1297
01:41:37,782 --> 01:41:39,350
For the dojo.

1298
01:41:39,351 --> 01:41:42,022
- But, Michael...
- Shut up before I change my mind.

1299
01:41:44,356 --> 01:41:45,991
Thank you.

1300
01:41:47,892 --> 01:41:51,632
All the flowers fade

1301
01:41:53,131 --> 01:41:55,966
And the stars pale...

1302
01:41:55,967 --> 01:41:58,269
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1303
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,338
As this bitter beauty...

1304
01:42:00,339 --> 01:42:02,573
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1305
01:42:02,574 --> 01:42:05,746
Grabs you by the tail

1306
01:42:06,811 --> 01:42:09,916
How long will you hesitate

1307
01:42:12,017 --> 01:42:15,219
Halfway up the trail?

1308
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,926
Yeah, it's dark in the trees

1309
01:42:20,858 --> 01:42:24,331
And some wounds never heal

1310
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:27,797
But you're dreaming

1311
01:42:27,798 --> 01:42:31,472
With eyes wide open

1312
01:42:32,571 --> 01:42:36,378
Your heart has spoken

1313
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:41,149
For the first time...

1314
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,960
All right, everyone, line up.

1315
01:42:56,961 --> 01:42:59,597
Fall in, guys. Feet together.

1316
01:42:59,598 --> 01:43:01,401
All the penny wishes...

1317
01:43:02,601 --> 01:43:04,201
Ready?

1318
01:43:04,202 --> 01:43:06,071
One...

1319
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:09,674
two...

1320
01:43:09,675 --> 01:43:11,642
three...

1321
01:43:11,643 --> 01:43:14,815
Splitting at the seams

1322
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:19,654
And you're standing in the doorway

1323
01:43:20,686 --> 01:43:23,925
With your hair all in a mess

1324
01:43:26,224 --> 01:43:29,593
You in all your glory

1325
01:43:29,594 --> 01:43:33,997
Wondering what comes next

1326
01:43:33,998 --> 01:43:36,800
And you're dreaming

1327
01:43:36,801 --> 01:43:41,706
With eyes wide open

1328
01:43:41,707 --> 01:43:45,875
Your heart has spoken

1329
01:43:45,876 --> 01:43:50,818
For the first time

1330
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:55,586
Yeah, you're dreaming

1331
01:43:55,587 --> 01:43:59,856
With eyes wide open

1332
01:43:59,857 --> 01:44:03,898
Your heart has spoken...

1333
01:44:27,952 --> 01:44:29,786
You think they'd be proud?

1334
01:44:29,787 --> 01:44:32,157
They've always been proud.
