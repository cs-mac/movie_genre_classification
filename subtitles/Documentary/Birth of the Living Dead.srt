1
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:22,361
Welcome to a night

2
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:25,231
of total terror.

3
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:33,606
In 1967, a 27 year old
college drop out from the Bronx

4
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:38,978
named George A. Romero directed
a low budget horror film.

5
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,749
Night of the Living Dead!

6
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,119
The film introduced the world
to a new kind of monster...

7
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,455
Persons who have recently died

8
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:55,161
have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.

9
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:57,129
...the flesh eating zombie.

10
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:07,139
This spawned an entire genre
of TV shows and movies, novels,

11
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:13,245
comic books, video games
and zombie conventions,

12
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,848
thriving industries
to this day.

13
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,121
But at the time "Night of
the Living Dead" was made,

14
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,756
I don't think
audiences were ready

15
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,224
for "Night of the Living Dead."

16
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:28,160
It spoke to its audience
in ways few horror films

17
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:29,895
had ever done before.

18
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:32,298
And I think that's why
they were drawn to it.

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,400
The first time you
saw it you realized

20
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:38,838
it was making a place for itself
in a time capsule of some sort.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,608
No movie had that kind
of impact at that time.

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,377
It was this tiny
little movie in Pittsburgh

23
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,146
that seemed to have no chance.

24
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,148
And it, you know,
changed the world.

25
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,286
It was no big thing, man.

26
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,555
Who knew that we were ever even
going to finish this movie.

27
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:58,324
It was just like a bunch
of people getting together

28
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,093
and we were going
to try to make a movie.

29
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:05,431
And none of us knew that it
was ever going to get finished.

30
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,767
Let alone become something
as well-known as it is.

31
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:16,308
George Romero started his first
film production company

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,545
in the city of Pittsburgh
in 1963.

33
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,614
He called it, the Latent Image.

34
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:24,383
♪ It's a beautiful day
in this neighborhood ♪

35
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,552
♪ A beautiful day
for a neighbor ♪

36
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,721
♪ Would you be mine

37
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:30,322
♪ Could you be mine

38
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,358
We all weaned into the business

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,461
on Fred Rogers,
"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood."

40
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:39,632
Almost everybody in Pittsburgh
who works in the biz now

41
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,467
worked for Fred for a while.

42
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:47,206
♪ I have always wanted to have
a neighbor just like you ♪

43
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,909
Romero and his partners
make several short films

44
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,111
for the children's
television series,

45
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:55,114
including
"Things that Feel Soft"

46
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:58,584
and "Mr. Rogers
Gets a Tonsillectomy."

47
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:04,924
Up in the ceiling were
some lights I could see.

48
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:09,695
And the kind eyes

49
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,131
of the people
in the operating room.

50
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:16,769
Even though they wore masks,
I could see their kind eyes.

51
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:19,638
Which remains one of the
scariest movies I've ever done.

52
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:27,146
The Latent Image also finds
opportunity in a new industry.

53
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:30,082
At the time, you know,
commercials were live.

54
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,718
The beer commercials used
to be the sportscaster.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,687
Even when you were
able to drink.

56
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,424
You were actually able to drink
beer on camera in a commercial.

57
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,259
These guys, by the time,

58
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,363
if you went into extra innings,

59
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:48,834
it was like...

60
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,336
And all of a sudden,
we come along and say,

61
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,338
"You know, you can do
this shit on film, man."

62
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,973
When you hit a dry spell,

63
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,908
what's the natural way
to wet it down?

64
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,309
Hey honey! How about a beer?

65
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,844
With a tall, cold Duke.

66
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:03,115
Duquesne beer at the time,
which is no longer.

67
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,619
Great times, great beer,
they go together.

68
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,755
And there's no better beer
for great times than Iron City.

69
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,323
Iron's still there.

70
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,992
Iron! Gimme an Iron!

71
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,160
And how about that
Iron City flavor?

72
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,829
Rich. Robust.

73
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,063
Delicious.

74
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:21,333
I could shoot, I could record,
I was an editor.

75
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:23,469
You know, I wound
up doing it all.

76
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,937
So it was all learn by doing.

77
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,606
I shot more film
at the Latent Image

78
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,009
than I've shot over the course

79
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,279
of all the feature films
that I've made.

80
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,347
I mean, because we were
shooting all the time.

81
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,082
In those days, it was all film.

82
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,385
So, you had to wait for it
to come back from the lab.

83
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:40,686
There were local labs.

84
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,254
They were not that reliable.

85
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:44,623
You'd put your heart
into shooting this stuff

86
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,858
and the guy would
call up and say,

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,861
"You know what,
we fucked it up."

88
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:59,938
But once the film came back,
as long as it looked okay man,

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,674
as soon as the film
walked in the door

90
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,976
I'd sit there
until it was edited.

91
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:08,781
I'd sit there sometimes
36, 48 hours, get it done.

92
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,249
You know I basically
lived there.

93
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:13,952
And I just lived, breathed
and drank the stuff.

94
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,888
No thought
for family or whatever;

95
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,024
I just was, making movies, man.

96
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:22,661
Preview films presents,
"The Calgon Story."

97
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,430
We did this thing called,
"The Calgon Story."

98
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:27,232
It was a knock off
of, "Fantastic Voyage."

99
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,734
Add the Calgon!

100
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,804
And it was the biggest
commercial that we've ever done.

101
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:32,938
It's working!

102
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,673
The grey is gone!

103
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,175
The fibers are clean!

104
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,810
Let's get out of here.

105
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,078
I think I'm in love with you.

106
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,182
And they wanted 35
so we sacrificed our profit

107
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:46,885
and went out
and bought a 35mm camera.

108
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,188
We started to think
that we could actually

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,789
make movies, you know.

110
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,858
When we finally
had the equipment

111
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,027
and we thought we could
make a movie, I wanted,

112
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:00,299
I had this really high minded
idea to this Bergmanesque

113
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:05,104
sort of "Virgin Spring"
kind of a movie.

114
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:08,073
And so I wrote this thing
about two teenagers

115
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,608
in the middle ages.

116
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,778
I mean, boy, talk about reaching
for the moon, right?

117
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,180
Romero's search
for investors for his first

118
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:18,417
feature-length screenplay,
"Whine of the Fawn,"

119
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,419
ultimately failed.

120
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,322
Eventually we abandoned
it and decided to do,

121
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:26,325
maybe we should do something
a little more commercial.

122
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:30,129
And, so we decided
to do a horror flick.

123
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:33,365
And I had read a novel
called, "I am Legend."

124
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,100
A Richard Matheson novel.

125
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:38,504
And it seemed to me that it
was about revolution underneath.

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,784
But we were also
very aware of the time,

127
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,154
you know, and the sort
of anger of the 60s.

128
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,756
The year was 1967.

129
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,465
The U.S. was fighting
an increasingly unpopular war

130
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,066
in Vietnam.

131
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:20,078
At home in the U.S.,
despite historic strides made

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,249
during the civil rights era,
rampant racism still ruled.

133
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:29,588
After suffering continued
unchecked discrimination,

134
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,559
African Americans
took to the streets.

135
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,662
Some called it rioting.

136
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,065
Others called it revolution.

137
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,969
We stand on the eve
of a black revolution, brothers.

138
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:46,472
Masses of our people
are in the streets.

139
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:48,307
They're fighting tit for tat,

140
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:49,808
two for two,

141
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,278
an eye for an eye
and a life for a life.

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,815
The summer of '67 was the summer
of riots in Newark and Detroit.

143
00:07:56,817 --> 00:08:01,153
And the idea of
the "American Ghetto"

144
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,957
really started to take hold
in the public consciousness

145
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,060
as a kind of symptom
of the Civil Rights movement

146
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:10,362
whereas in the 50s
and early 60s

147
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,197
it would have been
lunch counters

148
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,533
and marches in southern
cities and busses.

149
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,168
Now, it was about anger.

150
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,238
There was a good deal
of sort of anger.

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,508
You know, I think mostly
that the 60s didn't work.

152
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,276
You know, we thought
we had changed the world

153
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:27,446
or were part of some
sort of a reform

154
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:32,017
that was going to make
things better.

155
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,552
And all of a sudden
it wasn't any better.

156
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,820
It wasn't any different.

157
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:37,389
Let's get off the street!

158
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,825
Get the lead out of your ass!

159
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:43,829
So I think there was a bit of
rage, a bit of disappointment.

160
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,134
So I invented these characters.

161
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:50,969
In my mind
they were just ghouls.

162
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:52,237
The dead are
coming back to life.

163
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,639
That's the revolution.

164
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,941
That's the big thing
that everybody's missing.

165
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,510
And we just wanted to make
as ballsy a horror film

166
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,078
as we could make.

167
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,114
Romero and nine
other investors --

168
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,850
including several partners
from the Latent Image --

169
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,953
form a new company
called, "Image 10."

170
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:11,857
They rent an abandoned farmhouse
for the film's primary location.

171
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,459
Initially, ten of us
kicked in 600 bucks,

172
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,961
it was enough
to rent the farmhouse,

173
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:18,830
buy some film stock,
and we started to shoot.

174
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,032
We started to shoot not knowing

175
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,914
if we were ever
going to finish.

176
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,040
Romero is 27 years old.

177
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,168
We lived on that farmhouse.

178
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,471
And we had to go out
to the little stream

179
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,307
in order to wash off.

180
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,343
So it was real
guerilla stuff, you know.

181
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:05,978
Talk about dedication.

182
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,879
And everybody went
along with this!

183
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,715
You know, somehow I'd
say, "Okay, guys."

184
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:12,684
It's going to be rough, but,
you know, we'll make a movie."

185
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:15,988
And everybody'd say,
"All right."

186
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,422
Did that surprise you?

187
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,491
It did! It did!
Completely.

188
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,060
I'd expect people to say,
"What are you, crazy?"

189
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:25,263
George Romero's jobs
include cinematographer,

190
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,199
editor, and director.

191
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,267
I didn't know very much then.

192
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,902
What's a director
s'posed to do?

193
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,938
I dunno!

194
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,039
Walk over here!

195
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,308
I think the first time
you try to do anything,

196
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,212
especially when you're trying
to do something new, um,

197
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,581
you're learning on the job.

198
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,551
And essentially everything
that can go wrong will go wrong.

199
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:50,055
Whether it's issues
with cameras or cast members

200
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,824
who really don't have
a lot of experience.

201
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:56,294
Crew members who don't quite
know what they're doing.

202
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,829
I tried to build a clay hand

203
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:01,867
and I tried to leave it hollow
and fill it with blood.

204
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,439
It looks like shit!

205
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:10,275
I mean, it's, it's not great.

206
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:13,812
There were very few independents
being done at that point.

207
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:17,215
And here's a guy
from Pittsburgh, PA,

208
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,017
who gets an idea for a film,

209
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,920
manages to raise
a small amount of money

210
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,955
and just had
the courage, the passion,

211
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:26,725
the persistence to get it done.

212
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,994
It's really remarkable a film

213
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:32,564
that has become such a classic
came out of an environment

214
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:37,302
where everyone was
learning on the job.

215
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:40,005
Many in the cast and crew
take on multiple jobs

216
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,407
to make up for
the lack in budget.

217
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:47,713
Russ Streiner's duties
include producer and actor.

218
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:51,016
John Russo's include
co-screenwriter and zombie.

219
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,785
Initially I had written
it as a short story.

220
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,189
And then I started to adapt
it into a screenplay.

221
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,858
And then we actually started
to have to start to shoot,

222
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,228
so Jack Russo took over
finishing the screenplay

223
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,165
and we collaborated
on it after that point.

224
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:11,436
Karl Hardman is producer,
make-up artist and actor.

225
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:14,239
Marilyn Eastman is
make-up artist and actor.

226
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:17,075
Karl and Marilyn started
this audio production company.

227
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:20,679
And so they provided all
the audio recording equipment

228
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,714
when we made
"Night of the Living Dead."

229
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:26,685
They did the zombie make ups
and were incredibly energetic

230
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:30,388
and just would do any job
that needed to be done.

231
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,659
It was a new impetus
for people to uh,

232
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,462
honestly, to fuck
the system, you know?

233
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:38,964
It's like we can
do this ourselves.

234
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,365
We don't have
to go to Hollywood

235
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,100
with our little script
about zombies

236
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:44,736
that everybody would
never have supported.

237
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:46,271
It's too freaky, uh,

238
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:48,607
they're too busy making
Charlton Heston epics,

239
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,710
you know,
and uh "Mary Poppins."

240
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:54,045
Friends, friends of friends
and colleagues

241
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,814
comprise the rest of the crew.

242
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:00,519
"Night of the Living Dead" was
very much a collaborative work.

243
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,487
There was a sense
of improvisation on the set,

244
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,390
which I think helps the movie.

245
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:07,692
Crews, you know,
it's where it's at, man.

246
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:11,830
I mean, you're reliant
on all these people.

247
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,800
And it's the only way
it happens, ever.

248
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,535
You don't make the movie,
you don't make the movie,

249
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:19,171
you can't go out
and make a movie!

250
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,941
You know, you can't make
this movie without this guy!

251
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:26,478
And look, he's doing it all!

252
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,514
Look, isn't it,
that's what it is, man!

253
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,749
Alright, Vince,
hit him in the head,

254
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,651
right between the eyes.

255
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,319
For many, like investor,

256
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,522
production director
and actor Vince Survinski,

257
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,292
this is their first experience
with filmmaking.

258
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:43,228
Vince Survinski owned
a roller rink in Pittsburgh

259
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,264
and said, "Ah, I always
wanted to get into movies."

260
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,500
Vince was always
a go-to guy.

261
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,968
He would get things done.

262
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,436
We'd all be sitting
around puzzling,

263
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,438
"Oh, this is a great farm house,
but you have to wade

264
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,341
across a stream
to get over there."

265
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,577
So Vince'd say, "Ah, I'll
build a little bridge."

266
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,545
And Goddammit,
with his own hands

267
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,080
he built this
little wooden bridge

268
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,002
that you could actually
drive a car over.

269
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:10,288
Oh, the demolition crew!

270
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,659
Vince's brother, Reg, and he had
a partner named Tony Pantonello.

271
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,094
They used to do fireworks.

272
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,530
They were not the Zambelli's
but, you know,

273
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,599
if you needed some fireworks
down at your church

274
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,267
you called these guys.

275
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,569
They did all
the pyrotechnical stuff

276
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,771
and they were hilarious guys,
I mean, you know.

277
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:29,941
Tony would have this cigar
constantly burning in his mouth

278
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,910
and he's working
putting a fuse together

279
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,912
and he couldn't see very well,
so he's like this

280
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,747
and this cigar and I'm like,

281
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,383
"Tony, you're gonna
blow your fingers off!"

282
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:39,918
They did all the squibs.

283
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,487
Squibwork and the explosives,
and all that.

284
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,460
Actor, lighting person,
and investor Bill Hinzman

285
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:52,898
and John Russo both volunteer
to be set on fire.

286
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,367
Given no protective clothing
they simply agree

287
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,403
to roll on the grass
if they get hot.

288
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:01,206
I think maybe that
was Reg's suggestion.

289
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,576
"It starts to feel hot,
just lie down."

290
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,778
"Want anything from
the supply wagon, Kuss?"

291
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,281
No, we're alright.

292
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,549
Hey, Kass, put that thing
all the way into the fire,

293
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,085
we don't want it
getting up again!

294
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,288
Chief, Chief McClelland,
how's everything going?

295
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,925
Aw, things aren't going too bad,
men are taking it pretty good.

296
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:22,327
You want to get on the other
side of the road over there!

297
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,830
Bill Cardille who was
a TV personality,

298
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:28,633
he came out to be the news guy.

299
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:32,437
And he had to interview
Kuss as the Sheriff.

300
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,773
So, all those lines,
the greatest lines in the movie

301
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:36,641
were all ad libbed by Kuss.

302
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,343
Are they slow moving, Chief?

303
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:41,913
Yeah, they're dead,
they're all messed up.

304
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,853
All that shit was
completely off the cuff.

305
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:53,091
This is Bill Cardille,
WIIC, TV 11 news.

306
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,728
Bill Cardille, almost every
Saturday night he would plug us

307
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,363
and say there are these
guys in Pittsburgh

308
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,365
that are actually
making a horror movie.

309
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,568
And I'm going to go out
and I'm going to appear in it.

310
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,803
So we got a little
bit of a profile.

311
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:07,806
And, because of that profile
I think people believed

312
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:11,276
that we were going to,
probably more than us,

313
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,611
that we were actually
going to finish this movie.

314
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,013
Yeah, Chief, we're going
to stay with it

315
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,748
until we meet up
with the National Guard.

316
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,483
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

317
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,851
You're doing all the work,
why don't you take it.

318
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,220
Bill Cardille came out
and brought the camera guy

319
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:26,024
from Channel 11
and he brought his gear.

320
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,728
The helicopter pilot
for local radio station KQV

321
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,964
lets Russ Streiner ride
with him to get aerial shots.

322
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:38,236
We called the Police,
we got real police

323
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,971
to come out and cooperate.

324
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:43,141
I mean, all we had to do
was call up and say, "Guys!"

325
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,676
And, you know and they
brought the vans out

326
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:46,378
and the dogs
and everything else!

327
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,646
You know, it was amazing
all the cooperation

328
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:49,881
that we used to get.

329
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,949
I mean, it was incredible.

330
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,385
Everybody was sort of with us

331
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,921
because we were trying
to actually make a movie.

332
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:59,457
The dozens of zombies
are played by friends,

333
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,261
family, local townfolk
and clients of Romero's

334
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,998
commercial production company,
the Latent Image.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,635
Most of the zombies were people
we used to work with.

336
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,470
People that, that
were giving us jobs.

337
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:15,473
Advertising people,
a couple of news guys.

338
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,646
A lot of the zombies
were clients of ours

339
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:23,748
from ad agencies.

340
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,052
Humoring us,
saying, "Sure, okay.

341
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,086
I'll come out."

342
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,392
A woman came out and was willing
to appear nude from behind.

343
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:37,095
I don't know if there's any
such thing as a bad zombie.

344
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,064
I mean, I love them all.

345
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,166
But, you know, you get
people who come out.

346
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,802
I mean, if I do anything,
if I make a gesture,

347
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:45,537
if I'm talking
to twenty zombies

348
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,772
and they're all looking at me
saying, "Well, what do I do?"

349
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,007
"Well, you walk
over here."

350
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,444
And if I go like that,
everybody does that.

351
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,113
So, pretty much just say,
"Do whatever you want.

352
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,714
Do your best zombie, man."

353
00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:00,251
And you get some
incredibly creative things.

354
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:03,988
One of the investors

355
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,491
Ross Harris was a meat packer.

356
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,127
So he brought
all these entrails,

357
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,730
so it was pretty rough.

358
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,066
That was all real stuff,
real intestines,

359
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,735
real livers, cow livers.

360
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,508
We wanted to push the envelope,

361
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,444
let's see what
we can do with this.

362
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,280
Just bring out buckets of stuff
and... I'm telling you, boy,

363
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:32,016
people that come to be zombies
they're really dedicated.

364
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:35,286
They'll dig into that
stuff and chew on it

365
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,659
and I'm going, "Oy!"

366
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:44,195
You'll never get me to do that!

367
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,602
That's guts!

368
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,570
It's guts!

369
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,344
When I was gonna show it,
I'm thinking to myself

370
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,946
they're probably just gonna say,
"That sucked Mr. Chris."

371
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,748
Or whatever it may be.

372
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,352
And sure enough, it was the--
it was the complete opposite.

373
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:12,490
It's amazing the impact
that this movie made,

374
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,260
that this guy made--
you know, with no budget.

375
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,228
How it still was important

376
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,731
and how it still resonates
with everyone who watches it.

377
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,834
When they were dead, they, um,

378
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,436
they were acting
like with no muscles,

379
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,238
they had like, to stay.

380
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,239
What's the name of that?

381
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,174
What's the name of that?

382
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:30,341
Starts with "R."

383
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,377
- Riga...
- Who said it?

384
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,346
The whole curriculum I have with
the kids is where they learn

385
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,549
literacy through the process
of making movies.

386
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,550
Rigor mortis.

387
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,817
Say it again.

388
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,952
Rigor mortis.

389
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:41,920
Say it again.

390
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,054
Rigor mortis.

391
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,889
And what happens with that?

392
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:48,159
Christopher Cruz teaches his
literacy through film program

393
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,495
in the Bronx, New York.

394
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,363
George Romero
grew up in the Bronx

395
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,933
before moving to Pittsburgh.

396
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:59,370
And it was the old days
of the Sharks and the Jets.

397
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:03,408
And people, most people
thought I was Italian

398
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,378
so I got away, I think
I got away with my hide,

399
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,747
the Golden Guineas
left me alone,

400
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,983
until they found
out I was Spanish.

401
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,185
Then I was a Shark, you know.

402
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,255
I was never really
into any of that stuff.

403
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,691
I just wanted to make movies.

404
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:29,000
This movie to me
what's so gorgeous,

405
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,169
even the way it starts,
just that road,

406
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,571
and there are different ways
to make horror films,

407
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,840
what I enjoy about this
is that right away,

408
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,842
the music is very disturbing

409
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:42,247
and telegraphs that you're
going to get into something

410
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,983
that's going to be scary.

411
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:47,418
But then, you know,
they go to a graveyard,

412
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,021
and they have their little
dialogue about the length

413
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,924
of the trip and they got
started late and so on.

414
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:54,892
They ought to make
the day the time changes

415
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,060
the first day of summer.

416
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:57,462
What?

417
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,764
Well, it's 8 o'clock
and it's still light.

418
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:02,467
A lot of good the extra
day light does us.

419
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,469
We've still got
a 3 hour drive back.

420
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,304
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

421
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,507
So it's mundane you know,
there's a mundanity to it

422
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,444
and that is um, I think
a very modern approach.

423
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:17,115
It even came following
a bunch of low budget films

424
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:19,417
that basically, like
white girls in bikinis

425
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,252
being chased by guys
wearing shag carpeting

426
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:22,894
being kind of monster.

427
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:27,425
Before "Night," audiences
of horror were accustomed

428
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:31,229
to space aliens,
radioactive mutations

429
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:35,133
and traditional
gothic monsters.

430
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,768
And by not doing
that kind of stuff,

431
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,237
by making it just
as real as possible,

432
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,772
it became this
whole other thing.

433
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,041
It's not even
a haunted cemetery,

434
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,476
it looks like a big open place
where they can park their car

435
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:50,014
and they can go to the grave
and it'll be fine.

436
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,151
It's still spooky, the music
is indicating something to come

437
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:55,987
but it's essentially
a day in the life episode

438
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:57,221
of these characters.

439
00:21:57,223 --> 00:22:00,158
Boy, you used to really
be scared here.

440
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,626
Johnny!

441
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:03,061
You're still afraid!

442
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:06,197
It's to me one of the first sort
of post-modern horror movies

443
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,334
in that it is
commenting on itself.

444
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:12,537
They're coming
to get you, Barbara!

445
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,605
That's what's so brilliant
about that famous line,

446
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,407
"They're coming
to get you, Barbara!"

447
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:20,378
is that he's commenting
on a horror movie.

448
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,513
They're coming for you!

449
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,716
Look, there comes
one of them now!

450
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,484
Now, of course,
years later we have "Scream"

451
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,720
and other films like that,
and they're self-reflexive,

452
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,489
but in this obnoxious
nudge-nudge, wink-wink way,

453
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:32,857
where it's like the audience,

454
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,258
well we've seen all this before

455
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,027
let's make fun
of the characters.

456
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,862
That's not how it
functions in this movie.

457
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:40,631
It functions
as two people, you know

458
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:44,302
the brother is kind of teasing
and scare the sister,

459
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:47,538
and then when it comes true,

460
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,775
to me this is absolutely
stunningly awesome.

461
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,646
Johnny!

462
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:57,482
Help me!

463
00:22:57,484 --> 00:22:59,050
The horror just
came out of nowhere.

464
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:01,719
It just kind of shocked you.

465
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,488
It scared me to death.

466
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,760
It disorients you just right
from the beginning of the movie;

467
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,296
you're being told that places
that shouldn't be very scary

468
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,265
are actually going
to be really scary.

469
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,167
Situations where
you should feel safe,

470
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,668
you're not going to feel safe.

471
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,504
The new horror comes
stumbling towards them

472
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:22,273
which is the zombie.

473
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,475
He really reinvents the zombie

474
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,645
and the zombie becomes one
of the great new monsters.

475
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,719
The image of the zombie
in the cemetery

476
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:38,923
is a key image that we
all felt was so iconic

477
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,559
and we patterned our
zombies for the series

478
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:44,228
"The Walking Dead"
after that zombie.

479
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:51,035
We patterned both in terms
of its kind of gait,

480
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,274
his speed.

481
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:06,184
Not only is it creepy,
but it just seems

482
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:09,520
like it's unrelenting
and it's not going to stop.

483
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,788
Before "Night of
the Living Dead,"

484
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,457
there were movies like
"I Walk with a Zombie,"

485
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:15,026
they were this sort
of tribal character.

486
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,594
Very different.

487
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:21,332
Now, arguably, the zombie is
as important as the werewolf.

488
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,334
But right below the vampire

489
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,703
is probably the most
important horror monster

490
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,939
in the history of scary movies.

491
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:31,609
All these zombies
all go back to Romero.

492
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,378
There's no movie director that's
responsible for the vampire.

493
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,248
There's no movie director that's
responsible for Frankenstein.

494
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,650
There's no movie director that's
responsible for the werewolf.

495
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:41,986
There's people who've
made key movies of that.

496
00:24:41,988 --> 00:24:45,289
But, those are much
older characters,

497
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,192
which have this kind
of literary pedigree.

498
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:51,229
And while there have been
undead and zombies, et cetera,

499
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:54,298
what we know of as a zombie,

500
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,669
the kind of the it's alive
moment of it, was 1968,

501
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,873
George Romero in "Night of
the Living Dead" in Pittsburgh.

502
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:03,941
Dead face!

503
00:25:07,412 --> 00:25:08,713
Hold it.

504
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,047
Don't smile.

505
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,085
Smiling is your enemy.

506
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:16,254
Follow the sound guys!

507
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:30,167
What are George Romero's
rules of zombies?

508
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,235
Aria.

509
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:34,772
That zombies,
they, they walk slow.

510
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:37,041
They drag their feet
when they're walking.

511
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:37,975
Jared, what else?

512
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,744
And they don't smile or laugh.

513
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,412
They don't smile or laugh.

514
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,614
When they're human,
the way they die

515
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,917
is the way they're going
to stay when they're zombies

516
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,652
until they turn into dust.

517
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,120
What is the purpose
of a zombie?

518
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,254
Aria.

519
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,456
They like to eat people.

520
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,158
They don't live
to do anything else.

521
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,193
They just like to eat
and eat and eat.

522
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:58,963
You guys remember what
I said, the need to feed?

523
00:25:58,965 --> 00:25:59,830
Remember?

524
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:00,765
Say it again.

525
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,832
The need to feed!

526
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:02,767
Say it again.

527
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,701
The need to feed!

528
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:04,635
Again.

529
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:05,703
The need to feed!

530
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:07,371
That is it!

531
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:14,845
To me there's something, um,

532
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:17,882
definitive and classical
about the terror

533
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:19,150
and the simplicity.

534
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:21,686
It's not overblown.

535
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,154
She gets in the car,
what do you do?

536
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,455
You undo the clutch.

537
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,791
She goes and she blows it
and runs into the tree!

538
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,793
I mean, oh my God!

539
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:35,499
Every shot does feel
iconic at this point.

540
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:37,935
And I'm speaking of these
first 10 minutes.

541
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:39,503
Every shot is iconic.

542
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,675
It doesn't feel storyboarded.

543
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:48,813
Everything feels organically,
like it's organically unfolding.

544
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,753
She sees the lonely house
in the distance

545
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,489
and that's sort
of another iconic shot.

546
00:27:01,793 --> 00:27:06,864
This to me is one of the great
sequences in any movie.

547
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:17,074
Duane Jones,
a classically trained actor,

548
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,577
played the role
of Ben, the hero.

549
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,879
One of the things amazing
to me when I saw it this time,

550
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,081
and it really blew my mind,

551
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,118
was the fact that no one

552
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,355
reacts to Duane Jones,
or the character

553
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:34,025
as a black man.

554
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,092
It's alright.

555
00:27:35,094 --> 00:27:36,861
There really wasn't
an audition.

556
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,796
Uh, you know, we never
auditioned Duane.

557
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,132
He was just a beautifully
impressive guy.

558
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:44,135
He was a really
beautiful person, too.

559
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,437
The script wasn't written,
the character wasn't described

560
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:50,074
as white, black,
yellow, red, or anything.

561
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:51,909
And we thought we were
doing the right thing

562
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:56,514
by not changing the script
when we decided to use Duane.

563
00:27:56,516 --> 00:28:01,886
Here is a white woman,
very pale, blonde woman,

564
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,689
who runs into a house

565
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:09,393
and is rescued by a black man.

566
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,995
And there's no reaction!

567
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:13,564
There's a pump out here that's
locked, is there a key?

568
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,066
She's out of it, she's scared,

569
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,701
she's frightened,
but not of him.

570
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:21,806
Which in 1968, as strange
as it seems, was still something

571
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,909
that the average audience
really would have noticed.

572
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:29,680
It would have registered to them
as something different.

573
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:32,249
It felt like such a modern
movie in that obviously

574
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,884
it was never remarked
upon that he was black.

575
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,419
Nobody said anything about it

576
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,754
the way they did
in other movies.

577
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,190
And keep in mind,
this was a time

578
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:41,559
when there was
a hugely popular TV show,

579
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:43,527
"The Andy Griffith Show,"
taking place in the south,

580
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,464
and there were
no black people in it.

581
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:49,133
So that to have
this mainstream culture

582
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:53,370
refuse to acknowledge
any kind of black catalyst

583
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:56,340
and to have it there
and not be remarked upon,

584
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,342
it really felt
like a brand new day.

585
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:01,946
I don't think anyone had ever
seen anything like that,

586
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,380
in the 60s.

587
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:06,383
Chiz Schultz produced
television specials

588
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:09,620
starring Harry Belafonte
in the late 1960s.

589
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,489
We had Petula Clark

590
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,325
who was the top
British singer at the time.

591
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,560
And they had a number together.

592
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:18,662
And at one point toward the end

593
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:22,867
Harry links arms with Petula
and they sing the final verse.

594
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,202
And we finished
dress rehearsal.

595
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:30,174
And the man in charge of
advertising for Chrysler said,

596
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:34,445
"Belafonte cannot
touch Petula Clark."

597
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:37,548
And we were sort of in shock.

598
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,417
And Belafonte said, "I'm not
sure I understood you."

599
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:43,220
He said, "There will be
no touching of Miss Clark."

600
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:46,791
Remember, we have to sell
cars in the South."

601
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:49,293
And Harry said,
"Give me just a minute."

602
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,396
And he called
the president of Chrysler.

603
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,132
And he said, "You should know
I'm calling a press conference

604
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:57,835
in 10 minutes
to say that Chrysler

605
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,639
will not allow me
to touch Petula Clark."

606
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,974
We went into air time.

607
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,442
The taping.

608
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:08,045
Harry and Petula linked arms.

609
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:10,614
But that was not unusual.

610
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,516
That was the atmosphere
at the time.

611
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:16,320
We were only a year past
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"

612
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,589
which had made its
entire subject

613
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:21,125
the shockingness
of inter-racial marriage.

614
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:24,361
Mom, this is John.

615
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:31,035
Doc, Doc, Doctor Prentiss.

616
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,638
I'm so pleased to meet you.

617
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,874
I'm pleased to meet
you, Mrs. Drayton.

618
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,044
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"
was criticized for taking pains

619
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,346
not to offend white moviegoers

620
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:46,483
and for being out of touch
with the racial storms of 1967.

621
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,219
And it never occurred
to me that I might fall

622
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,620
in love with a Negro!

623
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:52,389
Of Sidney Poitier's character,
H. Rap Brown said:

624
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:59,563
This kind of criticism
wasn't new to Poitier.

625
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,466
I remember watching
Sidney Poitier

626
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:06,136
in the Stanley Kramer film,
"The Defiant Ones."

627
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:08,405
And, uh, it was him
and Tony Curtis

628
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:13,210
playing these two convicts
who escape from the chain gang,

629
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:16,080
and near the very
end of the film,

630
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,616
they're trying to get
to this rail road, right?

631
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:25,222
But Tony can't
hold on, he can't,

632
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:27,191
the train's moving too fast.

633
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,593
So instead of Sidney
lets Tony drop,

634
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,462
Sidney falls off, too.

635
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:32,897
And then you see
the last scene,

636
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:36,934
and Sidney's cradling
Tony Curtis in his arms,

637
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,036
and he starts
singing this song.

638
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:45,509
♪ If I ever do see his face once
more, he never get home again ♪

639
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:48,279
Cradling Tony, you know,
as the law enforcement people

640
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,780
come down on them.

641
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,315
And I remember
thinking back then

642
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:53,717
when I was 15, 16 years old,

643
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,886
Sidney, you crazy, man?

644
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:57,755
Let that white man go.

645
00:31:57,757 --> 00:32:00,324
Save yourself, you know.

646
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:03,193
Because it was like,
he was always becoming, at,

647
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:09,366
by that time, he was becoming
sort of like this, this savior.

648
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:12,703
African American heroes
in the mid-60s in movies

649
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:15,372
were allowed
to be really smart,

650
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,975
they weren't necessary
allowed to be aggressive

651
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,044
or strong or tough.

652
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:22,413
I mean, Poitier started
to break that barrier

653
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,015
in "In the Heat of the Night,"
but the most he could do

654
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:27,985
was slap a white man
in the face

655
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,388
after he is slapped in the face
by that white man.

656
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:37,361
Poitier played a detective
who in this scene

657
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:41,865
dared to interrogate
a rich white man.

658
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,968
You saw it.

659
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,302
I saw it.

660
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:48,572
The slap was
an electric moment in 1967.

661
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:52,509
Then all of a sudden
Duane Jones is like the lead,

662
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:55,279
basically in
an all-white film.

663
00:32:57,782 --> 00:33:01,952
But he comes across as a very
strong, focused character.

664
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:06,623
Duane was very upset whenever
he had to do anything violent.

665
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,226
He's a, you know, very
sensitive kind of a guy.

666
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:11,061
And what's a really
telling scene

667
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,197
is when he slaps the women.

668
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,369
It's even more intense
than when Sidney

669
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,572
hits what's-his-name
in "In the Heat of the Night."

670
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:22,940
He really slapped her.

671
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:26,210
Particularly, "I'm going
to slap a white woman"

672
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,412
and shoot a white guy.

673
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:31,749
"And uh, I'm going
to be in trouble!"

674
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:34,218
And then when
he shoots the guy!

675
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,286
You know, he shoots the guy!

676
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:39,323
I said, "This is a bold
black man for 1967!"

677
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:40,557
Very bold.

678
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,693
You would never put
"Night of the Living Dead"

679
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,295
on the spectrum
of blaxploitation

680
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:47,531
and black power movies
that started to happen

681
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,299
in the late 60s and early 70s,

682
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:52,036
but in a way,
you know, it really,

683
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:54,571
it precedes "Shaft,"
it precedes "Superfly,"

684
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:56,206
it precedes all those movies

685
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,976
where the African American
main character

686
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:01,245
was suddenly
no longer accommodationist

687
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,047
and exceptional and polite.

688
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,149
He's black.

689
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:07,051
He's brutal.

690
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,419
He's boss.

691
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,723
But, you know,
tough and empowered.

692
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:15,526
And of course we discussed it,
and Duane, as I said,

693
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:19,563
was the most sensitive
among us to the racial issue

694
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:23,734
and how some of that
stuff might resonate.

695
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:25,702
We said, "Well, wait,
it was in the script

696
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,738
before the guy
was black."

697
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,642
And, but he was saying, "Well
yeah, but he is black now!"

698
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:33,677
And so you have
to think about that.

699
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,813
And as I said,
I've in recent years

700
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,148
come to the thought that maybe
we should have explored

701
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,951
the racial issue a little bit.

702
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:44,488
We thought we were being really
hip by not changing the script.

703
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,523
I think it's also
what made the movie

704
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:49,126
feel like it belonged
to another generation.

705
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,829
That sense of not
wringing its hands

706
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,631
and having to talk,
stop for a moment,

707
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,734
they're all being pilloried
by zombies and saying,

708
00:34:57,736 --> 00:35:00,370
"You know, Ben,
when I was a boy,

709
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:02,673
we had a colored maid
and she never worked

710
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:03,841
as hard as you
did for us."

711
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:06,543
I mean, by not having
a scene like that,

712
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:10,180
it felt exciting and new.

713
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:12,382
It truly did.

714
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,917
Hold it!
Don't shoot!

715
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:14,985
We're from town.

716
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,587
A radio!

717
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,555
One great thing about
"Night of the Living Dead"

718
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:21,725
is that it doesn't resort
to the cliché of like,

719
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:24,528
well, everybody would put
aside their differences

720
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,730
in the face of such
a big threat.

721
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:28,098
How long you guys
been down there?

722
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,600
I could've used
some help up here.

723
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:31,001
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

724
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,537
Which is this hokey thing
that horror movies

725
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,606
and sci fi movies still do.

726
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:40,577
That no matter, you know,
how much you may differ

727
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:43,514
in real life, all that's
going to get cast aside

728
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,681
because you have
to fight the monster

729
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:46,049
or fight the alien or whatever.

730
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:47,284
The cellar.

731
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:49,019
The cellar, there's
only one door, right?

732
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,788
Just one door, that's
all we have to protect.

733
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,958
Tom and I fixed it so it locks
and boards from the inside.

734
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,660
But up here, all these windows?

735
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:58,996
Why, we'd never know where
they were going to hit us next!

736
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,864
You got a point,
Mr. Cooper.

737
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:03,000
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

738
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:04,835
Romero actually suggests that,

739
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:07,070
nope, it's going to be embedded

740
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:09,406
even in the way
you choose to fight,

741
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,708
even in where
you choose to hide.

742
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,977
But the cellar is
the strongest place.

743
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,712
The cellar is a death trap.

744
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:18,749
Who you are in real life
is going to absolutely affect

745
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:22,786
how you treat this threat
and how you see this threat.

746
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,589
You put people in this
incredibly extreme circumstance

747
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,525
and, you know, what kind
of society do they create?

748
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,227
And that's the heart
of "Night of the Living Dead."

749
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,329
You two do whatever you like.

750
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,464
I'm going back down
into the cellar

751
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,133
and you better decide!

752
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:37,801
Because I'm going
to board up that door

753
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:39,836
and I'm not going to unlock it
again no matter what happens!

754
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,907
Some parts of the movie
almost play like Beckett.

755
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,442
You know, that sense
of what happens

756
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:46,910
when you trap people together

757
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,512
and they just have
to deal with themselves.

758
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:51,281
And that sense of anticipation

759
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:54,585
and knowing that
there's no place to go.

760
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:59,723
Then slowly there's
cracks in the crevices

761
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:00,991
and the hands
start coming through,

762
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,527
and they're trying
to get the hands out.

763
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:06,096
And he shoots the guy
a couple of times.

764
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:10,567
The guy won't die until
he shoots them in the head.

765
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:13,070
To kill them you need
to chop off their heads.

766
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,171
Or what?

767
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:16,006
Or just shoot them
in the brain.

768
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,875
Because the way they
work is by the brain.

769
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:22,779
Usually you have
to throw fire so that,

770
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:26,049
so that you can save
yourself or someone else.

771
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:27,684
Then, they see the news report.

772
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:28,986
It's on!
It's on!

773
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:31,154
We've never had the budgets
to really explore

774
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:35,926
that this is
a worldwide phenomenon.

775
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:37,661
We did it mostly with media.

776
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,830
What they were hearing
on the radio and on the TV.

777
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,565
Otherwise it was
all the farmhouse.

778
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:42,933
The wave of murder
which is sweeping

779
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:44,668
the Eastern third of the nation

780
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,970
is being committed by creatures

781
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:50,107
who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.

782
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,409
Chuck Craig was
an actual newsman.

783
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:55,045
The guy that has most
of the airtime in the movie.

784
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:57,881
First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development

785
00:37:57,883 --> 00:38:00,450
came from people who were
understandably frightened,

786
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,818
and almost incoherent.

787
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,086
Wrote his own copy.

788
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,822
Read the script and we sat
around and we bullshat

789
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,924
about the concept
of what was going on.

790
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:10,694
It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,

791
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:12,329
but it does seem to be a fact.

792
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,765
That stuff has a ring
of authenticity about it

793
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,567
because Chuck did it himself.

794
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:20,737
The kind of low key realism
of those broadcasts

795
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,307
of those newsrooms
absolutely is intended

796
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,843
to situate the movie
in reality.

797
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,046
That sort of unfiltered
sense of nobody's

798
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:30,614
spinning the news,
just reporting it.

799
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:33,917
It's saying that if this
were happening in your town,

800
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,887
this is what your newscasts
would look like.

801
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:39,623
Major contact came
in a pre-dawn attack...

802
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,591
I think the newscasts
that were created

803
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:44,494
for "Night of the Living Dead"
are in sync with the kind

804
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,397
of newscasts that I was seeing,
my generation was seeing

805
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:50,400
on television, when we used
to watch Morley Safer

806
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:53,603
out in Vietnam
in the bush and stuff.

807
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:57,207
Vietnam was America's
first televised war.

808
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,975
And while the networks
systematically

809
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:01,044
downplayed the bloodshed,

810
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,980
viewers, for the first
time in TV history,

811
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,917
got glimpses of what
war was really like.

812
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:11,221
I think the news coverage
of the Vietnam war was unlike

813
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,190
news coverage from ever before.

814
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:16,460
I remember just
the amount of dead.

815
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:19,329
All law enforcement agencies
and the military

816
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:20,964
have been organized
to search out

817
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,100
and destroy
the marauding ghouls.

818
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:24,935
Particularly, when you
saw the vigilantes

819
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:26,503
get prepared and stuff.

820
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:28,238
It made me think of
the stuff I would see

821
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,309
on the television and stuff
of the Newark riots, of Watts.

822
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:33,443
This was all happening, man.

823
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:35,512
You saw National Guard
on the street,

824
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:36,813
you saw looting and stuff.

825
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:39,583
So it all was very
reminiscent of that stuff.

826
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,786
I mean, it was obviously
of those times.

827
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:45,422
I grew up in Detroit in 1967
and I remember that summer

828
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,823
being terrified.

829
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:49,826
There's a famous story about
a house in my neighborhood that,

830
00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:51,561
somebody was hanging
out in their house.

831
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,563
There were a bunch of,
you know, National Guardsmen,

832
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,365
which was teenagers
with guns who'd probably

833
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,001
been jacked up on coffee
and up for two days in a row.

834
00:39:58,003 --> 00:39:59,269
There was a guy lighting
a cigarette hiding out

835
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,405
in an attic, they thought
somebody fired a gun,

836
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,140
and hundreds of rounds

837
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,442
of ammunition were
expended on this house.

838
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,878
That this guy wasn't killed
was a complete miracle.

839
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,347
I mean, they shot
the house up so much,

840
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,516
it almost took
the top of it off.

841
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,484
And so to see that
stuff in a movie.

842
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:18,789
And also to see that stuff in
a movie with a black guy in it.

843
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,759
It was like a welt of social
consciousness in filmmaking.

844
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:23,994
There were so many
things I don't think

845
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,929
anybody could ever do again.

846
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:27,931
In other words, you feel that
the radiation on the Venus Probe

847
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,800
was enough to cause
these mutations?

848
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,435
There was a very high
degree of radiation.

849
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:32,903
Just a minute.

850
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,838
I'm not sure that
that's certain at all.

851
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,040
Big traditional institutions,

852
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:41,378
whether it's the government or
the army or network television

853
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,249
are utterly unable
to be counted upon,

854
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:48,552
not only counted
upon to stop it

855
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:50,787
but counted upon
even to explain it.

856
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:55,325
Um, so, there's this
great sense of just,

857
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,627
and this is very 1968,

858
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,997
great sense of the complete
ineffectuality

859
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:05,268
of any institution that
purveys itself to you

860
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,703
as being trustworthy.

861
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:08,872
I must disagree with these
gentlemen presently

862
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:12,042
until this is
irrefutably proved.

863
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:14,177
Everything is being
done that can be done.

864
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,446
I think there's one other big
departure from convention,

865
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:19,149
specifically from horror
convention, which is that

866
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,818
if that movie had been
made 10 years earlier

867
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,387
or even 5 years earlier,

868
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:28,425
there would've been,
like, a voodoo potion...

869
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:31,328
Combining voodoo witchery
with the most advanced

870
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,630
of medical sciences.

871
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:39,302
Or a curse, or an evil
professor, or an incantation.

872
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:42,339
Genius or madman?

873
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:44,975
Romero sort of tosses
that all aside.

874
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:48,812
You don't ever get an official
confirmed explanation

875
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:49,913
of what's happening.

876
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:52,883
God changed the rules.

877
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:57,120
That's the only explanation
that I, that I need.

878
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:58,722
No more room in hell.

879
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,259
You can see what it is,
you can't see why it is.

880
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:06,763
It's so indeterminate that
you can't protect yourself.

881
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:11,134
And you're not given
anything of why it is

882
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:13,770
that would make you more
comfortable watching it.

883
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:16,840
And it doesn't matter to me.

884
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,174
It's happening.

885
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:20,911
And probably, at least
in my mythology,

886
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,846
it's some sort
of permanent condition.

887
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:25,282
I don't know. Unless we
redeem ourselves somehow.

888
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:28,652
Stay tuned to the broadcasting
station in your local area

889
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:30,487
for this list
of rescue stations.

890
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:33,957
Maybe we can get to the safe
shelter, get gas in the car.

891
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:37,027
Look for the name of the rescue
station nearest you

892
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:40,997
and make your way to that
location as soon as possible.

893
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:42,098
So we have that truck.

894
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,600
If we can get some gas
we can get out of here.

895
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,335
This is great
story logic, you know,

896
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,238
great plot unfolding
and great story logic.

897
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,606
There's a key on here
that's labeled

898
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,374
for the gas pump out back.

899
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:53,510
So they said, "We have
the key," right?

900
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:56,680
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

901
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:59,182
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

902
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,318
So then they create
this diversion

903
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,688
with the Molotov cocktails.

904
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,090
And you see, I remember
this, right?

905
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:11,995
Duane and the guy run out,
get in the car.

906
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:15,699
The girl now, she panics,
she doesn't want

907
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:16,766
to be without the boyfriend.

908
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,902
She runs and jumps
in the car, right?

909
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:20,270
They get to the gas tank.

910
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:21,204
Come on!

911
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:23,173
This key won't work.

912
00:43:23,175 --> 00:43:25,609
Duane, pow!

913
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:27,811
Shoots the look off.

914
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:32,515
Watch the torch!

915
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:35,118
So they've had the problem with
the gasoline's soaking the car.

916
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,653
I hate it when that happens.

917
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,422
Um, but they're aware,

918
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:41,391
they need to get out of that
frickin' truck.

919
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:42,659
So they're getting out
and then she says,

920
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,194
"Oh, my sweater's stuck!"

921
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:46,129
Come on, come on!

922
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:47,364
My jacket's caught.

923
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:48,565
And you're like,
"Your sweater's stuck?

924
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,266
What, that's it!"

925
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:51,234
Boom.

926
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:57,474
It's understanding how
to portray the little,

927
00:43:57,476 --> 00:44:00,276
the little things that can go
wrong that really can screw you

928
00:44:00,278 --> 00:44:02,612
in this sort of scary
environment,

929
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:07,350
giving it an incredibly
timeless and special quality.

930
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:11,821
And they start
devouring the meat.

931
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:14,624
But then you see that
they're growing in force!

932
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:17,260
So, earlier Duane says
only 8 or 10 zombies

933
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:19,329
becomes 16 zombies,
then 20 zombies.

934
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:22,832
It grows and grows.

935
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:25,902
Once you saw the violence,
once you saw the extent

936
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:30,640
they were gonna go
to show the gore,

937
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:33,476
the audience at the time said,
"Well, if they're gonna show"

938
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:37,047
a kid chomping on her father,
and they're gonna show it

939
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,682
in this detail, you know,

940
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:40,150
"what else are they
gonna show me?"

941
00:44:40,152 --> 00:44:41,785
And that's terrifying.

942
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:45,588
This film and the structure,
the morality,

943
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:49,192
who lives and who dies is
not based on whether you're

944
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,795
a good person, whether you
work hard or fight hard.

945
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:01,971
I mean a child killing
her mother, that is the violence

946
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:04,374
that we're experiencing
in that scene,

947
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:08,778
moreso than someone being
attacked by a trowel.

948
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,747
That scene is just devastating

949
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,751
because the mother
is very adoring.

950
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,556
That remains one of the most
shocking things I've ever seen.

951
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:23,693
And I'll tell you what, it's
not because you see the gore.

952
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:25,195
What's beautiful is the sound.

953
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:27,697
The knife never
touches the flesh.

954
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,837
And when they break
through in that last scene,

955
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,039
the girl's trying to stop 'em.

956
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:36,906
And they break in.

957
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:38,749
And the brother with the glove?

958
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,478
No, get out!

959
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,114
No!

960
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,482
No, no!

961
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:48,318
When Barbara gets it
from her own brother,

962
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,757
this irony is so profoundly,
it's disturbing,

963
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:56,559
and once again,
it's not deserved.

964
00:45:58,262 --> 00:46:00,797
When you play with
the expectations

965
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,000
of the classic structure,
and then you defy them

966
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:06,536
and the wrong person
gets killed.

967
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,938
This is what's upsetting,
that's what haunts,

968
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,541
that's what creates
a feeling of dread.

969
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:15,678
I mean, we've lost
various of our heroes

970
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,114
along the way,
but Ben is still at it,

971
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:21,284
and there's that scene when
he has to go into the basement.

972
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:23,787
I mean, he's fought
this whole time about

973
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:27,357
not going down there,
or that it's a last resort.

974
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,593
And when you realize that's
what he's going to do.

975
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:39,102
It's just an incredibly
horrific shot of all the zombies

976
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:42,972
just busting in, they've
broken through the membrane.

977
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,141
In the time that "Night
of the Living Dead" came out,

978
00:46:45,143 --> 00:46:48,678
you don't feel safe
in your home anymore.

979
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,246
You know, it's--

980
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:52,916
There are things
that are overtaking us

981
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:56,786
over which we have no control
and there's that fear

982
00:46:56,788 --> 00:47:00,390
and I think that the zombie
apocalypse takes inspiration

983
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:05,094
from that fear and it's why
audiences connect with it

984
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:09,165
in a way that is not quite
obvious on the surface

985
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,901
but is really in the subtext.

986
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:16,906
It's an unsettling
element of the movie

987
00:47:16,908 --> 00:47:21,678
that the people who seem
most likely to be able

988
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,981
to thwart this incursion
of the living dead

989
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:27,617
look like a lynch mob.

990
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,786
The resonance for people
who would have spent

991
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:31,321
the last 10 years

992
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:37,093
watching white southerners
vow to prevent

993
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:41,297
the desegregation of schools,
for instance, um,

994
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:44,934
it would've been
really pretty clear.

995
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:47,370
And dogs in "Night
of the Living Dead,"

996
00:47:47,372 --> 00:47:49,672
there's a very specific
cultural resonance.

997
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:52,675
You know, black men
being chased by dogs

998
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:57,647
is one of the ugliest images
of the civil rights movement,

999
00:47:57,649 --> 00:48:02,619
and was very much part of
the national visual vocabulary

1000
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:05,588
of any moviegoer,
other than a very little kid,

1001
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,724
who would have gone
to see this movie.

1002
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:12,228
And again, it connects
to this, this idea that

1003
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,166
it's not as simple as
the good guys vs. the undead.

1004
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:22,305
There are the good guys,
the not good guys,

1005
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:24,774
and the living dead.

1006
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,910
They seem to be getting
a certain amount of pleasure

1007
00:48:26,912 --> 00:48:30,246
out of putting down these
monsters and being able

1008
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:35,184
to go out and hunt people
and lynch people.

1009
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:37,353
They seem really real to me.

1010
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,188
They felt real, those guys.

1011
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,457
I wasn't sure they were actors.

1012
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,764
It's a really interesting,
squirmy political aspect

1013
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:50,366
of the movie that's
intentionally unsettling.

1014
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:54,337
I think Romero wants you to feel
uncomfortable with the fact

1015
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:57,941
that the so called victors
at the end of the movie

1016
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:02,445
are exactly the kind of people
you're inclined not to root for.

1017
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:05,448
You! Drag that on out of here
and throw it on the fire.

1018
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,649
Nothing down here.

1019
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:08,751
Alright, go ahead
and give him a hand.

1020
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:09,919
Let's go check out the house.

1021
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:12,388
There's something there.
I heard a noise.

1022
00:49:16,894 --> 00:49:18,061
Alright Vince,
hit him in the head.

1023
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:20,063
Right between the eyes.

1024
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,833
Good shot.

1025
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,869
That was the ironic ending.

1026
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:29,539
He refuses to go downstairs,
finally he survives

1027
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,773
by going downstairs,

1028
00:49:30,775 --> 00:49:34,344
then when he comes back up
he gets gunned down.

1029
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,347
'Cause he's mistaken
for one of the living dead.

1030
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,348
Okay, he's dead.

1031
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,449
Let's go get him.

1032
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:41,250
That's another one
for the fire.

1033
00:49:41,252 --> 00:49:45,154
So, yeah, that ending was there
before we ever cast Duane.

1034
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:49,292
And that was
the only time for me,

1035
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:51,728
I, I put a racial thing to it.

1036
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,565
You know, like, they saw him,
he didn't yell out,

1037
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:57,767
he was a black man,
and they shot him.

1038
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:01,637
My favorite scene was when,

1039
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:06,376
probably when
the African man got shot,

1040
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,244
when he wasn't even a zombie.

1041
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:12,448
I thought they should know
if he's a zombie or not,

1042
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:16,853
because if they knew he was
a zombie, they would have,

1043
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,988
the zombie would have
attacked them already

1044
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,323
and walked toward them.

1045
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:25,294
But all he did was stand
up and they just shot him.

1046
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:32,402
A lot of people talked
about that as a lynching

1047
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,438
and saw a political
thread in it.

1048
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,609
I think it's more of a shock
in terms of the way it violates

1049
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:44,347
your sense of narrative
expectation than,

1050
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:46,082
uh, politically.

1051
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:50,019
When our protagonist does get
shot, utterly arbitrarily,

1052
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:53,122
I think that's way
beyond a racist issue,

1053
00:50:53,124 --> 00:50:56,159
that's Romero just
speaking from the times

1054
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:59,028
about a bleakness that
the culture was suffering.

1055
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,264
If he had survived,
it would have been dishonest.

1056
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,934
I mean, even as a kid
and I was, you know,

1057
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,202
propping my eyes open
with toothpicks

1058
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:09,105
trying to sleep a couple
of nights after.

1059
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:13,576
It felt like that was the most
honest thing to do.

1060
00:51:13,578 --> 00:51:16,446
You know, it's a tradition
in films that you can escape.

1061
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,980
There's always the idea
you can escape.

1062
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:22,985
You might leave your past if
you were involved with the mob,

1063
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:25,688
you would leave and you'd
have a new beginning.

1064
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,157
It's a tradition all
the way back to Homer!

1065
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,725
The new beginning.

1066
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:31,694
You go home
and you start again.

1067
00:51:31,696 --> 00:51:33,930
You refresh
and you start again.

1068
00:51:33,932 --> 00:51:35,698
But, of course,
the apocalyptic filmmakers

1069
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,066
take that away from you.

1070
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:37,900
No.

1071
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:39,168
Tomorrow may not come

1072
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,436
the way you're planning on it.

1073
00:51:40,438 --> 00:51:41,971
You may not have
another chance.

1074
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,073
The only reason to do
the fantasy film

1075
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:47,610
or the horror film
is to sort of upset the order,

1076
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:49,812
upset the balance of things.

1077
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:53,216
And it seems to me, seemed to me
that the formula was always

1078
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:54,817
to restore order, you know?

1079
00:51:54,819 --> 00:52:00,056
Put it back the way it was,
which seems, you know,

1080
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:03,826
counterproductive to what
you're doing initially.

1081
00:52:03,828 --> 00:52:06,929
And, which is why it
made sense to me to have,

1082
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:09,265
you know, "Night
of the Living Dead"

1083
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:12,135
have this sort of tragic
and ironic ending.

1084
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:19,809
The credits roll seconds
after Ben's death.

1085
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:24,080
It's shockingly blasé
and detached.

1086
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:26,682
It's as businesslike
as anything else in the film.

1087
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:31,320
It may be the most emotionless
horror film of all time.

1088
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,124
If it had been Sidney Poitier
in the movie,

1089
00:52:35,126 --> 00:52:37,426
he would have done that thing
and wave to everybody,

1090
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:38,594
thrown his trench coat
over his shoulder,

1091
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,263
and walked off
into the distance

1092
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:43,065
as the haunting love theme
by Loulou piped into theaters

1093
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:45,701
reminding us of the feat
he accomplished.

1094
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:50,973
Um, and you know, that's,
it just felt so right.

1095
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:52,542
It was the thing that was
probably more exciting

1096
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,443
to everybody, when I
finally called the people

1097
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:56,078
who did see it,
"Wasn't it great

1098
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,514
that he does everything
and then gets shot?

1099
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:00,816
Not only gets shot,
but right in the head!

1100
00:53:00,818 --> 00:53:03,619
So it's not like
you miss it."

1101
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:09,559
It's completely terrifying
and the perfect ending.

1102
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,094
Randy, light these
torches over here.

1103
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:20,336
You really offered no comforts
to the audience at all.

1104
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:26,809
No. But there's always
the refreshment stand!

1105
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:33,382
Principal photography for
"Night of the Living Dead"

1106
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:37,086
wrapped in November of 1967.

1107
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,756
As Romero edited, the search
for investors continued.

1108
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:42,692
And at first people
had no faith that we could

1109
00:53:42,694 --> 00:53:44,460
actually make a movie.

1110
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:45,828
And it was only
when we were able

1111
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,600
to actually show some dailies
and people saw that lips

1112
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:55,471
were in sync
with the sound, um,

1113
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:57,807
and they were able to say,
"It looks like a movie!"

1114
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:00,343
And we'd say, "That's what
we're trying to tell ya!

1115
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:03,379
One of these days it's gonna
grow up to be a movie!"

1116
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:08,451
And, uh, you know,
so money dribbled in,

1117
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,152
over the course
of several months.

1118
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:11,754
And we were never certain
that we were ever

1119
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:14,056
going to get enough
to finish it.

1120
00:54:14,058 --> 00:54:16,392
We didn't have money
for the sound mix.

1121
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:18,327
So Russ Streiner
challenged the guy

1122
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:20,997
who owns the lab
to a chess match,

1123
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:23,032
and at stake was the sound mix.

1124
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:24,900
And Russ beat the guy!

1125
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:27,370
And won the sound mix!

1126
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:30,973
So this was the kind of shit
that we were going through, man.

1127
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:48,624
In January, 1968,
Vietnamese Revolutionary Forces

1128
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:52,261
mounted a coordinated attack
on over 100 South Vietnamese

1129
00:54:52,263 --> 00:54:56,966
cities and towns, including
the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

1130
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:02,571
It was called the Tet Offensive
and it brought

1131
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:04,674
some of the most disturbing
images to date

1132
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,743
to prime time television.

1133
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:09,979
For many, the war
seemed more dangerous

1134
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:12,214
and pointless than ever.

1135
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:16,085
Still, it would
continue until 1975.

1136
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:22,658
President Lyndon B. Johnson
seemed better at facing facts

1137
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,227
when it came
to domestic policy.

1138
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:27,663
He commissioned a study
to investigate the causes

1139
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:30,266
of the nation's race riots.

1140
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:33,736
An unflinching wake-up call,
the Kerner Commission Report

1141
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:35,237
warned that,

1142
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:44,180
Regarding the ghetto,
it stated:

1143
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:53,789
And while "black militancy"
may have added fuel

1144
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:56,659
to the riots,
the primary cause was:

1145
00:55:58,528 --> 00:56:02,231
We are moving toward two
societies, separate and unequal

1146
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,401
and if something isn't
done to stop this

1147
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,938
in a very determined manner
things can really get worse.

1148
00:56:10,774 --> 00:56:12,875
A few days later
"Night of the Living Dead"

1149
00:56:12,877 --> 00:56:15,111
was finally completed.

1150
00:56:15,113 --> 00:56:18,681
Image 10 still needed
a distributor for the film.

1151
00:56:18,683 --> 00:56:21,217
With the hope of finding
one in New York City,

1152
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,585
Romero and Streiner

1153
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,287
pick up the first finished
print from the lab.

1154
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,689
Threw it in the trunk
of the car.

1155
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:31,093
Finished answer print,
drove it to New York

1156
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:33,295
to see if anybody
wanted to show it.

1157
00:56:33,297 --> 00:56:36,766
And Russ and I are
driving to New York

1158
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,033
and we hear on the radio

1159
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:41,036
that Martin Luther King
had been assassinated.

1160
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:45,908
And you know, of course we
have this sort of angry film

1161
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,878
that, you know, has
this 60s stuff in it,

1162
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,916
we had a black lead,
Duane, and, you know...

1163
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:58,454
Several distributors
considered the film.

1164
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,990
It did not ignite
a bidding war.

1165
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:05,060
I think Romero was working
against all kinds of prejudices

1166
00:57:05,062 --> 00:57:07,696
against what he
was trying to do.

1167
00:57:07,698 --> 00:57:11,400
A, if you've never made a film,
you can't make a film.

1168
00:57:11,402 --> 00:57:13,169
You've got to have a whole
succession of films

1169
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:15,271
in order to make a film.

1170
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:19,008
Uh, I think he was working
against the fact of you have

1171
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:23,479
to have millions of dollars
to make a feature film.

1172
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,447
Well, you don't.

1173
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:27,883
The movie only cost $114,000.

1174
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:30,953
Um, that's a very,
very low budget now.

1175
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:33,656
It was also a very,
very low budget then.

1176
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,059
I think in '67,
the average studio movie

1177
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:40,729
probably cost about three
or 3.5 million dollars.

1178
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:43,833
So $114,000 is nothing.

1179
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,968
The movie's in black
and white at a moment

1180
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,205
when just about
everything in movies

1181
00:57:49,207 --> 00:57:50,840
had switched over to color.

1182
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,443
A black and white movie
in 1968 was less playable.

1183
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:56,712
Theaters were less
interested in booking it.

1184
00:57:56,714 --> 00:58:01,050
Um, of course he was working
with a cast of unknowns.

1185
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:04,753
That adds up to a very tough
set of circumstances,

1186
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:09,058
especially when you're
effectively rebooting a genre

1187
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,229
that hasn't done much
for the last several years.

1188
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:15,064
Columbia, I think, was
the first place we went to

1189
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:16,665
and they actually held
it for a little while

1190
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:19,268
and it looked as if they were
really seriously thinking

1191
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,769
about releasing it.

1192
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:23,105
Columbia turned it down.

1193
00:58:23,107 --> 00:58:26,909
American International Pictures,
known for low budget biker,

1194
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:31,680
psychedelic, and Roger Corman's
Edgar Allan Poe movies,

1195
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:34,583
said they'd release it,
but under one condition.

1196
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:37,319
They wanted to change
the ending and they said,

1197
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:42,191
"It's just too dark,"
and, you know, so,

1198
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,827
we boldly said, "Fuggetaboutit!

1199
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:47,496
This is our movie!"

1200
00:58:47,498 --> 00:58:50,432
And we walked, and we never
got the time of day

1201
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:52,601
from anybody else for a while.

1202
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:58,173
And we finally hired, someone
recommended a sales agent,

1203
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,577
um, you know, somebody
who's business it is

1204
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,381
to go and, you know,
try to find distribution.

1205
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:07,950
And so we hired this
guy and he took it,

1206
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:11,053
and eventually got
a deal with Walter Reade.

1207
00:59:11,055 --> 00:59:13,556
"Night of the Living Dead"
was first released in theaters

1208
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:17,660
and drive-ins
on October 2nd, 1968.

1209
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:21,764
When we first saw
"Night of the Living Dead"

1210
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,632
we went to a drive in
to watch it.

1211
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,701
It was the first time we said,

1212
00:59:25,703 --> 00:59:28,237
"It really is a movie,
isn't it?"

1213
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,738
'Cause we were able
to go to the drive in

1214
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,043
and buy some dogs and some
popcorn, check out

1215
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:35,377
"Night of the Living Dead."

1216
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:37,580
"Night of the Living Dead"
in New York was treated

1217
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:39,615
as a grindhouse movie,

1218
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,116
and it was booked
as a grindhouse movie.

1219
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:43,686
It played on the New Amsterdam
theater on 42nd Street,

1220
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:49,792
which was like a 7th run,
a bad theater.

1221
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,294
New York's 42nd Street
was the epicenter

1222
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:55,664
of the grindhouse circuit.

1223
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:59,001
These are all exploitation films
that have no artistic ambition.

1224
00:59:59,003 --> 01:00:02,004
You can't escape the shock.

1225
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:04,740
I'm going to give you the time
of your life, baby.

1226
01:00:04,742 --> 01:00:06,375
That have no political meaning.

1227
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:09,845
That are--are probably
morally bankrupt.

1228
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:11,447
I'm going to kill you!

1229
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:12,848
Night...

1230
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,084
"Night of the Living Dead"
honestly was the kind of movie

1231
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:18,187
that critics mostly dismissed.

1232
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:20,022
...of the Living Dead.

1233
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,124
It was in a very
disreputable genre.

1234
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:27,062
Horror was a dirty business
right next to porn,

1235
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:30,766
uh, in terms of how the movies were
made, how they were financed,

1236
01:00:30,768 --> 01:00:33,135
where they were shown
in drive ins.

1237
01:00:33,137 --> 01:00:35,804
Variety called
"Night of the Living Dead" an:

1238
01:00:38,308 --> 01:00:39,308
which:

1239
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:49,284
Anyone who did review it
reviewed it in that way.

1240
01:00:49,286 --> 01:00:52,855
You know, sort of
really angrily.

1241
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,791
It was dismissed in
the New York Times, um,

1242
01:00:55,793 --> 01:01:00,195
in a tiny, tiny review
by Vincent Canby.

1243
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:03,432
Canby's 3 sentence
review began with:

1244
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:22,518
He writes in this tone
that he can't really believe

1245
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,722
that he's been dispatched to
have to write about this thing,

1246
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,258
and probably had to go
spend a miserable day

1247
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:33,028
at the New Amsterdam theater on
42nd Street sitting through it.

1248
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,101
Along with
the grindhouse circuit,

1249
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:42,037
"Night" was booked
for afternoon matinees.

1250
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,541
Throughout the 60s,
horror movies,

1251
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:49,445
fan magazines and toys were
marketed primarily to children.

1252
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:52,214
You'll cringe in terror

1253
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:55,617
when you see our
Screaming Mee Mee Show.

1254
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:59,555
In 1968, parents felt safe
dropping their kids off

1255
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:03,292
for an afternoon
of "horror."

1256
01:02:03,294 --> 01:02:05,394
Their most recent experience
would have been something

1257
01:02:05,396 --> 01:02:08,497
like the Roger Corman,
Vincent Price,

1258
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,132
Edgar Allen Poe adaptations,

1259
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:13,635
which were fun and they
were even a little scary,

1260
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:15,604
but they were basically
horror movies

1261
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,807
which you could
almost take kids to.

1262
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:21,744
So, here comes
"Night of the Living Dead."

1263
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:26,148
I can't imagine what children,
by the time you get to

1264
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:31,353
the, the sort of flesh feast
where they're eating,

1265
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:32,688
whatever they're eating.

1266
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:37,993
And this naked, uh, zombie
staggering toward the house.

1267
01:02:37,995 --> 01:02:41,864
You were like, way out
of the realm of anything

1268
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:43,499
that had happened in horror.

1269
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:48,003
Critic Roger Ebert attended
one of these matinees.

1270
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:50,973
He wrote
in the Chicago Sun-Times:

1271
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:28,443
It was so many people
running out of the theater

1272
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:30,779
in the hallway of the movies,

1273
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,881
that was the first movie
I ever seen people

1274
01:03:32,883 --> 01:03:34,216
running out the movie.

1275
01:03:34,218 --> 01:03:35,751
I remember the girl
that was in front of us,

1276
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:38,887
she put the coat over her head
and was running out, falling.

1277
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:41,456
The name of the theater
was called, "Adams."

1278
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,959
It was in Newark, NJ,
downtown Newark.

1279
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,461
I had to be 10, my oldest
brother had to be 11,

1280
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:49,231
and he cried worse than all
of us, and my younger brother,

1281
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,365
it didn't bother him.

1282
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:52,668
As of today,
he likes scary movies.

1283
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,504
I might have been 13...
12, 13?

1284
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:56,872
The drive in movie was

1285
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,074
the Whitestone Drive In
in the Bronx.

1286
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:04,646
The part where the little girl,
she's, like, eating the father.

1287
01:04:04,648 --> 01:04:07,883
That was, like,
really horrible!

1288
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,086
It took me a long time
to get to sleep at night.

1289
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:14,523
And when the lights was
off it was hard for us.

1290
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:17,192
You know, I remember
a few times I wet the bed

1291
01:04:17,194 --> 01:04:19,628
because I was scared to get
up to go to the bathroom

1292
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,496
because I always thought that
the "Night of the Living Dead"

1293
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:22,998
was in the other room.

1294
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,801
You feel so, like, "Oh, my God,
they're coming..."

1295
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:28,570
They're going to come
to get me and eat me up!"

1296
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:31,206
An abridged version
of Roger Ebert's review

1297
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:35,310
was published nationwide
in Reader's Digest magazine.

1298
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:38,780
In spite of this warning to
parents, the film did so well

1299
01:04:38,782 --> 01:04:41,083
that the National
Association of Theater Owners

1300
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,584
selected it as their

1301
01:04:42,586 --> 01:04:45,587
"Exploitation picture
of the month."

1302
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,890
It was playing at, like,
in the Drive-In circuit

1303
01:04:47,892 --> 01:04:50,626
and it wasn't the first
run film in the bill,

1304
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:54,029
it was the last film,
so consequently it was on late

1305
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,198
when everyone was
asleep in the car.

1306
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,002
Elvis Mitchell first saw "Night"
when he was 10 years old

1307
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:02,204
at a drive-in
in Detroit.

1308
01:05:02,206 --> 01:05:04,773
The sheer excitement
of seeing a movie like that,

1309
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:09,344
as terrifying as it was,
it felt like it belonged to you.

1310
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:11,647
You know, it felt like this
generational shift

1311
01:05:11,649 --> 01:05:12,981
in filmmaking.

1312
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:15,717
If there had been more
resources devoted to the movie,

1313
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:18,320
and more consideration,
and if it wasn't like

1314
01:05:18,322 --> 01:05:19,922
run and gun filmmaking,

1315
01:05:19,924 --> 01:05:23,292
if it wasn't like hearing
Public Enemy for the first time,

1316
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,593
or for my parent's generation

1317
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:27,429
seeing Elvis Presley
for the first time.

1318
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:30,933
It's just that kind of, oh,
my God, that electricity.

1319
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:43,412
In 1969, Walter Reade
re-released "Night"

1320
01:05:43,414 --> 01:05:44,913
on a new double bill.

1321
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:46,748
They played it
with "Slaves?"

1322
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,551
I mean, I couldn't
believe that.

1323
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:49,851
You know? What?

1324
01:05:49,853 --> 01:05:52,387
"Slaves"
and "Night of the Living Dead?"

1325
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:53,722
How does that connect?

1326
01:05:53,724 --> 01:05:55,324
But it was at this
double-feature

1327
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,993
where George Abagnolo,
critic for Andy Warhol's

1328
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,896
ultra-hip "Interview" magazine,
saw "Night."

1329
01:06:00,898 --> 01:06:02,497
He wrote:

1330
01:06:08,004 --> 01:06:10,372
And when the film got
to Europe in 1970,

1331
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:13,275
the prestigious French film
journal, "Positif," called it:

1332
01:06:16,646 --> 01:06:18,547
Of course, the moment
that stuff starts happening

1333
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:20,082
then everybody over here says,

1334
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:22,150
"Well, maybe I should
take a look at this."

1335
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:25,988
A bunch of people jumped
on the bandwagon, Rex Reed,

1336
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,055
and all that.

1337
01:06:27,057 --> 01:06:28,857
And Roger did a Mea Culpa

1338
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,326
and said he didn't
understand it.

1339
01:06:31,328 --> 01:06:33,428
Roger Ebert would later write:

1340
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,402
The Museum of Modern Art
in New York played "Night"

1341
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:42,571
to a standing-room-only crowd.

1342
01:06:42,573 --> 01:06:44,306
The film would
eventually become part

1343
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:46,575
of its permanent collection.

1344
01:06:46,577 --> 01:06:49,644
But, uh, then that whole
copyright issue came up

1345
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:53,181
and that was the end of that.

1346
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:56,118
When Romero and Streiner were
shopping their film around,

1347
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,756
its original title was,
"The Night of the Flesh Eaters."

1348
01:07:00,758 --> 01:07:04,059
And we put the little
copyright bug,

1349
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,229
the c with circle around it,
on the title.

1350
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,663
It was over
a live action picture,

1351
01:07:08,665 --> 01:07:11,967
of one of the early shots
of the car in the cemetery.

1352
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:13,702
And when they put
the new title on,

1353
01:07:13,704 --> 01:07:15,904
which was their title,
"Night of the Living Dead,"

1354
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,140
the copyright thing came off.

1355
01:07:18,142 --> 01:07:20,575
And they never noticed
that there wasn't one,

1356
01:07:20,577 --> 01:07:22,477
and that's the way it is.

1357
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:25,180
And people all around
the world said,

1358
01:07:25,182 --> 01:07:28,183
"Wait, there's no copyright
on this movie anymore!"

1359
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:31,620
So, basically,
it became public domain.

1360
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,425
Stupid mistake!

1361
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,560
Image 10 received no royalties

1362
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:41,730
for the huge ticket
sales in Europe.

1363
01:07:41,732 --> 01:07:43,965
Their attempt to sue
the distributor ended

1364
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:47,102
when Walter Reade
filed for bankruptcy.

1365
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:50,505
Pirated copies of "Night"
played worldwide.

1366
01:07:50,507 --> 01:07:53,909
It's impossible to know
how much money it's made.

1367
01:07:53,911 --> 01:07:55,210
End the war!

1368
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,545
End the war!

1369
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:58,313
End the war!

1370
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:01,016
As the war grinded
on into the 1970s,

1371
01:08:01,018 --> 01:08:03,051
so did
"Night of the Living Dead,"

1372
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:06,121
its midnight shows making it
a cult institution.

1373
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,623
You want to own it,
you want it to belong to you.

1374
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:11,860
Uh, you want to believe
there's a part of pop culture

1375
01:08:11,862 --> 01:08:15,063
that still kind of comes
through the back door,

1376
01:08:15,065 --> 01:08:19,067
that isn't heralded
and isn't having all of its fun

1377
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:21,303
taken out of it
before it gets to you.

1378
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,172
Um, and that's one
of the things that

1379
01:08:24,174 --> 01:08:25,574
that movie really had.

1380
01:08:25,576 --> 01:08:27,776
And for a long time.

1381
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:30,912
And as history unfolded,
events seemed to vindicate,

1382
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:34,483
time and again, "Night's"
suspicion of authority

1383
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,218
and unmitigated bleakness.

1384
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,722
All these things made
you think, "Oh, my God."

1385
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:42,023
I'm not alone!"

1386
01:08:42,025 --> 01:08:44,893
Finally, you almost feel
like Ben, there are other,

1387
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:47,329
there are like-minded people,
there's this cult

1388
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:48,964
of other people
out there like me,

1389
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:52,934
or people who know how
to fold this into a movie.

1390
01:08:52,936 --> 01:08:55,170
You wanted,
you wanted to see that.

1391
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,973
For the British Film Institute's
"Sight and Sound,"

1392
01:08:57,975 --> 01:09:00,041
Elliot Stein wrote:

1393
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:16,024
You know, 1968 was a moment
when everybody was reading

1394
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,493
political messages
into every film

1395
01:09:18,495 --> 01:09:20,562
and I think it
is a political movie.

1396
01:09:20,564 --> 01:09:22,864
And one reason that "Night of
the Living Dead" works so well

1397
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:27,836
is because everyone in America
thought some version

1398
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,206
of this country
is going to hell.

1399
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,241
The lunatics are taking over.

1400
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:37,445
Conservative, older people
thought that, and progressive,

1401
01:09:37,447 --> 01:09:40,582
young people thought that that
had been true for a long time.

1402
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:44,986
And on that political front,
the movie plays perfectly

1403
01:09:44,988 --> 01:09:46,388
to both audiences.

1404
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:51,159
"Night of the Living Dead"
metaphorically, in a funny way,

1405
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:55,230
were all these fears rising
up and coming at them.

1406
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:59,634
And they weren't coming
at heroes or wealthy people,

1407
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:02,437
they were coming
at the common American.

1408
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:05,807
I mean, the young woman
who plays the lead.

1409
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:08,210
The couple who's in the house.

1410
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:11,913
They're just that average
working class American.

1411
01:10:11,915 --> 01:10:14,482
And here were these
fearful things coming

1412
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:17,719
to not only kill them
but to eat them!

1413
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:21,556
So, it fulfilled I think a kind
of pervasive fear that existed

1414
01:10:21,558 --> 01:10:25,126
in the country at the time
among normal working people.

1415
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:30,799
There was a sense of chaos
and sense of tension, you know,

1416
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:32,834
in the American fabric,
you know,

1417
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:35,036
which means things
were going to change.

1418
01:10:35,038 --> 01:10:36,871
So I think that what
Romero was doing

1419
01:10:36,873 --> 01:10:39,474
with "Night of the Living Dead"
sort of points to you know,

1420
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:40,909
this unraveling.

1421
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:44,045
It's the unraveling of
everything we like to believe

1422
01:10:44,047 --> 01:10:47,749
is our comfort zone
and our safety.

1423
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:53,088
"Night of the Living Dead's"
cynicism and ferocious intensity

1424
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,590
was reflected in many
of the films that followed

1425
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:57,859
in the 1970s.

1426
01:10:57,861 --> 01:11:00,695
Like "Night," these films
shattered all the things

1427
01:11:00,697 --> 01:11:04,833
that kept us safe
in traditional Hollywood movies.

1428
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:07,602
Heroism.

1429
01:11:11,274 --> 01:11:13,275
Teamwork.

1430
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:16,544
Science.

1431
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:21,816
Young love.

1432
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:26,988
The patriarchal family.

1433
01:11:31,927 --> 01:11:33,928
The media.

1434
01:11:35,264 --> 01:11:37,265
The government.

1435
01:11:39,835 --> 01:11:42,337
And the police and military.

1436
01:11:45,741 --> 01:11:48,310
There's really a fragility
to our society,

1437
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:50,712
and then you realize well
in fact I must guard it,

1438
01:11:50,714 --> 01:11:52,080
I must be vigilant.

1439
01:11:52,082 --> 01:11:55,150
And then you get in to why
horror stories can actually have

1440
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:58,653
a positive, uh,
message if you will,

1441
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:01,456
a positive effect
which is to say:

1442
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,225
Here is a cautionary tale.

1443
01:12:04,227 --> 01:12:06,494
Do not take anything
for granted.

1444
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:12,534
Because one day a zombie might
wander up, and you may make fun

1445
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,103
of the person who's afraid
but they could be right,

1446
01:12:15,105 --> 01:12:17,839
and then things might
go from bad to worse.

1447
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:20,875
They're coming
to get you, Barbara!

1448
01:14:25,634 --> 01:14:28,870
And you've got "Zombie
Number One" Bill Hinzman.

1449
01:14:34,877 --> 01:14:37,679
Started it all 40 years ago.

1450
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,647
My role in "Night
of the Living Dead"

1451
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:43,184
was the "graveyard zombie."

1452
01:14:43,186 --> 01:14:48,423
And the graveyard zombie scene
was the last scene that was shot

1453
01:14:48,425 --> 01:14:52,861
and throughout the film,
I was a crewmember, of course,

1454
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,831
and an investor in the film,
and throughout the film

1455
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:59,601
I was jumping in to fill
a part as a zombie.

1456
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:03,238
I was tall, skinny,
and had an old suit, uh,

1457
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,639
so, it was pretty appropriate.

1458
01:15:04,641 --> 01:15:08,776
But anyway, when the time came
to film the final scene

1459
01:15:08,778 --> 01:15:10,879
George says, "You really
look good as a zombie",

1460
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:12,380
do you want to do
the graveyard zombie?"

1461
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,382
I said, "Yeah, sure."

1462
01:15:16,418 --> 01:15:19,587
You know, sometimes,
I really do blush, I think,

1463
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:20,755
under the make-up, you know,

1464
01:15:20,757 --> 01:15:22,290
because it's really kind
of embarrassing.

1465
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,493
I, I'm sure you've heard
the stories of actors

1466
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:27,795
are always afraid
they're gonna get discovered

1467
01:15:27,797 --> 01:15:30,265
that they don't have
any talent or anything.

1468
01:15:30,267 --> 01:15:32,934
And, it's like,
sometimes I feel that way.

1469
01:15:32,936 --> 01:15:35,937
I'm a little embarrassed
sometimes because, you know,

1470
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:39,207
every Sunday night I got
to take the damn garbage out,

1471
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:41,576
and on the way out I'll go,
"I'm a legend!"

1472
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:45,413
What the hell am I taking
the damn garbage out for?

1473
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,916
"Why aren't I rich?"

1474
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,752
But that's, that's life!

1475
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,620
But it's so much fun
to do these things.

1476
01:15:52,622 --> 01:15:56,591
You know, just, especially if
I'm depressed about something.

1477
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,026
My wife kicks me out
every once in a while

1478
01:15:58,028 --> 01:15:59,294
and says, "Go to one
of those events.

1479
01:15:59,296 --> 01:16:00,695
Get your ego built
back up again."

1480
01:16:00,697 --> 01:16:02,297
"Okay."
