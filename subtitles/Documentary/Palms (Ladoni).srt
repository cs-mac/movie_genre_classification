Rome. Year 28
after the Crucifixion of Jesus

00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,955
Emperor Nero outlaws Christians

Kishinev. Year 1990
after the birth of Christ

6
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,558
He said he was not going
to move from this place

7
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:58,322
until the coming
of the Kingdom of God.

8
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:03,565
"But to make it happen
I should fulfil the following -

9
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:08,880
"I should make the inside
like the outside

10
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:13,761
"and the left arm
like the right arm,

11
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:18,318
"and the left cheek
like the right cheek.

12
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:23,037
"And when I make a hand
instead of the hand,

13
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:27,086
"and eyes instead of the eye,

14
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,398
"and a face instead of the face...

15
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:35,526
"And when I make legs
instead of the leg,

16
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:39,441
"and a back instead of the back,

17
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:43,839
"and a head instead of the head...

18
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:48,318
"And when I make a man
and a woman into one,

19
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:52,036
"so that a man is not a man

20
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:56,279
"and a woman is not a woman,

21
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:00,159
"then the Kingdom of God will come."

22
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:18,438
My little son, it's me,
your father talking to you.

23
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,164
You haven't yet been born.

24
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:26,683
You've been living in darkness
for a month now.

25
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:34,766
My little son, you see,
your mother is not my wife.

26
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:40,921
And it's not in my power
to promise you'll stay alive.

27
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,238
But I still want you
to know everything.

28
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:49,401
Only a short time ago
everything was so good.

29
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,842
Whatever I set about
would work out splendidly!

30
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,207
People were falling in love with me.

31
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,801
And I was using their kindness.

32
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,046
Money seemed to stick to me.

33
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:11,119
And my mother and father
waited for me in vain

34
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,675
so many a night.

35
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,727
Everything seemed perfect to me.

36
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,760
And today it has all changed.

37
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:28,756
My cards show total darkness.

38
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:35,605
My little son,
I'm closing my eyes

39
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,205
to see you.

40
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,243
Chapter I

41
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:47,400
BED AND CLOTHING

42
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:53,482
Your mother is not my wife.

43
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:58,004
And it's possible that very soon
you'll be scraped out of her womb.

44
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,964
Piece by piece.

45
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,363
Never mind. Can you hear me?

46
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:10,885
Nothing will ever change the fact
that today you exist.

47
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:16,200
And I, your father,
can talk to you.

48
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:20,758
Because there are things
nobody else will tell you about.

49
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:26,437
I'll take you to the city.
You shouldn't be sad.

50
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,795
Everything is divine in nature,

51
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:34,517
and I do regret
it took me so long to grasp it.

52
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:39,118
Soon, this will be razed
to the ground.

53
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:42,085
This district will be destroyed.

54
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,601
And these people
will be forcefully taken

55
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:50,444
to shelters, prisons
and lunatic asylums.

56
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:03,320
When it's not raining,
this woman is lying on the ground.

57
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:05,602
She's been lying here
for as long as 40 years.

58
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:11,045
40 years ago, on this spot,
she was waiting for her groom.

59
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,118
He never came.

60
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:17,564
Then she made a bed
for two and lay down.

61
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,400
She said,
"I've been fighting on my own

62
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:23,763
"for 40 years
against the whole system.

63
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,645
"I'm lying down
and collecting chances.

64
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:31,197
"I deliberately
don't undertake anything.

65
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:34,006
"It's better if I collect my chances

66
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,875
"until the chances reach
their critical mass

67
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,481
"which will lead to an explosion,

68
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,526
"to the second coming of Jesus."

69
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,517
Those who didn't
have a place on Earth

70
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,802
would come to live here.

71
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:04,395
And those who were destined to die,

72
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:08,162
but survived and had children.

73
00:09:11,847 --> 00:09:15,078
My little son,
can you hear me?

74
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,635
Can you hear me?

75
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:24,081
It is very important for me
to know that you exist.

76
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,721
If only you knew

77
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,844
how much I want
to take you to people.

78
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,326
I will show you how humans dress,

79
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,404
and how their bodies work.

80
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:44,075
We'll move along,
step by step,

81
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:49,400
as we have no idea when we are going
to see each other again.

82
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,717
Indeed,
you and I need the same thing.

83
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,596
We need salvation.

84
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,722
And if your life is spared,

85
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:05,924
then you will have to live
in the system.

86
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:12,285
Years will pass, and you will
start thinking of how to leave it.

87
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,799
The first way to reach salvation

88
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,037
is to go mad.

89
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:22,802
Simply, to go mad.

90
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:28,245
I'm offering you this way to
salvation, sincerely, as your father.

91
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,444
To go mad.
Not out of hopelessness, no.

92
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:36,840
It's a chance. But you can
only use it in a physical sense.

93
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:42,561
Or you can do as this woman,
make a bed on the ground,

94
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:47,004
and lie down
and make love to Jesus Christ.

95
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:54,159
Literally ten steps away
from the woman lying on the ground

96
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:57,637
an old man is working.

97
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:02,437
He walks around town,
and people throw old clothes at him.

98
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:06,883
He also has a girl with him.

99
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:11,483
He found her in the street
when she was pregnant

100
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,445
and didn't have a place to live.

101
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,118
They put the old clothes
into a press,

102
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,483
and sell them
to the state for a pittance.

103
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,881
This is not the only type of clothes
they have.

104
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,003
There are also those left
from the dead.

105
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:34,558
After a funeral, people give him
the clothes of the dead.

106
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:38,083
They store these clothes,
but never sell them.

107
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,841
They arrange these clothes
from the dead

108
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,236
like a wall around their house.

109
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:48,764
Some of the clothes are hospital
pyjamas with numbers on them.

110
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:54,126
They are from people who
died in a psychiatric institution,

111
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,358
from loneliness and injections.

112
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,801
Their pyjamas were to be burned,

113
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,243
but he took them
and brought them to his place.

114
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:20,921
He said,
"I learn from these clothes."

115
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,876
And in return, he whispers
something to them about his own love.

116
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:37,604
He's even become able to tell
when someone is about to die,

117
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,201
and their clothes are brought here,

118
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:42,482
to become part of this wall.

119
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:51,206
Once he gave a dress from a dead girl
to his apprentice as a present.

120
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:56,557
It was the first time
a man had given her a present.

121
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:00,162
That's why she doesn't feel
any jealousy towards the dead.

122
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,762
More so, the girl believes him,
her teacher,

123
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:10,400
that these clothes belong
to those who are already in Heaven.

124
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,483
Not long ago, he admitted to her

125
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,276
that both his legs
were soon to be amputated.

126
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,326
First the left one,
then the right one.

127
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:40,163
The girl with the flute said
that when she was still healthy,

128
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,238
she didn't want to study.

129
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,642
She cried.

130
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:53,843
She cried because she was a girl
and could not become a priest.

131
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:59,479
She said, "If I were a priest,
I would have grown my hair.

132
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:04,641
"It would be long and wavy and
as beautiful as the priests' hair."

133
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:13,561
My little son, in childhood
I also wanted to become a priest,

134
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:20,284
to be allowed to have long hair,
as long as a girl's hair.

135
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,038
Chapter II

136
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:38,199
LIFE ON THE SWAMP

137
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:45,604
I don't want us to leave this place.

138
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:49,123
If you decide to go around
the woman on the floor,

139
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:53,166
you will see a door,
a door in the ground.

140
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:57,237
A young man lives there.

141
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:01,725
He escaped from a mad house,

142
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:05,038
and came to live here,
with these people.

143
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:09,245
In the hospital they called him
a Pithecanthropus,

144
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,761
a prehistoric man.

145
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:15,476
Until one day
he gnawed through his veins.

146
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:21,686
And when blood was flowing
from his body

147
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:26,602
and he was already asleep,
a naked boy appeared to him and said,

148
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:29,759
"Get up, calm down,
go and live with these people.

149
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:36,878
"You will get up with them
every morning and see how they live.

150
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:42,277
"You should watch.
Let it be of no concern to you

151
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:45,007
"that you can't speak or work.

152
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:47,965
"You don't need to do either.

153
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,243
"You will start to speak later

154
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,637
"when people have exhausted
all combinations of words,

155
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,922
"and eaten up their own language.

156
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,885
"That will be the time
for you to speak.

157
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:06,164
"And while you are on this earth,
just watch.

158
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,238
"Watch and don't be afraid.

159
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,603
"Don't be afraid
that you can't change anything

160
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:16,283
"as you don't know your silence
and what it is like.

161
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:25,163
"And you can't see the body
of your silence.

162
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:49,639
"You are looking at a girl.
You like her.

163
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,235
"But even her body is not comparable

164
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,239
"with the body of your silence.

165
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,603
"Your silence has a body

166
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,076
"and everyone needs it.

167
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,963
"You will start to speak later

168
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,083
"when people have lost
the gift of speech

169
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,237
"because of shame and fear.

170
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,358
"Meanwhile, looking at people

171
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,041
"will submerge them in your silence.

172
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,918
"The time will come

173
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:20,283
"when people will extract
new words from your silence.

174
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,881
Completely new."

175
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:30,161
Old people bring him food right here

176
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,717
because he comes out of the cellar
only on Sundays.

177
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,321
He is afraid that on weekdays
he could be caught,

178
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:39,205
and taken back to hospital.

179
00:17:57,447 --> 00:18:01,440
The other day
the ragman lost one leg.

180
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:06,123
Half of what he told his apprentice
has come true.

181
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:12,036
Soon he'll lose his second leg.

182
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:35,000
Life on the swamp starts
from the moment a child wakes up,

183
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:39,046
gets up from bed
and steps on the water.

184
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:48,563
I won't tell you why I brought you
to this place, or give you a reason.

185
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,476
Because you don't have
to have any reasons.

186
00:18:54,447 --> 00:19:00,317
You can simply understand me better
when next to these children.

187
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:06,557
And I will probably feel
like being closer to you.

188
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,356
There are two doors in the cellar

189
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,722
where the runaway lives.

190
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:19,483
One door faces the south side
where the children live.

191
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,161
And the other faces the north side

192
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:24,397
where the old people live.

193
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,963
Apart from old people
and children,

194
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,039
there should be
ordinary adult people here.

195
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,687
But some had to leave
and earn money.

196
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:37,646
Others are in prison,
or have been sectioned.

197
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:42,517
That's why today there are
only children and old people here.

198
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:02,077
One of the boys and his sister
have turned 13.

199
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,406
Every week he asks his sister
to cut his hair.

200
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:13,405
The boy said that at night he feels
his legs are being torn away.

201
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,881
"It happens at night, in the dark

202
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,118
"when you stop feeling
your own body,

203
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,721
"and when you can clearly see

204
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,839
"that these legs are not yours."

205
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:02,524
The boy told me
that when his mother was arrested,

206
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,440
the investigator asked her,

207
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:09,839
"How long have you been sleeping
with your son?"

208
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,395
She asked the investigator,

209
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:16,446
"Tell me how many legs
your child has."

210
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:23,557
The investigator said, "Two legs."

211
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:28,043
"Well," said the mother,

212
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:33,643
"Can you believe
that my son also has two legs?"

213
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:17,165
The boy told me that when his mother
was ill and was screaming,

214
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:23,800
he and his sister started
to scream together with her.

215
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:27,846
"We were distracting her
from her fit.

216
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:34,924
"And when I was ill,
Mummy kissed me all night.

217
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:40,240
"And when my sister was ill,
I also kissed her all night.

218
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:45,555
"I kissed her 1,050 times.

219
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:51,081
"I was counting - 1,050 times,

220
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,965
"and I understood that anyone,

221
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:57,881
"however sick, would get better...

222
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:06,042
"...would get better,
if kissed 1,050 times."

223
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:14,638
The boy told me
that actually he was older than me

224
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,525
and that he would die before me.

225
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,996
He said he was going to be crucified,

226
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:23,442
and before that he'd be tortured.

227
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,041
I asked him,
"Who is going to crucify you?

228
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:28,800
"Who is going to torture you?"

229
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:33,802
He replied, "It doesn't matter
who will crucify me

230
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:36,640
"as long as I am tortured."

231
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,964
From the clothes of that ragman

232
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:54,203
the children made this doll
and named it Jesus Christ.

233
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:06,287
These children also know something
very important about Jesus...

234
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:14,284
...that one day he came to people
who lived near water.

235
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:22,365
He told them,
"Follow me, come with me...

236
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:27,156
"...and I will make
you catchers of human souls...

237
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:32,558
"Catchers of human souls."

238
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:38,887
Those people left everything
behind and followed him.

239
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:48,046
These children also leave this place
and go to the city.

240
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:55,365
They go to one college,
then to another.

241
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,756
Then they go to university.

242
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:02,643
They find lodgers
amongst the students,

243
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:07,277
and bring them here.

244
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,643
They catch human souls in the city.

245
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:14,286
They bring men and women

246
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:18,603
and put them up
in the other house.

247
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:10,524
My little son,
don't attempt to understand

248
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:15,123
where power goes,
and from where it returns.

249
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:19,803
Power began to ferment like wine,

250
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:24,085
but they are scared
to fill the old wineskins

251
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,045
with their new wine.

252
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:32,006
They won't fill the old wineskins
with wine.

253
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,880
The old wineskins
are being thrown out these days.

254
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:41,205
The system needs new wineskins.

255
00:26:42,207 --> 00:26:46,041
New wineskins. What are they?

256
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:51,365
It is from the lamb
that grazes freely...

257
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:55,125
...the Lamb of God.

258
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:02,804
Then they take him,
slaughter and eat him,

259
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,677
tan his skin
and make wineskins out of it.

260
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:14,764
It's all the same -
the basics are the same everywhere.

261
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:25,684
Some children found this woman
in the city in winter.

262
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:31,399
She was lying on the ground,
drunk and frozen to the pavement.

263
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:39,280
She was no longer a woman,
but a bundle of a frozen soul.

264
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:44,845
They peeled her off the pavement
and brought her here.

265
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:54,958
She likes telling the children
about her man.

266
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:02,323
Sometimes she extends her arms
and calls to him.

267
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:11,917
She asks the children
to call him too,

268
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:16,647
so that he'll come back to her.

269
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:19,241
And the children do
whatever she asks.

270
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:26,402
My little son, say goodbye to her,

271
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,845
and I'll take you further.

272
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:36,923
While you're still not born,
you are young and have a future.

273
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,402
Chapter III

274
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:47,079
YAZUNDOKTA

275
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,805
GEORGE THE VICTOR

276
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:50,878
MAN IN THE BROKEN TROUGH

277
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:56,523
My little son,

278
00:28:56,607 --> 00:29:03,206
by now the old ragman
has already lost his second leg.

279
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,681
That's it.

280
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,843
My little son,

281
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:14,436
I really want you
to be popular with women...

282
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:21,596
...to be loved
and happily married.

283
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:27,996
However, I'm begging you,
if only you can,

284
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:32,000
stay a virgin
and never become a man.

285
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,441
Don't become a man.

286
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,004
I know, it's hard.

287
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:45,639
Just listen to me. Another body
goes through your heart.

288
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:50,282
With this body
you can lead a sexual life.

289
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:59,000
With this body
you'll be able to protect a woman,

290
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,242
even after her death,

291
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:08,323
when she doesn't have her husband,
or father or brother next to her.

292
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:14,082
My little son,

293
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:19,480
through your heart
goes the body of a pauper.

294
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:23,526
It's the finest of all bodies.

295
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:28,920
And with this body
you'll be able to embrace any woman.

296
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:34,003
This body is always naked.

297
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:39,599
It's naked to the point
of being invisible.

298
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:43,844
It doesn't belong in the system.

299
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:13,877
My little son, I want to take you
to the man in the broken trough.

300
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:17,243
Do you know what he said?

301
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:23,323
He said that once he tried
and managed to kiss his own chest.

302
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:29,957
He said he hadn't seen
a naked arm,

303
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:33,835
or even a naked shoulder
for a long time.

304
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:41,402
The man in the broken trough
says that sometimes

305
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:46,117
it seems to him that his mother
used to bathe him in this trough.

306
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:51,520
He said, "This trough
is all that's left of my home."

307
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,317
I know that very soon
they will convince you

308
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:10,080
that you are a consumer.

309
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:16,402
You consume electricity,
buy clothes and use hot water.

310
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:22,520
You'll be told
that society provides everything,

311
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,883
it's society that trains
teachers and priests.

312
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,882
And if you don't need either,
there's yet more.

313
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:38,846
Society provides doctors
and prostitutes for you.

314
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,725
And if you don't need prostitutes,

315
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:48,881
they'll convince you that
you're doomed to have a sexual life

316
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,324
requiring at least a towel and soap -

317
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:56,080
both produced by society.

318
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:02,798
In a nutshell,
they won't leave you alone.

319
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:07,165
They'll convince you that
a person is born in a social body,

320
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:10,796
and dies in a social body.

321
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:14,038
And you'll agree
with this accusation.

322
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:19,126
But while you're still unborn,

323
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:22,836
there is something
you can say for yourself.

324
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:27,318
You know better than me
that as you are doomed to live,

325
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:33,277
it doesn't matter to you
whether you live or die.

326
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,961
You don't need time.

327
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,244
It's those who are doomed to die
who need time.

328
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:42,125
It's the system that needs time.

329
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,926
That's why your social body
will haunt you,

330
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,885
even after your death.

331
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:58,438
My little one, my social body also
isn't letting me get close to you.

332
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:24,920
His trough is damaged
because he tried to commit suicide.

333
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:30,039
For money, he was taken to the roof
of an eight-story building.

334
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:35,565
He fell down. But after the fall
only the trough was damaged,

335
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:38,719
and he was unhurt.

336
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:06,205
Once, in a street,
I touched a blind beggar.

337
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:11,685
He was wandering round the city
looking for his wife.

338
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:21,684
You are on your own.

339
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:24,679
Imagine, you are on your own.

340
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:30,160
There is no one else...
not even God.

341
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:32,397
You are on your own.

342
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:37,277
If you ever imagine
that you are on your own,

343
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:42,885
then a multitude of lives
will appear in your single body.

344
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:47,597
Because when a person realises
he is on his own,

345
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,076
Jesus appears before him.

346
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:56,998
Jesus, because he was also
utterly on his own in this world.

347
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:04,040
And if you ever get married
and have children...

348
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,884
...you will not be able
to move further,

349
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,845
unless you are full of compassion

350
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,600
and realise
that your wife is also lonely,

351
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:18,077
and that your child
is also utterly alone,

352
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:23,480
and that your father and your mother
are also lonely people.

353
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,961
He too once had a woman.

354
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,597
When he remembers her,

355
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:11,716
he begins to embrace himself
with both arms.

356
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:16,878
That's how he remembers her.

357
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:53,242
The man hasn't left his
broken trough for 40 years.

358
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:59,197
He said that there is enough room
in the trough for another person...

359
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:05,283
...and that once, in winter,
one woman took him in,

360
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,927
but only for one night.

361
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:14,480
He said that that night he left
his trough and lay down with her.

362
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:22,276
She put her leg up against his legs,
and that's how they slept

363
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:25,325
until the morning,
when he left.

364
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,921
My little son,
beware of learned books,

365
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:07,841
beware of laws, any laws.

366
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:12,880
Because for the system
we are not people.

367
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,959
It has established an order of things

368
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:20,484
in which neither you nor I exist.
There is no one.

369
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,116
There's only the law
which exists for us,

370
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:27,597
the law of blood,
the law of fine matter.

371
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:30,599
Our blood, yours and mine,

372
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:34,521
is the sacred axis
of the whole system.

373
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,599
The laws of dialectics deal with it.

374
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:43,044
The laws of dialectics
are the laws of the system.

375
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:46,437
They work only within the system.

376
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:51,123
They are tested,
logical and, of course, false.

377
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:56,964
According to these laws,
the system is a great biomass,

378
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:02,758
and a human being
is the number of its chances.

379
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:06,681
It's possible to take these chances
away, or to leave them.

380
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:09,679
This is the foundation
of everything.

381
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,281
These are
the laws of dialectics,

382
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,837
for this reason
they are immune from morality...

383
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:19,321
...immune from good and evil.

384
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,399
With all this in mind,
it is getting ever harder

385
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:27,038
to discuss whether
we are human at all, or not.

386
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:31,959
He was nicknamed
"George the Victor".

387
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:38,960
Beggars call his hands "candles",
two "candles".

388
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:46,765
At the moment
he is smoking his last cigarette.

389
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,083
And you, my little son,

390
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:53,637
should live your life
like a cigarette...

391
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:57,246
...and like a candle.

392
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:03,600
Like a cigarette, you'll smoulder
and leave your ashes behind.

393
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:10,276
Like a candle,
you'll melt and turn into light.

394
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:15,440
And your light
will transform your body.

395
00:42:16,727 --> 00:42:19,082
You'll see...

396
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:35,157
It wasn't that long ago
that he worked in the fields.

397
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:41,401
Once,
because of the girl he loved,

398
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:44,718
he was caught,
and thrown into millstones.

399
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,963
The millstones were in motion.

400
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:52,801
Since that time,
he roams the city on his knees.

401
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:54,923
He never gets up.

402
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:26,643
He does fortune telling,
about the girl

403
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,321
who was stolen from him.

404
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:33,643
He wants to know
if she still loves him, or not.

405
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:40,405
She loves me, she loves me not,
she loves me, she loves me not.

406
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:47,477
She loves me, she loves me not,
she loves me, she loves me not.

407
00:43:48,447 --> 00:43:51,883
With his knees,
he practises fortune-telling,

408
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,322
fortune-telling about the girl.

409
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:11,161
The system by now has acquired
the rhythmic basis of death.

410
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:17,838
It has learnt
how to counteract itself.

411
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:25,399
That's why it's pointless
to resist the system.

412
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:29,366
In reality,
the system doesn't want to kill us.

413
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,276
It wants to be.

414
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,843
To be.

415
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:37,964
It doesn't want
the end of the world.

416
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:45,243
That's why the system needs light,
which it doesn't have.

417
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:52,357
Particles of such light
are the flesh of the soul.

418
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:55,917
They can only be taken
from human life.

419
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,880
With each day that passes,

420
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:09,556
I feel that the system crystallises
the light in my body.

421
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:13,401
The light grows solid
and leads to a headache.

422
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:19,244
I don't have any proof.
I just know that my head aches.

423
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:24,076
That's why, my little son,
before it's too late,

424
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:27,762
you should start working
for your salvation.

425
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,643
You see,
you have your own light.

426
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:40,078
Follow it,
and you'll come out of the system.

427
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:46,279
For now, do not think
about any kind of nonsense.

428
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,562
Don't think about travelling abroad.

429
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:57,796
After death, you'll have
enough time to travel around.

430
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:02,963
Our next baptism will be by fire.

431
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:09,595
Then it will be too late
to decide whose side you are on.

432
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:32,841
Grigory said that he is happy.

433
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:37,364
Happy because he can't cross himself
either in the Orthodox way,

434
00:46:37,447 --> 00:46:39,483
with three fingers,

435
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:44,719
or in the Catholic way,
with an open hand.

436
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:49,323
For him, the Great Schism
of the churches never happened.

437
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:53,562
In his hands,
they are reunited.

438
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:06,685
"God knew that what he conceived
was worth the risk.

439
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:11,079
"He has already prepared
a body for me.

440
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:16,599
"It will be made
of imagination and light.

441
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:20,157
"The smell has already reached me
from the kitchen,

442
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,920
"where my body is being prepared.

443
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:26,841
"You can't even imagine
who I'm going to be."

444
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:57,042
This man is a king -

445
00:48:57,127 --> 00:48:59,118
King Oswald.

446
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:08,802
He says his civilisation
doesn't leave any trace.

447
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:13,799
His civilisation is on small wheels.

448
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:43,400
Every morning
this woman appears in the market.

449
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:49,716
She doesn't live anywhere.
She just keeps walking and walking,

450
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:52,275
pulling a trunk behind her.

451
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:56,681
Her name is Yazundokta.

452
00:50:00,847 --> 00:50:07,116
The man in the broken trough said
that once, when she wasn't even 20,

453
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,243
he saw her posing
for a photographer

454
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:13,036
who was taking pictures
of her bare back.

455
00:50:15,287 --> 00:50:20,315
He said that when he saw her back
and her shoulder blades...

456
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:29,319
...he wondered why little wings
were not growing there.

457
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,480
The man in the broken trough said

458
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:42,640
that her back is still as gorgeous
as in those days.

459
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:46,117
"She has the most beautiful
back in the world!"

460
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:52,246
When Yazundokta's estate,
all her property, was taken away,

461
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:57,355
and she needed food, she would allow
her back to be kissed for money.

462
00:50:59,047 --> 00:51:01,959
Only kissed and only her back.

463
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:29,560
Yazundokta told me
she had become a woman in prison.

464
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:34,084
Her first man was her jailer.

465
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:38,126
Yes, a jailer.

466
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:43,837
She told me that in the war,
before the evacuation,

467
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:46,043
grenades were thrown at inmates,

468
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:50,086
and shot dead
in the most cold-blooded way.

469
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:53,000
Women were shot in the genitals.

470
00:51:57,007 --> 00:52:01,125
She said that man, that bastard...

471
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:07,684
...pulled her legs apart,
and shoved his revolver right inside.

472
00:52:08,807 --> 00:52:12,880
"He shoved the barrel
of his revolver right there.

473
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,604
"But the revolver misfired...

474
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:28,526
"...and he pulled
the barrel out of me.

475
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:36,604
"I saw his face, I saw
how exhausted he suddenly was.

476
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:43,838
"He was terrified,
and ashamed

477
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,044
"that he had failed so dramatically.

478
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:52,478
"I hugged his head
and I comforted him."

479
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:59,637
That same day,
he took Yazundokta out of prison.

480
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:08,637
Soon after bombing started,
the man was blown to pieces.

481
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:15,285
Only his head
was left for Yazundokta.

482
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:22,235
People say, she took his head,

483
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:25,080
and as she has no home,

484
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:29,479
she keeps his head in this trunk.

485
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:36,484
There is a compartment in the trunk
where that man's head is still kept.

486
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:48,039
He could have become her first man,
but he completely failed.

487
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,564
Chapter IV

488
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:41,444
KING OSWALD

489
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,324
SAINT-SAENS (CHANCE)

490
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:45,284
FIRST DAY OF FREEDOM

491
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:57,606
There is something humiliating
about people hurrying to work.

492
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:04,839
You should try not to go to work.

493
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,919
Don't do work useful for society.

494
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:10,202
It's better to be a beggar.

495
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:15,122
You see, people need guarantees.
That's why they go to work.

496
00:55:16,127 --> 00:55:19,517
They are paid not for their work,

497
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:24,123
but for having rejected
the path of destitution.

498
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:37,960
My little boy, like any father,
I only wish you happiness.

499
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:41,926
I don't want you to be in poverty,
amongst the destitute,

500
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:44,043
against your will.

501
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:49,763
However,
I believe only those who beg

502
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,125
earn their daily bread
through their own labour.

503
00:55:55,807 --> 00:56:00,119
Follow the poor.
Become poor.

504
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:05,565
People who are poor in spirit
can renounce even the spirit.

505
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:11,085
You can't even imagine
how free are those poor in spirit.

506
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:15,080
They are so free
they don't even need freedom.

507
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:21,686
They may not know who Jesus Christ
is and whether he ever existed.

508
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:25,639
Blessedness is not a feat.

509
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:29,322
Blessedness is neither a talent,
nor a chore.

510
00:56:29,407 --> 00:56:32,365
It's just blessedness.

511
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:37,885
These people leave nothing
to the system, but their ashes.

512
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:52,000
I can't say what's happening to me.

513
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:55,636
That means I can't understand
what's being done to me,

514
00:56:55,727 --> 00:56:58,844
and what's being done
to other people.

515
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:02,158
To understand
what's being done to everyone,

516
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:06,684
one should think differently
to everyone else.

517
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,886
But how can one do that
if no words are left?

518
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:14,846
If there were words,
then there would be thoughts.

519
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,725
What's left is to learn
the language of birds,

520
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,275
and become a social outcast,

521
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:27,043
because the writers
have used up all the words.

522
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:31,680
The system set a trap for them -

523
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:35,760
it pretended it was afraid
of their words.

524
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,763
And they fell for it.

525
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:42,396
They shouldn't have spoken
to this system in its language,

526
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:44,478
but they kept doing so,

527
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:48,845
and their native language
turned into a pillar of salt.

528
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:55,235
That's it. The system has created
a body made of language.

529
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:59,438
I don't have
my language any more.

530
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:02,997
There are no words
and therefore no thoughts.

531
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:07,761
As much as I want to think otherwise,
I just can't.

532
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:13,597
The situation
is under total control.

533
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:23,201
Dissent will mean hiding
one's thoughts.

534
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,919
That's why you shouldn't listen
to anyone, my little boy.

535
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:38,680
Don't listen to your teachers.
Don't even listen to me.

536
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:42,442
I'm stretching out my arms to you
while you're not here.

537
00:58:43,727 --> 00:58:48,198
I don't want us
to talk in the language I use.

538
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,840
You've seen what it leads to.

539
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:05,402
My little one, you know...

540
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:10,600
...l'm afraid of your birth. Afraid.

541
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:13,679
I live in fear.

542
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:19,476
The fear is already here.

543
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:22,206
Here, in my stomach.

544
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:27,397
Because there is no fear
in the mind.

545
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:30,479
If the mind is capable
of seeing anything at all,

546
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,035
it can't be gripped by fear.

547
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:44,481
Those who step over their fear
cannot comprehend what lies ahead.

548
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:49,639
My little son,
I'm scared to come to you.

549
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,762
I'm scared to see your face.

550
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:59,318
The most frightening thing of all
is to come out of the fear.

551
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:05,679
I want to see you and experience fear
because of that.

552
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:20,037
On the same day I saw a young guy

553
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:25,326
who had been released
from a prison infirmary.

554
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:34,320
He was in prison,
along with his father.

555
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,397
His father lost his sight in prison,

556
01:00:39,487 --> 01:00:42,877
and his movement coordination.

557
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:48,646
When his father was in prison,

558
01:00:48,727 --> 01:00:53,482
the son gathered together
medicinal and narcotic herbs,

559
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,683
and threw them to him
through the barbed wire,

560
01:00:55,767 --> 01:01:02,525
until he was put in prison
along with his father.

561
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:41,365
If only you knew how he was shaking.

562
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:57,205
You, little one,
have your own body.

563
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,765
Nobody knows about it yet.

564
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:04,041
This body is Easter.

565
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,766
It's called Easter.

566
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:12,406
The system doesn't own this body.

567
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:21,043
The paradox is that the death
of the system lies within itself.

568
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,275
Its life is its death.

569
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:45,036
My little one,
I've just had a feeling

570
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:51,441
that I'm talking to you
after your death,

571
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,917
that ten minutes ago
you were still here,

572
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:59,204
and now you are not.

573
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:05,236
That means
I've become younger than you,

574
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:10,162
because I've been left alive,
and you have not.

575
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:16,042
If that's so,
one shouldn't believe it.

576
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,358
One simply
shouldn't believe information

577
01:04:19,447 --> 01:04:22,086
that comes from the system.

578
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:24,635
It's my fault.

579
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:29,039
It's me who believed
that you are no longer here.

580
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:32,119
Don't believe information
from the system,

581
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:34,641
especially if it's true.

582
01:05:04,887 --> 01:05:06,400
Chapter V

583
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:10,076
HEALING OF THE BORN BLIND

584
01:05:22,327 --> 01:05:25,842
These people
were ordinary epileptics...

585
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:30,000
until an abominable experiment
was conducted on them.

586
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:33,966
They were lobotomised,
their memories were erased.

587
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:37,517
Now they can't remember anything.

588
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:42,078
They can't even remember themselves,
who they are.

589
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,440
When a crowd fills the square...

590
01:06:05,447 --> 01:06:10,885
...this blind boy hurries to work.
He begs.

591
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:23,487
Though he was born blind,
his stride is confident and fast.

592
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:26,286
He thinks all people are blind.

593
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:35,317
He really thinks
all people are blind.

594
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:55,876
His father and mother
are also blind.

595
01:06:55,967 --> 01:07:01,405
They told their son
that everyone is blind,

596
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:05,196
and that no one
can see oneself.

597
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:12,556
But the blind boy
made his own discovery.

598
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:18,525
He figured out
that all people are women.

599
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:22,005
Every person is a woman,

600
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:25,523
and all voices
are the voices of women.

601
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:29,082
That's what he thinks.

602
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:35,840
Women give birth to children
who are also women.

603
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:41,802
And his fate was to be born a man.

604
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:45,602
That's why he is a cripple.

605
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:50,922
And his father is a cripple
because he was also born a man.

606
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:57,163
He believes that the only other man
is his father.

607
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:29,635
The blind boy knows that
female humans feel sorry for him.

608
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:35,801
They feel sorry for him
because he is a man,

609
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:39,926
and throw coins to him
to make his life better.

610
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:28,801
His blind mother knows that her son
is constantly drawn to women.

611
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:34,883
She keeps reminding him
that he shouldn't be

612
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,640
because he is a man.

613
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:47,036
"The thing you want to do,
you should do with your eyes."

614
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:51,117
My little son,

615
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:56,565
if only I could see,
I would make love with my eyes.

616
01:09:58,047 --> 01:10:03,679
What a shame
I can't make love with my eyes.

617
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:20,158
If a female human
doesn't wish to notice him

618
01:10:20,247 --> 01:10:25,640
she turns away, but he keeps
waiting and doesn't leave.

619
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:29,037
He knows that the woman
is also blind

620
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:34,520
and can't see he is a man,
a cripple, and needs help.

621
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:40,206
By midday, all the members
of the family meet up.

622
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:43,441
The blind man finds his wife.

623
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:47,076
And the boy,
the bread-winner, comes last.

624
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,000
He comes to his parents.

625
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:09,156
About 20 years ago,

626
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:13,798
the father and the mother
were in a psychiatric institution.

627
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:19,398
She was 20 then,
he was even younger.

628
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:25,686
When they fell in love
with each other in that institution,

629
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:32,525
as usual, they were supposed
to be sterilised to be made barren.

630
01:13:33,807 --> 01:13:36,446
But they managed to escape.

631
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:41,282
By touch, they found a tree with
branches stretching beyond the fence.

632
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:45,440
They climbed that tree
and found their freedom.

633
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:50,356
And they had a son.

634
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:27,479
The blind boy has a secret though -

635
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:32,687
a secret place where
he stashes away a bit of money.

636
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:38,477
Before giving money to his mother,
he hides here in this corner,

637
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:44,563
and transfers some coins
from the full box to his secret box.

638
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,400
He keeps it
deep under his clothes.

639
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:50,877
Neither his father nor mother
know about it.

640
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:16,916
My little son,
I really want you to become poor.

641
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:25,198
I, your father,
wish that you become poor...

642
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:30,684
...because I love you.

643
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:36,923
My little son...

644
01:15:39,727 --> 01:15:44,801
...I want you to decide
to keep your virginity.

645
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:51,159
You will start seeing it
as a living person,

646
01:15:52,287 --> 01:15:56,724
and realise there is nothing
more important for you.

647
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:03,283
You should unite your poverty
and your virginity.

648
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:06,439
This is the only advice
I can give you.

649
01:16:25,567 --> 01:16:30,118
Unite your poverty
and your virginity...

650
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:34,686
...and you'll begin
to learn love from love itself.

651
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:40,198
Poverty and virginity
will be your companions,

652
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:43,916
and you'll become more refined,

653
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:49,604
and your love will begin to take on
the most incredible shapes.

654
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:54,636
Try and unite
virginity and poverty,

655
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:59,397
and you won't need
any civil rights,

656
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:03,006
which will not be of any use
tO yOu anyWay.

657
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:06,636
Poverty will protect you
from the system,

658
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:10,959
and virginity from the fornications
of the system.

659
01:17:16,607 --> 01:17:21,362
But I don't want your development
to take the path of acquisition.

660
01:17:23,047 --> 01:17:27,643
I want your development
to take the path of renunciation.

661
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:30,287
Renunciation and loss.

662
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:34,246
And you'll become one
who isn't part of the system.

663
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:40,922
That's why, if you haven't
yet slept with a woman,

664
01:17:41,007 --> 01:17:43,316
stay as yOu are.

665
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:17,927
End of part one

666
01:19:20,116 --> 01:19:25,952
I can't help the feeling
that the sky doesn't exist...

667
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:29,908
...that it has disappeared
from above us.

668
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:38,755
Time has come into its final shape.
That's it, time has taken a shape.

669
01:19:40,756 --> 01:19:45,466
It's no longer possible to dissent,
there is no point,

670
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:51,995
because the system will absorb
everything that has a meaning.

671
01:19:54,036 --> 01:19:58,507
That's why, little one,
you should arm yourself with poverty,

672
01:19:58,596 --> 01:20:01,588
and strike the system first.

673
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:08,350
Part 2

674
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,945
I'm scared for you, my little one.

675
01:20:13,436 --> 01:20:17,395
You see, the sky used to be
our protective ceiling,

676
01:20:17,476 --> 01:20:24,029
which protected me from the cosmos,
and the rubbish found there.

677
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:28,109
The sky used to be
our protective ceiling.

678
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:30,346
When I was still living
under the sky,

679
01:20:30,436 --> 01:20:35,590
it was possible for some
of my thoughts not to materialise.

680
01:20:35,676 --> 01:20:38,952
Now all my thoughts materialise.

681
01:20:39,036 --> 01:20:44,269
It's like a growing cancer
spreading everywhere,

682
01:20:44,356 --> 01:20:48,713
but it's a special type of cancer -
it doesn't let the body die,

683
01:20:48,796 --> 01:20:53,347
so the corpse can constantly
conduct energy and power.

684
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:01,147
Today the system needs
more fine matter.

685
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:05,548
It wants society
to have superconductivity.

686
01:21:06,636 --> 01:21:11,664
Now the system needs churches
and prayer houses...

687
01:21:13,476 --> 01:21:18,596
...which means that all religions
are effectively disappearing.

688
01:21:28,156 --> 01:21:31,148
Everybody before us
was afraid of this situation,

689
01:21:31,236 --> 01:21:36,185
which is worse than any war,
and we have entered it.

690
01:21:39,596 --> 01:21:44,067
We've entered the zone
of the objective laws of the system.

691
01:21:44,156 --> 01:21:48,593
Do you remember those epileptics?
They found themselves cast out

692
01:21:48,676 --> 01:21:52,112
because they didn't need
to go anywhere.

693
01:21:52,196 --> 01:21:54,664
They were on the border of worlds,

694
01:21:54,756 --> 01:21:58,032
and could see
into the nature of things.

695
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:01,392
Why see into the nature of things?

696
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:04,149
It's all been seen into already.

697
01:22:08,396 --> 01:22:14,744
My little son, I'm closing my eyes
so that I can see you better.

698
01:22:22,196 --> 01:22:25,313
I'm going to close my eyes.

699
01:22:28,996 --> 01:22:31,908
Perhaps it used to be land...

700
01:22:32,756 --> 01:22:37,466
...perhaps then it was possible
to feel the spirit. The spirit.

701
01:22:37,556 --> 01:22:42,311
It was possible to touch it,
to talk to it, to live with it.

702
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:46,548
Or perhaps I'm just depressed?

703
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:51,624
I used to think, "Never mind
if I don't have anyone.

704
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:55,629
"I'll live with this land.
It's already sufficient."

705
01:22:55,716 --> 01:22:58,355
I didn't mind sliding into poverty

706
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:01,832
because I knew
the land would support me.

707
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:04,749
And now,
with every passing day,

708
01:23:04,836 --> 01:23:09,387
I clearly see
my utter uselessness,

709
01:23:09,476 --> 01:23:12,866
here, where I'm standing.

710
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:20,106
My mother doesn't understand
what I'm talking about.

711
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:23,188
I tried to talk
to my girlfriend about this,

712
01:23:23,276 --> 01:23:26,552
and terror engulfed me,
thinking what would happen to her,

713
01:23:26,636 --> 01:23:29,628
staying with me.

714
01:23:29,716 --> 01:23:35,109
The nightmare, soon to affect
everyone, is unfolding here.

715
01:23:36,276 --> 01:23:40,349
And, if earlier, I wanted
to become a dissident,

716
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:43,746
to burn at the stake or to go mad,

717
01:23:43,836 --> 01:23:48,352
now it's becoming clear
that to become a dissident,

718
01:23:48,436 --> 01:23:50,825
one has to go mad first.

719
01:23:51,956 --> 01:23:55,266
One has to go mad first.

720
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:57,551
Or die.

721
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,515
Chapter VI

722
01:23:59,596 --> 01:24:00,995
SRULIK

723
01:24:01,076 --> 01:24:02,475
HUNGER

724
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:04,512
NIGHTLIFE OF THE DESTITUTE

725
01:24:10,276 --> 01:24:13,393
I wanted you
to come to this man.

726
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:18,072
But it's too late,
he's no longer on Earth.

727
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:21,785
He died, and birds
sang prayers at his funeral.

728
01:24:21,876 --> 01:24:24,595
His name was Srulik.

729
01:24:25,636 --> 01:24:27,866
He lived here, in the attic.

730
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:31,266
Doves would fly into his window,
eat from his plate.

731
01:24:31,356 --> 01:24:33,586
When he was in bed,

732
01:24:33,676 --> 01:24:37,305
doves would sleep on his face,
between his legs.

733
01:24:51,436 --> 01:24:56,590
Srulik didn't use money
and never received a pension.

734
01:24:56,676 --> 01:25:01,909
He sheltered women who escaped
from prison and being sectioned.

735
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:06,035
The women would bring him grain,
bread and wine.

736
01:25:08,596 --> 01:25:11,394
Srulik told them stories

737
01:25:11,476 --> 01:25:14,468
in which Earth was inhabited
by birds, not people.

738
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:20,472
Jacob was a bird, Sarah was a bird,
and David was a fledgling.

739
01:25:42,556 --> 01:25:48,870
I'm increasingly getting this heavy
feeling that is difficult to explain.

740
01:25:48,956 --> 01:25:54,474
As the situation is getting worse...
as the situation is getting worse.

741
01:25:55,356 --> 01:25:59,634
The spirit is rapidly deserting
the land and the cities.

742
01:25:59,716 --> 01:26:02,753
It's no longer possible to stop it.

743
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:10,552
People are losing their protection.

744
01:26:11,996 --> 01:26:16,865
The system has entered the phase
of shaping itself,

745
01:26:16,956 --> 01:26:22,952
of total survival by all means
possible so as to manifest itself.

746
01:26:23,956 --> 01:26:26,470
It takes any shape.

747
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:31,835
It turns whatever threatens
its existence into its advantage.

748
01:26:36,756 --> 01:26:41,386
It's possible now to build
and open new churches

749
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:44,434
because the spirit itself is leaving,

750
01:26:44,516 --> 01:26:48,225
because any attempts
to keep the spirit in the system

751
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:51,228
will lead to another tragedy.

752
01:26:57,156 --> 01:27:04,028
So, either a person lives
in the spirit and leaves the system,

753
01:27:04,116 --> 01:27:06,755
and lives together with it...

754
01:27:09,796 --> 01:27:14,267
...or identifies oneself with
the system and becomes its follower,

755
01:27:14,356 --> 01:27:17,746
its slave, forever.

756
01:27:19,676 --> 01:27:22,474
The spirit is leaving.

757
01:27:23,476 --> 01:27:26,513
The spirit is leaving!

758
01:27:27,396 --> 01:27:30,786
And the energy which stays...

759
01:27:32,556 --> 01:27:37,266
...will have a quality
not acceptable to everyone,

760
01:27:38,476 --> 01:27:42,025
only to the followers of the system.

761
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:51,351
Decent, intelligent people

762
01:27:51,436 --> 01:27:54,792
simply won't find
enough concentrated energy,

763
01:27:54,876 --> 01:27:59,745
that light and that piece of bread
which could help them

764
01:27:59,836 --> 01:28:02,589
to revive their own world.

765
01:28:02,716 --> 01:28:08,313
That person will look like
an alcoholic who needs a drink...

766
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:15,946
...while there is no drink
to be found.

767
01:28:22,556 --> 01:28:25,593
This will lead to intellectual death.

768
01:28:27,316 --> 01:28:34,188
A person in such a lost state can
easily be pushed in any direction.

769
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:39,350
It's not essential whether
I'm going to be persecuted, or not...

770
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:42,950
It will be more or less
the same thing.

771
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:48,508
What's important is that the forces
at work will control everyone,

772
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:52,908
everyone who is moving
against the flow.

773
01:29:01,476 --> 01:29:07,426
Once Srulik developed a fever
he said,

774
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:10,826
"I know,
soon the other world will come.

775
01:29:12,716 --> 01:29:16,265
"In childhood I heard there is a book

776
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:22,875
"which tells how to re-consecrate
arms, legs, sexual organs."

777
01:29:25,636 --> 01:29:28,912
He called the doves "poor beggars".

778
01:29:30,756 --> 01:29:33,350
Srulik said,

779
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:38,954
"To touch a pauper, I don't
have to go out and touch them.

780
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:44,352
"I've learnt to exchange warmth."

781
01:30:12,076 --> 01:30:15,591
Srulik taught the bird language
to the women.

782
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:19,225
Adam knew the bird language.

783
01:30:19,316 --> 01:30:21,591
When, after the death of Srulik,

784
01:30:21,676 --> 01:30:25,066
the police broke in
to arrest the women...

785
01:30:26,076 --> 01:30:30,069
...one of them
hid a dove under her clothes

786
01:30:30,156 --> 01:30:32,716
and jumped out of the window.

787
01:30:34,156 --> 01:30:38,547
The woman fell five storeys
to her death.

788
01:30:38,636 --> 01:30:41,355
When her body was turned over

789
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,985
a white dove,
with wings tinged red,

790
01:30:45,076 --> 01:30:48,148
flew out and disappeared.

791
01:30:52,756 --> 01:30:55,065
One beggar said
people don't give coins -

792
01:30:55,156 --> 01:30:58,034
but unbutton themselves.

793
01:30:58,116 --> 01:31:00,550
"They unbutton themselves for me.

794
01:31:00,636 --> 01:31:02,786
"They get undressed.

795
01:31:02,876 --> 01:31:06,755
"Unbuttoning one,
then another, then another.

796
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:13,150
"Men and women unbutton themselves
from me. They undress and pass by.

797
01:31:13,956 --> 01:31:17,346
"It only lasts a few seconds,

798
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:21,952
"but that's enough
for me to see them totally naked."

799
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:56,632
The moment you leave society,
you are confronted by eternal fear.

800
01:31:57,516 --> 01:32:00,394
One can't immediately
leave society.

801
01:32:00,476 --> 01:32:04,867
You eat and drink, you live,
and you're already a part of society.

802
01:32:04,956 --> 01:32:09,711
Don't eat, don't drink, then you'll
be able to live outside society.

803
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:12,708
Otherwise, whatever you say,

804
01:32:12,796 --> 01:32:15,469
whatever your spiritual capacity,

805
01:32:15,556 --> 01:32:18,992
your ability to see through things,

806
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:21,465
if you are moving with society,

807
01:32:21,556 --> 01:32:25,913
you don't truly see through things -
instead you are doing work.

808
01:32:25,996 --> 01:32:31,150
You work for society,
even when you see through things.

809
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:47,276
My little son, you don't see me,
and I don't see you.

810
01:32:47,356 --> 01:32:53,875
In this society, you and I represent
a union of two blind people.

811
01:32:57,596 --> 01:33:01,191
It is the condition
of our contact.

812
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:11,071
I want to see you so much
that I'm ready to believe

813
01:33:11,156 --> 01:33:14,353
that one of these people is you.

814
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:25,790
My grown-up child,
I'm trying to hide you,

815
01:33:25,876 --> 01:33:29,710
so that nobody can find out
who you really are.

816
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:53,553
I don't want to scare you,
but you should understand this,

817
01:33:53,636 --> 01:33:58,551
even if the system
says it is based on law,

818
01:33:58,636 --> 01:34:03,346
there is one thing in this world
outside the jurisdiction of law...

819
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:08,269
...doom.

820
01:34:09,756 --> 01:34:11,747
Doom.

821
01:34:15,476 --> 01:34:19,151
If the system manages,
in the nick of time,

822
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:23,070
to separate people
into those who are functional,

823
01:34:23,156 --> 01:34:26,114
and those who are doomed,

824
01:34:26,196 --> 01:34:28,346
then a crime...

825
01:34:29,676 --> 01:34:33,385
...will not be any different
from a legality.

826
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:37,392
Individuals will lose the ability

827
01:34:37,476 --> 01:34:42,504
to analyse the state
of the society in which they live.

828
01:35:11,596 --> 01:35:16,545
My little son, don't become
a human rights activist.

829
01:35:16,636 --> 01:35:20,231
Don't be swayed
by how they risk their lives.

830
01:35:20,316 --> 01:35:23,513
Risking their lives is one thing,

831
01:35:24,396 --> 01:35:26,785
but what life becomes

832
01:35:26,876 --> 01:35:29,515
is completely different.

833
01:35:53,476 --> 01:35:58,345
In 1945, this man was
in a German concentration camp.

834
01:35:58,436 --> 01:36:00,870
He was still a small child.

835
01:36:00,956 --> 01:36:02,992
A German doctor freed him.

836
01:36:05,356 --> 01:36:09,986
He received the certificate
confirming he had been freed,

837
01:36:10,076 --> 01:36:14,354
and went to the officials
for a flat to live.

838
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:18,907
But the 40 year old certificate
wasn't recognised

839
01:36:18,996 --> 01:36:22,068
because Himmler's signature
was not there.

840
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:25,034
He was told that people
could only be freed

841
01:36:25,116 --> 01:36:27,914
if Himmler personally signed
the document,

842
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:30,669
and they refused
to give him a flat.

843
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:33,873
This man developed
a headache.

844
01:36:33,956 --> 01:36:36,629
He didn't know where to get
Himmler's signature,

845
01:36:36,716 --> 01:36:38,911
as Himmler
had committed suicide.

846
01:36:38,996 --> 01:36:41,874
He is no longer alive.

847
01:36:43,236 --> 01:36:47,275
Then this man's wounds
began to bleed,

848
01:36:47,356 --> 01:36:49,506
and he began to drink.

849
01:36:55,316 --> 01:36:57,784
And so did his wife.

850
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:01,746
Even she no longer believed

851
01:37:01,836 --> 01:37:06,307
that her husband had ever been
in a concentration camp.

852
01:37:10,156 --> 01:37:13,148
Their son started
taking them to town

853
01:37:13,236 --> 01:37:15,989
and they all begged -

854
01:37:16,076 --> 01:37:20,752
the son, the father
and the mother...

855
01:37:22,876 --> 01:37:25,674
...each on their own.

856
01:37:34,996 --> 01:37:37,749
The son would protect his father.

857
01:37:37,836 --> 01:37:42,034
Only he believed his father's
concentration camp story.

858
01:37:57,556 --> 01:38:01,026
My little one,
you have your own light.

859
01:38:02,476 --> 01:38:05,274
It's pure, a sacred light.

860
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:09,065
You should try
to preserve it in poverty.

861
01:38:09,156 --> 01:38:13,672
Only this light can lead you
out of the system.

862
01:38:13,756 --> 01:38:18,784
And if you ever hear about
the Apocalypse, don't be afraid.

863
01:38:19,796 --> 01:38:24,790
For us, the end of the world
is the only salvation.

864
01:38:25,836 --> 01:38:29,988
It will be our only chance
to leave the system.

865
01:38:30,996 --> 01:38:34,989
It's not enough to be resurrected
to break out of it.

866
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:38,068
It's also necessary to ascend.

867
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:50,947
This woman's name is Maria.

868
01:38:51,036 --> 01:38:55,666
She told me she is ready
to give me her flesh and blood.

869
01:38:56,956 --> 01:38:59,709
She meant her son.

870
01:39:00,716 --> 01:39:03,071
When in a psychiatric hospital,

871
01:39:03,156 --> 01:39:06,671
a nurse told her
that she had a Mona Lisa smile

872
01:39:06,756 --> 01:39:10,351
and that her hair
would be shaved off.

873
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:16,109
She kept her hair.
It's in her bag right now.

874
01:39:20,116 --> 01:39:23,472
In hospital
she was given injections

875
01:39:23,556 --> 01:39:27,026
which would make her infertile.

876
01:39:27,116 --> 01:39:30,631
But she escaped
from the hospital, pregnant -

877
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:33,708
to the joy of all mothers.

878
01:39:33,796 --> 01:39:37,027
A long time ago
the Christians knew

879
01:39:37,116 --> 01:39:40,665
that one shouldn't
use contraception,

880
01:39:40,756 --> 01:39:43,190
that the womb should be free.

881
01:39:43,276 --> 01:39:48,396
There, in the womb,
is a place with the same name

882
01:39:48,476 --> 01:39:52,310
as that spot in the Universe

883
01:39:52,396 --> 01:39:54,785
which was the origin of life.

884
01:40:33,836 --> 01:40:37,829
If you look at people
through the eyes of a pauper,

885
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:41,511
you'll see that
their unhappiness

886
01:40:41,596 --> 01:40:44,030
comes from their fear of poverty,

887
01:40:44,116 --> 01:40:47,074
their fear of being excluded
from society,

888
01:40:47,156 --> 01:40:49,750
while their salvation
can only happen

889
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:52,714
if they are excluded.

890
01:40:52,796 --> 01:40:57,233
Jesus came here, to society,
as the King of Judea.

891
01:40:58,236 --> 01:41:02,946
He came as a King, that's why
he could lead the life of the poor.

892
01:41:03,036 --> 01:41:07,188
He gathered his followers
from among the semi-destitute -

893
01:41:07,276 --> 01:41:11,428
poor fishermen,
beggars, prostitutes,

894
01:41:11,516 --> 01:41:16,351
who, nevertheless,
had regular incomes from their work.

895
01:41:16,436 --> 01:41:19,473
They had already
gone through earning a living,

896
01:41:19,556 --> 01:41:24,471
and were now ready to give it up
in order to become destitute.

897
01:41:39,956 --> 01:41:43,585
"There is no hair under the hat."

898
01:41:45,476 --> 01:41:48,115
Maria said that...

899
01:41:49,116 --> 01:41:52,711
...there isn't a single hair
under her hat.

900
01:42:56,196 --> 01:43:02,032
I thought I would fulfil
all her wishes, yet she left me.

901
01:43:05,676 --> 01:43:11,273
I was copying her movements,
copying her movements,

902
01:43:11,356 --> 01:43:15,429
adopting her poses,
killing the man in me.

903
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:36,875
I thought I would fulfil
all her wishes, yet she left me.

904
01:43:39,116 --> 01:43:41,584
I was copying her movements,

905
01:43:41,676 --> 01:43:45,908
adopting her poses,
killing the man in me.

906
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:03,392
Once a woman brought
Romany Gypsies to Srulik.

907
01:45:03,476 --> 01:45:06,036
Srulik used to live with Gypsies -

908
01:45:06,116 --> 01:45:09,392
when he was in
a concentration camp.

909
01:45:13,676 --> 01:45:16,986
Those Gypsies,
just like these Gypsies,

910
01:45:17,076 --> 01:45:19,909
were from this city.

911
01:45:19,996 --> 01:45:21,987
And those Gypsies
sang and danced

912
01:45:22,076 --> 01:45:25,068
and danced naked
in gas chambers.

913
01:45:25,156 --> 01:45:30,310
Those Gypsies
helped young Srulik escape.

914
01:45:30,396 --> 01:45:34,912
And these Gypsies
came to give him a funeral.

915
01:45:50,996 --> 01:45:54,432
For several nights before his death,
Srulik hadn't slept,

916
01:45:54,516 --> 01:45:57,713
and kept stroking a black pigeon.

917
01:45:57,796 --> 01:46:00,868
Every morning
a girl would come to him.

918
01:46:00,956 --> 01:46:04,710
She worked at night,
and every morning.

919
01:46:04,796 --> 01:46:11,110
Srulik would tell her
about the language of the birds

920
01:46:11,196 --> 01:46:15,428
and the pigeons he slept with.

921
01:46:15,516 --> 01:46:18,713
He said these pigeons
conceived from him.

922
01:46:18,796 --> 01:46:24,109
He called them "my dear pigeons".

923
01:46:24,196 --> 01:46:27,506
"Their eggs are my eggs...

924
01:46:28,556 --> 01:46:31,116
"...and there are many baby birds

925
01:46:31,196 --> 01:46:34,506
"now in the city, fathered by me.

926
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:37,394
"It seems someone
grassed on me

927
01:46:37,476 --> 01:46:41,515
"and they started
taking the eggs from me."

928
01:46:41,596 --> 01:46:49,184
Srulik said, "As soon as
one of my birds sits on the eggs,

929
01:46:49,276 --> 01:46:55,511
"a police officer usually accompanied
by lab workers storms in.

930
01:46:55,596 --> 01:46:56,312
"They confiscate all my eggs,

931
01:46:56,396 --> 01:47:00,309
"put them in a special box

932
01:47:00,396 --> 01:47:02,387
"and take them away.

933
01:47:02,476 --> 01:47:05,946
"Bandits! It happens every month.

934
01:47:06,036 --> 01:47:10,905
"Those eggs have baby birds
conceived by me - little Sruliks!"

935
01:47:42,716 --> 01:47:44,786
Night time for the destitute

936
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:49,267
is equally full of fear
and of the unexpected.

937
01:47:53,156 --> 01:47:56,148
Every evening,
when the sun is setting,

938
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:58,625
this woman starts getting ready

939
01:47:58,716 --> 01:48:01,310
for her night time hallucinations.

940
01:48:01,396 --> 01:48:04,991
Her hallucinations
are her world

941
01:48:05,076 --> 01:48:07,636
in which
she meets her husband.

942
01:48:07,716 --> 01:48:11,152
Her husband died of starvation
many years agO.

943
01:48:13,396 --> 01:48:17,947
During the day,
she begs for money and buys food.

944
01:48:20,996 --> 01:48:23,635
But she is unable to eat it.

945
01:48:23,716 --> 01:48:27,106
She puts it on the table at night
for her husband.

946
01:48:27,196 --> 01:48:31,075
And by about midnight
he eats it.

947
01:48:31,156 --> 01:48:33,465
But she can't see him.

948
01:48:35,276 --> 01:48:37,267
In her hallucinations

949
01:48:37,356 --> 01:48:40,985
she sees her neighbours,
but not him.

950
01:48:49,996 --> 01:48:53,033
Then the most
difficult minutes come.

951
01:48:53,116 --> 01:48:58,474
It all starts with the appearance
of a huge red spot in the sky.

952
01:48:58,556 --> 01:49:01,866
It looks like the sun,
but it's not the sun.

953
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:07,825
"This spot doesn't let me
see my husband."

954
01:49:14,316 --> 01:49:16,671
Then her childhood
girlfriend comes.

955
01:49:16,756 --> 01:49:18,747
She is coming right now.

956
01:49:18,836 --> 01:49:21,987
During the day
she roams canteens,

957
01:49:22,076 --> 01:49:25,227
and collects bread
left by people.

958
01:49:26,396 --> 01:49:30,309
"My girlfriend also lost her brother
to starvation.

959
01:49:30,396 --> 01:49:32,671
"But she keeps blaming me,

960
01:49:32,756 --> 01:49:36,874
"saying that my parents ate him
during the famine.

961
01:49:39,476 --> 01:49:42,912
"Parents were giving
their children anything,

962
01:49:42,996 --> 01:49:44,634
"so that they could survive
during the famine.

963
01:49:48,556 --> 01:49:53,391
"Sometimes they wouldn't tell
children what they were eating.

964
01:49:54,476 --> 01:49:57,752
"But we didn't eat her brother!

965
01:49:57,876 --> 01:50:02,108
"Yet she comes every night
and tells me, 'lt was you.'

966
01:50:02,196 --> 01:50:04,994
"But I didn't eat him.

967
01:50:05,076 --> 01:50:09,911
"What they once put
in my mouth when I was ill...

968
01:50:12,236 --> 01:50:14,750
"...wasn't meat."

MAGIC FLUTE

971
01:50:44,956 --> 01:50:48,266
The further you move away
from the system,

972
01:50:48,636 --> 01:50:52,595
the stronger its pulling power.

973
01:50:54,796 --> 01:50:58,186
You think you are going mad.

974
01:50:58,276 --> 01:51:03,350
You realise that the system
has no boundaries.

975
01:51:04,356 --> 01:51:06,347
At the transitional levels

976
01:51:06,436 --> 01:51:09,508
the system is no longer
of material nature.

977
01:51:09,596 --> 01:51:12,633
It has given up
annexation of territory

978
01:51:12,716 --> 01:51:16,470
because it doesn't
secure its future.

979
01:51:16,556 --> 01:51:19,992
The future of the system
is in the system itself.

980
01:51:21,356 --> 01:51:25,474
What is truly terrifying
is not what is happening,

981
01:51:26,556 --> 01:51:29,548
but where things come from
and where they go.

982
01:51:29,636 --> 01:51:34,630
Generational succession
has become invisible and sudden.

983
01:51:36,116 --> 01:51:41,144
One generation succeeds another
at a lightening speed -

984
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:44,273
in a week,
even in an hour.

985
01:51:44,356 --> 01:51:48,554
If you don't keep up
with your generation,

986
01:51:48,636 --> 01:51:52,709
you fall and execute yourself.
Execute yourself.

987
01:51:52,796 --> 01:51:55,993
And there is no need
for you to be arrested.

988
01:52:00,396 --> 01:52:04,105
If at the moment
of a generational succession,

989
01:52:04,196 --> 01:52:08,712
you were asleep, you jump up
in the middle of the night,

990
01:52:08,796 --> 01:52:13,665
look at the door
and jump out of the window.

991
01:52:13,756 --> 01:52:18,546
That's why, my little son,
if you are left to live,

992
01:52:18,636 --> 01:52:23,630
and you hear about someone
that has committed suicide,

993
01:52:23,716 --> 01:52:28,631
you should know,
he didn't kill himself.

994
01:52:30,636 --> 01:52:35,869
Don't believe that those who
commit suicide don't want to live.

995
01:52:35,956 --> 01:52:38,834
They do want to live.

996
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:43,671
The thing is, they're not aware
they're committing suicide.

997
01:52:43,756 --> 01:52:47,465
One can only be aware
of committing a murder.

998
01:52:52,036 --> 01:52:54,027
I'm saying this to you now,

999
01:52:54,116 --> 01:53:00,749
while I'm still quite young
and before I get old,

1000
01:53:00,836 --> 01:53:03,987
so that we can understand
each other.

1001
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:19,230
I beg you, do not try
to improve this system.

1002
01:53:21,956 --> 01:53:26,108
It would be better if you could
learn to pass through it.

1003
01:53:27,116 --> 01:53:31,871
But it's also important for
the system to pass through itself...

1004
01:53:33,436 --> 01:53:35,870
...in order to enter the future.

1005
01:53:38,236 --> 01:53:42,514
That's why the system
destroyed half of its population,

1006
01:53:42,596 --> 01:53:46,748
and entered itself
tO create a passage Way.

1007
01:53:48,916 --> 01:53:53,865
And by now, the system
has learnt to pass through people

1008
01:53:53,956 --> 01:53:56,789
without taking their lives.

1009
01:54:01,036 --> 01:54:04,824
My little son, I don't want
to test your patience.

1010
01:54:04,916 --> 01:54:08,147
I forgive you
for everything in advance,

1011
01:54:08,236 --> 01:54:11,751
for everything you'll do
if you stay alive.

1012
01:54:11,836 --> 01:54:14,145
And you, forgive me too,

1013
01:54:14,236 --> 01:54:18,627
forgive me for your mother,
and for our incest.

1014
01:54:20,396 --> 01:54:24,628
I want to see so badly
how you first look at me.

1015
01:54:34,156 --> 01:54:38,468
My little son,
as yOu can see...

1016
01:54:39,516 --> 01:54:42,428
...I can't find my place in life.

1017
01:54:42,516 --> 01:54:45,826
It's possible
it has never existed here.

1018
01:54:47,396 --> 01:54:50,388
I believe in our connection.

1019
01:54:50,956 --> 01:54:55,632
And the best confirmation
that we are father and son

1020
01:54:55,716 --> 01:55:00,551
is that we can't see each other.

1021
01:55:36,196 --> 01:55:38,710
Take a step backwards...

1022
01:55:41,516 --> 01:55:46,146
...and the system
will start threatening you.

1023
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:50,793
Take another step backwards...

1024
01:55:51,996 --> 01:55:55,955
...and the system
may offer you a place.

1025
01:55:56,036 --> 01:55:59,631
You should take
another step backwards...

1026
01:56:00,356 --> 01:56:04,634
...and the system will offer you
religions to choose from.

1027
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:08,906
You should take
another step backwards.

1028
01:56:09,036 --> 01:56:11,630
It's these steps backwards

1029
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:14,150
that lead one to Golgotha.

1030
01:56:23,156 --> 01:56:28,549
It seems that the time allocated
to people has passed,

1031
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:32,706
and time has acquired
its own form.

1032
01:56:32,796 --> 01:56:35,151
It's likely that the system

1033
01:56:35,236 --> 01:56:38,467
knows the days
of your birth and death.

1034
01:56:48,076 --> 01:56:52,354
The sky remained the last
hidden truth about the Earth.

1035
01:56:53,236 --> 01:56:55,591
Now the sky is disappearing,

1036
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:59,669
and leaving the stars
to be included in the system.

1037
01:57:00,876 --> 01:57:04,425
Now the system
has also got hold of the stars.

1038
01:57:05,436 --> 01:57:08,473
The stars
are also working for it.

1039
01:57:08,556 --> 01:57:12,674
The sky and the earth are dying
in order to leave the system.

1040
01:57:12,756 --> 01:57:16,544
We are now almost living
on a different planet.

1041
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:40,714
My little one,
your heart has its own body.

1042
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:47,065
It's so transparent
that it is invisible.

1043
01:57:48,356 --> 01:57:52,269
Its poverty is profound.

1044
01:57:53,956 --> 01:57:57,346
This is the eye of Jesus Christ.

1045
01:57:58,956 --> 01:58:03,427
That's why it's impossible
to deceive it.

1046
01:58:03,516 --> 01:58:06,269
It even sees your parents
as destitute...

1047
01:58:07,276 --> 01:58:10,552
...so that you can also
see them as destitute,

1048
01:58:10,636 --> 01:58:16,268
as well as yourself as destitute,
and your girlfriend.

1049

Chapter Vlll

1050
01:58:28,556 --> 01:58:32,390
THE BORDERS
OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL

1051
01:58:45,596 --> 01:58:49,350
Once a man lived on Earth.
His name was Abraham.

1052
01:58:49,436 --> 01:58:54,590
He was no longer young when he
heard a voice say, "Get up and go."

1053
01:58:54,676 --> 01:59:00,865
So this man left everything
behind and went.

1054
01:59:02,236 --> 01:59:08,232
The route he took became
the border of the state of Israel.

1055
01:59:09,676 --> 01:59:12,474
There is no such state
as Israel,

1056
01:59:12,556 --> 01:59:17,584
yet the border of this state
cuts through everything on Earth.

1057
01:59:27,716 --> 01:59:31,709
That beggar said that
the border of the state of Israel

1058
01:59:31,796 --> 01:59:34,310
lies across his face.

1059
01:59:57,556 --> 02:00:01,071
The system covers
an ever increasing area.

1060
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:06,787
It's always possible
to recall a person from any place.

1061
02:00:08,476 --> 02:00:13,106
One day, in a canteen,
in front of a bowl of soup,

1062
02:00:13,196 --> 02:00:17,986
you'll suddenly realise
how tired and how ill you are.

1063
02:00:19,196 --> 02:00:23,314
Nobody will seem
to be doing any harm to you.

1064
02:00:24,636 --> 02:00:27,275
Yet the state of things

1065
02:00:27,356 --> 02:00:31,588
will lead you
to an almost unbearable condition.

1066
02:00:32,396 --> 02:00:35,115
It will be enough for you

1067
02:00:35,196 --> 02:00:39,030
not to find a place
to wash your underwear or a shirt.

1068
02:00:39,116 --> 02:00:43,234
In a week
you'll turn into a pauper.

1069
02:00:45,396 --> 02:00:49,230
What will happen then?

1070
02:00:50,756 --> 02:00:54,305
A very peculiar thing will happen:

1071
02:00:54,396 --> 02:00:58,548
Outsiders will seek protection
with the authorities.

1072
02:00:58,636 --> 02:01:01,230
What's really terrible

1073
02:01:01,316 --> 02:01:05,514
is that the authorities will protect
and take care of them

1074
02:01:05,596 --> 02:01:09,350
and will give them jobs.

1075
02:01:27,676 --> 02:01:31,908
This mute old man believes
that the state of Israel

1076
02:01:31,996 --> 02:01:34,715
lies within the borders
of his house.

1077
02:01:34,796 --> 02:01:38,994
He's reinforced the border
of the state of Israel with a fence,

1078
02:01:39,076 --> 02:01:44,025
and one day every year
he measures its length with a stick.

1079
02:02:01,316 --> 02:02:04,786
He finds new planks
and reinforces the border,

1080
02:02:04,876 --> 02:02:08,027
so that the pile of rubbish
doesn't overwhelm it.

1081
02:02:08,116 --> 02:02:13,270
There, inside the fence, is a pile,
a pile of rubbish.

1082
02:02:14,356 --> 02:02:17,154
This pile of rubbish
is his house.

1083
02:02:18,156 --> 02:02:20,351
It's one huge dust-heap.

1084
02:02:21,396 --> 02:02:27,107
At times this dust-heap
doesn't let him in.

1085
02:02:28,156 --> 02:02:29,430
It presses on the door...

1086
02:02:29,516 --> 02:02:32,872
...and makes it hard for the old man
to enter his house.

1087
02:02:37,396 --> 02:02:41,275
The doors don't open due to
the rubbish he has collected.

1088
02:02:41,356 --> 02:02:43,824
Sometimes passers-by help him

1089
02:02:43,916 --> 02:02:47,829
and push him inside,
to the dust-heap.

1090
02:02:58,716 --> 02:03:06,430
He can only make money
by selling paper to the state...

1091
02:03:07,836 --> 02:03:11,385
...but the heap keeps growing.

1092
02:03:19,476 --> 02:03:21,944
Several times, people tried
to wean the old man off his heap...

1093
02:03:22,036 --> 02:03:25,745
...and burnt it,
but it would grow again and again.

1094
02:03:46,116 --> 02:03:48,471
Imagine this:

1095
02:03:48,556 --> 02:03:54,188
There are a certain number
of young people within the system.

1096
02:03:54,796 --> 02:03:58,186
To find out how they differ
from each other

1097
02:03:58,276 --> 02:04:00,551
they should be dissected.

1098
02:04:02,356 --> 02:04:05,712
Then their full potential
will become known.

1099
02:04:05,796 --> 02:04:10,870
Constant pressure will force
your psyche to move ahead of you.

1100
02:04:10,956 --> 02:04:13,709
It will adopt
the mode of behaviour

1101
02:04:13,796 --> 02:04:18,711
to accommodate that pressure,
and not to accommodate you.

1102
02:04:20,516 --> 02:04:25,067
If you can't catch up
with your own psychic development,

1103
02:04:25,156 --> 02:04:29,274
you'll find yourself impotent
in this system.

1104
02:04:31,716 --> 02:04:36,346
That's why, just as
you would take a medicine,

1105
02:04:36,436 --> 02:04:38,791
take on the image of a pauper.

1106
02:04:38,876 --> 02:04:42,186
Remember,
the image of a pauper

1107
02:04:42,276 --> 02:04:44,631
is always ahead of the system.

1108
02:04:45,796 --> 02:04:47,787
Adopt it.

1109
02:04:48,636 --> 02:04:52,993
Otherwise, people are
going to be brought out

1110
02:04:53,076 --> 02:04:58,230
out of their usual state of being,
to become different people.

1111
02:05:06,356 --> 02:05:12,545
Any human potential will be used,
first of all, as a means.

1112
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:18,914
Any human potential
will be turned into a means.

1113
02:05:18,996 --> 02:05:24,024
And those gifted
will unwillingly persecute

1114
02:05:24,116 --> 02:05:30,112
and kill those who are talentless
with their life energy.

1115
02:05:31,396 --> 02:05:36,151
If you're unable to carry out
focused psychological work,

1116
02:05:36,236 --> 02:05:40,752
then you'll find yourself
among the socially ill.

1117
02:05:40,836 --> 02:05:43,873
This is the basic secret
of the system.

1118
02:05:44,836 --> 02:05:48,909
Imagine such
a blood-chilling allegory.

1119
02:05:48,996 --> 02:05:53,945
Only strong people
will retain the ability to work.

1120
02:05:54,036 --> 02:06:00,111
They'll become teachers, priests,
scientists, students.

1121
02:06:01,076 --> 02:06:04,751
God save you
from becoming one of these!

1122
02:06:06,156 --> 02:06:09,273
It's like buying the clothes
of a murder victim

1123
02:06:09,356 --> 02:06:12,666
from a second-hand shop
and wearing them.

1124
02:06:15,316 --> 02:06:19,389
But you won't be able
to move far in such clothes.

1125
02:06:23,436 --> 02:06:25,552
Children will be the first

1126
02:06:25,636 --> 02:06:28,787
to get used
to these inhuman conditions,

1127
02:06:28,876 --> 02:06:31,948
and I'm afraid for you,
my little one.

1128
02:06:33,956 --> 02:06:36,550
I haven't got much time left...

1129
02:06:37,556 --> 02:06:42,505
...and I don't know how to help you,
and what advice to give.

1130
02:06:42,596 --> 02:06:44,951
I really don't know.

1131
02:06:46,236 --> 02:06:49,706
I can't offer
a place of salvation to you.

1132
02:06:51,276 --> 02:06:53,506
You'll leave...

1133
02:06:54,756 --> 02:06:59,227
...and the one who deserves
salvation more than you,

1134
02:06:59,316 --> 02:07:01,625
will stay.

1135
02:07:02,636 --> 02:07:05,150
You'll leave him...

1136
02:07:06,476 --> 02:07:10,947
...and run away.
Run away? Where to?

1137
02:07:11,036 --> 02:07:15,712
The system has
geographic boundaries no longer.

1138
02:07:19,196 --> 02:07:22,711
One thing is to run from
a concentration camp, like Osventsim,

1139
02:07:22,796 --> 02:07:26,186
from barbed wire,
far from Europe.

1140
02:07:27,196 --> 02:07:32,031
Another thing is to run today
from the intellectual fascism.

1141
02:07:33,476 --> 02:07:37,754
Where can you run to
to escape intellectual fascism?

1142
02:07:37,836 --> 02:07:40,509
Where can you set your foot?

1143
02:07:58,956 --> 02:08:02,471
The code of the place
where we are now...

1144
02:08:03,876 --> 02:08:06,674
...used to be the code

1145
02:08:06,756 --> 02:08:10,066
of the latitude embracing
all that's alive.

1146
02:08:10,996 --> 02:08:15,672
But today the code of this place
is not that latitude.

1147
02:08:15,756 --> 02:08:19,635
It doesn't embrace
but sieves into all that's alive,

1148
02:08:19,836 --> 02:08:22,509
into others' flesh and blood.

1149
02:08:23,516 --> 02:08:26,952
That's why the system
will need you at any point,

1150
02:08:27,036 --> 02:08:29,596
wherever you may go.

1151
02:08:49,356 --> 02:08:53,395
People say that
once this woman was very rich,

1152
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:56,548
and that the mute old man loves her,

1153
02:08:56,636 --> 02:09:00,914
and wants to take her in,
up to the mountain.

1154
02:09:13,676 --> 02:09:15,985
Every day,
on her way from church,

1155
02:09:16,076 --> 02:09:19,193
she travels along the border
of the state of Israel.

1156
02:09:19,276 --> 02:09:22,746
She says that she feels
like Natasha Rostov -

1157
02:09:22,836 --> 02:09:26,590
her life is passing
and there is no love.

1158
02:09:30,996 --> 02:09:35,387
The old man starts calling her,
up to the mountain.

1159
02:09:35,476 --> 02:09:38,468
But she,
just as with all his neighbours,

1160
02:09:38,556 --> 02:09:44,267
knows that the old man went mad
after his son had left him.

1161
02:09:44,356 --> 02:09:47,712
The woman in the wheelchair
is afraid of the old man.

1162
02:09:47,796 --> 02:09:50,310
She throws stones at him.

1163
02:09:51,436 --> 02:09:55,748
When she passes along the border
of his state, he moans,

1164
02:09:55,836 --> 02:10:00,785
calls the neighbours and dances,
holding his certificates.

1165
02:10:04,796 --> 02:10:08,232
These certificates show
that he has a son,

1166
02:10:08,316 --> 02:10:14,755
and that this woman in
the wheelchair was once his wife.

1167
02:10:53,596 --> 02:10:58,670
On the surface, the system
may be in opposition with itself.

1168
02:10:59,996 --> 02:11:02,715
It may even fall into pieces.

1169
02:11:03,716 --> 02:11:07,550
But it's only
the outward manifestation.

1170
02:11:19,076 --> 02:11:23,035
I don't believe the system
maliciously plans anything.

1171
02:11:23,116 --> 02:11:25,311
It just wants to be.

1172
02:11:25,396 --> 02:11:29,150
The evil which comes
from the system

1173
02:11:29,236 --> 02:11:32,353
appears only in my mind.

1174
02:11:32,436 --> 02:11:38,227
"Don't do evil in response to evil"
is the first tenet of freedom.

1175
02:13:28,996 --> 02:13:31,794
Chapter IX

1176
02:13:31,876 --> 02:13:35,073
THE IRON BED

1177
02:13:43,676 --> 02:13:50,024
One beggar said that Christians
are creatures mad with love.

1178
02:13:51,116 --> 02:13:54,870
They leave their dirty homes
to go into town,

1179
02:13:54,956 --> 02:13:59,950
and it's often hard to tell them
apart from ordinary people.

1180
02:14:00,036 --> 02:14:03,392
They seem to be the same kind
of people as everyone else.

1181
02:14:03,476 --> 02:14:07,992
But they don't want
their sexual life

1182
02:14:08,076 --> 02:14:10,636
to take place within the system.

1183
02:14:10,716 --> 02:14:15,471
That's why they make love
through death.

1184
02:14:17,236 --> 02:14:20,467
Christians are people
who have learnt

1185
02:14:20,556 --> 02:14:24,674
how to kiss each other
through death.

1186
02:14:26,396 --> 02:14:28,387
It's possible, after all,

1187
02:14:28,476 --> 02:14:32,230
to kiss a girl through
her clothes, her dress,

1188
02:14:32,316 --> 02:14:35,114
and they do
the same sort of thing.

1189
02:14:35,196 --> 02:14:39,269
It's possible to kiss
the death of another person

1190
02:14:39,356 --> 02:14:42,428
through one's own death.

1191
02:14:44,316 --> 02:14:48,275
My little son,
I would like you to learn

1192
02:14:48,356 --> 02:14:50,665
how to kiss
your girlfriend through death,

1193
02:14:50,756 --> 02:14:53,316
with your lips.

1194
02:14:53,396 --> 02:14:55,910
Kiss the air around her.

1195
02:14:56,876 --> 02:15:02,075
As soon as you start kissing
your girlfriend through death,

1196
02:15:02,156 --> 02:15:06,434
you'll feel how your death
is turning into her body.

1197
02:15:08,516 --> 02:15:12,509
And for this body
you'll give your life.

1198
02:15:30,316 --> 02:15:32,784
Chapter X

1199
02:15:32,876 --> 02:15:36,346
THE PARLIAMENT OF BIRDS

1200
02:15:41,596 --> 02:15:43,587
My little one...

1201
02:15:44,956 --> 02:15:47,390
...I had a weird dream.

1202
02:15:47,476 --> 02:15:52,266
I was in our city,
yet it was totally different.

1203
02:15:54,356 --> 02:15:57,029
It was covered in snow,

1204
02:15:57,116 --> 02:16:01,348
and instead of buildings and streets,
there were cemetery paths.

1205
02:16:01,436 --> 02:16:08,194
Instead of people, there were
tombstones forming families.

1206
02:16:08,276 --> 02:16:12,394
They lent against one another,
holding each other up.

1207
02:16:12,516 --> 02:16:14,711
They led their own lives.

1208
02:16:15,796 --> 02:16:19,789
These were people
who had changed a lot.

1209
02:16:20,836 --> 02:16:24,067
Answers to questions
about life and death

1210
02:16:24,156 --> 02:16:26,670
were written across their faces.

1211
02:16:31,836 --> 02:16:34,873
They were crying
with these letters.

1212
02:16:35,916 --> 02:16:39,352
It seemed to me that the letters
were not letters at all,

1213
02:16:39,436 --> 02:16:41,791
but posthumous kisses.

1214
02:16:41,876 --> 02:16:46,427
They were all saying something,
but I couldn't understand.

1215
02:16:54,116 --> 02:16:56,630
There were people everywhere.

1216
02:16:56,716 --> 02:16:59,230
The tombstones surrounded me.

1217
02:17:00,356 --> 02:17:03,109
They were wishing me only good.

1218
02:17:06,596 --> 02:17:09,269
My little son,

1219
02:17:09,356 --> 02:17:13,235
not to kiss your beloved
is the same as to kiss her.

1220
02:17:17,076 --> 02:17:21,308
Not to kiss your beloved
is the same as to kiss her.

1221
02:17:35,396 --> 02:17:38,229
That's it, my little one.

1222
02:17:40,156 --> 02:17:42,386
Do you remember Srulik?

1223
02:17:42,476 --> 02:17:46,515
I've just remembered how
he waved his hands and said,

1224
02:17:46,596 --> 02:17:49,349
"This is my life..."

1225
02:18:02,916 --> 02:18:04,907
My little son...

1226
02:18:06,316 --> 02:18:08,750
This is my life.

1227
02:18:11,036 --> 02:18:13,470
This is my life.

1228
02:18:17,636 --> 02:18:19,706
This is my life.

1229
02:18:21,036 --> 02:18:23,789
This is my life.

1230
02:18:26,756 --> 02:18:29,031
This is my life.

1231
02:18:34,156 --> 02:18:40,231
A film by
Artur Aristakisyan

1232
02:18:40,556 --> 02:18:42,353
Music by Giuseppe Verdi

1233
02:18:42,436 --> 02:18:46,111
and a poem of Naum Kaplan

1234
02:18:46,196 --> 02:18:48,152
have been used in the film

1235
02:18:48,476 --> 02:18:54,233
THE END

1236
02:19:12,787 --> 02:19:19,977
<i>What was the inspiration
behind you becoming a director?</i>

1237
02:19:22,227 --> 02:19:29,338
<i>I needed to do something.
I needed to make a living somehow.</i>

1238
02:19:31,467 --> 02:19:34,220
I needed to pass the time somehow.

1239
02:19:37,107 --> 02:19:40,577
I needed to assuage...

1240
02:19:42,587 --> 02:19:47,661
...my ambition and my vanity
in some way.

1241
02:19:50,267 --> 02:19:55,785
The most important thing
was to do something,

1242
02:19:55,867 --> 02:19:59,303
to live and feel myself
to be fully human.

1243
02:19:59,387 --> 02:20:02,618
<i>Were there
any specific films, people</i>

1244
02:20:02,747 --> 02:20:08,140
<i>or events that were influential?</i>

1245
02:20:11,907 --> 02:20:18,096
People I saw on the street
who no-one was paying attention to.

1246
02:20:18,227 --> 02:20:21,856
<i>I was interested in observing them.</i>

1247
02:20:23,667 --> 02:20:26,818
<i>I could have gone on
observing these people forever.</i>

1248
02:20:26,947 --> 02:20:30,337
<i>I was sorry
I couldn't do this my whole life</i>

1249
02:20:30,467 --> 02:20:33,186
<i>and make it my profession.</i>

1250
02:20:33,267 --> 02:20:36,225
<i>Then I saw some old films.</i>

1251
02:20:40,387 --> 02:20:43,857
<i>Old Italian films...</i>

1252
02:20:46,507 --> 02:20:51,865
<i>And then somehow,
when I was about 16,</i>

1253
02:20:51,947 --> 02:21:00,025
<i>it soon became clear...
that I would do something on film.</i>

1254
02:21:00,107 --> 02:21:05,625
That is, something photographic
in relation to life.

1255
02:21:07,467 --> 02:21:13,622
The most photographic thing of all
is cinema because it records life.

1256
02:21:20,907 --> 02:21:23,296
Flat snippets of time.

1257
02:21:25,107 --> 02:21:27,621
Of people in flat snippets of time.

1258
02:21:28,867 --> 02:21:31,176
So I went into cinema.

1259
02:21:31,267 --> 02:21:33,940
<i>So, in "Palms" there arose...</i>

1260
02:21:34,067 --> 02:21:39,937
<i>From a dialogue
and experimentation with the film.</i>

1261
02:21:40,027 --> 02:21:45,340
<i>I was interested in the film itself
as a certain type of substance.</i>

1262
02:21:45,467 --> 02:21:48,265
<i>A light bearing substance...</i>

1263
02:21:50,867 --> 02:21:55,497
<i>... which speaks in the language
of photographic reality.</i>

1264
02:21:58,667 --> 02:22:02,945
To do something new
was what I least wanted to do.

1265
02:22:06,467 --> 02:22:09,698
I wanted to create
a certain type of film.

1266
02:22:12,467 --> 02:22:17,143
The film is
the main dramatis persona in "Palms".

1267
02:22:23,507 --> 02:22:29,457
The figures of the downtrodden only
serve to reveal the film's density

1268
02:22:29,547 --> 02:22:33,506
and its life blood,
if there is such a thing.

1269
02:22:36,507 --> 02:22:40,466
<i>Why did you choose
these figures to depict this?</i>

1270
02:22:40,587 --> 02:22:43,260
<i>Was it coincidence
or were they an ideal?</i>

1271
02:22:43,387 --> 02:22:47,141
The downtrodden seemed to me
to be that language,

1272
02:22:47,267 --> 02:22:52,978
allowing one to see the film itself,
if you can put it that way.

1273
02:22:53,067 --> 02:22:56,104
<i>To see and to feel
with one's eyes.</i>

1274
02:22:57,747 --> 02:23:02,218
<i>The film was shot like a string
of prayer beads for the eyes.</i>

1275
02:23:02,347 --> 02:23:08,104
<i>When we watch a film with our eyes,
we sift through these beads.</i>

1276
02:23:08,227 --> 02:23:15,815
<i>And the figures of these poor people
in the film polish up our vision</i>

1277
02:23:15,947 --> 02:23:21,817
<i>and our eyes in much the same way
as the prayer beads</i>

1278
02:23:21,907 --> 02:23:27,664
<i>made out of bits of cloth or stones
polish the fingers of those who pray.</i>

1279
02:23:30,707 --> 02:23:36,942
Thus each frame of this film
should polish the eyes

1280
02:23:38,467 --> 02:23:41,027
of the person watching the film.

1281
02:23:44,427 --> 02:23:51,299
<i>How did you succeed
in making the film look so old,</i>

1282
02:23:51,387 --> 02:23:57,178
<i>as if it had just been dug up
by archaeologists?</i>

1283
02:23:57,307 --> 02:24:03,985
<i>It was very simple. I had to
duplicate the image represented</i>

1284
02:24:04,067 --> 02:24:08,185
by transferring it
from 1 6mm to 35mm film.

1285
02:24:09,267 --> 02:24:12,259
From narrow to wide format.

1286
02:24:12,347 --> 02:24:17,057
<i>It's clear that the representation
is very simple and home-made.</i>

1287
02:24:19,387 --> 02:24:24,666
Like a black and white fresco
that is cracking and flaking a bit.

1288
02:24:31,467 --> 02:24:40,136
<i>Could you tell us a little bit
about the specific place,</i>

1289
02:24:42,027 --> 02:24:48,978
<i>the time and the people
appearing in the film?</i>

1290
02:24:49,067 --> 02:24:53,618
<i>How typical were they?</i>

1291
02:24:53,707 --> 02:25:00,738
It was a town in which everything
was clear to me, where I feel great.

1292
02:25:00,867 --> 02:25:03,984
I felt completely at home there.

1293
02:25:05,547 --> 02:25:08,380
<i>Kishinev was my whole world.</i>

1294
02:25:08,467 --> 02:25:11,664
<i>It would have been different
had it been another town.</i>

1295
02:25:11,747 --> 02:25:16,980
<i>But the whole world and all other
worlds resided in Kishinev for me.</i>

1296
02:25:17,107 --> 02:25:21,658
<i>How typical were the things
that you showed?</i>

1297
02:25:21,787 --> 02:25:24,984
<i>Was this part of town
an exception?</i>

1298
02:25:25,067 --> 02:25:29,936
<i>No, it was a town
and there were people there.</i>

1299
02:25:30,027 --> 02:25:33,099
<i>There are poor people in any town.</i>

1300
02:25:33,187 --> 02:25:36,020
<i>I filmed people
to whom I had access.</i>

1301
02:25:36,107 --> 02:25:41,135
I explained it wasn't for television,
the cinema or a newspaper.

1302
02:25:43,227 --> 02:25:46,776
It was for my love of it.

1303
02:25:46,907 --> 02:25:52,504
I didn't think I would make a film
out of it at the time.

1304
02:25:53,467 --> 02:25:56,504
<i>I just felt that I had to film
and film and film...</i>

1305
02:25:56,587 --> 02:26:02,059
<i>I was interested in the people,
their actions,</i>

1306
02:26:02,147 --> 02:26:07,460
<i>their figures,
their close-ups as a language,</i>

1307
02:26:07,547 --> 02:26:09,856
<i>like a sort of code...</i>

1308
02:26:11,747 --> 02:26:17,026
<i>A code through which
you can talk with people.</i>

1309
02:26:20,347 --> 02:26:25,057
A certain non-verbal language -
a visual language.

1310
02:26:26,907 --> 02:26:29,501
<i>Did you think about the end product</i>

1311
02:26:29,627 --> 02:26:33,302
<i>or were you prepared
to keep filming indefinitely?</i>

1312
02:26:33,427 --> 02:26:37,739
A lot of material accumulated
and I decided to turn it into a film.

1313
02:26:37,867 --> 02:26:42,258
At the basis of this film
lies one person's monologue.

1314
02:26:42,387 --> 02:26:47,541
A monologue addressed not so much
to another person or to God

1315
02:26:47,627 --> 02:26:51,666
but a monologue to someone...

1316
02:26:56,667 --> 02:27:00,342
...yet to come into this world,
but of flesh and bone -

1317
02:27:00,427 --> 02:27:03,578
a child still in its mother's womb...

1318
02:27:05,107 --> 02:27:07,746
<i>... who will certainly be killed.</i>

1319
02:27:08,627 --> 02:27:11,380
<i>A child destined not to live.</i>

1320
02:27:17,547 --> 02:27:23,702
<i>And the conceptual part
of the message to your son.</i>

1321
02:27:23,787 --> 02:27:30,943
<i>Was this message
a reflection of these images</i>

1322
02:27:32,667 --> 02:27:37,138
<i>or did it ripen
of its own accord...</i>

1323
02:27:37,227 --> 02:27:42,017
<i>Did it develop independently?</i>

1324
02:27:42,107 --> 02:27:47,181
No. There was a man in Kishinev
who would walk the streets all day

1325
02:27:47,307 --> 02:27:51,505
talking to his unborn son.
This man existed.

1326
02:27:51,627 --> 02:27:53,822
He never talked to anyone.

1327
02:27:53,947 --> 02:28:01,865
But sometimes if one
wanted to hear what he was saying,

1328
02:28:02,827 --> 02:28:06,979
one could follow him
and listen to what he was saying.

1329
02:28:09,187 --> 02:28:15,786
He would spend all day
talking to his unborn son.

1330
02:28:15,907 --> 02:28:20,344
His wife had gone off with another
man and got rid of their child.

1331
02:28:20,467 --> 02:28:23,027
But he continued to talk to his son.

1332
02:28:27,547 --> 02:28:32,667
When I was still quite young
I overheard a part of what he said.

1333
02:28:36,627 --> 02:28:40,939
Therefore it was easier for me

1334
02:28:42,067 --> 02:28:47,141
to tell my story...
through this person.

1335
02:28:51,707 --> 02:28:57,304
<i>The film is the conversation between
this person and his unborn son.</i>

1336
02:28:57,387 --> 02:29:01,460
<i>We don't see this person -
we only hear his voice.</i>

1337
02:29:10,947 --> 02:29:16,544
<i>Going back to the people in the film,
did you know them personally?</i>

1338
02:29:16,627 --> 02:29:20,779
No. I shot people
who I saw in the street...

1339
02:29:23,547 --> 02:29:26,380
...and in the houses I went into.

1340
02:29:26,467 --> 02:29:31,143
I could go freely into these houses
without permission.

1341
02:29:33,827 --> 02:29:39,663
It was a squalid little place
where the poor people lived.

1342
02:29:44,267 --> 02:29:49,341
<i>The intimate way the film was shot
gives the impression</i>

1343
02:29:49,467 --> 02:29:51,856
<i>that you'd lived with them.</i>

1344
02:29:51,987 --> 02:29:55,138
I don't remember that.
I was distanced from them.

1345
02:29:55,267 --> 02:30:00,899
I didn't set myself any goal
to create such a feeling.

1346
02:30:00,987 --> 02:30:07,222
<i>I don't remember that any particular
closeness arose between us.</i>

1347
02:30:07,347 --> 02:30:10,657
<i>I would stay with them
or follow behind</i>

1348
02:30:10,787 --> 02:30:15,781
<i>and just filmed them
and that was it.</i>

1349
02:30:15,867 --> 02:30:21,703
<i>I remember one accusation made
in the cinema in London -</i>

1350
02:30:21,787 --> 02:30:27,384
<i>that you used these people
instead of helping them.</i>

1351
02:30:27,467 --> 02:30:35,420
<i>That what they needed
was basic social welfare</i>

1352
02:30:35,507 --> 02:30:40,262
<i>rather than the theories</i>

1353
02:30:40,387 --> 02:30:46,257
<i>that you were proposing to them.</i>

1354
02:30:46,387 --> 02:30:51,017
I have never proposed any esoteric
theories to anyone - God forbid!

1355
02:30:51,107 --> 02:30:54,179
I'm an artist, not a social worker.

1356
02:30:54,307 --> 02:30:58,061
These people
simply existed for me as models.

1357
02:31:00,667 --> 02:31:03,306
A painter sees a person on the street

1358
02:31:03,427 --> 02:31:08,547
and invites him and pays him if he
can't persuade him to pose for free.

1359
02:31:08,667 --> 02:31:14,185
An artist pulls these poor people
and alcoholics into his studio...

1360
02:31:14,307 --> 02:31:18,505
and creates portraits
of kings and prophets out of them

1361
02:31:18,627 --> 02:31:21,903
and then sends them on their way.

1362
02:31:23,787 --> 02:31:29,783
It was exactly the same for me.
There was no common human tie.

1363
02:31:29,907 --> 02:31:35,743
I didn't think about them
or their lives for long.

1364
02:31:35,867 --> 02:31:38,301
It was more a dialogue with myself.

1365
02:31:38,427 --> 02:31:43,660
It had and has nothing,
and can have nothing to do with them.

1366
02:31:46,387 --> 02:31:49,857
I am the artist
and they are the models.

1367
02:32:17,947 --> 02:32:20,461
<i>And the stories
you told about them.</i>

1368
02:32:20,547 --> 02:32:26,338
<i>Did they came from them or from you</i>

1369
02:32:26,427 --> 02:32:31,182
<i>or was it a combination of the two?</i>

1370
02:32:32,347 --> 02:32:39,185
No. I recorded their voices
and remembered their stories

1371
02:32:39,307 --> 02:32:41,867
<i>and sometimes I had a camera.</i>

1372
02:32:41,947 --> 02:32:45,622
<i>When I was filming them myself
I heard their voices.</i>

1373
02:32:45,707 --> 02:32:52,704
<i>And then out of their stories
I wrote biographical allegories.</i>

1374
02:32:52,787 --> 02:32:59,784
<i>Out of the lives of two people
I would write the story of one.</i>

1375
02:33:01,107 --> 02:33:05,623
<i>So their life histories would sound
like allegories or fairytales.</i>

1376
02:33:07,467 --> 02:33:13,064
<i>Did you write these stories
while filming or later on?</i>

1377
02:33:15,627 --> 02:33:22,066
<i>The stories of their lives were
written before and during the shoot.</i>

1378
02:33:22,187 --> 02:33:25,418
<i>They wrote themselves
during my life in Kishinev.</i>

1379
02:33:25,547 --> 02:33:29,426
<i>Nevertheless, I didn't change
a single fact within these stories.</i>

1380
02:33:29,547 --> 02:33:33,904
<i>I discarded everything
that was superfluous</i>

1381
02:33:34,027 --> 02:33:37,656
<i>and created these allegories.</i>

1382
02:33:39,067 --> 02:33:43,379
<i>And I recorded them
whilst dubbing the film.</i>

1383
02:33:44,427 --> 02:33:46,418
It was improvisation.

1384
02:33:46,507 --> 02:33:53,379
When I was dubbing the film,
telling the stories of these people,

1385
02:33:53,507 --> 02:33:58,740
I simply talked via these images
that I saw on the screen

1386
02:33:58,867 --> 02:34:01,700
and just continued to talk.

1387
02:34:05,147 --> 02:34:08,264
Then I would discard any text
that was superfluous.

1388
02:34:08,387 --> 02:34:11,743
It all came out of the darkness.

1389
02:34:11,867 --> 02:34:13,823
The screen would light up,

1390
02:34:15,067 --> 02:34:18,980
I would see the figures
of these poor people,

1391
02:34:19,107 --> 02:34:21,940
the frames flew past
and I just talked.

1392
02:34:28,147 --> 02:34:31,856
That is how
this monologue came into being.

1393
02:34:31,987 --> 02:34:34,979
It was definitely born
in the darkness.

1394
02:34:35,907 --> 02:34:40,458
In the darkness of the hall
where the recording was playing.

1395
02:35:10,427 --> 02:35:14,420
<i>How was the film received in Russia
and the rest of the world?</i>

1396
02:35:14,507 --> 02:35:18,216
These sorts of films...
are usually viewed

1397
02:35:18,307 --> 02:35:25,987
either with rapture or hostility,
even by people in the arts.

1398
02:35:27,227 --> 02:35:32,665
And that was how it was viewed.
Most people were hostile to it.

1399
02:35:35,707 --> 02:35:38,016
<i>How was this hostility expressed?</i>

1400
02:35:38,107 --> 02:35:43,181
Resentment.
Complete rejection of the film.

1401
02:35:44,427 --> 02:35:47,703
Rejection of the message
behind the film.

1402
02:35:52,187 --> 02:35:55,179
Resentment towards this message.

1403
02:35:56,547 --> 02:35:59,983
This message is very difficult.

1404
02:36:03,067 --> 02:36:09,700
This message is more emotional
than anything else.

1405
02:36:10,947 --> 02:36:15,737
<i>It's very difficult
to define in words.</i>

1406
02:36:18,627 --> 02:36:23,542
<i>But this is the message
behind the film.</i>

1407
02:36:25,147 --> 02:36:27,263
<i>That's the spirit of it.</i>

1408
02:36:33,147 --> 02:36:41,065
<i>There is a lot that is ecstatic,
hysterical and insane in it.</i>

1409
02:36:43,187 --> 02:36:46,862
It used to be called
amateur filmmaking.

1410
02:36:50,027 --> 02:36:52,825
Honest, personal filmmaking.

1411
02:36:54,587 --> 02:36:58,102
Auteur cinema.
You can call it what you like.

1412
02:36:58,187 --> 02:37:04,103
I don't think
there is an apt name for it.

1413
02:37:06,387 --> 02:37:08,821
It's filmmaking and that's it.

1414
02:37:10,467 --> 02:37:12,662
<i>Does that mean
you achieved your aim?</i>

1415
02:37:12,747 --> 02:37:15,864
<i>No. This is just an attempt.</i>

1416
02:37:20,787 --> 02:37:24,985
It works at certain moments...

1417
02:37:27,827 --> 02:37:34,346
...in a way
that I can't express in words.

1418
02:37:34,467 --> 02:37:36,856
Although the film is quite long

1419
02:37:36,987 --> 02:37:39,706
it only takes place
in several episodes.

1420
02:37:43,667 --> 02:37:48,536
These episodes
were not planned by me.

1421
02:37:49,507 --> 02:37:52,180
<i>These episodes came about...</i>

1422
02:37:55,747 --> 02:37:57,942
<i>They arose...</i>

1423
02:38:01,387 --> 02:38:06,984
<i>... of their own accord later on.</i>

1424
02:38:09,507 --> 02:38:11,975
<i>During the creation of the film.</i>

1425
02:38:14,907 --> 02:38:22,177
For example at five or six moments
when somehow...

1426
02:38:24,387 --> 02:38:29,302
...the image,
the voice and the music

1427
02:38:30,747 --> 02:38:36,185
<i>or the absence of a voice
or music came together.</i>

1428
02:38:36,267 --> 02:38:39,657
<i>Something coincided,
something that we see and hear.</i>

1429
02:38:43,547 --> 02:38:48,018
Such films are made blindly.

1430
02:38:51,907 --> 02:38:57,584
This happens not because
it was something I wanted to happen,

1431
02:38:59,907 --> 02:39:03,104
but simply
because it just happened that way.
