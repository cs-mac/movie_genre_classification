What I said was,
"One's experience of guilt

00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,156
is a conditioned response,

which objective reasoning
can overcome."

00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,604
What's he talking about?

169
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:10,976
Oh, a girl went missing
up at the lake,

170
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,977
a cheerleader from Eastfield.

171
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,378
Z told him
there's a crazy person

172
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,312
in the woods who eats kids.

173
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,117
[sighs] Very Brothers Grimm.

174
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,519
She's definitely
gonna be an English major.

175
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,653
You know, I'm worried, actually,

176
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,124
'cause the kids ride
their bikes up there.

177
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:26,655
Was she lost or abducted?

178
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:27,558
They don't know.

179
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,692
You know, she's 17.

180
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,063
She could have run away.

181
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,230
Well, maybe we just say
no bikes after dark

182
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,701
up at the lake
until they know more.

183
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,004
What are you looking for?

184
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,473
I thought you were saving that.

185
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,444
What happened, Ev?

186
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,146
Nothing.

187
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,113
Well, nothing new, anyway.

188
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,718
Santos read my book, though,
called it extraordinary.

189
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,288
Well, isn't that good?

190
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,657
Then right on cue, he brings
up my enrollment numbers

191
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:00,655
and proceeds
to give me his thoughts

192
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,627
for 20 of the longest minutes
of my life.

193
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,298
Why the Chateau?

194
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,201
Well, at this point, why not?

195
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,741
I wonder sometimes if we made the
right choice coming down here.

196
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,477
Well, we don't really have
much of a choice.

197
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:23,549
To another school year.

198
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,655
[woman] Okay, here's the drill.

199
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,425
Right diagonal, left diagonal.

200
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,296
[chatter continues indistinctly]

201
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,176
- Wow.
- [laughter]

202
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,509
Come on, ladies. Let's focus.

203
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,513
We have to get this
down by tomorrow.

204
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:57,583
[laughs]

205
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,086
Have fun storming the castle.

206
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,620
- Bye!
- Bye.

207
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,222
Have you ever thought
about going back to teaching

208
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:08,124
when the kids
get a little older?

209
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,127
No, thanks.

210
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,793
Universities are elitist,
cutthroat places.

211
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,296
364 days of the year,

212
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,465
I don't even think about it.

213
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,069
Well, I always tell people Ellen is
the smartest woman I know. [chuckles]

214
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,570
Hey, how about high schools?

215
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,074
Aren't they always
looking for, uh, subs?

216
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,179
Oh, can you imagine what that
mother is going through?

217
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,681
She is so young.

218
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,447
I hope they catch whoever did it

219
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,753
and fry his sicko A-S-S.

220
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,759
[knock on door]

221
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:48,699
Hi. Come on in.

222
00:12:58,642 --> 00:12:59,677
Anna.

223
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,412
Thought I saw
your name on the roll.

224
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:02,677
How was your summer?

225
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,312
It was great, actually.

226
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,682
Um, I went to Greece after all.

227
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:07,884
- You did go? Fantastic.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,552
The cradle of philosophy.

229
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,419
- How was it?
- [chuckles] It was amazing.

230
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:13,422
I got a chance to read your book
while I was there,

231
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,490
and, um, I was wondering...

232
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:18,561
Like, I know you're probably
so over talking about it,

233
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:22,565
but I would love to sit down with you
and... over coffee or something,

234
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,366
you know,
and just pick your brain.

235
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,701
Well, I am certainly
not over talking about it,

236
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,437
but I don't
actually drink coffee.

237
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,608
My, uh, office hours
are on the top there.

238
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,742
Okay.

239
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,146
Hi, everybody.

240
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:37,415
I, uh, see some familiar faces,
which is good.

241
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:41,420
We philosophers are a dying
breed, so safety in numbers.

242
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,686
For those of you
who don't know me,

243
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,389
I am Dr. Birch,
and this is Humanities 325,

244
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:48,193
the Philosophy of Language.

245
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:52,763
Uh...

246
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:54,800
thought it seemed
a little crowded in here.

247
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,198
[chuckles]

248
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,468
[doorbell rings]

249
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,206
- Ellen Birch?
- Yes.

250
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,275
Is your husband home?

251
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,193
Need help?

252
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,661
Uh, no. It's all right. I...

253
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,962
Well, I'm looking
for mousetraps. [chuckles]

254
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,864
Just didn't expect
to see so many.

255
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,869
I thought I'd just find
the old <i>Tom and Jerry</i> kind.

256
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,470
Is this any good?

257
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,673
Yeah, but they're kinda cruel.

258
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,809
The little mouse gets stuck in
there and starves to death.

259
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,674
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

260
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:41,009
Hmm.

261
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,677
But these ones
let you trap the mouse,

262
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,714
then release it
in a field somewhere.

263
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:51,320
Well, it's more
than I wanted to pay,

264
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,625
but I guess it's the least I
could do for the little guy.

265
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,227
[both chuckle]

266
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,337
Do you have a gun?

267
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,436
Yes, I do.

268
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,604
Can I see it?

269
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,405
No, you may not.

270
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,542
Why?

271
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,246
Well, because guns
are dangerous.

272
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,945
- Why?
- Well, because they are.

273
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,980
Honey, let's just go
upstairs and play, okay?

274
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:19,615
- But I wanna see it.
- I know you do,

275
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:20,982
but you gotta go
upstairs and see...

276
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:23,421
- Play. Go. Go. Play.
- [chuckles]

277
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:27,391
Yeah, they're curious
at that age.

278
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,397
- Maybe you should give your husband another call.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

279
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,515
[whispers]Press okay.

280
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:53,951
- What?
- Press okay.

281
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,953
- Yeah.
- [beeps]

282
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,629
Thank you.

283
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:30,756
[dramatic music playing]

284
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:02,920
Ellen?

285
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,456
Hey, what's wrong?

286
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,056
Are the kids okay?

287
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:07,923
Yeah, they're fine.
They're fine.

288
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,525
Dr. Birch?

289
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,394
Detective Robert Malloy.
Detective Killian.

290
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,798
Officer Antonelli.

291
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,800
Oh, hi. What can we do for you?
Is something wrong?

292
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:19,370
Do you own
a gray 2015 Volvo S60?

293
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,544
Where were you?
I've been calling you.

294
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,349
I... I stopped
at the hardware store.

295
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,550
What's this about, Detective?

296
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,519
Well...

297
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,656
girl from Eastfield
went missing a few days ago.

298
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:40,492
We're looking into it.

299
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,393
Joyce Bonner.

300
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,862
Have you heard of her?

301
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:45,497
No.

302
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,663
Oh, so she was the girl
on the news, right?

303
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,165
The... The, um, cheerleader.

304
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,967
- Yeah.
- What does that have to do with us?

305
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:55,069
Well, we got a report
a man in a gray Volvo

306
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,074
was watching her
the day she disappeared.

307
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,508
I'm sure it's nothing,

308
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,379
but we're obliged
to look it up, you know.

309
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:06,984
Can you tell me where you were
Thursday the 28th, about 3 p.m.?

310
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,451
[scoffs] I doubt it, and...

311
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,986
and my appointment book's
at school, so...

312
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,721
At school?
Oh, you aren't a doctor?

313
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,657
No, I'm a professor
at Addison University.

314
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,726
I can look tomorrow,
give you a call.

315
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,761
Your appointment book will tell you
where you were supposed to be,

316
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:21,465
not necessarily
where you were.

317
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,702
Yeah, suppose you're right.

318
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,134
[Zelda] Whoa, what's going on?

319
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,072
Hey, Z, go in the house, honey.

320
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:37,749
Um, on the 28th, that was Z's
last day of camp,

321
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,482
and you went to pick her up,
remember?

322
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,183
- Mm-hmm. What camp is that?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,220
Wildwood, Route 15.

324
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,557
She got out at 3:30.

325
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,692
- [Evan] Yeah.
- Okay, that's fine.

326
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,862
We'll just take a look inside
your car and be on our way.

327
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,732
- Of course.
- Don't you need a warrant to do that? I mean...

328
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:56,634
Not if we have your permission.

329
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:58,767
Well, I'd give it,
but you still haven't said

330
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,201
what this has to do with me.

331
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,203
Well, according
to our witness, uh,

332
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:06,077
the vehicle had a Addison sticker
on the front windshield.

333
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,943
Uh, well, it could be a mistake.

334
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,512
I mean, as my wife said,

335
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:11,946
I was picking up
our daughter from camp,

336
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,149
and Wildwood's 30 miles
from the lake, so...

337
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,787
How'd you know she
disappeared from the lake?

338
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:17,689
It was on the news.

339
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,524
Z, your mom said
to wait inside, please.

340
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,962
Dr. Birch, uh,
this is pretty routine.

341
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,262
Really? It's routine to make insinuations
in front of my daughter? Wow.

342
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,064
Why don't you just calm down,
sir?

343
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,833
I'm perfectly calm, sir.

344
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:31,636
- Honey, they're just doing their job.
- I...

345
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,037
Do you mind if we look
inside your vehicle?

346
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,105
No, of course not.

347
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:37,809
Yes, actually, I do mind.

348
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,082
Who's back there?

349
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,218
What makes you think anyone is?

350
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:52,023
A presumption based on scenes
from television and movies.

351
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:55,493
Well, in the real world,
we got things called budgets.

352
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:59,662
We can't afford to have anyone standing
around, watching us do our jobs.

353
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:00,665
[chuckles]

354
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,032
Now...

355
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:07,505
what time did you
have to pick up your daughter?

356
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,674
3:30, give or take.

357
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:10,876
Give or take what?

358
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:12,878
Five, ten minutes.

359
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,811
I mean, these things rarely
end at even times, you know.

360
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,914
It's always 32
or 17 minutes past and...

361
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,215
Did you get there on time?

362
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:22,987
- Yeah.
- Exactly on time?

363
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:24,989
Little early?

364
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,626
[sighs] I told you.
I don't remember.

365
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,026
As my daughter is only nine,

366
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:32,861
she's unable to obtain
a driver's license,

367
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:34,930
and consequently,
I give her many rides.

368
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,365
This particular instance

369
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,168
did not leave
a significant impression.

370
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:41,772
Did you ever meet Joyce Bonner?

371
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:43,107
Uh...

372
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:45,309
- I don't think so.
- You could have?

373
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,777
I don't remember meeting
somebody with that name,

374
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,712
but I meet a lot of young
people at the college.

375
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,149
It's conceivable that I met her.

376
00:20:52,782 --> 00:20:54,785
What I'm sure of is that
I don't know if I have.

377
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,152
When we asked if you'd heard
of her disappearance,

378
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:59,821
you said, "She was
a cheerleader, right?"

379
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:00,858
Do you remember saying that?

380
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,260
Yeah.

381
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,796
"She <i>was</i> a cheerleader"?

382
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,195
Well, I was speaking offhand.

383
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,131
I'm sure she still
is a cheerleader,

384
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,865
except that she's missing,
and I'm...

385
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,636
I'm guessing she's not off
cheerleading somewhere.

386
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:17,405
Philosophy.
"I think, therefore I am,"

387
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,008
that kind of thing?

388
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,409
Well, I teach Descartes
in my intro class,

389
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,280
but I specialize in linguistics,

390
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:24,883
the philosophy of language.

391
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,785
Oh. Um...

392
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:31,189
pardon my ignorance,
but what does a philosopher do?

393
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:33,058
- [chuckles]
- [Killian] What's so funny?

394
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,261
Uh, well, it's one of the
great questions, isn't it?

395
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:38,826
You might consider philosophy

396
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,598
the logical
clarification of thoughts.

397
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:42,897
But I'm more of a teacher

398
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,034
than a practicing philosopher.

399
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,137
This is relevant somehow, is it?

400
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:49,674
We never know what's relevant
until we hear it.

401
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:54,977
You might consider
crime investigation

402
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,315
the logical clarification
of evidence.

403
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,348
You live close by the lake,
don't you?

404
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,719
You ever go up there?

405
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:03,419
Yeah, sometimes.

406
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,723
Did you ever rent a kayak?

407
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,091
No.

408
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:08,022
You ever remember
seeing a young girl,

409
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:12,196
17, brunette, worked
around the kayak stand?

410
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,328
Uh, can't say that I do.

411
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,065
You mean you don't remember?

412
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,965
That's right. I don't remember
seeing a young girl,

413
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:22,139
uh, let alone a brunette one,
working at the kayak rental.

414
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,807
I've never been
to the kayak rental.

415
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,108
I've... I've never sent anybody
to the kayak rental.

416
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,911
In fact, I've never even thought
about the kayak rental

417
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,216
until now, till you bring it up.

418
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,916
You enjoying yourself?

419
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:37,388
Hmm. Well,
too bad about your memory.

420
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,925
[Malloy coughs]

421
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:55,774
Right.

422
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,142
Thank you for your time,
Professor.

423
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,175
I'm not under arrest anymore?

424
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,079
You never were.

425
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,448
We have your numbers, so we'll
contact you again if we need you.

426
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,816
At my office, please.

427
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,087
Of course. Thanks for your help.

428
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,189
You're welcome.

429
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:16,928
[door closes]

430
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,999
Everything's fine.

431
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,301
I just answered some questions,
and then I left.

432
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,771
What did they want to know?

433
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,974
Uh, well, where I'd been,
how long I was there,

434
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:34,713
whether I'd met, um...
what's her name?

435
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,781
- Joyce Bonner.
- Bonner, yeah.

436
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:40,484
Had you...

437
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,287
met her?

438
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:43,922
[sighs] Why would I have?

439
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,256
I just told them
everything I knew,

440
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,026
they thanked me,
and that was that.

441
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,459
You didn't save a plate,
did you? I'm really starved.

442
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,230
- [shouts] A plate?
- Yeah.

443
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,396
Adam cried for an hour,

444
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,934
because he thought
you went to jail.

445
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:00,271
You're acting
like this is my fault.

446
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:02,005
They just wanted
to look in the car.

447
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,038
There's a thing called
the Fourth Amendment.

448
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,240
Oh, my God.
A girl is missing, Evan.

449
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:07,442
I know. I know.

450
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:08,747
Has it even crossed your mind?

451
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,346
What... What if it was Zelda?

452
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:13,217
What if someone pulled the same
macho bullshit you pulled today?

453
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,356
Yeah, well, maybe I overreacted.

454
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,455
What were you thinking?

455
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,958
Well, they were
pushing me around.

456
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,129
I got defensive.

457
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:28,299
I was stupid, I... I know. I...

458
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,802
I just should have
let 'em do what they wanted.

459
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:35,807
How is Adam?

460
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:38,275
You should talk to him.

461
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,544
- And Z?
- [sighs] She's fine.

462
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,848
You should talk to her, too.

463
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,186
What about you?

464
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,555
Did I scare you, too?

465
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:53,324
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,538
[gasping, sobbing]

467
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,575
[gasps]

468
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,345
[scratching]

469
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,381
[mouse squeaking]

470
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:50,345
Zeno's Progressive
Dichotomy Paradox

471
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:53,151
proposes that before
a person can walk across a room,

472
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:54,551
he must go halfway.

473
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,550
But before he gets halfway,

474
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:58,619
he must cover
a quarter that distance,

475
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:02,359
and so on and so on to an infinite
number of decreasing distances.

476
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,965
Based on this logic, the man was
never able to take the first step.

477
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,033
Zeno demonstrated, in a way,

478
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,169
that motion was impossible.

479
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,241
Mr. Barnes.

480
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:17,641
Here.

481
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,211
Do you agree with Zeno?

482
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,213
Um, yes.

483
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,980
So you will be unable
to leave this room

484
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:27,652
after my thrilling
lecture is over?

485
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,354
Looks like we're all stuck here.

486
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:31,086
[scattered laughter]

487
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,124
Well, I mean,
it's a play on words.

488
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:35,026
It makes sense, but it doesn't.

489
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:36,526
Yeah, you're on the right track.

490
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:39,931
A paradox exposes
the limits of language.

491
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,596
We all know from experience

492
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:43,166
that we are able
to walk across a room.

493
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,370
It's only in our language
that uncertainty arises.

494
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:51,341
Do you have a dollar in the same
way that you have a headache?

495
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,210
As long as there
are verbs like "to be"

496
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:59,080
or adjectives like "true" or
"false," we will continue...

497
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:01,184
and this is a quote from
our friend Wittgenstein...

498
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,318
we will continue
to "Stare at something

499
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,624
which no explanation
seems able to remove."

500
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,994
- Yes.
- So there's no such thing as truth?

501
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:13,398
Well, let me ask you this.

502
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,465
Can I tell you the truth,

503
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,601
or can I tell you what I perceive
or interpret as the truth,

504
00:27:19,603 --> 00:27:21,039
as best my memory will allow?

505
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,772
Anyway, we're getting
ahead of ourselves,

506
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:27,477
so let's stick with the paradox.

507
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:29,514
One crumb at a time.

508
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:37,255
[knocks]

509
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:38,990
Hi. Am I early?

510
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:41,224
No. No. I'm just getting a jump
on these. Come in.

511
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,427
Oh, you can leave that open.

512
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:44,996
Okay.

513
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:48,130
How's your semester so far?

514
00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:50,134
[sighs] Hectic.

515
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,069
I'm taking 18 units.

516
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,738
Eighteen? [chuckles]

517
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,071
That's pretty.

518
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:57,975
That new?

519
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:01,343
Oh. Oh, yeah.

520
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:03,280
I got that in, um,
Boston over summer.

521
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,516
You've got a good memory.

522
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:07,684
I can barely remember last week.

523
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:11,189
Do you remember...

524
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,558
last semester?

525
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,695
I'll take that as a yes.

526
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,729
We don't have to bring that up.

527
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,367
No, I... I'd rather we did.

528
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:26,236
Should I get the door now?

529
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah.

530
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:41,386
[sighs] I wanted to apologize.

531
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:45,619
Um, I was in a pretty bad place
last year,

532
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:46,523
and...

533
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:48,593
you were...

534
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,494
You tried to help me,

535
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:55,366
and I took advantage of that
in a really big way.

536
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:58,703
And, um, I want to say
that it was a...

537
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:02,239
a moment of weakness,
but it wasn't that.

538
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:05,242
It was just a moment
where I didn't think,

539
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,715
and... I want you to know
how stupid I felt

540
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,550
and how truly sorry I am.

541
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,422
Well, Anna,
I appreciate your candor

542
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,057
and your honesty,

543
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,224
and I accept your apology.
Thank you.

544
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:25,062
I just want us to forget
about it and be normal.

545
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,130
Well, if you're willing to
rebuild the trust between us,

546
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:29,167
then so am I.

547
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:33,434
You're such
an incredible person.

548
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:34,702
- Ah.
- And I mean that

549
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,540
in a strictly platonic way.
I do.

550
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,208
And I actually
did come to talk to you

551
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,710
about your book if that's okay.

552
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,448
- Great.
- [clears throat]

553
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,615
Wow, I wish some of my critics

554
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,415
read it as thoroughly
as it looks like you have.

555
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,184
Or even some of my colleagues,
for that matter.

556
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:51,385
- [knock on door]
- [laughs]

557
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,290
Come in.

558
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,760
Hmm. Good afternoon, Professor.

559
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,395
You got a second?

560
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,326
W... Well, as you can see,

561
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:00,394
I'm with a student right now.

562
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:01,299
It'll just take a second.

563
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:03,800
Hmm, look at that.

564
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,469
You write that?

565
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:06,570
Yeah.

566
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:07,871
Thick.

567
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:09,403
Actually, do you mind
waiting outside,

568
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,272
and I'll see you in a moment?

569
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:12,709
Sure. Take your time.

570
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,140
How long have you known
the good doctor?

571
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:46,810
Few years.

572
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:49,944
Nice guy?

I actually have
a meeting off campus,

578
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:06,795
so I don't really have
time to talk.

579
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,566
No problem. I'll walk with you.

580
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:12,402
I wanted to talk
to you about the 28th some more.

581
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,635
You wanted to, past tense?

582
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:16,471
Have circumstances changed?

583
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,675
Ah, figure of speech.

584
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:19,443
I want to talk to you now.

585
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:20,911
Well, you're talking to me.

586
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:22,978
You said you picked up
your daughter

587
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,815
from camp that day.
Is that correct?

588
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,480
Yes, that's what I said.

589
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:27,885
Mm-hmm. Is that what you did?

590
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,785
Well, considering my daughter is
not still at camp waiting for me,

591
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:32,787
I'd say, uh, yes,
that's what I did.

592
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,525
- No stops?
- No stops.

593
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:37,491
Camp counselor said she waited
with your daughter

594
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,329
for 40 minutes
before you showed up.

595
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,934
Well, is tardiness
a crime these days?

596
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:45,936
No, but obstruction is.

597
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,607
And how am I doing that?

598
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,348
Where did you get my notes?

599
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,452
Found it in a garbage can
up by the lake.

600
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:05,522
You sure you didn't stop there,
maybe on the way?

601
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,455
I... It's possible.

602
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:10,560
I... I-- I go
to the lake sometimes.

603
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,863
I sit in my car. I do work,

604
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:16,334
look out at the water, and
just clear my head, you know?

605
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,735
And is that what you did
on the 28th?

606
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,801
I don't remember. I might have.

607
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:23,605
I might have gone there
that morning or the day before.

608
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:24,908
I... I-- I can't be certain.

609
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,746
What I'm sure of is that I... I had nothing
to do with this girl's disappearance, so...

610
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,946
Look, do... do you have
any more questions?

611
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,316
'Cause I really need to go.

612
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,453
No. No more questions.

613
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:38,553
Thank you.

has been impounded

by the Hillside
Police Department.

618

The car will be returned

You're kidding?

I've been nothing
but cooperative.

621

Well, since your statement

622
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:10,384
contradicted
the physical evidence...

623
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,354
- Contradicted?
- ...we thought a thorough search of your car...

624
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:13,454
And this is how you do it?
You leave me stranded at work?

625
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:14,888
Ah, listen.

626
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,724
I tried to tell you
the tow truck was here,

- but you had me wait.
- You didn't tr...

This is unbelievable.

I want to clear this up
faster than anybody.

Now, let's just go back
to those 40 minutes.

Look, you can arrest me,
if that's your intention.

I'm not answering another question
until I speak to my lawyer.

Honestly, I wish
you called me earlier.

635

I just thought if I answered
their questions,

636
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:41,819
it would go away.

637

That's what everybody thinks,

are you used to a case like this?

Well, do you mean a kidnapping,

or do you mean a murder?

00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:05,509

hostage situation?

648

I don't know what kind of case this
is, and frankly, neither do they.

a cause of death, a motive.

They don't even have
a crime yet.

651
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,984
All they do have is
an uncorroborated statement

652
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,455
and a warrant I wouldn't pick up
my dog's poop with.

So what should we do now?

656
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,461
Stay on defense.
You did the right thing

657
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:28,430
not letting them
search your car,

658
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:29,899
- because now if they find anything...
- They won't.

659
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,435
But if they do,
we can get it thrown out.

Look, this...
this isn't some metropolis.

When a kid goes missing here,
everybody knows about it.

Correct.

a pattern of behavior.

- No, he's not.

this girl. I never have.

00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:36,052
Ew. That's not sanitary, honey.

808
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,289
I didn't find it
on the street. Gosh.

809
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,290
I found it in Dad's car.

810
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,595
When?

811
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:46,359
When we washed it.

812
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:47,928
It was in the back seat,

813
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,198
so I didn't think
you wanted it anymore.

814
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,569
Yeah, well, I want it.

815
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:57,138
Uh, will you go wash your face?

816
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,506
You don't need to wear
makeup to the beach.

817
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:00,477
- But...
- Just wash your face, okay?

818
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:17,159
[Evan] Okay.

819
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,031
Where do you want to be?

820
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:24,333
Right here?

821
00:43:24,566 --> 00:43:25,568
Right here?

822
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:32,208
Maybe, yeah.

823
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:33,510
Why's that?

824
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,252
[Evan muttering]

825
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:49,493
We should take a trip.

826
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:51,995
- Hmm?
- A trip.

827
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:55,631
We didn't have
a summer vacation this year.

828
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,268
We should go back to Spain.

829
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:00,703
Wouldn't that be fun?

830
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:03,340
Go back to our cafe.

831
00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:06,410
You know, we should
actually move there.

832
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:09,980
We should buy that cafe.
You could run it.

833
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:12,245
I could teach English somewhere,

834
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:13,383
and the kids could be bilingual.

835
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,153
- Okay.
- [laughs]

836
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,593
You said something
to me that day.

837
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,127
You promised me something.

838
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:28,365
You remember what you said?

839
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:30,399
Uh...

840
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,437
You promised you'd always
tell me the truth.

841
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:35,472
[chuckles]

842
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:37,207
What?

843
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,640
That was before
I went back to school.

844
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:41,441
It sounds like something
I would have said.

845
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:42,712
Oh, you mean you wouldn't
promise me that now?

846
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:44,280
No. I...

847
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:46,212
Well, I can't actually
promise you that.

848
00:44:46,214 --> 00:44:47,383
Nobody can. I mean,

849
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:51,151
what I should have said
was that I...

850
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:54,256
I promise to always tell you what I
interpret and remember as the truth.

851
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:57,293
I like
your original promise better.

852
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,196
That's the one
I'm gonna hold you to.

853
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,169
Pizza?

854
00:45:06,368 --> 00:45:07,401
Yeah. I'll just put him down.

855
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,339
[dramatic music playing]

856
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:26,790
[Zelda screams]

857
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:29,156
[Evan] What is it, honey?

858
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:31,091
Marvin's gone! Marvin's gone!

859
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:32,493
He's gone?

860
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:33,560
[Ellen] Oh, honey,
we'll find him.

861
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:34,430
How'd he get out?

862
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:36,796
Well, I don't know.

863
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:39,135
Did I leave his door open
when I fed him this morning?

864
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,167
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll find him.

865
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:42,669
He'll be here somewhere.
We'll find him.

866
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:43,673
Marvin!

867
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,143
- Marvin!
- Marvin!

868
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:49,612
- [dog barking]
- [Zelda] Marvin!

869
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:52,182
- [Ellen] Did you look under the tree?
- Marvin!

870
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:55,051
[Zelda] Marvin!

871
00:45:58,321 --> 00:45:59,356
Marvin!

872
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:14,435
We'll get her another one.

873
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,505
She doesn't want another one.

874
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,439
I'm sorry.

875
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,341
I know you are.
She knows you are.

876
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,212
It's just gonna take her a
little while to forgive you.

877
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:24,712
[Evan] We were just
so rushed this morning.

878
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:26,379
Okay, Evan, please don't do

879
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:29,183
the whole absent-minded
professor thing.

880
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:33,453
It used to be cute, and I just...
I need you here from now on.

881
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:34,522
We all do.

882
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:35,525
It was an honest mistake.

883
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:37,461
I'm not just talking
about the rabbit.

884
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:41,131
I can't move again.

885
00:46:48,537 --> 00:46:50,306
Leave that on.
I'm gonna stay up.

886
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,607
Fine.

887
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:55,111
[tense music playing]

888
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:05,522
[water running]

889
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:33,617
I'm gonna staple this one.

890
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:43,459
Good.

891
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,834
[faint ringing]

892
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:55,437
[school bell fades in]

893
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:59,176
Uh, what was I saying?

894
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:04,446
Oh, well, whatever it was,
it can wait.

895
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:05,946
That's the beauty of time.

896
00:48:05,948 --> 00:48:07,317
There's always more of it.

897
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,015
I will see you next week.

898
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:10,686
[tense music playing]

899
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:38,714
[Killian] ...great.

900
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,217
That's great, Barbara.

901
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:49,425
Okay. Thank you.

902
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:08,444
Long day, Professor?

903
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:10,977
Need a ride?

904
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,881
No, I'll be fine
on the bus. Thanks.

905
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,515
Well, I've still got
some time right now

906
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,484
if, uh, you wanna grab
some coffee.

907
00:49:17,486 --> 00:49:18,722
I don't drink coffee, remember?

908
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,758
Well, they have tea
and juice and water.

909
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:23,392
You do drink water?

910
00:49:23,758 --> 00:49:24,994
[doorbell rings]

911
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:30,399
Mrs. Birch.

912
00:49:30,598 --> 00:49:31,832
My husband's not here.
He's at work.

913
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:32,969
I know.

914
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,038
I'd like to talk to you
if you have a moment.

915
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:41,278
[Anna] I get it,
but I don't agree.

916
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:43,679
Wittgenstein
would spend his nights

917
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:48,415
having sex with strange men
in parks, right?

918
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,917
And then he would go home

919
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,785
and write about
language's inability

920
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:54,854
to define things like...
like truth and morality.

921
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:58,058
And does his behavior make his
arguments any less valid?

922
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,627
Well, no, but couldn't you say

923
00:50:00,629 --> 00:50:05,368
that his theories stem from fear
rather than rational thought?

924
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,002
I don't see how.

925
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:08,669
I mean, the duty
of the philosophic mind

926
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,136
is to rise above the personal

927
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:12,439
and contemplate
the universal, right?

928
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:13,343
Uh...

929
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,812
What?

930
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:18,714
Forget it.
It's personal, and we agreed.

931
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:22,085
Well, if it's apropos
of the material, please.

932
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:23,920
It's about last semester.

933
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:27,956
Well, make your point.

934
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,459
Oh, thank you.
[clears throat]

935
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:33,863
You're spoiling me.
[chuckles]

936
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:36,065
How do you like it here?

937
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:39,702
You've been here,
what, four, five years?

938
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:41,870
Yeah. We... We like it fine.

939
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:44,107
Uh, it's been five years.

940
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:47,476
Where'd you move from?

941
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:50,042
Evanston, outside Chicago.

942
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:50,946
Mm-hmm.

943
00:50:52,647 --> 00:50:54,781
Hey, there! Look who's here.

944
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:56,986
It's my junior deputy.
[chuckles]

945
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:00,754
Do you need more help
from Daddy?

946
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:02,656
H... Honey, we just...

947
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:03,790
We need some grown-up time.

948
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:04,794
Can you go play?

949
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:05,894
Yeah.

950
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:08,832
Hmm, cute kid.

951
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:10,065
Adam, right?

952
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:11,600
No, that's Super Dude.

953
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:13,135
Big difference.

954
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:14,935
Puts on a cape,
he's a whole other person.

955
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:17,607
[laughs]
I need a cape like that.

956
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,444
Gets tiring
being myself all the time.

957
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:23,479
Well, if I get a chance,
I'll sew you one.

958
00:51:25,046 --> 00:51:26,879
[grunts] Well,
now you're humoring me.

959
00:51:26,881 --> 00:51:29,649
No. I'm politely waiting for
you to get to the point.

960
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:33,886
[chuckles] My wife tells me
I'm terrible at small talk.

961
00:51:33,888 --> 00:51:34,890
I think she's right.

962
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:42,529
I remember the second before,
I thought, "This is wrong.

963
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:45,735
You're making a mistake.
You're crossing a line."

964
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,071
And so why do it?

965
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:51,705
I don't know. It's not like

966
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:54,073
I was satisfying
some curiosity, you know?

967
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,644
I know what it's like to...

968
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:08,090
Then I read your book,
and it hit me.

969
00:52:08,823 --> 00:52:11,927
People make the most destructive
choices consciously,

970
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,826
and then they try
and rationalize it

971
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:16,129
with things like,
"I didn't mean it,"

972
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:18,866
or, "I wasn't thinking,"
or whatever, but it's a lie.

973
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:20,804
I saw you at the lake
the other day.

974
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:24,773
Girl's missing.

975
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,809
It's every parent's
worst nightmare.

976
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:28,511
Yeah.

977
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:31,013
I've come by
to ask for your help.

978
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,115
Well, how can I help you,
Detective, all things considered?

979
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:37,854
Because I assume you think
your husband is innocent.

980
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:40,654
Joyce Bonner is out there,

981
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:42,592
and if she's still alive,
she's on borrowed time.

982
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:45,125
If your husband
had nothing to do with that,

983
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,830
I need to know so I can move on.

984
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:49,263
I've tried to rule him out,
but he won't let me.

985
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:50,834
I'm sure he's told you
everything he knows.

986
00:52:51,165 --> 00:52:55,071
Mm, I think you're a lot more
convinced of that than I am.

987
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,305
I think that there's
this unknown part of us,

988
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:00,477
like the id, that...

989
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:03,245
prefers destruction,

990
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:05,848
even craves it.

991
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:08,615
What we call guilt

992
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:11,553
is just a fear of this
unknown part of our minds.

993
00:53:17,626 --> 00:53:18,528
Evan?

994
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:21,930
Well, what do you think?
Am I crazy?

995
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:25,732
Um, sorry. I realized
I just missed my bus.

996
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:29,038
Um, does your offer still stand?

997
00:53:30,238 --> 00:53:32,171
We found strands of brown hair

998
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:34,009
in the back seat
of your husband's car.

999
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:39,048
We matched them with a sample
of Joyce's hairbrush.

1000
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:40,950
It came back positive.

1001
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:45,554
You're the first person
I've told that to.

1002
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:48,156
Not even my partner knows.

1003
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:51,727
And if you can tell me what
that girl was doing in the car,

1004
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:54,796
it doesn't have
to leave this room.

1005
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,069
I know why you left Evanston,

1006
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:04,173
the official version, anyway.

1007
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,744
College was a little reluctant
to give the details, but...

1008
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,080
must have been tough.

1009
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,752
How many years you been married?

1010
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:19,187
Oh, 15 years.

1011
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:21,124
Yeah.

1012
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:22,724
All of them smooth?

1013
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:24,026
Oh, hardly.

1014
00:54:26,694 --> 00:54:28,932
We both had our reasons
for leaving Evanston,

1015
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:30,332
both of them very different.

1016
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,702
Don't think for a second
you know what they were.

1017
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:37,373
Think it's time for you to go.

1018
00:54:41,243 --> 00:54:42,578
Well, thank you for your help.

1019
00:54:43,245 --> 00:54:44,247
You have a lovely home.

1020
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:47,015
Yeah, I work hard
to keep it that way.

1021
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:51,019
Thank you very much.

1022
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:52,921
Goodbye now.

1023
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:01,897
[tense music playing]

- [screams]

1025

[stereo playing music]

1026
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:44,270
Oh, she's home.

1027
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:45,772
Oh, I'm sorry. If I'd known,
I would have called her.

1028
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:46,809
I didn't mind.

1029
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:51,347
Thank you for the ride.

1030
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:55,652
[chuckles] Philosophers
are a dying breed, Professor.

1031
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:57,283
There's safety in numbers.

1032
00:55:57,285 --> 00:55:58,320
[chuckles]

1033
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:10,999
Hello?

1034
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:13,299
Ellen?

1035
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:14,870
[Adam] Daddy's home!

1036
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,143
The policeman
came back today, Daddy.

1037
00:56:20,374 --> 00:56:21,943
They came back again, huh?

1038
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,046
Hmm.

1039
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:25,281
Hon?

1040
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:27,379
I've been calling you.

1041
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:28,417
Where were you?

1042
00:56:48,903 --> 00:56:51,037
Why don't you walk Zelda in?
I'll carry Adam.

1043
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:53,008
I've got it. It's only a finger.

1044
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:59,082
[telephone ringing]

1045
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:04,352
Evan Birch.

1046
00:57:08,256 --> 00:57:11,124
- Hair?
- Strands of brown hair in the back seat.

1047
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:12,292
<i>It's a match.</i>

1048
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:13,560
Well, they must have planted it.

1049
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:15,361
Evan, I need you to think.

1050
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:17,229
Is there any way this girl
could have been in your car?

1051
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:18,867
No, not that I know of.

1052
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:21,368
[sighs]

1053
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,438
What if you didn't know it?

1054
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:24,470
<i>Did you ever
leave your car open,</i>

1055
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:26,138
- maybe at the lake that day?
- <i>No.</i>

1056
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,908
- Pick up any hitchhikers?
- No.

1057
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,243
<i>How 'bout at school?
Do you ever give students ride?</i>

1058
00:57:30,245 --> 00:57:31,981
I don't socialize
with the students.

1059
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,149
<i>That's not what I asked.</i>

1060
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:38,317
Um, I did give a ride to some
high school students one day.

1061
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,323
They were doing prep classes
here on campus.

1062
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,892
Three girls and a boy.
It was raining.

1063
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:45,528
Was Joyce Bonner one of them?

1064
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:48,363
Maybe. I suppose it's possible.

1065
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:50,800
Do you have attendance records?

1066
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,299
Uh, yeah.

1067
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:54,903
I... Look, I'm late for class.

1068
00:57:55,403 --> 00:57:58,037
I'll... I'll have a look
and see if she's on there.

1069
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:59,573
It'll be good if she's
on there, right?

1070
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:02,174
Well, on the one hand,
it would explain the hairs.

1071
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:04,276
On the other hand, it would
connect you to a missing girl.

1072
00:58:04,278 --> 00:58:06,281
- <i>Look, I'll call you later.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

1073
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:19,528
[Malloy] Where I grew up,

1074
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,261
if someone wants to prove
a chair exists,

1075
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:24,867
they hit you over the head
with it. [chuckles]

1076
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,899
Yeah.

1077
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:28,069
We're done with your car.

1078
00:58:30,972 --> 00:58:32,541
Sign this, it's all yours.

1079
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:38,410
So you can take
my car without asking,

1080
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:40,282
but you need my permission
to give it back?

1081
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:44,250
I don't make the paperwork.
I just fill it out.

1082
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:46,185
I don't suppose you towed it
back to my spot?

1083
00:58:46,187 --> 00:58:47,088
No.

1084
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:49,858
You have to pick it up
from the impound,

1085
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:52,127
half an hour up 35.

1086
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,261
- I'll give you a lift if you like.
- That's okay.

1087
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:56,899
I'll get it myself, thanks.

1088
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:02,137
Anything else?

1089
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:06,609
You don't think much
about what I do, but...

1090
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:10,879
when you consider it,
we're in the same racket.

1091
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:12,914
What racket is that?

1092
00:59:13,147 --> 00:59:15,885
Proof, searching for the truth.

1093
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:22,391
Truth hides behind arguments,
analysis, reasoning.

1094
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:27,359
Well, reason leads us to the truth.
It doesn't conceal it.

1095
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:29,564
I've always argued that
the truth is instinctive.

1096
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:34,035
You take this little problem
here on your board.

1097
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:38,441
The answer seems
pretty plain to me.

1098
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:39,975
Does it?

1099
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:42,345
Well, be my guest.
Prove this chair exists.

1100
00:59:46,314 --> 00:59:47,349
What chair?

1101
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,622
Where did you go to school?

1102
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:59,361
Oh, bachelor's at Seton Hall.

1103
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:01,597
JD at Fordham.

1104
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:03,366
A lawyer?

1105
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:05,100
Did you practice?

1106
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,969
I did my time
in the DA's office.

1107
01:00:08,236 --> 01:00:09,405
Wasn't my kind of thing.

1108
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:12,407
They wouldn't let you
carry a gun.

1109
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:14,910
[laughs]

1110
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:17,245
[sighs]

1111
01:00:17,745 --> 01:00:19,381
That's my youngest, Katie.

1112
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:22,415
She goes to school with Joyce.

1113
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:23,920
They don't know
each other, though.

1114
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:27,022
Different circles.
[clears throat]

1115
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:30,189
Well, you know,
we almost put her

1116
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:32,460
through that summer program
of yours at Addison,

1117
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,296
you know,
the one Joyce went through.

1118
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:38,298
Who knows?
They may have become friends.

1119
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,535
Well, it's a large program.

1120
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:41,937
Not everybody
knows everybody else.

1121
01:00:42,437 --> 01:00:44,607
Including the teachers
and the... the students?

1122
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:47,540
Are you questioning me
outside counsel, Detective?

1123
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,109
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.

1124
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:51,310
No, I just want to know
that, you know,

1125
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:54,247
if Katie had gone there, would she have
gotten to know all her professors?

1126
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:56,082
Uh, not necessarily.

1127
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:57,986
The students are limited
to three classes,

1128
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,489
and there are 15 instructors.

1129
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,256
That's not to say
contact's unimaginable.

1130
01:01:03,258 --> 01:01:05,361
Really? In what way?

1131
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,029
Well, one could imagine
Katie, for example,

1132
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:14,437
being caught in a rainstorm,
uh, with a few friends,

1133
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:16,636
two other girls and a boy,

1134
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:20,173
and perhaps a, uh,
professor offers them

1135
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:23,078
a ride from the library
to the student union,

1136
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:26,649
and, uh, perhaps while Katie's
in the back of the car, she...

1137
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:31,383
she fixes up her makeup and... and maybe
brushes back some of her wet hair...

1138
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:33,819
- Mm-hmm.
- inadvertently leaving a strand or two

1139
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:37,459
in the professor's
notoriously unkempt car.

1140
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:40,727
Would that qualify
as getting to know somebody?

1141
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:41,761
No, I don't think it would,

1142
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:43,830
but if I read her diary

1143
01:01:43,832 --> 01:01:46,366
and it mentioned an older man
she'd met that summer,

1144
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:49,672
I'd want to have words with every
guy she so much as bumped into.

1145
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:52,705
[scoffs] You read
your daughter's diary?

1146
01:01:52,707 --> 01:01:54,010
Every page.

1147
01:01:56,812 --> 01:02:00,683
Before I forget,
I found these in your glove box.

1148
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:02,784
I wanted to make sure
you got them back.

1149
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:05,484
What is it?

1150
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:06,488
You tell me.

1151
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:12,325
I suppose you think
I met Joyce Bonner

1152
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,526
at the Sanders Hotel
fountain at 7:00?

1153
01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:16,731
No. The Sanders is in Chicago.

1154
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:20,102
Was, anyway. Closed down
about four years ago.

1155
01:02:21,202 --> 01:02:23,104
That would have made Joyce 13,

1156
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:26,508
and I don't think
you're that kind of guy.

1157
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:29,475
I mean, at first,
I thought it was garbage,

1158
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:30,676
but then you bought this car

1159
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:32,544
here about three years ago,

1160
01:02:32,546 --> 01:02:34,346
and I know you don't smoke,

1161
01:02:34,348 --> 01:02:36,216
so I just figured
you were holding on to them

1162
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:37,783
for sentimental reasons.

1163
01:02:37,785 --> 01:02:40,488
Shouldn't this be in one
of your fancy evidence bags?

1164
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:42,258
Should it?

1165
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:44,727
Whose writing is it?

1166
01:02:45,127 --> 01:02:45,892
I have no idea.

1167
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:46,892
Is it your wife's?

1168
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:48,129
No, it's not.

1169
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:49,632
It doesn't appear to be.

1170
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,700
- Would you slow down?
- It looks feminine,

1171
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:58,506
the way the letters
are all round, almost touching.

1172
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:03,411
You know, when a guy
goes through AA,

1173
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:05,448
he carries a coin
around with him,

1174
01:03:05,914 --> 01:03:07,415
reminds him not to drink.

1175
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,183
Seems pretty natural,

1176
01:03:10,185 --> 01:03:11,320
the way you're
fiddling with those.

1177
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:13,321
Could you stop
the goddamn car?

1178
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:19,194
[clears throat]

1179
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:26,368
You have to know
where this is headed.

1180
01:03:28,435 --> 01:03:29,338
[sighs]

1181
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,674
Would you take me
to my car, please?

1182
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:36,910
[whistles]

1183
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,147
Hey, Frank!

1184
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:43,184
Here you go.

1185
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:45,354
Three-five-six-seven.

[sobs]

1189
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:28,962
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1190
01:04:28,964 --> 01:04:32,401
The impound may as well have
been across the state line.

1191
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:37,839
Can we not talk about that now?

1192
01:04:44,278 --> 01:04:45,313
Mmm.

1193
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,419
Mm, peaches.

1194
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:52,421
Perfect Peaches.

1195
01:04:55,522 --> 01:04:56,425
What?

1196
01:04:57,725 --> 01:04:59,227
Just looking at your face.

1197
01:05:01,328 --> 01:05:02,231
Why?

1198
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:06,969
Can't one look at another's face
without having an agenda?

1199
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:11,640
One can, but I have the feeling
that one isn't.

1200
01:05:18,379 --> 01:05:19,881
I want you
to tell me the truth.

1201
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:21,983
The truth about what?

1202
01:05:22,716 --> 01:05:24,220
What was she doing
in your car?

1203
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:27,687
Who?

1204
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,225
What? Did you think
I wouldn't find out

1205
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:30,992
that they have evidence
of a missing girl in your car?

1206
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:34,660
I didn't want to worry you
any more than you already were.

1207
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:36,696
So you kept a secret, <i>secret</i>?

1208
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,400
- No.
- From your wife?

1209
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:41,436
This is her lip gloss, Evan.
Zelda found it.

1210
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:43,906
What was she doing in your car?

1211
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:46,673
I could explain this to you,

1212
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,707
but I have a feeling it may be too
pat for your taste right now.

1213
01:05:48,709 --> 01:05:50,075
Oh, don't make this about me.

1214
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,546
I think this is about you,
Ellen.

1215
01:05:52,546 --> 01:05:54,013
You used to be
so rational, you know?

1216
01:05:54,015 --> 01:05:55,915
Things were either
proven or unproven,

1217
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:59,888
and now you're all intuition
and conjecture and paranoia.

1218
01:06:03,857 --> 01:06:04,959
Did that cop tell you?

1219
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,263
Is that what you were
talking about the other day?

1220
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,867
Oh, this is just great. Did he
ask you to wear a wire as well?

1221
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:15,971
I'm trying my hardest
to trust you again.

1222
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:20,742
You don't trust me now?

1223
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:23,044
I haven't trusted you
for five years.

1224
01:06:23,845 --> 01:06:26,578
[scoffs] Okay. I'm gonna
save you the anxiety

1225
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,383
of having to sleep
next to me tonight.

- <i>What?</i>
- Jesus, Evan,

1230
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:53,372
I've been trying you all morning.
Fisherman found her.

<i>Source inside the police told
me she was floating by the dam.</i>

1232

[exhales] What does that mean?

1233
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,479
It means you don't
say shit to anybody,

1234
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:00,948
not without talking to me first.

1235
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:04,319
Autopsy's coming. Then they'll
decide whether to file charges.

<i>I'll be in touch
when I hear more.</i>

<i>Until then, act normal.</i>

1238
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:09,325
Act normal?

Guilty men hide.

Professor Birch.
Professor Birch,

if we could have a moment
of your time, sir.

1244
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,571
Professor Birch, if we could just
have one moment of your time.

1245
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:26,973
Do you have a statement, sir?

1246
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:28,573
- Dr. Birch.
- I have a few questions.

1247
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:29,875
- Professor. Professor.
- Professor Birch.

1248

[overlapping chatter]

1249
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:49,564
Well, nothing like the hint of a
scandal to bring out an audience.

1250
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:55,136
So many budding philosophers.

1251
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:58,106
We haven't a moment to waste.

1252
01:08:03,577 --> 01:08:04,979
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about this?

1253
01:08:05,446 --> 01:08:06,948
There was nothing to tell.
I mean,

1254
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,682
it seems I was at the lake the
day the girl disappeared,

1255
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:11,486
and the police
have questioned me about it.

1256
01:08:11,785 --> 01:08:13,421
Because you might have
seen something?

1257
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,591
There may be
other connections, too.

Such as?

Well, she was enrolled
in a summer program here,

1260
01:08:20,128 --> 01:08:21,928

given her a ride one day

with some other students.

- It was raining.
- Evan, how worried should I be about this?

Why? Did you give her
a ride, too?

You're a member
of this faculty.

Anything that threatens
your reputation

- Which means I get to hear about it

- before the goddamn press.
- Okay.

asking for a quote.

1270
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,714
I sounded like an imbecile.

1271
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:43,017
Why? What did you say?

1272
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,818
That I had the utmost confidence
in my faculty

1273
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,690
and I am certain the police
will rule out Dr. Birch

as a suspect in this case.

- Okay, great.
- Evan,

1276

- is that gonna come back and haunt me?
- No, it's not, Bob.

Look, I'm behind you,

but I'm pulling you
from classes immediately.

You... I just gave a lecture
to a standing-room-only crowd.

Listen to yourself. They weren't
there for your lecture.

1282
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:12,277
...but no more classes
until further notice.

1283
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:13,781
- ...to this university is second to none.
- Evan!

1284
01:09:14,982 --> 01:09:16,051
It's already done.

1285
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:30,062
Adam, can you be
a big ghost, honey,

1286
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:31,566
and buckle yourself in?

1287
01:09:34,802 --> 01:09:36,605
Hey, honey, um...

1288
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,139
you remember that day

1289
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:41,543
Daddy was late to pick you up
from camp?

1290
01:09:42,744 --> 01:09:44,613
Do you remember, like,

1291
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:49,250
anything that he said
or why he was late?

1292
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,756
Oh, hey, buddy.
You get a costume?

1293
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:56,988
- Yes, it's perfect.
- Ah, look at that.

1294
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,189
What about you?

1295
01:09:58,191 --> 01:09:59,627
- I didn't want one.
- Oh.

1296
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:02,264
Why didn't you call me?
I would have joined you.

1297
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,732
They found her.

1298
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,202
Yeah. Paul told me.

1299
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,538
Wait. That's all
you have to say?

1300
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:11,707
What do you want me to say?

1301
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:14,139
They're gonna let me know
if they want to charge me

1302
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:15,510
after the autopsy comes in.

1303

[camera clicking]

1305
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,110
[Killian] Yes.

1306
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:55,150
And you said
that was a gray Volkswagen.

1307
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,653
And what time was
that?

1308
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:04,693
Okay.

1309
01:11:08,629 --> 01:11:09,330
All right.

1310
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:11,800
Thank you.

1311
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:21,777
[Evan] Oh, look
at the skeletons.

1312
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,310
Why does that invisible man
wear a Band-Aid?

1313
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:26,347
Did he get hurt?

1314
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:28,714
Well, it's a bandage,
not a Band-Aid,

1315
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,919
and he wears them
so that he can be seen.

1316
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:49,738
Candy apples!

1317
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,304
Could I have this one, Daddy?

1318
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:54,342
- Hey, John.
- Hi.

1319
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:55,840
Me under here.

1320
01:11:55,842 --> 01:11:56,908
Which one do you want?

1321
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,945
One with sprinkles?

1322
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,045
Okay. Let's have one
with sprinkles,

1323
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:01,346
- and we'll have two with nuts.
- Okay.

1324
01:12:01,348 --> 01:12:02,751
Uh, do you want nuts
on yours, Zelda?

1325
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:03,952
Zelda?

1326
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:06,087
Where'd she go? Zelda?

1327
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:09,992
Zelda?

1328
01:12:10,691 --> 01:12:11,693
Zelda!

1329
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,358
Adam, will you
stay here with John?

1330
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,460
- Will you keep an eye on Adam?
- Sure.

1331
01:12:14,462 --> 01:12:17,866
Zelda! Zelda!

1332
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,102
Zelda, what are you doing?

1333
01:12:25,205 --> 01:12:27,273
- Will you stop that girl?
- [car horn honks]

1334
01:12:27,275 --> 01:12:29,411
- Hey, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire?
- [man] Watch where you're going!

1335
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,710
What the hell are you thinking?

1336
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:32,813
- Just a second, sir.
- This is my daughter.

1337
01:12:35,248 --> 01:12:37,051
Is that true?
Is this your father?

1338
01:12:37,385 --> 01:12:38,349
No.

1339
01:12:38,351 --> 01:12:39,785
Zelda Frances Birch!

1340
01:12:39,787 --> 01:12:40,819
Settle down, sir.

1341
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:42,287
I will not settle down.

1342
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:43,889
I... This is my daughter.
I am taking her home.

1343
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:45,090
She's in a lot of trouble.

1344
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:46,927
Sir, I need you to step back.

1345
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,262
Is that clear?

1346
01:12:51,466 --> 01:12:52,430
Zelda?

1347
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:53,668
That's your name?

1348
01:12:54,368 --> 01:12:55,404
Okay, Zelda,

1349
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:57,338
I want you to tell me the truth.

1350
01:12:58,306 --> 01:12:59,374
Is that your father?

1351
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:05,247
I need to see your ID, sir.

1352
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,715
This is unbelievable.

1353
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:15,056
I... I don't have my ID.

1354
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:29,137
[telephone rings]

1355
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:33,475
Okay, in you go.

1356
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:35,243
Up you go.

1357
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,044
Help him put his belt on.

1358
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,346
There you go, sir.

1359
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:42,818
Sorry for the confusion.

1360
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,884
You can't be
too careful these days.

1361
01:13:44,886 --> 01:13:46,388
- Is that what you call this?
- Oh, come on, Evan.

1362
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:54,796
[Evan] I've got all night,
young lady.

1363
01:13:57,198 --> 01:13:59,066
A shrug's not gonna cut it,
I'm afraid.

1364
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:01,069
I'm sorry.

1365
01:14:06,973 --> 01:14:09,010
You've hardly said two words
to me all week, Zelda.

1366
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,045
I know everything's
a little crazy at the moment.

1367
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:14,149
Is that what's bothering you?

1368
01:14:15,115 --> 01:14:16,048
No.

1369
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:16,985
Well, what is it?

1370
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:19,053
Promise you won't tell Mommy?

1371
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:22,223
Your mommy and I don't keep
secrets from each other,

1372
01:14:22,923 --> 01:14:24,355
okay? But if you tell me
what it is,

1373
01:14:24,357 --> 01:14:25,494
I'll decide
if she needs to know.

1374
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:29,263
She asked me about that day

1375
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:33,068
you picked me up from camp,
when you were late.

1376
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,304
Z, I need you to be
honest with me,

1377
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:40,508
okay? Completely honest.

1378
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:43,341
Do you think
I had something to do

1379
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:44,879
with what happened to that girl?

1380
01:14:48,082 --> 01:14:48,984
No.

1381
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:51,186
Oh, good, because I didn't.

1382
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:52,988
You know me.

1383
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:58,159
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

[tense music continues]

1390
01:15:57,517 --> 01:15:58,419
Okay.

1391
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:03,390
Thank you.

1392
01:16:15,269 --> 01:16:16,635
Is Evan Birch home?

1393
01:16:16,637 --> 01:16:18,039
It's Detective Malloy.

1394
01:16:18,338 --> 01:16:20,975
They had an event tonight
at the university.

1395

[overlapping chatter]

1396
01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:30,683
All right, let's do it.

1397
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:33,120
It's only a faculty party.
It'll be fine.

1398
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:36,458
We should figure out
what we're gonna say.

1399
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:38,927
Well, just the truth.

1400
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,593
It's outrageous
we're being strung along,

1401
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,132
and hopefully everything
will be cleared up soon.

1402
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,105
We're hanging in there.

1403
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,107
It's outrageous how
we've been strung along,

1404
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:58,245
but everything
will be cleared up soon.

1405
01:16:59,346 --> 01:17:00,381
Let's hope so.

1406
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:02,747
Situations like this

1407
01:17:02,749 --> 01:17:04,919
tend to show our real selves,
you know?

1408
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,486
I'll have a Chardonnay
and a scotch and soda.

1409
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:10,057
And actually, I'll have one for the road.
Double, neat.

1410
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:12,694
It's criminal, what they're
putting you through.

1411
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:14,162
You can sue, you know.

1412
01:17:14,427 --> 01:17:15,693
One battle at a time.

1413
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:17,295
I think the most important thing

1414
01:17:17,297 --> 01:17:19,066
is we gotta get Evan
back in the classroom.

1415
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:21,168
What do you mean?

1416
01:17:22,168 --> 01:17:23,070
Here you are.

1417
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,440
They pulled you from classes?

1418
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:29,144
I think I spoke
out of turn, buddy.

1419
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,675
Sorry.

1420
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:32,713
- Until when?
- Uh, spring.

1421
01:17:33,114 --> 01:17:35,380
The... The second coming.
Who knows?

1422
01:17:35,382 --> 01:17:37,184
Hey, Barbara.
You look fantastic.

1423
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:39,417
Can I talk to you for a second?

1424
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:41,088
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

1425
01:17:48,428 --> 01:17:49,463
You having fun yet?

1426
01:17:49,763 --> 01:17:51,231
When were you
planning on telling me?

1427
01:17:51,664 --> 01:17:53,631
Oh, wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

1428
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:55,235
What? What?

1429
01:17:55,436 --> 01:17:57,236
When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

1430
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:59,470
Frankly, I think it's
the least of our problems.

1431
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:00,671
You think our livelihood

1432
01:18:00,673 --> 01:18:02,374
is the least of our problems?

1433
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:04,175
Listen, listen, let's just
finish our time here,

1434
01:18:04,177 --> 01:18:06,411
and I promise we can fight
about this when we get home.

1435
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:07,648
No. I'm going home now.

1436
01:18:08,582 --> 01:18:11,519
Why? So you can finish
interrogating Zelda?

1437
01:18:12,586 --> 01:18:14,719
- Interrogating?
- Well, what else would you call it?

1438
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:16,457
Has that cop deputized you yet?

1439
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:18,590
- Ellen.
- Let go!

1440
01:18:18,592 --> 01:18:20,658
Ellen, listen. Just relax.

1441
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,294
Have a drink.

1442
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,129
- Sit down, please.
- Why? To give everyone

1443
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:26,098
- a better chance to gawk at us?
- No.

1444
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,099
It's outrageous how they're
stringing us along...

1445
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:30,469
- Ellen.
- but everything's gonna be cleared up soon!

1446
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:32,737
Do you hear
how ridiculous that sounds?

1447
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:34,273
I hear how ridiculous you sound.

1448
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:35,674
Will you please calm down?

1449
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:37,544
I'm sick of being calm!

1450
01:18:42,516 --> 01:18:43,785
Under a bit of pressure lately.

1451
01:18:47,754 --> 01:18:48,655
[Evan] Ellen!

1452
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:51,689
What's gotten into you?

1453
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:53,060
- What's gotten into me?
- Yeah.

1454
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:55,294
Just go back in there,

1455
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:56,828
and peddle whatever
jolly bullshit you want, Evan.

1456
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,429
I'm going home.

1457
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,531
All right, so that's it?
Things get tough,

1458
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:00,568
and you just leave?

1459
01:19:01,534 --> 01:19:03,268
Whatever happened
to for better or worse?

1460
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,836
[gasps] Oh,

1461
01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:07,775
you're gonna lecture me
on keeping promises?

1462
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:09,577
What's that?

1463
01:19:09,776 --> 01:19:11,712
I found it, in your desk.

1464
01:19:12,178 --> 01:19:13,080
Who wrote it?

1465
01:19:14,748 --> 01:19:17,782
[scoffs] You found it,
as in it magically appeared,

1466
01:19:17,784 --> 01:19:19,617
or you went looking
through my desk?

1467
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:21,353
Oh, no, no, no.
I searched your desk.

1468
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:24,122
I searched the whole,
entire house. Who wrote it?

1469
01:19:24,124 --> 01:19:25,890
What have I ever done
that's made you so distrustful?

1470
01:19:25,892 --> 01:19:27,492
- What have you done?
- Yeah.

1471
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:28,729
You know exactly
what you've done!

1472
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:31,565
Evanston? Really?

1473
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:34,800
God, for the millionth time,
nothing happened.

1474
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:37,236
Well, I saw you! I saw you
fucking in your office!

1475
01:19:37,238 --> 01:19:39,106
I never fucked her
in my office!

1476
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:47,614
You know what
you don't understand?

1477
01:19:49,816 --> 01:19:53,285
I don't even care
that you did it anymore.

1478
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:54,189
I don't,

1479
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,158
but it's the lie.

1480
01:19:58,626 --> 01:19:59,793
You've been telling me,

1481
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,728
you've been telling yourself nothing
happened for so many years,

1482
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:05,300
I think you actually believe it.

1483
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:11,738
And I'm terrified about what else
you could convince yourself of.

1484
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:16,411
[exhales forcefully]

- You got it.

[coins rattling]

1491
01:22:44,557 --> 01:22:45,859
Have you got
a telephone I can use?

1492
01:22:46,627 --> 01:22:48,329
[telephone line rings]

1493
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:01,776
Detective Malloy, please.

1494
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:03,845
I'd like to report a crime.

1495
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:05,847
[writing]

1496
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,914
- [knock on door]
- Mm-hmm.

1497
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:10,350
Can we talk?

1498
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,721
Sure.

1499
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:16,391
Come on in.

1500
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:18,860
Alone?

1501
01:23:30,503 --> 01:23:31,439
Long night?

1502
01:23:32,573 --> 01:23:33,638
Yeah.

1503
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,709
How 'bout some coffee?

1504
01:23:38,544 --> 01:23:39,446
What did you do there?

1505
01:23:40,381 --> 01:23:41,082
Uh...

1506
01:23:46,019 --> 01:23:46,921
[sighs]

1507
01:23:47,687 --> 01:23:49,423
You're a tough man
to track down.

1508
01:23:53,494 --> 01:23:54,395
Where have you been?

1509
01:24:05,672 --> 01:24:06,708
[recorder clicks]

1510
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:11,111
Do you have trouble remembering
things sometimes, Detective?

1511
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:13,648
People and places, sequences?

1512
01:24:14,515 --> 01:24:15,813
I've read
a lot of studies on it.

1513
01:24:15,815 --> 01:24:18,952
It's, uh, it's fascinating.

1514
01:24:20,587 --> 01:24:25,892
You know, m... memory is really the
least reliable function of our brain.

1515
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:30,530
I mean, it's reliable in that it
reinforces one's concept of self,

1516
01:24:31,964 --> 01:24:33,532
as opposed to providing

1517
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:38,906
an... an accurate account
of past events.

1518
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:41,173
Is this gonna be on the test?

1519
01:24:41,175 --> 01:24:42,944
[ominous music playing]

1520
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:56,591
I had a student once
when I was at Evanston,

1521
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,461
Carol. We, um...

1522
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,661
- we had an affair.
- Mm-hmm.

1523
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:06,667
Her parents threatened
to sue the university, I think.

1524
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:11,806
Ellen was pregnant, and, uh, I
resigned, and we moved here.

1525
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:19,847
But I also remember
that nothing happened.

1526
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,182
She tried to kiss me.

1527
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:25,617
I said no, and she got angry,

1528
01:25:25,619 --> 01:25:27,551
and she told her parents
that we slept together anyway,

1529
01:25:27,553 --> 01:25:29,589
and that's... that's why
we had to leave.

1530
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:32,059
But I don't remember
which one actually happened.

1531
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,061
I can't prove either,

1532
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:37,696
and, uh,
and without proof I'm...

1533
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:38,633
[gasping]

1534
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:53,080
I migh...

1535
01:25:55,114 --> 01:25:56,684
I might have killed that girl.

1536
01:25:59,686 --> 01:26:02,490
I saw her that day at the lake.

1537
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:07,627
<i>I... I went over to... to see he.</i>

1538
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:14,769
<i>She... She remembered
me from, uh,</i>

1539
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:17,868
<i>from a... a ride
I'd given her once,</i>

1540
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:19,737
and, uh, she knew
a lot about me.

1541
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,141
She'd read my book.

1542
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:24,645
<i>She had a crush on me.</i>

1543
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:27,545
She asked if I wanted
to take a walk.

1544
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:29,684
She knew an old trail
around the dam.

1545
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:32,053
<i>I said, "Yeah, that'd be nice."</i>

1546
01:26:38,992 --> 01:26:40,494
<i>We were alone.</i>

1547
01:26:40,793 --> 01:26:42,497
<i>It was quiet.
The view was beautiful.</i>

1548
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:46,730
<i>No one had looked at me
like that in a long time.</i>

1549
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:48,002
[ominous music continues]

[Evan] <i>Things
got a little heated.</i>

1552
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:09,756
And...

1553
01:27:12,926 --> 01:27:14,695
I tried to hold her arms...

1554
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:18,265
so she couldn't move,
j... just to keep control.

1555
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:21,800
I mean, she...
she tried to push me,

1556
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:22,934
<i>and she ran.</i>

1557
01:27:22,936 --> 01:27:24,539
<i>I chased after her. I...</i>

1558
01:27:24,937 --> 01:27:26,673
<i>I didn't want her
to get the wrong idea.</i>

1559
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:30,241
<i>She lost her footing.</i>

1560
01:27:30,243 --> 01:27:31,876
She... She fell

1561
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:33,812
and hit her head.
I panicked. I...

1562
01:27:33,814 --> 01:27:37,151
I didn't know what to do,
and I pushed her in.

1563
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:41,254
I mean, it wasn't on purpose.

1564
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:44,025
- None of this was... was on purpose.
- Evan!

1565
01:27:46,059 --> 01:27:49,029
The washrooms are around the corner
if you want to splash your face.

1566
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:52,767
Am I under arrest?

1567
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:54,569
No.

1568
01:27:58,904 --> 01:27:59,940
Read that.

1569
01:28:03,776 --> 01:28:05,279
It's the final autopsy report.

1570
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:07,347
You didn't kill Joyce Bonner.

1571
01:28:08,214 --> 01:28:10,584
She fell off a cliff on the
opposite side of the lake.

1572
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:12,919
It was an accident.

1573
01:28:13,186 --> 01:28:14,919
And she wasn't found
by the dam.

1574
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,958
That was misinformation
we leaked.

1575
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:19,860
The autopsy shows
she broke both her wrists,

1576
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,064
probably from trying
to slow her fall.

1577
01:28:23,864 --> 01:28:24,899
Her neck was broken.

1578
01:28:25,164 --> 01:28:26,367
The fall killed her instantly.

1579
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:29,869
That's why we were trying
to get you in here.

1580
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,370
I d... I don't understand.

1581
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:34,675
- I just confessed to you...
- The case is closed.

1582
01:28:34,908 --> 01:28:36,276
She never hit her head
on a rock.

1583
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:40,178
There's no evidence of any
intercourse or a struggle,

1584
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,912
no skin under her fingernails,

1585
01:28:41,914 --> 01:28:43,782
no bruises
where you grabbed her.

1586
01:28:43,784 --> 01:28:44,919
I could go on.

1587
01:28:45,252 --> 01:28:47,120
I'm sitting here telling you
that I killed her.

1588
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,123
Can you prove it? [scoffs]

1589
01:28:50,123 --> 01:28:52,026
Because I sure as hell
haven't been able to.

1590
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:55,096
<i>I know you were there that day.</i>

1591
01:28:57,698 --> 01:28:58,999
<i>I know she was in your car,</i>

1592
01:29:00,033 --> 01:29:02,102
and I know about your history
with students...

1593
01:29:03,936 --> 01:29:05,372
but humans leave traces,

1594
01:29:06,707 --> 01:29:08,005
fibers from clothing,

1595
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:09,709
skin fragments, footprints,

1596
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:11,943
and there's no trace of you

1597
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:14,315
<i>beyond the scribblings
I found in the trash can.</i>

1598
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,182
<i>There's no proof

and, uh, apologizes
for any inconveniences.

1607
01:29:42,743 --> 01:29:44,879
I'll have a patrolman
drive you home.

1608
01:29:45,846 --> 01:29:46,877
You're letting me go?

1609
01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:47,981
Look, I'm not a priest.

1610
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:50,915
You want to screw college girls
in the woods,

1611
01:29:50,917 --> 01:29:52,951
go ahead. You're not the first,
and you won't be the last,

1612
01:29:52,953 --> 01:29:55,356
but don't look to me
for absolution or forgiveness.

1613
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:56,757
I'm no shrink.

1614
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,292
I'm like you,

1615
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,162
someone who looks for proof.

1616
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,901
And when I find it,

1617
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,338
I sure as hell
hold on to it tighter than you.

[knock on door]

Let him sleep it off,
and then drive Mr. Birch home.

1620
01:30:24,918 --> 01:30:26,087
His family is waiting.

[Adam] Daddy's home!

Ah, hey, babies. Oh.

1626
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:25,980
We caught him, Daddy!

1627
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:27,314
You caught who?

[squeaking]

1629

[Zelda] His name is Herbie.

1630
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:32,386
Can we keep him, Daddy? Please?

1631
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:34,352
We'll keep him
in Jinx's old cage,

1632
01:31:34,354 --> 01:31:36,390
and I'll take care
of him. I promise.

1633
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:38,325
What does Mommy say?

1634
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:40,561
I said we needed to make
the decision together.

1635
01:31:41,328 --> 01:31:42,960
Why don't you take him upstairs,

1636
01:31:42,962 --> 01:31:44,264
and we'll talk about it.

1637
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:02,145
They, uh...
They've closed the case.

1638
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:05,218
It was a... It was an accident.

She fell.

1640

It's... It's all over.

01:32:09,388 --> 01:32:10,290
What?

1642
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:13,961
Why aren't you happy?

1643
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:17,298
Well, what Malloy thought
never worried me.

1644
01:32:22,936 --> 01:32:23,971
What happened to your hand?

1645
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:27,471
Ah, it was stupid.

1646
01:32:27,473 --> 01:32:29,510
I... I got drunk, and...

1647
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:36,950
I would understand
if you wanna leave.

1648
01:32:38,217 --> 01:32:40,287
Well, that's no great feat
of understanding.

1649
01:32:40,552 --> 01:32:43,223
Ah, Ellen, please, I'm...
I'm trying to apologize.

1650
01:32:43,422 --> 01:32:45,325
I don't want an apology.

1651
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:49,597
What... What do you want?

1652
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:51,431
I want our life back.

1653
01:32:52,632 --> 01:32:54,034
I want our marriage back.

1654
01:32:55,668 --> 01:32:57,301
I want all the secrets
we've ignored

1655
01:32:57,303 --> 01:32:59,440
for the past five years
out in the open.

1656
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:12,887
Open it.

1657
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,289
Whatever it says,
whoever it's from, just open it.

1658
01:33:17,289 --> 01:33:18,658
There's no starting over.

1659
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,930
We tried that moving here.

1660
01:33:25,998 --> 01:33:30,637
We can only go forward,
either together or apart.

1661
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:33,439
You can't change
what you've done,

1662
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:36,139
can't change that I stood by

1663
01:33:36,141 --> 01:33:37,308
and I watched you make choices,

1664
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,479
even though you knew

1665
01:33:39,512 --> 01:33:41,482
they could destroy
everything that we've built.

1666
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:46,620
Ellen, whatever you decide,

1667
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,091
I promise you
I will never lie to you again.

1668
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:53,693
I will always
tell you the truth.

1669
01:33:56,628 --> 01:33:57,530
Yeah.

1670
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:07,540
Always the truth...

1671
01:34:10,075 --> 01:34:11,244
not what you interpret.
