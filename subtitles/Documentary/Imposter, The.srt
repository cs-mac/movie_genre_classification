1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,874
BOY: I want to get a good picture,

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,994
some more pictures.

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,872
This is Carey's room, her bed.

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,795
This is the birthday girl's mattress
and everything else.

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,159
She's even got a TV

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,428
in her room.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,708
Ain't she lucky?

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,876
That's my sister.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,118
The birthday girl.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,916
Ain't she beautiful?

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,159
And here is her brother.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,553
Nick.

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,949
WOMAN: The thought of what somebody
could have done to him...

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,232
It gives you nightmares.

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,919
It really does.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,518
ANOTHER WOMAN:
His disappearance never made the news.

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,552
It wasn't news to them,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,116
it was just news to us.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,034
It came to the point where, you know,
you're not gonna find him alive,

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,197
but you just want to
find what happened to him.

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,916
(Pouring rain)

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,636
MOTHER:
They called me at work when I wasn't there

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,437
and they wrote a message and said,
"Someone from Spain has Nicholas."

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,196
He wants to come home.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,514
My mom called me.

26
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,312
I was at work.

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,554
And she says, "Sitting down?

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,079
You're not going to believe this."

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,192
Course. It was mysterious,

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,470
it was er...exciting,

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,913
it was worrisome,

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,191
er, it was all mixed emotions, you know?

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,832
Ecstatic.

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,552
Bewildered.

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,715
You know, Spain!

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,398
Isn't that like across the country?

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,635
Um, how did he get there?

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,638
You want...
you have like a hundred thousand questions

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,392
that you want answered immediately.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,119
I felt wonderful,

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,590
you know, excited.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,715
You wanna see him, touch him,
you know what I mean?

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,672
And you want it all to happen now.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,914
(Pouring rain)

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,479
From as long as I remember,
I wanted to be someone else.

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,870
Someone who was acceptable.

47
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,919
(Siren)

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,308
The most important thing for me and what
I learned very fast was to be convincing.

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,359
When the police arrive,

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,391
I have immediately to put into their mind

51
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,715
they have a kid in front of them,
not an adult.

52
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,672
So it was very important for me
to behave like one.

53
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,836
(Communications over police radio)

54
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,679
(Speaks Spanish)

55
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,630
(Continues to speak Spanish)

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,468
They would see me with...
in a big coat with younger clothes.

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,038
And they would see a kid with a hat,
which is very low in the eyes.

58
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,308
They couldn't see my eyes.

59
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,795
(Speaks Spanish)

60
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,359
I wanted to provoke on them
a sense of guilt...

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,594
(Speaks Spanish)

62
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,918
..of being adults and to be close to a kid
which is dead scared.

63
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,191
When you see a kid that,
you know, got nervous reflexes,

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,959
that you can't touch them,
you can't approach them,

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,276
then you understand, you understand
that something is wrong.

66
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,390
(Speaks Spanish)

67
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,636
(Speaks Spanish)

68
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,829
I wasn't the one who was telling them
I've been sexually abused.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,997
I made them ask me that by my attitude,

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,837
by my way of doing things.

71
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,997
They were the one thinking about it
and that gave me power.

72
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,192
I didn't speak much.

73
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,035
(Woman speaks Spanish)

74
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,030
It's very hard to read a kid
that doesn't speak a word sometime.

75
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,913
(Speaks Spanish)

76
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,991
(Speaks Spanish)

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,600
If a cop don't know who a kid is
and where he comes from,

78
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,835
he just can't keep him
in the police station.

79
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,951
And I knew that eventually they would
have to put me into a children's home...

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,672
(Speaks Spanish)

81
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,359
..and that's all I wanted.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,195
Nobody ever gave a damn about me

83
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,711
and to know that if I change my identity

84
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,228
the reward was eventually
to be put in a place

85
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,555
where actually
they really cared about me...

86
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,436
then, hell, yeah.
I mean, I was reborn.

87
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,391
I mean... (Laughs) ..I was born again.

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,959
Nobody ever gave me a childhood,

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,310
because to give a kid a childhood
you need to, to love that kid.

90
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,951
I felt like I belonged there.

91
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,510
(Speaks Spanish)

92
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,037
They didn't know
that I was 23, 23 years old.

93
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,429
I was considered like one of them.

94
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,471
BEVERLY: I told him to be home by dinner

95
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,956
and gave him five bucks
to go play basketball,

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,070
and... he took off.

97
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,156
He called home, asking for a ride, er...

98
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,918
which was probably, I don't know,

99
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,315
he's within a couple of miles
from his house

100
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,036
and his mother works late
and sleeps during the day

101
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,234
and his older brother Jason
answered the phone.

102
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,037
When I woke up Jason was there and said
that he had called and wanted a ride home,

103
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,150
but Jason didn't want to wake me up,

104
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,389
so told him he had to walk home.

105
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,316
And that's...was the day,
the last time we heard from him.

106
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,709
You spend 24 hours crying, sick, worried,

107
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,279
then you get mad, then you get scared,

108
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,033
and then you try to get empowered.
You know, "OK, what can we do?

109
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,071
We have to do flyers,
we'll do this, we'll..."

110
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,434
You know, so instead of...

111
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,554
you don't cry, you do something positive

112
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,956
and try to work towards, I guess,
a solution of finding him.

113
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,189
BEVERLY: I thought somebody offered him
a ride, and he got in the car.

114
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,435
I dunno, I think he would have got in a car
with someone that he didn't know.

115
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,076
What are you looking at?

116
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,790
I could see the worry and the pain
they were going through,

117
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,549
so I always said, you know,
"He's out there," you know.

118
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,238
"He'll resurface," you know.

119
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,670
Unfortunately for me, it was one of
those places which is very rare in Spain

120
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,072
where actually they can't stand
having a kid with no identity card,

121
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,190
er, no proof of who he is.

122
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,356
(Woman speaks Spanish)

123
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,674
They wanted absolutely to know who I was,
where do I come from,

124
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,234
erm, they needed to know precise.

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,953
(Woman continues in Spanish)

126
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,477
"If you don't tell us,
if can't prove us who you are,

127
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,193
I'm gonna have you fingerprinted
and your pictures taken."

128
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,950
I couldn't allow that to happen.

129
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,434
I had to find a way out of that.

130
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,597
So the only, only thing left there was

131
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,710
was 1) go to prison

132
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,919
2) prove to them that I'm someone.

133
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,390
I said that I was American.

134
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,797
That er...I ran away and I was
willing to contact my family for them

135
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,990
but I wanted to do it myself.

136
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,236
I didn't want my family to receive a phone call
from the police or the persecutor

137
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,918
or the judge in Spain.

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,359
I wanted to do it myself.

139
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,879
And I said I would need to be
in the office for the night

140
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,353
because I live in the States.

141
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,949
The States is, you know,
the times is different, it's er...

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,231
So erm, you know,
just leave me in the office

143
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,191
and tomorrow you will have all you need.

144
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,279
(Speaks Spanish)

145
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,190
In this office nobody could hear me.

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,515
I knew that I could pass myself
for anyone on the phone,

147
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,118
could convince anyone of anything.

148
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,517
So I call the American Police.

149
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,959
(Phone rings)

150
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,718
County South, Detective Fowler.

151
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,795
The New York Police.

152
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,039
Lieutenant Kojak's office.

153
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,755
Different police stations in the States.

154
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,832
- Dobie here.
- Who is this, please?

155
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
I told them every time
that I was a policeman from Spain

156
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,636
called Jonathan Dorian,

157
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,398
that we had found a kid,

158
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,272
we are sure he's from the States
but we don't know where.

159
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,469
How long ago was this?

160
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,957
He's been maybe missing for a few years,
that someone must be looking for him.

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,434
So the police say, well, you know,

162
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,677
we got hundreds of posters
of missing persons on the wall

163
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,915
and we just can't go through each of them.

164
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,632
But what we can do for you

165
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,355
is to give you the number of the centre
for missing and exploited children

166
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,879
of Arlington, Virginia.

167
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,674
Centre for missing and exploited children.
Lorraine speaking. How may I help you?

168
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,348
Er, we have a kid in a shelter,
certainly is American,

169
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,311
who is about 14, 15 years old

170
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,669
but the problem is
we don't know who he is...

171
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,073
I describe myself.

172
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,635
Every detail I gave was details
that I know that I could handle.

173
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,795
I wanted to be vague enough for her
to look at many different things.

174
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,308
I wanted her to have many possibilities.

175
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,588
Let me just take a look here.

176
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,471
"I got maybe something," she said.

177
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,513
"Maybe, you know,
we got a kid from San Antonio

178
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,632
missing since June 13 1994.

179
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,875
His name is Nicholas Barclay."

180
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,957
I said, "Could you send me a fax
of what he looks like?"

181
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,674
In my head, I was just a police officer
with, with Nicholas Barclay next to me,

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,316
trying to confirm his identity
and like any other policeman would do.

183
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,916
Let's see if it's him.

184
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,156
I thought, let's see if it's him.

185
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,795
I look at it, black and white picture,
old picture.

186
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,312
Well, missing for three or four years,

187
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,432
guarantee one thing,
there will be a change.

188
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,151
If there is a change, there will be doubt.

189
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,668
If there is doubt, then I got a chance.

190
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,876
Something in my head decided
I could do it, that I had to try.

191
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,435
I took the phone and I told her
that this is Nicholas.

192
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,311
We got him, it's him.

193
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,316
It's incredible, it's him.

194
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,673
My mom called me
and she says, "Are you sitting down?

195
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,676
You're not gonna believe this."

196
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,797
And I said, "What, Mom?" She goes,
"The police department called me

197
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,877
and they think they found Nicholas
in Linares."

198
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,912
So I'm like, "OK,
where in Texas is Linares?"

199
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,076
Because Texas has a lot of small towns.

200
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,077
And then she was like, "No, Spain."

201
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,394
I'm like, "Spain?"

202
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,790
Oh, God, how to explain the emotions.

203
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,070
It's like all these different emotions,
from excitement to bewilderment,

204
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,997
to what do we do?

205
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,828
What's the next step? How do we get him?
When do we get to talk to him?

206
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,873
I knew that after that
they would contact me.

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,357
They would try to verify, to call,
to see, to... Is it true? Is it here?

208
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,550
Is it, you know...
Carey, the family and all that.

209
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,390
(Ringing tone)

210
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,158
Well, when I first got, you know,
got a hold of the shelter,

211
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,158
they put me on the phone
with Jonathan Dorian

212
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,158
who said that he worked
for the, a shelter,

213
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,596
and that he was the one
who was talking with Nicholas

214
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,189
and had got the information from Nicholas
on who he really was.

215
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,914
When she called, I said that Nicholas
was seated next to me.

216
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,350
But he was very scared,
he was very traumatised

217
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,072
and he didn't want to talk to no-one.

218
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,680
He sounded very responsible,
very concerned.

219
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,269
Er, he claims that he has been abused,
that he's been hurt,

220
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,437
that erm...certainly he's been abducted.

221
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,109
I kind of thought he was like
a social worker type of person.

222
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,628
Um, very reassuring.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,116
She said, "Is he saying anything?

224
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,276
Is he talking about us? Does he remember?"

225
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,630
Well, actually, I think he forgot
about everything, you know.

226
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,477
He doesn't remember very much.

227
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,715
He remember you but not very much.

228
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,914
We were told he was held by
some kind of like a sex slave kind of ring,

229
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,318
and that he had escaped from there and
that he was found wandering the streets.

230
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,352
She was heartbroken
but at the same time she was very happy.

231
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,992
I wanted to hear his voice.

232
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,359
No!

233
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,837
Absolutely, there was no way I was going
to talk to her pretending to be Nicholas

234
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,395
because I wasn't Nicholas
and she was his sister,

235
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,796
so er...it would have been a risk,

236
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,637
too big a risk for me,

237
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,477
but I did say a few words.

238
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,518
She said: "Hello, Nicholas.
You hear me, Nicholas?"

239
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,951
Nothing.

240
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,552
"I love you, Nicholas.
I want to take you back home with me.

241
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,828
I'm gonna take you, baby.

242
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,871
I'm gonna come and get you and..."

243
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,350
And maybe you hear "Love you"
or something like that, you know.

244
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,319
Very far away. It, it...

245
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,237
And then she say: "Was it him?"

246
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,077
I said, "Yeah. He said 'I love you."'

247
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,396
Oh. And then she started crying
on the phone.

248
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,117
You start crying, you tell him, "We're
going to come and get you, bring you home.

249
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,436
We'll get there, we're going to bring
you home, and I love you too."

250
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,914
I erm... I washed her brain.

251
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,598
I didn't stop,
because I didn't think of stopping.

252
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,674
I didn't watch myself in the mirror
and say, "What the fuck are you doing?

253
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,711
Stop that immediately."

254
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,831
(Footsteps)

255
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,869
I realised that I've crossed the line.

256
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,640
I wasn't pretending no more
to have another identity. I stole one.

257
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,308
(Phone rings)

258
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,075
I got a phone call: "Would you please
call a Carey Gibson?"

259
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,550
Well, I was astounded by what Carey said,

260
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,275
so one of the first things I said to her was,

261
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,677
when the FBI
and the US State Department assist you

262
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,919
and uh...get you and your brother back here,
I have to interview him immediately.

263
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,400
When the welfare of a minor,

264
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,998
er...is in jeopardy,

265
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,994
our reaction has to be very quick,

266
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,598
er...very responsive.

267
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,834
We have to put ourselves

268
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,074
in the position of the child

269
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,111
or the child's parents or guardians.

270
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,911
Generally when a child is missing for years,

271
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,954
either the child is dead or the child is not found

272
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,755
and to find that child in another country
is extremely rare.

273
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,192
That made it all the more compelling for us

274
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,915
to make sure that we did everything right
in terms of er...

275
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,997
establishing who he was
and getting him back to his family.

276
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,917
My main concern was getting him back,

277
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,509
so that my part could start,
the investigation could start...

278
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,949
we could find out
what had happened to this child.

279
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,070
I sent somebody out there
as quickly as possible.

280
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,868
The next day...
The next day, it got beyond my control.

281
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,150
The centre for missing
and exploited children sent me a flyer.

282
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,151
There was the picture of Nicholas
at the time of his disappearance...

283
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,477
And I saw what real Nicholas looked like,
really with colours and everything.

284
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,510
He was very blond, very...

285
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,790
He had blue eyes.

286
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,796
He looked nothing like me!

287
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,469
Nothing!

288
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,512
There's, you know, the only thing
he had in common with me

289
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,835
was that he had five fingers
at each hands.

290
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,750
Then I said, fuck, let's burn myself.

291
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,391
You know, I burned the flyer.

292
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,510
If I could have burned the identity that I said

293
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,199
and every word that had been
out of my mouth for the past few days,

294
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,912
I would have burned them too!

295
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,314
When everyone tells me
that the American Embassy is coming

296
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,954
and er...everybody's, you know...

297
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,468
and don't worry, Nicholas,
we're gonna take care of you.

298
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,548
Well, yeah, OK,
you know, I... I couldn't do nothing.

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,274
The only thing I could do

300
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,471
was think of how was going to be the prison
where I was going to be.

301
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,199
I didn't know what to do.

302
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,196
I really didn't know what to do.

303
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,233
When the Vice Consul
first arrived in Linares,

304
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,238
he got to the centre and found
Nicholas Barclay had disappeared.

305
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,793
I said, you've got to find him.

306
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,273
So he essentially,
with somebody from the Linares Centre,

307
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,356
went around looking for him.

308
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,638
Our priority was his safety and to make sure
he was reunited with the family.

309
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,756
I tried to run away
like I would do anywhere else.

310
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,239
Nicholas Barclay?

311
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,991
God didn't want me to leave this place.

312
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,353
I spoke with the vice consul and asked him
about his interactions with Nicholas.

313
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,234
He reported at the time
that he spoke English,

314
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,390
that he, he was,
he was at least at that moment

315
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,112
convinced that this was an American.

316
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,193
When I woke up the next morning,
everything was normal.

317
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,958
(Knock at door)

318
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,157
Then I saw the director of the shelter
that said,

319
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,510
"Well, you know, you must be happy,
your sister is on the way."

320
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,355
So I said, "What do you mean?"

321
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,712
He say, "Well, your sister,
you know, from San Antonio,

322
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,194
she's on the plane,
she's coming to get you."

323
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,393
Fuck, you know. Fuck! Fuck!

324
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,589
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

325
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,198
I'd never left the country.

326
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,708
I didn't know even what it entailed.

327
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,998
I knew Mom couldn't handle the flight.

328
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,473
She can't, she couldn't do it.

329
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,873
I have to do this.

330
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,071
I just gotta go get him
and get him back here where he's safe.

331
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,237
I should have thought of that.

332
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,595
I should have thought of the consequences.

333
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,631
If you do that, imagine for a second

334
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,037
that you're the father of a kid that's
been missing for three years, four months,

335
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,356
and that they find him in Columbia,
er...what would you do?

336
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,311
What would be the first thing you'd do?

337
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,791
I would jump on a fucking plane.

338
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,238
I didn't sleep for two days
before I got on the plane.

339
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,272
Fear, but also anticipation,

340
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,278
cos you want to get there, get there.

341
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,915
You want to see him, hold him,
smell him, just get there.

342
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,116
You can't prepare to play a role
of a person that you don't know.

343
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,955
I couldn't be Nicholas Barclay
because I didn't know Nicholas Barclay.

344
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,512
I didn't even know at that moment
if he was left or right-handed.

345
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,032
So, er, that was a problem.

346
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,150
I got on the plane and tried to sleep.

347
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,838
Didn't work.

348
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,951
(Nick's voice)

349
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,951
The director...

350
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,754
This is Nick, mwhah.

351
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,552
BEVERLY: He thought he was an adult.

352
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,592
We called him 13 going on 30.

353
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,755
Very difficult to discipline him.

354
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,637
If he made up his mind
he was gonna do something,

355
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,638
pretty much there wasn't a lot you could do.

356
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,991
Put the lighter down.

357
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,118
CAREY: He'd run away before
for a night or two, mad at Mom.

358
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,469
"I'm leaving, I'll find a new mom, a new home.

359
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,232
Kiss my ass," kind of thing.

360
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,034
And he, you know... would leave
and she would hunt him down

361
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,072
and find out where he is
and he'd show up the next day.

362
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,831
He was not, um, you know,
this perfect nice sweet innocent,

363
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,276
he was a very street-smart city boy.

364
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,149
- It's nice to meet ya. I am the director.
- In here, Nick.

365
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,191
See, ain't I beautiful?

366
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,120
He had beautiful blond hair.

367
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,833
Kind of looked like, erm, a little pixie.

368
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,477
He had blond hair and blue eyes
and a bit of a gap between his teeth.

369
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,511
When he smiled, you could see it.

370
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,834
Finally I'm on the ground.
"Who, who, who am I looking for?

371
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,757
What do they look like? Are they in suits?

372
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,677
Oh, damn, you can smoke here. Thank God!"

373
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,114
The air smelt different.

374
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,197
Erm,
it was a lot less crowded than I thought.

375
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,873
I did everything I could
to give myself a chance.

376
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,913
I bought product to colour my hair totally blond.

377
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,876
The gentlemen and a lady approached me,

378
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,195
cos I wasn't sure where to go

379
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,708
and we went straight into a car
and started driving.

380
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,349
On the flyers it said that Nicholas Barclay
had three tattoos.

381
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,238
There was a girl inside the shelter
that did small tattoos just like that.

382
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,191
She was no pro, she was just a kid.

383
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,271
And I asked her to put those tattoos

384
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,151
that were on the flyers on me.

385
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,956
I was quiet and that's when
the lady started talking to me.

386
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,231
She kept my mind busy
with explaining the countryside to me

387
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,311
the whole way down there on the drive.

388
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,315
I took big sunglasses, I took a hat,
I took a scarf, I took a glove.

389
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,518
I thought that if she couldn't see me,

390
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,233
then she wouldn't be able to say
I'm not her brother.

391
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,277
We stopped for a Coca-Cola,
which I thought was really cool.

392
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,757
They had coke there and it was
the anxiety of how long it was taking.

393
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,474
Minutes before she arrived
I was convinced it was finished.

394
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,871
That I was gonna get arrested
and maybe beat up also

395
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,070
because they were
not going to be happy about it.

396
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,954
I remember going into like a waiting area.

397
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,956
I'm speaking with a couple of people from
the home saying that he was in his room.

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,719
He'd been locked in his room all day.
He wouldn't let anyone go in.

399
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,070
Finally when I heard someone
knocking at the door and saying,

400
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,193
"Hey, Nicholas, your sister is downstairs,

401
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,356
er...she's waiting for you, she's there..."

402
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,150
CAREY: I went downstairs
and into like a courtyard.

403
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,919
There were some kids playing
like ball against a wall

404
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,997
and looked up at the window
and told him,

405
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,873
"I'm here, come here. I want to see you,
I want to hold you."

406
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,435
I remember seeing him look out the window.

407
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,273
I was sure that as soon as the sister
was gonna see me,

408
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,518
she was going to say
"What the fuck is that?" You know.

409
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,551
That's not...that's not Nicholas.

410
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,191
I waited maybe 10 minutes.

411
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,678
I knew I was about to lose everything.

412
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,952
I knew I couldn't wait no more,

413
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,433
that I couldn't go away,

414
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,277
that I couldn't just disappear,

415
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,595
so I opened the door and I went down.

416
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,915
It was just this sense of immense relief.

417
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,913
Just seeing, touching,
kissing, holding him.

418
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,196
I said, "What the hell?" You know.

419
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,953
He's here, we're here, I have him.

420
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,716
She didn't even wait a second
or two seconds.

421
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,910
She jump on me, she jump on me,

422
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,518
she took me in her arms

423
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,758
and she said, "Nicholas, oh, and you
were afraid I wouldn't recognise you.

424
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,597
I would remember that nose."

425
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,077
So I just... I remember touching his nose
and telling him, um,

426
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,396
"I remember that nose,
you kind of look like your Uncle Pat."

427
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,596
She said, "Don't worry," like she always say,
"everything is going to be fine.

428
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,392
Everything is going to be perfect.

429
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,271
I know it's you."

430
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,559
He was just...just basically
told me he loved me,

431
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,390
and he didn't say a whole lot
until all the people left.

432
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,832
Only God know why she would
do something like that,

433
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,389
but...but I know one thing for sure
is there was no other way.

434
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,034
She came for me and she wanted me back.

435
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,037
We went to the visit room
and she showed me dozens of pictures.

436
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,751
Pictures, pictures, pictures.

437
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,148
You remember, this was with Mom
at the, at the house we were living in

438
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,111
before you, you went missing.

439
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,670
Remember this was
when you were playing with Scotty.

440
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,711
Remember this was...

441
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,438
And he was like, "Jason looks the same,
Codey's gotten pretty big, huh?

442
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,155
Mom, God, Mom looks exactly the same.
Has she put on weight?

443
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,629
Wanted to know if Grandpa
was still an asshole,

444
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,911
um, told me how much he loved Grandma
and he missed her.

445
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,152
I remember seeing the tattoo,
the cross between his, you know,

446
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,519
right here on his hand.

447
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,597
I just kept thinking
how much he looks like Uncle Pat

448
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,837
and how mom was going to be
really surprised how tall he was.

449
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,914
She said that he looked very different,

450
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,996
that he had, you know, grown up...

451
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,075
..and erm...

452
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,672
he's very quiet,
you know, kinda held back.

453
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,439
He talked with a funny accent.

454
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,393
But it was always a whisper and very quiet
like he was hiding from something.

455
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,469
I mean, God,
look what he had been through.

456
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,591
He wasn't the same person.

457
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,518
He wasn't the same Nicholas
that disappeared four years before.

458
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,552
He had been held and tortured
and God knows what else.

459
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,591
He wasn't that same person.

460
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,231
The judge in Linares wanted to make sure
that there was in fact some legal basis

461
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,149
for Nicholas claiming to be er...
Carey Gibson's lost brother.

462
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,477
So now the problem was that they
had the sister and the embassy official

463
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,432
that were swearing
that I was Nicholas Barclay

464
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,438
and there was the police
and the prosecutor

465
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,313
and the judge
who were not convinced at all.

466
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,635
The judge insisted on separate interviews

467
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,711
and part of the evidence that was in those
interviews was a family photo album.

468
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,237
And the judge said, "Listen,
the only way for you to prove

469
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,272
that you're really Nicholas
is we got pictures here

470
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,117
that you've never seen before.

471
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,271
I'm gonna show you five of them."

472
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,591
Number one, OK.

473
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,672
Number two, OK.

474
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,278
Number three, OK.

475
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,958
Number four, OK.

476
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,353
On the five one I made a mistake,

477
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,479
but it was too late.

478
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,795
She was already convinced
I was Nicholas Barclay.

479
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,959
(Speaks Spanish)

480
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,838
At that point I didn't see how I could
not document him as a US citizen.

481
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,189
I would not have been able to do anything
if Carey didn't show me those pictures.

482
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,353
They took picture of me,
with no hat, with nothing.

483
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,034
Which was, you know, they saw my eyes.

484
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,471
Erm, the constitution of the United States.
I swear to be a US citizen.

485
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,033
You know, it wasn't real but I did it.

486
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,112
CAREY: We didn't do a whole lot of talking
the night before we got on the plane.

487
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,908
Not uncomfortable, just silence,
and it was almost like a peaceful silence.

488
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,072
You know, I could hear him breathing
and I just felt pretty peaceful.

489
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,436
I'd been thinking about running away
even before I met her.

490
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,115
All I got to do was take a taxi cab
and, going to a train station,

491
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,991
buy myself a ticket out of Spain.

492
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,476
I could have done that
in a couple of minutes.

493
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,675
Nothing was stopping me, nothing.

494
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,280
I went down a few times in the hallway,

495
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,552
always wondering if I was doing
the right thing, the wrong thing.

496
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,673
Should I go, shouldn't I go,
should I go, shouldn't I go?

497
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,631
(Distant shouting)

498
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,395
When I was born,
I don't think there was much love.

499
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,709
My mother was very, very young at the time
and she was, she was only 17 years old,

500
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,629
met er...older man, which was my father,
from Algeria.

501
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,396
My grandfather was a very racist person

502
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,877
and knowing that the man my mother
spent the night with is an Algerian,

503
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,356
he wanted absolutely my mother
to have an abortion.

504
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,437
Er, to get rid of me
even before I was born.

505
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,355
For him an Arab should be
dealt with a nuclear weapon

506
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,391
and a black man is a monkey.

507
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,717
Before I was born,
I definitely I had the wrong identity.

508
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,512
Er, I already didn't know...I was already
prepared not to know who I really was.

509
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,271
A new identity with a real passport,
an American passport.

510
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,436
I could go to the US, go to school there.

511
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,556
Live with that family
and just being someone.

512
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,151
And don't have never again
to worry about being identified.

513
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,231
I saw the opportunity.

514
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,475
A woman that could go through so much
to get me with her back in a family

515
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,513
which got kids, which seem a fam...
a loving family,

516
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,077
gotta be some...somebody good,

517
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,510
You know, I had conflicting rules
inside my own head.

518
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,712
Carey want me to be Nicholas
but what about the others?

519
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,716
Are they going to want me
to be Nicholas too?

520
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,438
I didn't understand why he was so...
like, nervous, you know what I mean?

521
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,836
He was like, you know,
constantly moving and to the bathroom,

522
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,353
and watching people,

523
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,630
watching me,
he was always watching me.

524
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,871
She was always looking at me.

525
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,434
I attested it to him just being scared.

526
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,431
You know, he's going back home

527
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,469
and we don't know what's happened to him,

528
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,351
how his mind's working.

529
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,595
Um, but he was just...
maybe he was afraid

530
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,599
that, that he wouldn't be recognised
or, or Mom wouldn't love him any more.

531
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,717
I'm gonna get killed.

532
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,398
And I want...

533
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
And I say,
well, maybe the plane better crash.

534
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,353
When they said it was time for us
to board, I...nudged Nick and I said,

535
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,318
"You ready? You ready to go home?"
He said, "I'm ready to go home."

536
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,432
"Let's get the fuck out of here, and go home."

537
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,791
(Laughs) And we got on the plane.

538
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,552
I was really nervous,
anticipation, pretty happy.

539
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,996
You know, we had made it...
It was a family thing, we all went together.

540
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,714
MAN:
I remember that night, minute by minute.

541
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,591
It was me, my grandma,

542
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,915
my sister and my dad, I believe.

543
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,996
We all loaded up in my Lincoln

544
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,632
to go get my mom and Nicholas.

545
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,630
It was a wait and see
but everybody was excited, you know.

546
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,671
We didn't know what to expect...

547
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,751
I didn't want to go out of the plane.

548
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,994
I wanted to wait.

549
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,439
I wanted to prepare myself.

550
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,794
I didn't have no plan.
I didn't have no strategy.

551
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,231
I knew there was no way out.

552
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,677
I could not turn back.

553
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,831
We had no idea what kind of person
we were getting, who was coming back.

554
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,234
I wanted to run and grab and hold him
but he held back.

555
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,155
So I walked down and grabbed his hand
and hugged him and told him I missed him.

556
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,913
He had changed so much.

557
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,436
It was like mind-boggling.

558
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,713
But then I realised, you know,

559
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,957
you tell yourself, well, he's been
through all this horrendous stuff,

560
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,992
so he's absolutely gonna be different.

561
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,711
CAREY: I just remember my kids
and my mom and erm, my husband

562
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,716
and just, God, we were so happy.

563
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,989
BEVERLY:
He was like totally covered up,

564
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,795
so then I got scared, thinking
that this kid's really messed up,

565
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,631
just by his appearance.

566
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,710
He was very quiet and erm, standoffish.

567
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,991
I never liked people to touch me.

568
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,911
And I can't change that.

569
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,599
So when she put her hands around me,

570
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,474
she must have felt
that I wasn't enjoying it at all.

571
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,273
I was very cold, very closed.
I didn't speak to people.

572
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,230
As much as I was happy...I didn't show it.

573
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,516
I had a border in front of me.

574
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,198
I didn't want to screw up.

575
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,878
Of course, it was welcome with open arms
and let's get you home attitude.

576
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,597
Talk about the rest later, you know,
let's just go home.

577
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,959
BEVERLY: I just watched him
all the way home in the car

578
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,871
and you could tell he was uneasy.

579
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,156
So we put on a tape, tried to make him
as comfortable as possible.

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,828
our long lost Nicholas was home.

591
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,752
I had a family and even more.

592
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,354
I never... I never dreamed of so much.

593
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,519
I never dreamed to be able to
not only stay in a place where I'm loved

594
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,551
but actually to have a family.

595
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,879
When I woke up in Texas country...

596
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,877
.. what I saw wasn't exactly
what I expected to see.

597
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,391
The States for me was big city, it was
big buildings and, and people everywhere.

598
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,234
The first thing
when you open your eyes is official,

599
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,316
your name is Nicholas Patrick Barclay,

600
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,749
that you're born December 31st 1980,

601
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,794
and that every family member
is calling me Nicholas

602
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,638
and not "Nicholas,
but what is your real name?"

603
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,671
No! Nicholas.

604
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,154
"OK, we're going to go shopping, Nicholas."

605
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,551
They drove me around,

606
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,878
and, you know,
I knew I had to recognise something,

607
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,198
so...and I also knew that I couldn't
because I'd never been there before.

608
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,118
Hey, Kirk, how are you doin'?

609
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,436
We met some people that knew Nicholas
before he disappeared.

610
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,678
I told them I didn't remember them, there
was something but I didn't remember them.

611
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,757
Like I had lost my memory,
which is what I told them.

612
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,591
He's traumatised.

613
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,871
That's why he wasn't remembering anything,

614
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,390
because of all, all of the things
that had happened to him.

615
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,073
I remember a sign.

616
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,319
I saw Nicholas in the picture doing this
with his fingers, you know,

617
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,351
his, his way to say "hello", you know,

618
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,751
and I did it a few times with them.

619
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,077
When I was there. That was one of
the only things I knew what to do.

620
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,918
I was thinking to myself

621
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,157
that Nicholas Barclay could come back
at his house any day.

622
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,398
That was my first worry.

623
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,431
I was really worried about that.

624
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,153
I couldn't help it.
I said, "Man, what if he show up?"

625
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,755
What if you opened the door
and say, "Hey, I'm back."

626
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,279
(Laughs) You know.

627
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,796
We thought the best thing for him
was just to have a normal routine.

628
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,552
You get up, you eat breakfast,
you do this, you eat lunch,

629
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,639
you eat dinner, we'd watch a movie,
just the normal family atmosphere.

630
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,871
Me and him hung out.

631
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,309
I’d just take him for drives and talk to him
and turn up the music and stuff.

632
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,231
♪ I listen to the wind

633
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,475
♪ To the wind of my soul

634
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,431
CAREY:
He'd hang out with Codey and his friends

635
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,472
and after school
they'd go to the park and play,

636
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,318
and, I mean, they would do
what teenagers do.

637
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,910
He actually kinda started liking a girl
in the neighbourhood, Amy.

638
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,998
They would hang out, talk on the phone

639
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,952
and he'd kinda get blushy-red
when we talked about her.

640
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,916
The only person I hadn't met
in the Barclays' family

641
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,033
was, erm, Jason, his other brother,
the brother of, erm, Carey.

642
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,388
And finally he came to see me.

643
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,912
He didn't look at me like Nicholas and he
didn't pretend to look at me like Nicholas

644
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,350
and, er,
he said good luck to me and he left.

645
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,595
♪ I swam upon the Devil's lake

646
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,557
♪ But never, never never never...

647
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,876
We didn't even talk about
what had happened to him over there,

648
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,191
because we felt, like, when the time was right
he would open up to us.

649
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,678
I did not receive any telephone calls
from the family

650
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,518
saying, you know, "Nicholas is back.

651
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,869
Please come over and talk to us.
We need help."

652
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,677
And I felt like it was imperative

653
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,073
that he be interviewed quickly.

654
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,391
So I'd agreed to meet Nicholas
at the San Antonio missing children's centre

655
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,237
to conduct our first interview.

656
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,550
I introduced myself to Nicholas
and then told him why I was there,

657
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,435
and that the purpose of this interview
was to get his account of his kidnapping

658
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,438
and for his assistance
in locating his abductors.

659
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,994
All I knew about Nicholas

660
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,713
was what I had read
on some of the missing posters.

661
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,393
Not that people
can't change in three years,

662
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,637
but this person in general
did not appear to be 16.

663
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,836
He had a shadow of a beard,
a dark beard,

664
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,200
that I doubt if Nicholas would have had
a shadow of a dark beard at the age of 16

665
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,992
since he had blond hair.

666
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,076
He appeared to be quite nervous

667
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,113
and he just seemed very uncomfortable
this entire time.

668
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,439
I told them that, um,
I was taken by military overseas

669
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,710
and I was abducted and put in a van,

670
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,196
then fly over to some places
that I never knew where it was.

671
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,596
That, er, we were kept in a room
with different kids.

672
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,789
They'd get chloroformed,

673
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,071
and, er, they wake up and they're, er...

674
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,749
you know, in a place
they don't know where they're at.

675
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:11,276
They were subjected by
high-ranking military to sexual abuse.

676
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,558
Every night all of the kids were raped
and molested by men.

677
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,434
These men were American,
Mexican and European.

678
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,918
They broke my hands, especially
my right hand, with a baseball bat.

679
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,679
They kept burning him
and giving him insects to eat.

680
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,836
- We were tortured.
- They broke his fingers.

681
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,633
- His left foot was broken with a crowbar.
- I was raped.

682
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,118
They keep these kids in line
by doing military scare tactics.

683
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,479
We were experimented on.

684
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,670
They would put needles in his eyes.

685
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,840
Headphones on their heads screaming
and yelling, er, different languages.

686
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,873
Spanish kept playing over and over
and a voice kept saying, "You are not you."

687
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,876
If he spoke English, he was beaten.

688
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,993
They moved these kids around
in military planes.

689
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,996
We never saw where we were going.

690
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,510
The boys' identities were changed
by either changing their hair colour,

691
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,755
eye colour or other ways.

692
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,153
They were always in uniform.

693
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,872
A solution was put in his eyes.

694
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,831
They would sell him for money for sex.

695
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,555
His eye colour was changed from blue
to brown by the use of this solution.

696
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,433
The door wasn't shut and I left by that door.

697
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,438
I ran in the big hallway
and there was another door.

698
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,231
Somehow I managed to go outside

699
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,555
and outside I ran, I ran, I ran

700
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,513
and hours after that
l, I discovered that I was in Spain.

701
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,751
(Ringing tone)

702
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,590
We've got a kid here
which is about 14, 15 years old.

703
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,959
He doesn't have no ID.

704
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,833
He's no documents on him
but you can see he's very young.

705
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,791
And he's very scared.

706
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,118
She was professional
but you could see that she was horrified.

707
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,038
This was a horrendous interview
and when I left I was shaken by it

708
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,868
because it had all the horrific,
emotional side effects

709
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,309
that go with listening to such a story.

710
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,830
He knew about this type of activity.

711
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,111
I mean, a normal person
doesn't sit down with a story

712
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,151
and make up horrendous...

713
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,238
that's not what you lie about.

714
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,876
You don't go into detail about torture
and the murdering of children or whatever.

715
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,148
None of that seemed normal.

716
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,872
He was tortured.

717
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,638
I mean, he had torture written all...

718
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,958
He had a broken hand
that was never medically attended to,

719
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,592
he walked with a limp,

720
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,510
erm, he had cigarette burns down the back
of his head to the back of his ankles.

721
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,554
This person is either, erm,
had been the victim himself

722
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,110
or he was a fantastic actor

723
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,072
and I didn't
know which of those titles applied to him.

724
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,438
I let them know that I was very sorry
about what had happened

725
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,914
and we were going to locate
the people who had done this

726
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,793
and put an end to the trauma
that he had been through.

727
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,555
This was the last border.

728
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,594
It's like you...

729
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,995
I won. You know, the game is over.

730
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,949
I had passports, everybody in the family
say I am Nicholas Barclay.

731
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,471
Nobody was investigating me.

732
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,359
Nobody was suspicious that I know.

733
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,875
Hell, I was happy.

734
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,434
I was, you know...
I couldn't believe my luck.

735
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,638
My name is Charlie Parker.
I'm a private investigator.

736
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,716
Hey, how are you doin'?

737
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,228
Say, I want you...
I want you to do something for me.

738
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,354
♪ I know dark clouds
are gonna gather around me

739
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,473
♪ I know my way'll be rough and steep

740
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,195
♪ Yet beautiful fields lie just before me...

741
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,679
I got a call back in November and, erm,
from a television producer for Hard Copy

742
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,711
and he said that a boy

743
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,639
who had been missing earlier for four years
had turned up

744
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,434
and he wanted me to track him down
so they could get an interview with him.

745
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,510
First I had to find out where his mother lived.

746
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:45,112
Found her and then we drove out to
the north of San Antonio to do the interview.

747
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,758
I had repeatedly asked him,
please do not contact the media.

748
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,712
If anything that Nicholas was telling us was true,

749
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,796
if any of it had any accuracy,

750
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,798
and if there was any military officer
possibly involved,

751
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,308
the last thing that we wanted it to be put

752
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,920
was on the front page of the newspaper
or on television

753
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,589
so that that abductor would know
something about our investigation.

754
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,075
This is Eyewitness News at 10.

755
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,234
He disappeared without a trace three years ago.

756
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,635
Tonight a San Antonio boy is back home.

757
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,274
Nicholas Barclay is now 16 years old.

758
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,833
He vanished when he was 13...

759
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,279
Nicholas says he was kidnapped

760
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,469
and taken to Spain.

761
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,916
He says for three years he was repeatedly
drugged, beaten and raped,

762
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,714
all part of a sex slave operation
involving dozens of missing children.

763
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,479
Well, Bob, the FBI is not taking this case lightly...

764
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,555
The reason?

765
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,160
Somehow a 13-year-old boy from San Antonio

766
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,112
ended up in Spain without a passport.

767
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,914
June 19th 1994,
Nicholas got into a fight with his family,

768
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,793
so he came here to Fort Sam Houston
to play basketball.

769
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,229
Two young boys approached him,
they started talking.

770
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,159
The next thing he knew, there was a cloth
over his mouth and Nicholas passed out.

771
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,276
He claims his captors
changed his appearance

772
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,038
to make him unrecognisable.

773
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,315
He was no longer allowed to speak English.

774
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,351
Did they rape you all every night?

775
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,479
Me? No.

776
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,956
Because they didn't rape me every night.

777
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,070
Some of them, they liked more.

778
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,599
Some of the kids they liked more.

779
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,679
They rape them
usually two or three times a week.

780
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,670
I wanted the media's attention, so that
I would make Nicholas even more real,

781
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,110
that people would really believe
that I'm Nicholas

782
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,593
and they would love me even more for that.

783
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,988
They set him up, put a microphone on him
and had the cameras on him

784
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,793
and I moved over behind a booth.

785
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,831
And it was almost fate.

786
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,873
Behind that booth was a picture

787
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,911
of the actual Nicholas Barclay.

788
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,559
And I could look at that picture
and look at him at the same time.

789
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,630
And as I looked at the picture, I noticed
that the boy had blue-grey-looking eyes

790
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,591
and this man had brown eyes.

791
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,558
Here was a moment where the hair
stood up on the back of your neck,

792
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,512
and, and er...there was
just something wrong about it.

793
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,996
I did what they wanted me to do.

794
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,316
Something was wrong. I said,
"Can you get me a picture of his ears?"

795
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,998
I need to get...get that.

796
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:22,912
And I had read about Scotland Yard
using that method to trace down a man,

797
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,272
James Earl Ray,
that had killed Martin Luther King.

798
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,596
They had caught him in Heathrow Airport
by identifying his ears.

799
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:35,909
And I knew the ears were a means of identity,
almost like fingerprints.

800
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,235
I put the picture in my pocket and took it...

801
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,359
When I got back to the office,

802
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,709
I put the pictures in Adobe Photoshop.

803
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,078
They, they were different ears.

804
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,712
And so I knew right away

805
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,116
that absolutely he was not Nicholas Barclay.

806
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,475
I thought I had a spy.

807
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,034
I thought I had real, honest to God spy.

808
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,116
Why else would a guy come here
and take the place of another person?

809
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,479
What would be his reason?

810
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,791
I phoned Nancy Fisher.

811
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,353
I said, "This guy's a fake. It's not him."

812
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,992
I said, "The ears don't match."

813
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,519
And my comment to him was,

814
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,548
"You need to be very careful

815
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,034
that you don't intrude
on the federal investigation."

816
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,551
People aren't used to hearing
you talk about somebody's ears

817
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,956
and I think she was taken back by that.
She didn't know what I was talking about.

818
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,514
I thought I didn't have a right to question,

819
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,279
you know, their statement
that this was their family member

820
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,153
because how, how could they be wrong?

821
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,794
I mean, no-one would be wrong
about something like that.

822
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,276
What do they want? I've already got
the fact he doesn't have the same ears.

823
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,871
Why would you ever,
ever take in a stranger?

824
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,831
Not just a stranger from this country

825
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,236
but a stranger from another country
who speaks with a French accent.

826
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,350
This has to be Nicholas Barclay.

827
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,949
It was an outrageous thing.

828
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,798
I cannot have talked to anyone
that hasn't read about this

829
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:17,039
that has said, "Wait a minute.
I know my own kid. I know my own son.

830
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,156

Well, he started back to high school.

854
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,395
I really was worried.

855
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,874
I didn't know what he was going to do.

856
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,434
This was a case. I mean, a real case.

857
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,158
This guy was lying
about who he said he was

858
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,191
and here the family was accepting him.

859
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,233
I expected him any day to blow up
something at the airbase

860
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,635
or do something at the army base.

861
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,315
I was pulling teeth trying to determine
who had kidnapped Nicholas,

862
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,590
when and where
and under what circumstances.

863
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,237
I had almost no information

864
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,397
because all the information he gave us
was very, very general.

865
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,795
He couldn't give names,
he couldn't give places,

866
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,115
he couldn't give times,
he couldn't give anything.

867
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,878
The family was told that the reason
we were taking Nicholas to Houston

868
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,751
was because he'd been through trauma.

869
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,998
So he deserved to see a forensic expert
to deal with the trauma.

870
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,713
Initially I thought that this was
going to be a forensic interview,

871
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,639
er, with the intent of finding out
more information

872
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,557
about the people who abducted him.

873
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:04,433
Here was this pale white kid
and I introduced myself

874
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,632
and, as he spoke back, immediately my...

875
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,830
Something in me just said,
this is not right,

876
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,393
there's something wrong here.

877
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,590
I speak with him for a long time.

878
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,349
He asked me to repeat all the stories
I'd been telling everybody.

879
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,631
I remember people grabbing me
and putting me in the van.

880
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,117
I went to sleep and I woke up in a room.
There was other kids...

881
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,232
I didn't see the same physiological change

882
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:35,958
in his body posture,
in his pupil size, in his heart rate,

883
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,399
that I would normally see

884
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,432
with somebody who's talking about
a traumatic experience.

885
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,519
He couldn't speak English
without an accent.

886
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,315
That told me about the development of his brain,
and the development of language.

887
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:01,559
You just cannot be raised for
the first six, seven years of your life

888
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,798
in an English-speaking home

889
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,231
and later on, you know,
eight, nine years later,

890
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,113
even 10 years later,

891
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,720
not be able to speak English
without an accent.

892
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:23,154
I can guarantee you that this kid was
not raised in an English-speaking family.

893
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,076
You know, I don't know who he is
but the person who was...I was interviewing

894
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,156
could not have been Nicholas Barclay.

895
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,915
OK, the worst scenario
just showed up and I don't like that.

896
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,509
This investigation did a 90 degree.

897
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,030
It just went from one, one place
all the way up to another.

898
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,353
I immediately called Carey Gibson
and I said to her,

899
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,359
"Carey, Dr Perry has just stated
that this person cannot be your brother,

900
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,789
for the fact
that he cannot be an American.

901
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,680
This could be a very dangerous person."

902
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,150
She shrieked or screamed
and said, "Oh, my gosh!"

903
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,595
So I said, "Don't be at the airport," you know.

904
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,359
"I'll handle it. I will take care of this individual"

905
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,709
and that she did not have to take him home,

906
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,796
you know, back to her home to live with them

907
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,149
and she says, "OK, OK."

908
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:27,995
We fly back into San Antonio
and there's Carey standing there.

909
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,395
What?

910
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,273
She acted like we'd
never had that conversation.

911
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,393
And she acted excited to see him,
asked him how his trip was.

912
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,310
I think I just stared for a minute...

913
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,791
And I called the US Attorneys' Office
right then and there

914
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,751
and I said, "What do I do?"

915
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,795
And the Assistant US Attorney said,
"Let him return to her temporarily."

916
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,391
She welcomed this person home
just like he was her brother.

917
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,228
I didn't have any clue
as to why she behaved in this manner.

918
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,795
Because in my conversation with her,

919
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,479
I had said,
"This person is not your brother."

920
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,274
I don't think... I don't remember her
putting it in those words.

921
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,630
Well, maybe they wanted him so badly
to be their son

922
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,398
that they said he was their son,

923
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,034
but it was starting to get ridiculous.

924
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,589
I couldn't let it go. There was no way
in the world I could let it go.

925
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,509
I started going into the neighbourhood,

926
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,551
and finding out about
the real Nicholas Barclay,

927
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,238
interviewing the neighbours,

928
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,511
trying to find out
what I could about that boy

929
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,232
and about that family.

930
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,032
And what's going on?

931
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,196
You know, why would Nicholas have left?

932
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,118
The police used to usually come

933
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,472
maybe like twice or three times a month.

934
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,432
Either it was argument with the kids

935
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,677
or with their boyfriend or with the other son.

936
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:07,319
I spoke to everyone and they all said
that Nicholas had caused trouble,

937
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,078
had come home late at night.

938
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,350
We've all had arguments in our family,

939
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,197
but it's rare that we call the police,

940
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,276
that it is so bad that they have to come.

941
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,753
It, it made me think
there was something going on,

942
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,916
more than meets the eye. Of course it did.

943
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,755
I knew that DNA samples would prove
that he wasn't Nicholas Barclay.

944
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,755
Mrs Dollarhide said, "This is my son.

945
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,872
I don't have to provide blood samples
for you for DNA

946
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,478
and she laid down on the floor,

947
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,511
literally laid down on the floor,

948
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,833
and said, "No, and you can't pick me up,
and you can't make me."

949
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:52,314
I did not want to go anywhere with the FBI,
but I don't remember refusing.

950
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,155
I was stunned.
I've never had that reaction before.

951
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,589
She wasn't just apathetic,
she was hostile.

952
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,836
To be honest with you, I really have
no idea what I was thinking at that time.

953
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,396
My main goal in life was not, not to think.

954
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,478
We didn't need to prove who he was.
We knew who he was.

955
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,399
I no longer saw them as a grieving erm...
victimised family.

956
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,318
I saw them as a very questionable family.

957
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:29,436
There would be no reason for them
to accept a stranger into their lives...

958
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,035
..unless there was something to hide.

959
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,832
That would be the only reason.

960
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,838
Something was being hidden
and I didn't know what that was.

961
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,635
When Beverly refused
to give her blood sample,

962
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,638
I started to become suspicious.

963
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,513
They knew that I wasn't Nicholas.

964
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,316
Whatever I was telling them,

965
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,277
they didn't believe a word of it.

966
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,038
But they were good at not showing it.

967
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,033
I mean, who wouldn't see it?

968
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,118
That's about four, five years ago now.

969
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,556
I remember in Spain,
Carey did everything for me.

970
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,671
When I didn't know something, she told me.

971
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,479
"You forgot everything
but you're going to remember it now

972
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:33,469
and, you know, this was Mom at the place
we're living in with... Do you remember?

973
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,752
Oh, this was Chantelle. You remember
Chantelle. That's your niece, my daughter.

974
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,997
Do you remember that? Do you
remember that? Do you remember that?"

975
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,871
Over and over and over again.

976
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,069
That's Jason.

977
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,759
She wanted to put it in my head.

978
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,553
She wanted to put it in my head
so I would never forget.

979
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,558
She just could not say it's not Nicholas.

980
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,431
Did she believe it or not?

981
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,754
If you asked me, I would say,

982
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,360
no, not for a second
did she believe I was her brother.

983
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,550
She decided I was gonna be her brother.

984
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,470
It's like I woke up in a place where...

985
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,270
Lies even bigger than what I did.

986
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,833
You know, it's...

987
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,350
they pretended as much as I did
and even more.

988
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,431
I kept thinking about the kid,
Nicholas Barclay.

989
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,833
At the time of his disappearance,

990
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,236
he was living with Beverly
in the house on Swallow Street

991
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,192
and his brother Jason
was also living there.

992
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,514
Jason, Nick's older brother,

993
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,198
when he moved into their house,

994
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,434
that house changed,

995
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,799
because before he got there,

996
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,034
Nick and his mom

997
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,752
seemed pretty close to me.

998
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,598
She loved him to death.

999
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:08,236
I mean, she loved him, you could tell...
She, she... He was the light of her life.

1000
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,510
This guy moved in,
he was a bum, a drug addict

1001
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,079
and he only cared about himself.

1002
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,709
And when he got into that house,
it just made things that much more worse.

1003
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,753
In fact, I think it even pushed his mom
into doing drugs herself

1004
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,358
when he moved into the house.

1005
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,392
That house just became
a volatile situation altogether.

1006
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,638
I discovered from the police files,

1007
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,148
a couple of months
after the disappearance,

1008
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,995
that Jason had called the police

1009
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,635
and said that his brother
had tried to break into the house.

1010
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,915
Well, we see that kind of thing all the time.

1011
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,077
People, people
are constantly doing stuff like that

1012
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,237
to make people think that person's alive.

1013
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,113
I started to put two and two together

1014
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,993
and I thought something happened
inside that house to that boy.

1015
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,512
I didn't need to be Columbo
to put all the pieces together.

1016
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,671
They killed him.

1017
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,154
Some of them did it, some of them knew of it,
and some of them chose to ignore it.

1018
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,279
I wasn't worried about
Nicholas coming back no more.

1019
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,551
Neither Nicholas Barclay
or his mother were cooperating,

1020
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,797
so we were going to have to have
a search warrant executed

1021
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,400
in order to obtain those blood samples.

1022
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,671
I couldn't pretend no more to be Nicholas
and act like Nicholas.

1023
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,190
I took two or three other agents with me
to go pick him up.

1024
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,710
So inside me, I started getting,
you know, more and more aggressive,

1025
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,508
weird.

1026
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,558
I couldn't go on.

1027
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,118
We got the fingerprints
and we got the palm prints.

1028
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,869
Within a few weeks, we would be sending
them out to Interpol, to the embassies,

1029
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,797
to see if any of these fingerprints

1030
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,593
matched anything that they had on record.

1031
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,358
I was trying to find a way out,

1032
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,318
not only a way out in San Antonio, Texas,

1033
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,476
but a way out, out of my mind.

1034
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,231
Nicholas was becoming
much more agitated and angry

1035
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,999
and I really felt like
he was going to run away

1036
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,032
and if he ran away we might have
a very hard time locating him.

1037
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,400
I started tailing him,
I started following him.

1038
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,830
I started sitting up on Beverly's place
where she lived

1039
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,873
and writing down licence numbers of
all the cars that came to her, to see her.

1040
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,633
So I took a razor blade
and I slit my face.

1041
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,717
Everything was snowballing
and snowballing and snowballing.

1042
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,275
I show them, show them that

1043
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,754
I was under a great deal of pressure.

1044
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,756
On March 3rd of 1998,

1045
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,395
the legate in Madrid, Spain, called me

1046
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,113
and he said, "We've just identified him."

1047
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,593
And I said, "You're kidding?"

1048
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,555
I knew that everything was going down
and it was just a matter of weeks.

1049
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,355
He said, "What I'm gonna do right now
is fax to you the records that I have."

1050
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,872
CHARLIE: He agreed to meet with me.

1051
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,717
We ordered hot cakes.

1052
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,355
And we started to eat.

1053
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,231
And he said...

1054
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,555
I said,
"You really made your mother angry."

1055
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,592
And he said,
"She's not my mother and you know it."

1056
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,272
And I thought, well, I'II be damned.

1057
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,790
And so I stood over the fax machine,

1058
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,914
waiting for, of course, them to come in

1059
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,110
because I was screaming
and jumping up and down.

1060
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,111
I actually said, "Well, I'll be damned,

1061
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,549
you're going to finally tell me
who you are."

1062
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,793
I was like doing a dance
and everybody was high-fiving.

1063
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,196
It was like, you know, we finally,
we finally know who this person is.

1064
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,518
And my heart was beating fast,
just like it is now thinking about it.

1065
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,836
And... And I said, "Who are you?"

1066
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,917
He said, "I'm Frederic Bourdin
and I'm wanted by Interpol."

1067
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,478
The fingerprint cards told me

1068
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,717
that he was not 16, he was 23.

1069
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,629
That he was not American, he was French.

1070
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,758
That he was not Nicholas Barclay,
he was Frederic Bourdin.

1071
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,273
We grow up in America thinking Interpol

1072
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,756
is kind of the God of the cops.
You follow me?

1073
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,268
That's the highest step you can get
in "Copland".

1074
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,436
And so I thought, Jesus Christ,

1075
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,711
if he's wanted by Interpol,
what has he done? You know.

1076
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,671
There is no limit to what he's done.

1077
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,199
So he began to tell me.

1078
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,556
NANCY: Frederic Bourdin is delinquent.

1079
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,591
Activities and modus operandi...

1080
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,712
He has travelled throughout Europe

1081
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,193
appearing at shelters for minors

1082
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,639
under different aliases.

1083
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,158
Spain, 1992.

1084
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,790
Spain, September 1993.

1085
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,311
(Overlapping voices)

1086
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,709
Barcelona...

1087
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,752
.. stated that he'd run away
from his adoptive parents' house.

1088
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,831
Brussels, '95.

1089
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,718

1090
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,671
Milan, 1993.

1091
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,069
Glasgow.

1092
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,918
I sat there. I could hardly eat,
I could hardly swallow my food.

1093
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,595
He always wore glasses.

1094
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,710
Giovanni Petrullo.

1095
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,751
Michelangelo Martini.

1096
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,315

James Markey.

1101

Frederic Cassis.

1102
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,755

1103
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,108

'97.

1107
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,671
Spain, 1997.

1108
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,235
It's possible he may need psychiatric help.

1109
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,114
Settle in tonight

1110
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,037
because we are about to share with you

1111
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,593
a story so bizarre,

1112
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,631
it's hard to believe it's true.

1113
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,114
This is the tale of a master imposter

1114
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,391
who managed to lie his way
into the United States

1115
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,671
and prey upon
the most vulnerable of people.

1116
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,711
He is the only person in US history

1117
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,150
ever to have assumed
the identity of a missing child.

1118
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,033
He fooled even the lost boy's mother.

1119
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,674
It's hard to imagine
how he could have gotten away with it.

1120
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:04,508
We knew it was going to be,
you know, heart-wrenching and...

1121
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,875
you know...

1122
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,831
but we never thought it wouldn't be him.

1123
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,915
You know, why would you even think that?

1124
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,110
The first feeling was complete sadness.

1125
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,709
Because it wasn't Nicholas.

1126
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,671
Which took us back to square one.

1127
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,950
Where is Nicholas?

1128
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,991
That was the first one.

1129
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,193
The second emotion was,

1130
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,599
how could I be so fucking stupid?

1131
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,392
I mean, seriously.

1132
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,749
I contacted the SAPD,
the San Antonio Police Department,

1133
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,793
and told them, decided to tell them,
that, hey, they killed him.

1134
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,989
Based upon Frederic Bourdin's allegations,

1135
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,196
a homicide investigation was opened

1136
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,789
and the allegation
was against the family members

1137
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,197
as being...participating in
the disappearance of the child.

1138
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:08,552
It was related to us
that while Frederic was in jail

1139
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,194
that he said that my mom confessed to him

1140
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,073
that her and Jason
killed Nicholas and hid the body.

1141
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,679
They accused me first

1142
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,991
and it totally freaked me out.

1143
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,754
Because I, I...have been crazy
but never violent.

1144
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:35,357
This is the street the kid lived on
when he went missing.

1145
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,911
There's the house right there.

1146
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,671
I think the boy's buried here.

1147
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,078
I want to talk to Darryl inside.

1148
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:01,275
He's agreed to let me dig
and see if Nicholas Barclay's here.

1149
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,073
If Beverly knew that this individual
was not her son,

1150
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,839
then she had to have
some type of ulterior motive

1151
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,714
and it had to be something very scary

1152
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,309
for her to accept a stranger
into her household

1153
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,759
posing as her own son.

1154
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,836
I agreed to take a lie detector test.

1155
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,991
She passed the polygraph.

1156
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,992
And I said to the polygraph examiner,

1157
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,632
"I don't understand this,

1158
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,274
I don't understand it at all.
Will you give it to her again?"

1159
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,236
So he gave it to her again
and she passed the polygraph.

1160
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,192
I said, "No, there is something wrong."

1161
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,511
The third time he gave it to her,

1162
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,954
she flunked every question.

1163
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,319
I mean, like, big-time.

1164
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,069
The polygrapher said the machine
practically jumped off the table.

1165
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,469
Her answers appeared to be
false on everything.

1166
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,558
And he turned to her and he said,

1167
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,832
"Mrs Dollarhide, it appears
that you know where your son is.

1168
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,032
It appears that you know what happened
to him" and some other questions.

1169
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,238
And that's when she became
very aggravated, very agitated,

1170
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,032
jumped up and ran out and was screaming.

1171
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,313
I lied about being...stealing,

1172
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,278
and I had...so that's why I failed.

1173
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,516
I didn't lie about anything
to do with Nicholas.

1174
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,391
It was the other questions.

1175
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,557
- Darryl? Charlie Parker.
- Mr Parker.

1176
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,591
How are you doin'?

1177
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,189
It's nice in here.

1178
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,639
So this is the house, huh?

1179
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,999
Yes, sir.

1180
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,160
The polygraph led us to believe
that she did have some information...

1181
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,159
..she could provide that she refused to
and we felt like Jason had information.

1182
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,191
If Jason did something to Nicholas,
I didn't know about it

1183
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:07,756
and I can't imagine Jason ever doing that.

1184
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,075
It's just not in his makeup,

1185
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,873
but...I don't know.

1186
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:23,433
I know my brother or my mother did not
kill Nicholas, accidentally, on purpose.

1187
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,914
Whatever Frederic said, it never happened.

1188
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,231
When we first got my dog, he was always
digging in the back corner over there

1189
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,599
where the, the tree is.

1190
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:37,191
And one day I was mowing
and saw, like, pieces of, like, plastic,

1191
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,549
- kind of like a tarp kind of material...
- OK.

1192
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,353
..sticking out of the ground.
I tried to pull it up to get it out,

1193
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,198
and it just kept ripping on me
as it was stuck in the ground.

1194
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,708
So I never paid any attention to it
or gave it any thought,

1195
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,069
until last night when we were speaking
on the phone.

1196
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,196
And the bush has been there a while?

1197
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:00,039
I had initially tried to get a hold of
Jason prior to Frederic's arrest

1198
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,274
and couldn't.

1199
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,118
And then when I finally did
get a hold of him,

1200
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,720
I asked him
about the disappearance of his brother.

1201
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,668
He just seemed totally apathetic about
the disappearance of his younger brother.

1202
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,039
Extremely apathetic.

1203
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,152
And didn't care that he'd been returned

1204
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,474
but when he did see him,

1205
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,078
no, that wasn't his brother,

1206
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,873
but he didn't seem interested enough
or excited enough

1207
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,798
to tell his mother and sister,
"That's not my brother.

1208
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,354
No, no, they just wanted to believe."

1209
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,514
Yeah, it's a good spot. Let's see.

1210
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,551
Say he dumps him here first...

1211
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,879
..and then, if he looks up,

1212
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,113
yeah, yeah, this is good, this is good.

1213
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,869
He was very hostile,
refused to help in any way,

1214
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,754
and then he later left
the drug rehabilitation centre

1215
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,156
and was found having died
from a drug overdose.

1216
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,269
I think that Jason became a perfect scapegoat
because he's not here.

1217
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,954
He died,

1218
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,835
so he can't be questioned
or, you know, anything.

1219
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,718
I mean,
he can't, he can't even defend himself.

1220
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,472
It's kinda like a nightmare.

1221
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,709
AII this stuff is coming at you and none
of it's true but nobody believes you.

1222
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,354
Or they think that you had
something to do with it.

1223
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,110
And it's like getting in trouble
for something you didn't do.

1224
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:43,394
You know, when kids tell you,
"I didn't do it!"

1225
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,431
You're going, "Yeah, right."

1226
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,591
But I didn't do it.

1227
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,629
I do feel like the family knows
the whereabouts of Nicholas Barclay.

1228
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:59,673
I think that Beverly Dollarhide
and Jason Dollarhide knew at one time

1229
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,109
what happened to Nicholas Barclay.

1230
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,798
Show me one piece of evidence,

1231
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,355
show me one thing that will lock
anybody in our family up over this,

1232
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,029
just one shred of actual proof.

1233
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,196
Back here. Let's go back here.

1234
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,991
The biggest,
funniest one to me, hilarious,

1235
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,193
is that we went and picked up
a complete stranger

1236
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,152
to hide the fact that we killed Nicholas

1237
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,668
or someone in my family killed Nicholas.

1238
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,837
When through four years
that Nicholas was disappeared,

1239
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,075
we were the only ones looking for him.

1240
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,353
Why would we go pick up a stranger to hide
something that didn't need to be hidden?

1241
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,671
Just another one of his lies.

1242
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,599
REPORTER: Even from behind bars,

1243
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,871
he continued to lie to families
of other missing children.

1244
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,392
From this phone in his cell,

1245
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,351
Bourdin made hundreds of collect calls

1246
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,312
claiming to have information
about lost children.

1247
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,399
He even said he could help solve

1248
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,034
the highly publicised case
of Sabrina Aisenberg,

1249
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,675
an infant who was taken from her home
in Tampa, Florida, last year.

1250
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,271
No.

1251
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,073
Yes.

1252
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,879
He's a habitual liar

1253
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,592
and it blows my mind

1254
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:41,351
that anybody can take anything
that is said out of his mouth as truth.

1255
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,235
What? This kid comes
and says he's Nicholas,

1256
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,554
and then turns around and says,

1257
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,433
"You...these people
that took care of me killed him."

1258
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,040
Hm.
How do you come up with that conclusion?

1259
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,514
He put us through enough already

1260
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,189
and then for him to do this
while he's in jail for what he's done

1261
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,356
and to cause more pain to our family?

1262
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,514
Fuck him.
