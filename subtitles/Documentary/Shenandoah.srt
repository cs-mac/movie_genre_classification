1
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,524
They come closer every day, Pa.

2
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,962
- They on our land?
- No, sir.

3
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:07,845
Well, then, it doesn't concern us.

4
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:13,197
Does it?

5
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,562
You have something else to say?

6
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,398
No, sir.

7
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:24,559
Lord, we...

8
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,960
- What'd I do?
- Well, it's what you haven't done, Boy.

9
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,406
A man that eats with his hat
on is going nowhere in a hurry.

10
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,927
Now, your mother wanted all of
you raised as good Christians,

11
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:49,606
and I might not be able to do that
thorny job as well as she could,

12
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,206
but I can do a little something
about your manners. Now, shall we...?

13
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:56,809
Lord, we cleared this land.

14
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,679
We ploughed it, sowed it and
harvested. We cooked the harvest.

15
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:04,606
It wouldn't be here, we couldn't eat
it, if we hadn't done it all ourselves.

16
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,649
We worked dog-bone
hard for every crumb,

17
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:12,203
but we thank you just the
same, Lord, for this food. Amen.

18
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,531
- Where'd you come by the hat, Boy?
- Down by the creek, sir.

19
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:27,765
- Some fella down there passing out hats?
- I found it. It was just lying there.

20
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,525
Jacob, you look like you
got something on your mind.

21
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:36,526
- Say what you're thinking.
- We've been through it all before, Pa.

22
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:40,003
Don't paddle around with me. You
were raised to say what you think.

23
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,369
You were all raised
to say what you think.

24
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:48,609
The only thing I can't stand is a lot of
noisy silence. Let's have some talking.

25
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:52,607
Now, if you're going to make
a speech, I'm sorry I said it.

26
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,127
I know how you feel
about this war, Pa.

27
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,126
I guess we all more or
less feel the same way.

28
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:02,251
But I don't see how we can just
sit by and ignore it any longer.

29
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:05,008
Now, you say it's not our
business, not our fight.

30
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:09,849
Well, we're Virginians. I believe anything
that concerns Virginia concerns us.

31
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,927
- You do?
- Yes, sir, I do.

32
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,687
All right.

33
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,207
- John?
- Sir?

34
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:32,494
What are you gonna do? Are you going
to keep your slaves or let 'em go free?

35
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,452
You know I don't have any slaves, Pa.

36
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:40,166
That's right, John. You don't
have a slave to your name, do you?

37
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:44,771
James, what about you? Did you ever
think you might like to own a slave?

38
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:48,405
- I guess I never thought about it, Pa.
- Well, think about it.

39
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,487
Think about it.

40
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,329
If you had the money,
would you buy a slave?

41
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,011
- No, sir, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

42
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,851
If I can't do my own work, with
my own hands, it'll never get done.

43
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,610
Suppose you had a
friend that owned slaves,

44
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:05,609
and suppose somebody's
gonna take 'em away from him.

45
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:08,690
- Would you help him fight to keep 'em?
- No, sir.

46
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:12,736
- Your name's Nathan, isn't it?
- Aw, you know my name, Pa.

47
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:16,447
Well, I seem to remember somethin'
about... I was talking to Henry.

48
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,257
- Sir?
- Well, what do you think?

49
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,806
- No, sir, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

50
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:25,015
I see no reason to fight for
something I don't believe is right.

51
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,168
I don't think a real
friend would ask me to.

52
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:32,048
Why we have this same conversation
every Saturday, I'll never know.

53
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:35,734
But I'm going to pray to the Almighty
that this'll be the end of it.

54
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:38,207
Pass the biscuits!

55
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,772
Papa? We're ready to go, Papa.

56
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,608
You still miss her, don't you, Papa?

57
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,770
Miss her?

58
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,251
Oh, Jennie, you don't know
what I feel when I come up here.

59
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,175
Even after all these
years. 16 years gone.

60
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,898
16 years.

61
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,972
And even so, I...

62
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,295
I somehow... feel that she's not
dead at all, but only resting.

63
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:36,058
And it's like I'm just waiting for
her to get up and walk home with me.

64
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:02,335
# Be of sin the double cure

65
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:08,737
# Save from wrath and make me pure

66
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:14,181
# Could my tears forever flow

67
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:18,575
# Could my zeal no languor...

68
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,779
Did you bring it?

69
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:23,331
- No! Liquorice.
- I'll see you after.

70
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:32,054
# Thou must save, and Thou alone

71
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:37,741
# In my hand no price I bring

72
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:44,014
# Simply to Thy cross I cling

73
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:49,815
# While I draw this fleeting breath

74
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:56,014
# When my eyes shall close in death

75
00:09:56,105 --> 00:10:01,099
# When I rise to worids unknown

76
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:07,342
# And behold Thee on Thy throne

77
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:13,136
# Rock of Ages, cleft for me

78
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:20,302
# Let me hide myself in Thee

79
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:28,101
# Amen

80
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,784
There are, no doubt, some
present, Charlie Anderson,

81
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:41,940
who wonder why you and yours are
never on time for the Lord's services.

82
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:46,305
Have I kept the Lord
waiting, Pastor Bjoerling?

83
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:49,380
You have not.

84
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:57,659
Our message for today... is duty.

85
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:02,858
Now, this means many
things to many people.

86
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:06,941
But for a Virginian
they all lead to one.

87
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,059
James.

88
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:22,466
- Get that fish line.
- The three...

89
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,938
most important duties are...

90
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:31,501
- Tell him to stop that.
...duty to God that created us,

91
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,261
and loves us.

92
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:40,982
Duty to the state that
gives us sustenance,

93
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,664
and provides for us.

94
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,029
And duty to our neighbour.

95
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,667
Our fellow man,

96
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,062
without whom... we... could not live.

97
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,548
When you good people can
find it within yourselves

98
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:07,385
to refrain from doing
whatever it is you're doing,

99
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,826
I'll get on with the Lord's work.

100
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,983
Duty, to a Virginian,

101
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:15,141
is not just a word, my friends.

102
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,984
For the last time, Charlie
Anderson, I need that mule of yours.

103
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,984
I don't understand your
reluctance to talk about the sale.

104
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:31,382
That mule is a matched Kentucky Red,

105
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:34,384
matched with another that
pulls just like she does.

106
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:37,942
Matched, Abernathy! Do you
understand what matched means?

107
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:39,943
- How much?
- 30 dollars, Federal.

108
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:45,869
- I'll give you 50, Confederate.
- I'll let lightning strike her first.

109
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:53,103
Miss Jennie?

110
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,070
I'll be leaving soon, and...

111
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:03,784
- I'll be leaving soon and...
- You said that already, Sam.

112
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:07,229
I did? Oh, yes, I did.

113
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:10,111
I, uh...

114
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:13,948
I'd be eternally grateful if you'd
permit me to call upon you this evening.

115
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,263
Eternally is a long time, Sam.

116
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:21,631
Not when one carries the
memory of you, Miss Jennie.

117
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:26,230
I'll look forward to seeing
you after supper, Sam.

118
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:38,028
Abernathy, your idea of a
deal makes my stomach hurt.

119
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:48,749
- You want me to get that mule now?
- Get in that wagon, Gabriel.

120
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:02,512
Charlie Anderson, I wonder if
you'd be good enough to tell me

121
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:07,147
why you bother to come to services.
Meaning no disrespect, of course.

122
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:11,230
It was my wife's last
request, Pastor Bjoerling.

123
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,115
Meaning no disrespect, of course.

124
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:24,347
Whoa, boy.

125
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:28,229
Doc. Mrs Witherspoon.

126
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,866
Charlie. Looks like I'll
be paying you a visit soon.

127
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,948
Uh huh.

128
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,428
You haven't said a word.

129
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:54,430
I don't know what to say. I mean...

130
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,432
Well, I know what to say.
I just don't know how.

131
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,589
Must be all very complicated, then.

132
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,637
No, it's... just all memorised.

133
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:07,268
Everything I wanted to say,
I've said a dozen times.

134
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:10,112
I said it to my horse
and it sounded good.

135
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,509
I said it again to the
trees and it sounded better.

136
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,637
I said it to the moon
and it sounded perfect.

137
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:20,108
The moon can't hear you, Sam.

138
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,475
He smiles and smiles,
but he never hears.

139
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,511
I do.

140
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,241
Well, I'm sure gonna miss her.

141
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,630
Is she going somewhere?

142
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,394
Every woman goes
somewhere sooner or later.

143
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:03,394
You don't expect her to stay here and
take care of us all her life, do you?

144
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,791
I hadn't thought about it. I hadn't
planned on her going anywhere.

145
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:10,590
Well, you'd better get
used to the idea, Boy.

146
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:14,118
Your sister's ripe and
the pickers are here.

147
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:19,240
Of course, I don't suppose you
know what I mean, do you, Boy?

148
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:22,314
I'm not as dumb as you think I am, Pa.

149
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:38,156
Whoa! Halt!

150
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:41,437
Go back up to the house, Boy.

151
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:58,840
There's a rumour you have the coldest
water this side of the Shenandoah.

152
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:01,961
That's right. The best
east of the Mississippi.

153
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:05,753
Six foot deep, 20 foot
down. Help yourself.

154
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:08,234
Dismount, Sergeant.

155
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:16,113
Glad you're here, Johnson. I need to have
a little talk about those cannon of yours.

156
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:21,040
My chickens have stopped laying, the
cow's dried up. Who do I send the bill to?

157
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,243
You might try Abe Lincoln.
They're mostly his.

158
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:28,635
When are you going to take
this war seriously, Mr Anderson?

159
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:32,684
Now let me tell you something, Johnson,
before you get on my wrong side.

160
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,917
My corn I take serious
because it's my corn.

161
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:40,362
My potatoes and tomatoes and fences
I take note of because they're mine.

162
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:43,836
But this war is not mine
and I take no note of it.

163
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:50,960
You'll take notice when the Yankees
drop a cannonball in your parlour.

164
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:56,996
I might as well tell you now, I can't
think of another thing I wanna hear you say.

165
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:10,236
You have six sons,
don't you, Mr Anderson?

166
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:15,003
Does the size of my family have
some special interest for you?

167
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:18,876
As a matter of fact,
it does. We need men.

168
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:21,687
Two of these men here
are no more than 16.

169
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,885
It seems strange that none
of your sons are in the army.

170
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:29,120
It don't seem strange to me with all
the work there is to do around here.

171
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:33,087
I'll come right to the point.
I came out here to get 'em.

172
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,806
I say something funny?

173
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:43,597
You came all the way
out here to get my boys?

174
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,041
Yes, sir.

175
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:49,725
- Where are your sons now, Mr Anderson?
- You wanna see 'em, do you?

176
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,799
Yes, sir, I do.

177
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,165
Jacob?

178
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,846
James?

179
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,325
John?

180
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,206
Nathan?

181
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,803
Henry?

182
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,961
Boy?

183
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,569
If you've got anything to
say to 'em, they'll listen.

184
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,688
There's a Yankee army breathing
down your neck, Mr Anderson.

185
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,763
- You're town bred.
- I don't see what that has to do...

186
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,048
I've got 500 acres of
good, rich dirt here.

187
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:43,647
While the rains come and the sun shines,
it'll grow anything I've a mind to plant.

188
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:47,007
We've pulled every stump,
we've cleared every field,

189
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,890
and we did it ourselves,
without the sweat of one slave.

190
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,849
- So?
- "So"?

191
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:55,207
So can you give me one good reason

192
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,171
why I should send my family,
that took me a lifetime to raise,

193
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:03,165
down that road like a bunch of damn
fools to do somebody else's fighting?

194
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:06,245
Virginia needs all of
her sons, Mr Anderson.

195
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:09,530
That might be so, Johnson,
but these are my sons.

196
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,807
They don't belong to the state.

197
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:15,488
When they were babies, I never saw the
state coming round with a spare tit.

198
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,531
We never asked anything of
the state or expected anything.

199
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:22,492
We do our own living, and
thanks to no man for the right.

200
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,485
But seeing as how you're so
worried about it, I'll tell ya.

201
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:30,364
If any of my boys thinks this war's right
and wants to join in, he's free to do it.

202
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:33,684
Y'all hear that? D'you hear it?

203
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,890
Do you want to dress up like
these fellas? Here's your chance.

204
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,922
Patrol, mount.

205
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:02,486
Mr Anderson,

206
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:07,968
if you can sit in the middle of this war
and not get touched, I congratulate you.

207
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,694
Where are these Yankees now?

208
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,084
About ten miles that way,

209
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:17,327
about ten or twelve miles that
way, and about five miles that way.

210
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,645
Which way are you headed?

211
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,726
That way.

212
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,851
What do you do with dead soldiers?

213
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,610
- Where's their army?
- Harrisonburg.

214
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,728
You ride over there, Nathan. Take Henry
with you, tell 'em to come get 'em.

215
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,812
Yes, sir.

216
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,497
Does it concern us now?

217
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:17,132
You go to the house, get
something and cover 'em up.

218
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,572
Come on.

219
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:53,055
- Don't you think we ought to wait?
- No.

220
00:23:57,823 --> 00:24:01,417
Papa? Sam would like
to talk to you, Papa.

221
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,494
All right, Jennie.

222
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:11,102
- Good evening, sir.
- Sam.

223
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:23,981
It's bedtime.

224
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,658
Bedtime? Why, it's only...

225
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:45,984
Picker's here, Pa.

226
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,418
- What did he mean by that?
- It's nothing, Sam. Have a seat.

227
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:59,577
- I'd prefer to stand, sir.
- No, you sit down, Sam.

228
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,578
I never talk to a man
who's looking down on me.

229
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,945
Now, there's something you
want to talk to me about?

230
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,494
- Yes, sir.
- Sit down, Sam.

231
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:22,262
I've wanted to talk to you for
a long time now, sir, but...

232
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:25,942
Well, to come straight to the
point of the matter, sir, I...

233
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:32,101
- I want to ask for your daughter's hand.
- You mean you want to marry her, Sam?

234
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:34,578
Yes, sir.

235
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:39,621
- Why?
- Sir?

236
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:44,383
- Why do you want to marry her?
- Well, I... I love her, Mr Anderson.

237
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:52,656
Well, that's not good enough, Sam.

238
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,216
I beg your pardon?

239
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:57,538
- Do you like her?
- Well, I just said I...

240
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:03,225
No, you said you loved her. There's some
difference between loving and liking.

241
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:10,669
When I married Jennie's mother,
I didn't love her. I liked her.

242
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:13,309
I liked her a whole lot.

243
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:16,620
I liked Martha for at least
three years after we were married.

244
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:21,260
And then one day it just dawned
on me I loved her. I still do.

245
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,379
I still do.

246
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:28,985
You see, Sam, when you love
a woman without liking her,

247
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:34,189
a night can be long and cold, and
contempt comes up with the sun.

248
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,862
Do you understand all
this I'm telling you?

249
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,702
Yes, sir.

250
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,348
Well?

251
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,384
Well, I... I like Jennie,
sir. I've always liked her.

252
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,902
All right, then. You be good to her.

253
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,107
Because if you don't, it's
between you and me, boy.

254
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:02,981
- Then you have no objection, sir?
- I didn't say that.

255
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:06,063
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

256
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:13,863
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

257
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:31,510
I suppose that means Papa
Charlie gave permissión?

258
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:37,588
Sam'll be a couple of miles down the
road before it dawns on him to tell me.

259
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:52,421
It was Mother's.

260
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,632
You'll look beautiful, Jennie.

261
00:27:56,713 --> 00:28:01,947
Being married to someone you love
must be the most wonderful feeling.

262
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:05,662
When I was a little girl, I
slept all alone in a big room.

263
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:08,348
My bed had a feather mattress.

264
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:13,144
Outside, there was thunder, lightning
and rain falling on our tin roof.

265
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:18,308
I'd lie there under my blankets,
feeling so snug and good and warm.

266
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:23,628
Because I knew I was safe. I
was loved and somebody cared.

267
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:27,184
And now, married to James, it's
that same little-girl feeling.

268
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:32,395
- I'm loved, and somebody cares.
- Oh, I am so happy, I want to shout.

269
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:35,069
That's what it feels like, too.

270
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,477
First-rate-looking
animals you got here, son.

271
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:23,469
They should be. I do everything
but sing 'em to sleep.

272
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:28,870
Anderson's the name, Mr Carroll.
Nine horses and two mules.

273
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:32,074
You're right, Mr Tinkham.
These'll do just fine.

274
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:37,798
These folks sure know quality. I'll take
these two and four out in the pasture.

275
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:40,676
What do you mean, you'll take 'em?

276
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:47,827
Well, howdy, Mr Anderson. I
ain't seen you in quite a spell.

277
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:51,594
Well, I don't get around to
visiting jails much, Tinkham.

278
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,115
This here's Mr Carroll.

279
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:59,636
Mr Osborne, Mr Marshall. They're
Federal purchasing agents.

280
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:02,836
- Buying horses for the cavalry.
- That's right, Mr Anderson.

281
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,276
We've got a set price we can pay, but I'd
like to hear what you think they're worth.

282
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,157
The horses aren't for sale.

283
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:14,073
What my son tells you is
the gospel truth, gentlemen.

284
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,439
You can carve his words in stone if you've
a mind to. The horses are not for sale.

285
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,636
That may be, but I just
think I ought to tell you

286
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,756
we're authorised to
confiscate any we can't buy.

287
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,037
- What's "confiscate" mean, Pa?
- Steal.

288
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,149
No, I don't think
you quite understand.

289
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,870
You're not going to take one horse off
this farm. You might as well forget it.

290
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,231
You said these were reasonable people.

291
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:47,439
Mr Carroll, everybody in the county
knows they're just sitting out the war.

292
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:50,831
I think what Mr Tinkham
means is that he figured

293
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:56,280
anybody too yellow to fight wouldn't mind
making a couple of dollars off the war.

294
00:30:56,361 --> 00:31:00,401
- "Yellow"?
- I apologise for my son's manners.

295
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:02,836
He was taught to have more
respect for his elders.

296
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,752
I accept your apology, sir.

297
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:07,800
Jacob, I don't know what gets
into you every once in a while.

298
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:10,157
You know you shouldn't
hit this gentleman,

299
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,871
as long as I'm around to do it!

300
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,394
James! Henry!

301
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:53,560
I'm not in the habit of making promises
to strangers, but you have my word.

302
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:58,038
If you don't get off this farm this
minute, I'm gonna shoot you stone dead.

303
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:33,678
That fella Tinkham,

304
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:39,321
he's the only man I know that started
at the bottom and went down in the worid.

305
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,879
He used to steal horses for
nothing. Now he gets paid for it.

306
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:46,518
Boy, get out of there
before you catch cold.

307
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,918
Go on in the house.

308
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:52,479
- See what you got us into?
- Me? You hit him.

309
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:55,208
You would have if I
hadn't beat you to it.

310
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:00,682
Pa, first it was Johnson,
and that was on our land.

311
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:05,764
Now they come driving right into our yard.
Aren't we going to do anything about it?

312
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,321
Well, I must be getting
old. Seems to me we just did.

313
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,879
It's no easy job, Sam,
taking care of a woman.

314
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,166
No, sir.

315
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,966
Yeah.

316
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:32,839
They expect things
they never asked for.

317
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,490
And when they don't get
them, they ask you why.

318
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,644
Sometimes they don't ask.

319
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:42,804
And they just go ahead and punish you

320
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:47,170
for not doing something you didn't
know you were supposed to do.

321
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,049
What, for instance, sir?

322
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:55,002
Well, that's a very difficult question
to answer, Sam. You're never quite sure.

323
00:34:56,012 --> 00:35:00,324
It's just that it's sort
of, you might say, relative.

324
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,290
- Relative to what, sir?
- How they're feeling at the moment.

325
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:07,364
- How's that?
- You never know.

326
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,611
I don't believe I understand
what you're telling me, sir.

327
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:17,972
I know. I never understood it
myself. I never understood it.

328
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:21,250
It's just one of those things, Sam.

329
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,644
It's around. You just
don't ever see it.

330
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,761
Now, suppose...

331
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:33,165
Suppose Jennie started to cry one day.

332
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:36,404
You don't know what she's crying
about so you ask. You follow me?

333
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:38,086
Yes, sir.

334
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:42,092
You ask her, and she won't tell you.

335
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:48,808
And that's when you ask her what it
was you did that caused her to cry.

336
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:54,609
She still won't tell you.

337
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:59,051
And that's when you
start to get angry.

338
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:01,854
But don't get angry, Sam.

339
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:07,212
She won't tell you why she's
crying because she doesn't know.

340
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,173
Women are like that, Sam.

341
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:16,445
And it's exasperating. It's... urgh!
But don't let it make you angry.

342
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,527
No.

343
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:24,167
When she gets like that, just
walk up and hug her a little bit.

344
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:28,727
Cos that's all they really want
when they're like that, Sam.

345
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:32,411
A little loving. You
understand me, don't you?

346
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,014
No, sir.

347
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,087
You don't, huh?

348
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:47,089
There's something you must remember.
Husbands like to be alone once in a while.

349
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,168
Why?

350
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:55,732
You never know why. But I can always
tell when James wants to be alone.

351
00:36:55,818 --> 00:37:01,370
A mood comes over him. I can always see
it in his eyes before it really gets there.

352
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:04,529
I don't know where the
mood comes from or why.

353
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:07,815
But that's when I leave him alone.

354
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:11,778
It seems sometimes things
get so thick around a man,

355
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:14,975
that he comes to feel
everything is closing in on him.

356
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,338
And that's when he wants to be left
alone. You understand, don't you?

357
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:23,889
No.

358
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:46,171
Dearly beloved,

359
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,415
forasmuch as marriage is a
holy estate, ordained by God,

360
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,810
to be held in honour by all...

361
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:11,213
To love and to cherish
till death us do part.

362
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:15,897
"According to God's holy ordinance,
and thereto I plight thee my troth."

363
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,779
According to God's holy ordinance,

364
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:21,979
and thereto I plight thee my troth.

365
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:27,492
"I, Jennie, take thee,
Sam, to my wedded husband."

366
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:30,778
I, Jennie, take thee,
Sam, to my wedded husband.

367
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:31,851
"To have..."

368
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,661
To have and to hold
from this day forward,

369
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:37,336
for better, for worse,

370
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:39,811
for richer or poorer,

371
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,291
in sickness and in health.

372
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:47,218
To love, cherish, to obey,
till death us do part.

373
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:50,702
According to God's holy ordinance.

374
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:53,343
And thereto I plight thee my troth.

375
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:06,136
"Receive this ring as a token
of wedded love and troth."

376
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:12,015
Receive this ring as a token
of wedded love and troth.

377
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,492
Join your right hands.

378
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:23,539
Forasmuch as Sam and Jennie have
consented together in holy wedlock,

379
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:28,414
and have declared the same before God
and in the presence of this company,

380
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:30,972
I pronounce them man and wife.

381
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:36,344
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

382
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:41,419
What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.

383
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,903
Congratulations, Sam.

384
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,816
Jennie.

385
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:53,019
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

386
00:39:56,506 --> 00:40:00,419
- The captain's compliments, sir.
- Go on, Corporal.

387
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:07,455
He wishes to see you immediately. The
Yankees broke through at Winchester, sir.

388
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:09,935
Very well, Corporal.

389
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:27,900
I'll have to leave now.
You know that, don't you?

390
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,025
Do you understand?

391
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,138
Do you?

392
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,539
Ugh!

393
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:55,189
It's started.

394
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:58,261
- Pa!
- You just sit quiet.

395
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:02,058
Pa, something terrible's going to
happen if we don't get Ann home.

396
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:03,501
All right.

397
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,581
Take the carriage. Jennie
and I will go with Harkens.

398
00:41:06,668 --> 00:41:09,137
Jacob, drive them home.
Nathan, go with them.

399
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:12,904
- Henry, you find Doc Witherspoon.
- What shall I tell him, sir?

400
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:16,618
- Nothing. When I send for him, he knows.
- Yes, sir.

401
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:29,307
I'll be back, sir,
just as soon as I can.

402
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,302
You take care of yourself, you hear?

403
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:47,433
Congratulations, son. It's
a boy. I know the sound.

404
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:51,144
Congratulations, James.

405
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:56,302
Ann wants to see you.

406
00:43:05,274 --> 00:43:09,313
Something went wrong,
Charlie. I'm sorry.

407
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:14,309
It's a girl.

408
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,550
James?

409
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:25,668
- No. I might break it.
- How do you break an Anderson?

410
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:53,867
I don't know how you could bring yourself
to do this to me, Tom Witherspoon,

411
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:57,188
after all the business I've
given to you over the years.

412
00:43:57,276 --> 00:44:01,394
It's not that I have any
objection to giris, you understand.

413
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:05,470
It's just that it's awful
hard to break a habit.

414
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:10,792
- How old are you now, Boy?
- 18, sir.

415
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:15,871
That means you'll be 20 in four
years. 18 to you is 16 to me.

416
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:18,835
Just a little bit, sir.
I've never tasted it.

417
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:24,072
That's no good reason. I've known men
that've been drinking hard all their lives.

418
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:27,514
They've never tasted it
either. Isn't that right, Doc?

419
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,634
All right, here we are.

420
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:32,027
Here we go.

421
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:34,188
Here's to the ladies.

422
00:44:39,038 --> 00:44:43,350
- Well, these are busy days. Good night.
- Good night, Doctor.

423
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,796
Tom...

424
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,477
Tom, what's happening?

425
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,633
- Virginia's losing, isn't she?
- It looks that way, Charlie.

426
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:08,637
How do you feel about it all?

427
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,435
I was born in Virginia.
Lived here all my life.

428
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,433
Raised three sons and two
daughters under her flag.

429
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,911
My oldest son, Paul, is buried
somewhere in Pennsylvania.

430
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,117
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

431
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,197
They said Gettysburg is where he fell,
at a place called Little Round Top.

432
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:36,438
My youngest boy came home
last week with tuberculosis.

433
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:40,114
He won't see another Christmas.

434
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:46,639
My third son rides with General
Forrest. I don't know where they are.

435
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:51,238
You... You were asking me
how I feel about it all.

436
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:55,361
That's the only way I
know how to answer you.

437
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:13,314
If she needs me, send for me.
There's another baby due up the river.

438
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:15,393
Go on.

439
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:40,201
Get out of here. Git!

440
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:44,078
Or go find yourself a tree.
Just don't draw no fire to me.

441
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,682
Get out of here. Get out of here now.

442
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:55,601
Get out of here.

443
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:03,716
Get out of here! Git! You hear?

444
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,526
Well, now, look how young this one is.

445
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:48,201
I swear to goodness if these Rebs ain't
gonna be sending out grandpappies next.

446
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,757
Let me hold that rifle, Johnny.

447
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,204
My name isn't Johnny.

448
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,009
- Let me have the rifle.
- What for?

449
00:48:57,329 --> 00:49:02,085
It don't set right with the officers when
they see prisoners walking around armed.

450
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:07,767
Now give me that rifle before I put a
ball through that dumb head of yours.

451
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:12,561
I admire spunk in a boy.

452
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,166
But if you don't do
what I say from now on,

453
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:19,084
you're gonna find out spunk
don't come free for nothing.

454
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,050
- All right, Reb, let's go.
- I'm no soldier.

455
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:25,486
I don't look that ignorant, do I?

456
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:30,167
We seen enough of them Johnny
Reb caps to last us a lifetime.

457
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:36,441
- Go tell my Pa.
- Where they taking you, boy?

458
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:38,523
I don't know. Just
tell him what happened.

459
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:41,648
You don't have to tell his
pa nothing. You're free.

460
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,323
Master Anderson! Master Anderson!

461
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,845
- They took him.
- What are you saying?

462
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:27,050
- They took him.
- Who's "they"? Who'd they take?

463
00:50:27,134 --> 00:50:30,171
- The Yankee men. They took the Boy.
- How many Yankee men?

464
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:34,042
I don't know. Five, six. I don't know.

465
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:43,683
Now it concerns us.

466
00:50:55,495 --> 00:50:59,124
Nothing. There's footprints,
but they don't lead anywhere.

467
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:02,450
We haven't seen another
man since we left the house.

468
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:04,606
What do we do now?

469
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:09,211
Well, we'll go home
and we'll pack up...

470
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,644
and we'll leave tonight.

471
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,250
It's late. Won't Mr
Abernathy be looking for you?

472
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:37,808
He gone, Missy. Gone to Richmond.
Left the field boss in charge.

473
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:40,013
Won't he be wondering where you are?

474
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,774
Old Jethro don't care about me. When
my momma died, he even took our cabin.

475
00:51:44,857 --> 00:51:47,452
I don't got to go back, do I, Missy?

476
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:51,417
Man say I'm free. Don't that
mean I don't gotta go back?

477
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:55,093
Well, if the man said
you were free, Gabriel,

478
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:59,649
I guess that means you can go
anywhere in the worid you wanna go.

479
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,574
You mean I can just walk on down
that road and keep on walkin'?

480
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,774
You can run if you like, Gabriel.

481
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:19,570
Goodbye, Missy.

482
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,857
We can probably make better
time if we stay off the roads.

483
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,537
We can cut across here. There's a Unión
camp the other side of the ford. Here.

484
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,057
- Is that the closest?
- Yes, sir, far as I know.

485
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:05,692
The ones that took the Boy were probably
skirmishers. I don't think we'd find 'em.

486
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:09,012
- They turned him in as a prisoner?
- That's about all they can do.

487
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:14,095
All right, we'll try that one.
Mount up. I'll be with you directly.

488
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:28,693
Come in.

489
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:34,690
Hello, Papa Charlie.

490
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:42,134
Well, I think she's
getting bigger than you are.

491
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:48,697
Ann, we're leaving, and
James is staying with you.

492
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:54,174
I don't know how these people
dare take a son of mine.

493
00:53:55,184 --> 00:53:59,062
When I catch them, it's gonna
be a horrible thing to behold.

494
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:02,021
The Boy means a great
deal to you, doesn't he?

495
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,144
All of my sons mean
a great deal to me.

496
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:07,658
But the Boy...

497
00:54:07,743 --> 00:54:10,622
My Martha died the night he was born.

498
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,899
I look at him, I see her.

499
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:16,818
I'll pray for you.

500
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:21,773
It's too late to do any praying for
me and expect satisfactory results.

501
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:24,701
There.

502
00:54:24,784 --> 00:54:27,094
You and James decided on a name?

503
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:30,096
Martha.

504
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:33,815
Oh, she'd like that.

505
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:37,544
My Martha'd like that very much.

506
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:41,663
Ann...

507
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:49,142
I haven't told you, but we're all
mighty proud to have you in our family.

508
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:53,974
I love you very much.

509
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:25,857
Now, you take care of
yourself. You hear me?

510
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,859
We'll be back, just as soon as...

511
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:37,426
- Where do you think you're going?
- Wherever you go, Papa.

512
00:55:37,507 --> 00:55:41,740
From what these preachers tell me,
where I'm going, you wouldn't like it.

513
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:44,547
You may be on your way,
but you aren't there yet.

514
00:55:44,628 --> 00:55:47,188
Never mind that. You're
not going with us.

515
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:50,784
So unstrap, unhook, get out of your
brother's clothes. You're a woman.

516
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:57,422
I'm a woman, but I don't see anybody
here I can't outrun, outride and outshoot.

517
00:55:57,509 --> 00:56:00,467
I'll unstrap for
you, Papa. And unhook.

518
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:03,541
I'll even sit here and
watch you ride out of sight.

519
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:06,097
- And then what?
- I'll follow.

520
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:07,861
That's what I thought.

521
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:10,668
Don't worry about the place
here, Pa. We'll manage.

522
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,388
You just keep that little
Martha warm and fat.

523
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,827
She'll probably turn out to be the
only one around here with a brain.

524
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,629
- Bye, son.
- Goodbye, Pa.

525
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,062
You the leader of this band of fools?

526
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:28,667
Colonel Fairchild is my name.

527
00:57:28,753 --> 00:57:34,350
Whether or not I am the leader of fools
is a question which often enters my mind.

528
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:37,743
To whom do I have the
pleasure of speaking, sir?

529
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,393
Charlie Anderson is my name.

530
00:57:40,474 --> 00:57:44,182
You better decide later whether
speaking with me is a pleasure or not.

531
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:47,505
- You have business with me?
- Yes, sir, I do.

532
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:51,552
All right, Mr Nelson.
What can I do for you, sir?

533
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,512
Well, you can return
my son, for a start.

534
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:58,109
Then you can issue some kind of
order, or whatever it is you do,

535
00:57:58,194 --> 00:58:02,108
and instruct your people to keep off
my farm and leave my family alone.

536
00:58:02,194 --> 00:58:04,913
- Your son?
- My youngest son.

537
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:07,190
Your people came on
my farm and took him.

538
00:58:07,274 --> 00:58:10,391
- Why?
- That's what I'd like to know, Colonel.

539
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:15,310
- He's a prisoner and your army's got him.
- He isn't a Confederate?

540
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:19,354
No, sir. He's an Anderson,
and that's all he is.

541
00:58:19,435 --> 00:58:22,233
- How old is he?
- He's 16.

542
00:58:30,555 --> 00:58:34,390
Could you show me on the
map where your farm is?

543
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,944
Well, it's Shenandoah Gap.

544
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,874
It shows here. Right there.

545
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:45,232
It couldn't have been any
of my men who took your son,

546
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:48,388
because we haven't
been in your section.

547
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:51,195
But I think you should
understand something.

548
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,873
My men fought a battle the other day
with Rebels who threw stones at them,

549
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:57,948
because that was all that they had.

550
00:58:58,037 --> 00:59:03,953
We took 1500 prisoners and there wasn't
50 rounds of ammunition among them.

551
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,676
What are you telling me, Colonel?

552
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:09,555
Only that what you're trying
to do is nearly impossible.

553
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:13,597
Every corps in our army is taking
thousands of prisoners each day.

554
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:17,717
How do you expect to
find one 16-year-old boy?

555
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:36,834
If I had him, Mr Anderson, I'd give him
to you. But I don't have any prisoners.

556
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:40,911
We sent them all to the
railroad for shipment north.

557
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:48,718
If you find the boy, give this
slip to the officer in charge.

558
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,357
- It may help.
- What is it?

559
00:59:50,439 --> 00:59:54,148
It's a statement from me that
your son was taken by mistake,

560
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,155
and it would be considered a personal
favour to me if he is released to you.

561
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,118
Where's that railroad you
send your prisoners to?

562
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,395
It's at lvy Glen.

563
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,315
I do wish you good luck, Mr Anderson.
I have a 16-year-old son, too.

564
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,315
He's in school in Boston... thank God.

565
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,952
No stragglers back there!

566
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:40,076
All right, keep moving.

567
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:49,195
Go on inside. Keep those
men moving back there.

568
01:00:50,562 --> 01:00:53,030
All right, move along.

569
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:02,393
The Boy couldn't be
with them, could he, Pa?

570
01:01:15,003 --> 01:01:17,836
- I've a note for Captain Richards.
- Sir?

571
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:27,001
- You Anderson?
- I'm Anderson.

572
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,393
There's nothing I can do for you.

573
01:01:29,484 --> 01:01:33,477
I don't recall asking you to do
anything for me. I'm looking for my son.

574
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,476
- I don't have him.
- How do you know that?

575
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:42,036
All I'm asking is to look through these
cattle cars. Is that too much to expect?

576
01:01:42,124 --> 01:01:46,561
If your son is among these prisoners,
you're too late. There's a war going on.

577
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:50,274
- Sergeant! Lock 'em up.
- All right, lock 'em up.

578
01:01:50,364 --> 01:01:54,835
- We have schedules to meet.
- Lock 'em up.

579
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:10,355
What'd he say, Pa?

580
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:13,244
He says he has schedules to meet.

581
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:04,599
Sergeant!

582
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:13,957
Get this stuff off
of the tracks, mister.

583
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:16,403
What are you doing? Know
what the penalty is...

584
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:21,960
You'd all please me if you'd drop your
guns and stick your hands up in the air.

585
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,325
- Drop the rifles!
- Right now!

586
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,085
Now I remember. Anderson.
Your name is Anderson.

587
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,967
You can all turn around
and start walkin'.

588
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:42,167
I don't care where you go, as
long as you get out of my sight.

589
01:03:42,249 --> 01:03:46,721
- You're the man looking for his son.
- You're the man with schedules to keep.

590
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,483
Come on, move out. Come on, let's go.

591
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:53,324
Let's go, Captain. You
heard him. Come on. Move.

592
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,368
How long do you intend to
keep my train here, sir?

593
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:04,366
I'm glad you asked, because I believe
in a man knowing all about his business.

594
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,681
First I'm gonna empty your
train, and then I'm gonna burn it.

595
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:10,649
- Burn it?
- Open up those doors.

596
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:15,485
You can't do that. You
can't burn my train.

597
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:17,846
Maybe. You gotta give
me credit for trying.

598
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:22,402
- But why? Why?
- It's not the kind of a train I favour.

599
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:35,324
You can get out. You're free.

600
01:05:11,654 --> 01:05:13,485
Boy?

601
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:28,165
Jacob!

602
01:05:33,455 --> 01:05:36,048
Boy's not here, Jennie.

603
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:09,974
- Sam!
- Jennie...

604
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:28,057
You'd better leave soon. There's a
regular cavalry patrol on these railroads.

605
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:36,770
- Pa? What about the train, Pa?
- Uh, sir?

606
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:42,969
Sir, I've been the engineer
on this train for ten years.

607
01:06:43,057 --> 01:06:45,697
She's been a good train
all that time and, well...

608
01:06:45,777 --> 01:06:50,090
it ain't right to burn her just
cos she come onto hard times.

609
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:54,169
Now, you run a sad
kind of a train, mister.

610
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:59,777
It takes people away when they don't
wanna go, and won't bring 'em back.

611
01:06:59,858 --> 01:07:03,408
But I'll leave it to the
ones that were on it. Sam?

612
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:16,778
Burn it.

613
01:07:17,899 --> 01:07:21,494
Burn the train! Burn it!

614
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:34,172
Henry, give Sam the Boy's horse. The
rest of you, get mounted. Come on.

615
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:47,418
You be the only officer here, sir, and
the boys are after knowing what to do.

616
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,820
- Go home.
- Home, sir?

617
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,211
The war is lost. Go
back to your families.

618
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:04,329
I had no right to tell him that, but
those men can't go through another fight.

619
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:07,300
We knew before the last
one we couldn't win.

620
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:09,691
Why'd you go?

621
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:13,818
Easier than running, I guess.

622
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:21,330
If there's a cavalry patrol
around, we'd better move.

623
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:52,941
Hello, Carter.

624
01:08:53,023 --> 01:08:57,222
You can have your chance tonight,
Boy, if you wanna take it.

625
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,863
- Chance for what?
- To run.

626
01:09:00,864 --> 01:09:05,415
They don't waste many men on prisoner
duty and they're usually the worst.

627
01:09:05,504 --> 01:09:07,972
They plan on herding us
on that stern-wheeler.

628
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:12,104
Some of us don't fancy no
sightseeing trip up north.

629
01:09:12,184 --> 01:09:17,133
When they open that gate tonight, stick
as close to me as a flea on a hound dog.

630
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:21,457
There's something else. Once we
get going, you're on your own.

631
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:26,016
I gotta forget that you
ain't nothing but a lap baby.

632
01:09:42,786 --> 01:09:46,381
Nathan, you and Henry take the
horses over to that barn there.

633
01:09:46,466 --> 01:09:48,934
Yes, sir.

634
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:16,299
- Jacob, see if you can get a fire started.
- Yes, sir.

635
01:10:52,108 --> 01:10:55,499
- Say, what's Pa doing in there?
- Sleeping, I guess.

636
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:57,545
I can hear him moving.

637
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:16,547
That's sure gonna
taste good about now.

638
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,462
For somebody, it is.

639
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,423
- Sam?
- Sir?

640
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:29,900
You too, Jennie.

641
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:42,262
Here.

642
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,783
Your mother and I had it a little better
than this. It's not very comfortable.

643
01:11:59,871 --> 01:12:02,261
But when you've lived
together for years,

644
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:06,106
you'll realise that
comfort's not what counts.

645
01:12:10,152 --> 01:12:14,942
It's customary for a gentleman to
carry his bride across the threshold.

646
01:12:17,472 --> 01:12:21,182
So, if you wanna...
you can go ahead and...

647
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,864
Yes, sir.

648
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:44,308
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.

649
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:57,146
All right, move along. Move along.

650
01:12:57,235 --> 01:12:59,226
Inside!

651
01:13:05,395 --> 01:13:07,386
- Move along there.
- Now!

652
01:13:08,795 --> 01:13:11,184
Get that other guard.

653
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:14,187
Come on. Come on. This way.

654
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:23,104
Get down. Get down.

655
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:43,665
Get down. Get down.

656
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,593
Them blue-bellies must be everywhere.

657
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,992
What we're gonna have to do is travel
at night, heading south. Always south.

658
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,231
Then we can't hardly help
coming on something friendly.

659
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,118
But our farm is north.

660
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:38,834
- You hear something?
- I smell something. Wood smoke.

661
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:49,350
That's a Confederate camp.

662
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:53,913
Wood smoke ain't all you
smelled. You smelled country boys.

663
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:07,955
I gotten these over
at the hospital wagon.

664
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:11,160
Fellas they belonged to
won't be needing 'em no more.

665
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:16,034
The lieutenant says they'll be pulling
back and we're welcome to go with them.

666
01:16:16,124 --> 01:16:18,399
That was good of him.

667
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:25,515
- What is this?
- Don't ask.

668
01:16:25,604 --> 01:16:30,553
It ain't nothing your mama ever set
the table with, you can believe that.

669
01:16:30,644 --> 01:16:35,354
But we're walking in tall cotton, Boy.
Down in Vicksburg, they're eating rats.

670
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:23,323
Yankees! Yankees!

671
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,197
Here, take this.

672
01:17:45,487 --> 01:17:47,604
Don't fire till I tell you.

673
01:17:47,687 --> 01:17:50,360
I've never shot at a man before.

674
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:52,598
They ain't gonna know that.

675
01:18:18,449 --> 01:18:20,883
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir?

676
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:23,608
Is that a Confederate
cow or a Unión cow?

677
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:26,078
That must be a Unión cow, sir.

678
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:29,445
- Are Unión cows tasty?
- Quite tasty, sir.

679
01:18:29,529 --> 01:18:32,123
- Then take her prisoner.
- Yes, sir.

680
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,484
Hyah!

681
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:21,167
Sorry, sir.

682
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:26,804
That's all right, Lieutenant.
You scared a few pounds off her.

683
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:27,881
Get ready.

684
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,200
Fire!

685
01:19:37,693 --> 01:19:38,887
Fire!

686
01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:54,924
Charge!

687
01:19:56,773 --> 01:19:58,765
Charge!

688
01:20:05,374 --> 01:20:07,170
Fire!

689
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:39,530
You might as well know
something now, Boy.

690
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:43,733
In case you got any doubts, we
ain't got a dog's chance in hell.

691
01:21:04,177 --> 01:21:08,169
I ain't never seen nobody get
so peevish over a cow before.

692
01:21:31,538 --> 01:21:33,529
What you...

693
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:47,172
Howdy!

694
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:52,535
Hello.

695
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:54,577
What can I do for you?

696
01:22:54,661 --> 01:22:57,937
Just a drink of your
water, if you don't mind.

697
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:01,809
Come a long ways.
Got a long ways to go.

698
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:05,975
You're welcome to all you can
drink and all you can carry.

699
01:23:07,022 --> 01:23:09,013
Obliged.

700
01:23:09,102 --> 01:23:13,175
Nice place you got here.
Must support quite a few.

701
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:17,142
- Nine.
- Nine? Lmagine that.

702
01:23:18,142 --> 01:23:22,852
How come I don't see none
of 'em around... except you?

703
01:23:22,942 --> 01:23:25,741
They're all away
from home for a while.

704
01:23:38,543 --> 01:23:41,422
Aw, Mule, you sure do a job up right.

705
01:23:41,503 --> 01:23:45,133
Yeah, I'm bound to
say it. You sure do.

706
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:50,613
You two look around and
see if they got any horses.

707
01:23:50,704 --> 01:23:53,776
I'll see what's in the house.

708
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,934
Yeah.

709
01:24:42,146 --> 01:24:44,614
James?

710
01:24:57,947 --> 01:24:59,778
- Mule?
- James!

711
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,618
James!

712
01:25:44,949 --> 01:25:46,223
This all there is?

713
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:51,383
We used the last of the flour yesterday,
and this is the last of the coffee.

714
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:02,744
You don't think we're going
to find him, do you, Sam?

715
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:05,388
No, sir, I don't.

716
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:11,625
Boy could be any place, Pa. He may
even be somewhere up north by now.

717
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:15,498
- Federal prison, you mean?
- Yes, sir.

718
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:21,782
The horses haven't had a good feed in
a long time, Pa. They're almost spent.

719
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,180
I wanna say something.

720
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:28,227
I've known since the train that
we weren't liable to find him.

721
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:31,906
It was just a hair of a
chance that we got Sam back.

722
01:26:31,991 --> 01:26:35,826
I knew that... Maybe I knew
even before we left home.

723
01:26:35,911 --> 01:26:40,462
But somehow I just had to try.

724
01:26:41,032 --> 01:26:45,583
And if we don't try, we don't do.

725
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:49,152
And if we don't do,

726
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:52,950
why are we here on this earth?

727
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,583
I...

728
01:27:00,392 --> 01:27:03,384
I hope you all understood.

729
01:27:03,472 --> 01:27:06,782
We understood you, Pa,
and we're all with you.

730
01:27:07,873 --> 01:27:10,262
Tomorrow morning we'll start back.

731
01:27:15,193 --> 01:27:17,024
Pa...

732
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:23,027
I'll admit I don't feel
the same way I did before.

733
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,581
And I'll admit that I'd
sure like to get home.

734
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:28,871
But I don't want you
giving up because of us.

735
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:33,947
I'm with you. I don't wanna go
home unless you really want to.

736
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:38,625
Thank you, son.

737
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:43,626
We'll go home. Maybe the Boy's there.

738
01:28:41,837 --> 01:28:44,829
Hold your fire, men. Hold your fire.

739
01:29:11,238 --> 01:29:13,753
Dead!

740
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:28,834
How old are you?

741
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:32,997
- How old?
- 16.

742
01:29:33,599 --> 01:29:36,591
16... 16.

743
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:41,958
I'm not gonna kill you.

744
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,793
I want you to live.

745
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,111
I want you to live to be an old man.

746
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:53,877
And I want you to have
many, many, many children.

747
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,158
And I want you to feel
about your children then

748
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,834
the way I feel about mine now.

749
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,069
And some day,

750
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:12,276
when a man comes along and kills one
of them, I want you to remember. I...

751
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:23,240
I want you to remember.

752
01:31:06,164 --> 01:31:10,156
We'll bury him on the
farm, near his mother.

753
01:32:04,806 --> 01:32:09,880
- Somebody sick, Tom?
- Where have you been?

754
01:32:09,966 --> 01:32:11,957
What's wrong?

755
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:17,115
- What's wrong? The baby...
- The baby's all right, Charlie.

756
01:32:17,207 --> 01:32:18,606
Uh...

757
01:32:18,687 --> 01:32:21,918
James and Ann...

758
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:24,955
are dead.

759
01:32:30,967 --> 01:32:32,798
We...

760
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:35,482
We figured scavengers did it.

761
01:32:35,567 --> 01:32:38,400
From what I could tell,

762
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:41,081
James died instantly.

763
01:32:42,288 --> 01:32:47,407
It wasn't until two days later
I just happened to come by.

764
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,479
Ann had...

765
01:32:50,488 --> 01:32:52,365
She was dead, too.

766
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:55,758
I had them buried near Martha.

767
01:32:56,688 --> 01:33:02,524
I thought you'd like that. It
somehow seemed the only place.

768
01:33:03,569 --> 01:33:06,686
- Where's the baby, Tom?
- Upstairs.

769
01:33:06,768 --> 01:33:09,237
I found a woman to take care of her.

770
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:12,245
She's all right, Charlie.

771
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:57,640
The child is my granddaughter.

772
01:34:05,252 --> 01:34:07,719
Her name is Martha.

773
01:34:16,812 --> 01:34:20,805
It's been a long time,
Martha, since I held a baby.

774
01:34:23,052 --> 01:34:25,520
It's been a long time.

775
01:34:30,613 --> 01:34:33,923
O Lord, we cleared this land.

776
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:37,693
We ploughed it and sowed it,

777
01:34:38,692 --> 01:34:40,683
and harvested.

778
01:34:42,853 --> 01:34:45,493
We cooked the harvest. We...

779
01:34:46,573 --> 01:34:48,166
It wouldn't...

780
01:34:48,253 --> 01:34:54,124
It wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be
eating it, if we hadn't done it all...

781
01:34:54,214 --> 01:34:56,603
all ourselves.

782
01:35:53,817 --> 01:35:58,811
I don't even know what to
say to you any more, Martha.

783
01:36:01,057 --> 01:36:05,255
There's nothing much I can
tell you about this war.

784
01:36:06,457 --> 01:36:09,767
It's like all wars, I suppose.

785
01:36:09,857 --> 01:36:12,417
The undertakers are winning it.

786
01:36:12,497 --> 01:36:16,729
The politicians talk a
lot about the glory of it.

787
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:20,493
And the old men will
talk about the need of it.

788
01:36:22,298 --> 01:36:25,892
The soldiers, they just wanna go home.

789
01:36:30,298 --> 01:36:36,817
I guess you're not so lonely
now, Martha, with James and Ann...

790
01:36:36,898 --> 01:36:39,014
and Jacob.

791
01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:41,566
And maybe the Boy.

792
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:49,494
You didn't know Ann, did
you? Well, you'll like her.

793
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:56,178
You'll like her a lot, Martha. Why,
she and James are so much alike.

794
01:36:56,259 --> 01:37:00,252
They're just like we... No.

795
01:37:01,539 --> 01:37:07,456
We were never that much alike,
were we, Martha? We just sort of...

796
01:37:07,539 --> 01:37:10,849
We just sort of grew
alike through the years.

797
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,420
But... I-I wish...

798
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:24,016
I wish I could just know what
you're thinking about it all, Martha.

799
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,615
Then maybe things
wouldn't look so bad to me.

800
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:32,295
If I only knew what you thought.

801
01:37:42,262 --> 01:37:44,139
Ah, you...

802
01:37:44,221 --> 01:37:46,940
You never give up, do you?

803
01:37:59,662 --> 01:38:03,780
Thought you'd get away with it, huh? Why
didn't one of you tell me it was Sunday?

804
01:38:03,862 --> 01:38:07,060
Now, come on, get
cleaned up. We're late.

805
01:38:08,423 --> 01:38:10,857
- You have something to say?
- No, sir.

806
01:38:10,942 --> 01:38:14,457
Well, then, saddle your
horses. Get my carriage.

807
01:38:20,663 --> 01:38:26,295
#... goods and kindred go

808
01:38:26,383 --> 01:38:32,856
# This mortal life also

809
01:38:32,943 --> 01:38:39,861
# The body they may kill

810
01:38:39,944 --> 01:38:46,975
# God's truth abideth still

811
01:38:47,064 --> 01:38:56,382
# His kingdom is forever

812
01:38:56,464 --> 01:39:02,300
# Amen

813
01:39:07,185 --> 01:39:10,063
For our second hymn...

814
01:39:14,065 --> 01:39:17,262
For our second hymn,
we'll turn to page...

815
01:39:22,145 --> 01:39:23,898
How long, O Lord?

816
01:39:29,106 --> 01:39:32,940
With God's help, we'll turn to page...

817
01:39:38,266 --> 01:39:40,621
137.

818
01:39:58,307 --> 01:40:01,026
Shall we all rise and sing?

819
01:40:02,188 --> 01:40:08,707
# Praise God, from
whom all blessings flow

820
01:40:08,787 --> 01:40:15,864
# Praise Him, all creatures here below

821
01:40:15,948 --> 01:40:23,025
# Praise Him above, ye heavenly host

822
01:40:23,108 --> 01:40:31,618
# Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
