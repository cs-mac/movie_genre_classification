154
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,915
Just a little -
Just a little slow.

155
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,487
<i>He used to introduce himself ...</i>

156
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:03,079
<i>"Tom Kennedy, like the president" ...</i>

157
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,058
<i>or, "I'm from Georgia, like President Carter. "</i>

158
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,923
<i>He was a divorcé from Atlanta ...</i>

159
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,997
<i>who had decided to remarry.</i>

160
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:13,726
<i>He had met his second wife, Christine,
at the Oktoberfest in Munich.</i>

161
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,900
<i>At the birth of the twins,
he was told they might be retarded.</i>

162
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,735
<i>He came back home
and smashed his fist in the wall.</i>

163
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:24,773
<i>Soon after, he lost his job as an accountant,
and by then ...</i>

164
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,077
<i>Chris's nerves were so bad
that she couldn't keep her job.</i>

165
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,778
<i>He packed his family in a car
and headed for California.</i>

166
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:35,447
<i>In San Diego, he couldn't find work.</i>

167
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:40,858
<i>To explain his difficulties, he would say,
"It's a navy town, and I'm air force. "</i>

168
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:44,193
<i>He finally applied for welfare,
and it's through the welfare office ...</i>

169
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:47,665
<i>that Gracie and Ginny
landed at Children's Hospital.</i>

170
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,793
<i>The publicity brought him hope ...</i>

171
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,872
<i>and he passed
the real estate school exams ...</i>

172
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:56,239
<i>and joined this army of California salesmen
who pay for their own gas ...</i>

173
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,177
<i>and cling to the hope
of a commission on a sale.</i>

174
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:04,078
I'm following a lead, and the way I got the lead
is from my office manager, Gail Andress ...

175
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:08,315
from some prospects of a year ago
that Herbert Hawkins had.

176
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:13,450
And they live in Arcadia,
and he works in Pasadena ...

177
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,530
and he wants to retire in San Diego.

178
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,966
So I phoned him several times
last weekend ...

179
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,560
talked with him at length
about finding him a place.

180
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:28,836
And I called him again late Saturday night
and had him come down, and, um ...

181
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,969
he drove down about 150 miles.

182
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,673
He didn't know much about San Diego,
so I took him -

183
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,773
he and his wife -

184
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,351
Uh, lovely couple.

185
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:42,513
I took both he and his wife on a trip
to look at houses.

186
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,784
One was in Mira Mesa ...

187
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,190
and one in Scripps Ranch
and one in Encinitas.

188
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,197
However, none of the houses
exactly fit their needs ...

189
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,565
in what they were really wanting
to settle in, or retire in.

190
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,697
He has a boat, and he wants to get close
to the water and near the boat marina.

191
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:03,038
And I told him I would look
in the Point Loma area for him ...

192
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:05,544
and he said, "Yes, do it".

193
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,615
Because he very much wants to retire here,
and he loves the city.

194
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:13,244
And I think he's getting
a little bit tired of L.A. and environs, so ...

195
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,991
he, uh, would very much like
to relocate here upon his retirement.

196
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:22,392
And, uh, so I am now searching out
leads in Point Loma area ...

197
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,123
to try to find him a house.

198
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,390
<i>Now that I have these two twins ...</i>

199
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,526
<i>it's been a double expense
all the way down the line.</i>

200
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,264
<i>It was double the hospital bill.</i>

201
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,897
<i>They had to stay in there for two weeks
when they were born or more ...</i>

202
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,067
<i>because of the complications and, um -</i>

203
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,168
<i>The only bargain
we got was the doctor ...</i>

204
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,577
<i>simply because he didn't know
they were gonna be twins.</i>

205
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:42,672
<i>He had to deliver them
for the price of one.</i>

206
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,415
<i>He was exactly what I wanted.</i>

207
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,250
<i>For one thing, American men ...</i>

208
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:51,825
<i>say the job and the family is the first thing.</i>

209
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,190
<i>They care more about the family.</i>

210
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,229
<i>The German men, they have-</i>

211
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,732
<i>Oh, the job, I guess, is the first,
then comes the car ...</i>

212
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:05,033
<i>then comes their bowling team
or whatever,you know-</i>

213
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,868
<i>their pleasure on the hobby side.</i>

214
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:10,466
<i>And then,you know, the family
kind of comes a little bit farther away.</i>

215
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,948
<i>The twins had grown up
with another voice- Chris's.</i>

216
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,415
<i>She had been raised
on a farm by her grandparents ...</i>

217
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,419
<i>near Berlin in the postwar years.</i>

218
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,989
<i>She had learned her English
on an American army base ...</i>

219
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,682
<i>working at the P.X.</i>

220
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,784
<i>And there must have been
in the faces of these G.I.Joes ...</i>

221
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:31,058
<i>from Iowa, Missouri, Nevada
passing in front ofher ...</i>

222
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:34,965
<i>some strong seduction
which later drew her to Tom.</i>

223
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,697
<i>She followed these dreams
to the States ...</i>

224
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,797
<i>but there things turned sour
very quickly.</i>

225
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,409
<i>You know, he wants to do
a lot of things ...</i>

226
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:46,071
<i>but then financially,you know,
he's not able to.</i>

227
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,148
So, uh ...

228
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,480
it's kind of bad, because when you are
living in small quarters ...

229
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:54,713
everybody is kind of on the edge
with their nerves and so on ...

230
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:58,280
because you have
an - a grandmother at 76 ...

231
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,384
and then two ding-a-lings
that are pretty much a laugh.

232
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,395
<i> ...two ding-a-lings
that are pretty much a laugh ...</i>

233
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:13,940
living all in one room, and she sometimes,
you know, likes to get up early.

234
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,101
That means, you know, she likes
to go to bed earlier too at nighttime.

235
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:19,145
That's not possible
if one of the kids don't -

236
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,874
you know, is too much still pepped up ...

237
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:24,416
and she can't go to sleep
when she sings and so on.

238
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,453
So finally she used to have to leave
the room and go down to the living room ...

239
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:31,423
till ever peace gonna be in the bedroom
and she can go upstairs.

240
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:33,356
So that kind of eats on her nerves too.

241
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:36,897
Or when the kids are sick.
Then she barely gets any sleep.

242
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,692
Because then they'll be up all night.

243
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,667
All night long she has to go with them to
the bathroom and all those things like that.

244
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,672
Because when they get sick
they are really bad off and -

245
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,301
The last few years, when they started school,
they had one cold after another.

246
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,140
They couldn't breathe.

247
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,714
And then, you know,
with the temper they got -

248
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:57,545
You can imagine they almost kind of
jump out of their skirts.

249
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:00,085
You know, can't breathe
and all those things ...

250
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:04,214
so it almost has driven her
a lot of times up to the wall.

251
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,457
So the conditions are kind of
a little nerve-racking.

252
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,760
So if you don't have anything, you know,
some people probably would -

253
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,529
In my case, I don't know. Some of them
probably turn into alcoholics ...

254
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,103
or something like that, you know.

255
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:21,470
Because I have seen people turning
for a lot less into alcoholism.

256
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,569
Because they couldn't take
the pressure.

257
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:27,875
In my case, I have to take once in a while,
when it gets too rough -

258
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,813
I have to take tablets.

259
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,407
I'm glad I have them.

260
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,851
<i>The voice
they had heard the most was Granny's.</i>

261
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:37,753
<i>Granny had been a cashier ...</i>

262
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>in a Berlin movie house
most ofher life ...</i>

263
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,927
<i>and she had joined the New World
at age 65 ...</i>

264
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,263
<i>to take care of the twins like her mother
before her had taken care of Chris.</i>

265
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:54,399
<i>And in 10 years in the States, she had only
mastered four or five words in English.</i>

266
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,541
<i>She would never go out.</i>

267
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:01,672
<i>She would eat by herself in the kitchen
except on holidays.</i>

268
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,774
<i>During the day,
she would keep the house spotless ...</i>

269
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:08,719
<i>and at one point stopped to watch
her favorite show on TV-</i>

270
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:10,790
The Price Is Right.

271
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:14,054
<i>But most of the time
she would sew and design ...</i>

272
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,891
<i>the wardrobe of Grace and Ginny.</i>

273
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:26,615
Gracie? Gracie?

274
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,655
Gracie, please.

275
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,419
You have to cut it yourself.

276
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,754
You know how to do that.
You've been doing it for a while.

277
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,021
- Grace.
- Grace.

278
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,761
- Here you go.
- That's a pork chop.

279
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:14,197
What do you do now?

280
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,571
- Wait.
- Wait, wait, wait.

281
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:23,716
- There.
- Oh, it's right there.

282
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:26,547
- Then we always say the blessing, right?
- Right.

283
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,759
Bow your head. Ginny.

284
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:40,662
Lord and heavenly Father, we do thank thee
for the foods that nourish our body ...

285
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:43,328
and pray that you will continue
to bless this family ...

286
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:46,065
with health and prosperity and success.

287
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:48,403
We ask it in the name ofJesus. Amen.

288
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,739
It's hot?

289
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,311
Then blow if it's hot.

290
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:57,914
Is it too hot, girls?

291
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,020
Then just blow
a little bit on it without -

292
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,021
Let it cool a while and eat your salad.

293
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:04,613
Is that a potato salad?

294
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,192
Yeah, it's kind of mixed salad.

295
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,453
Kartoffel salad?

296
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,995
Yeah, it has pineapple in it and -

297
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:13,332
Fruit salad.

298
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,131
No, it also has tomato in it
and things like that.

299
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,297
<i>- Gemischt.
- Yeah, it's kind of mixed.</i>

300
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:23,501
<i>- Gemischt.
- Yeah, it's kind of mixed.</i>

301
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,134
<i>- Gemischt.
- Leftover mixings.</i>

302
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,049
- Any butter?
- Yeah.

303
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,381
I just didn't want to bring
the big thing out.

304
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:37,824
<i>Schlaglecker.</i>

305
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,120
<i>Schlag, Schlag.</i>

306
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,400
<i>And a Käse knife.</i>

307
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,000
<i>- Käse knife?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

308
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:53,937
- Thank you.
- Yeah, and I'll get you a knife -

309
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,668
<i>What's a Käse knife for?</i>

310
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,571
Eat your food.

311
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,240
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,817
<i>Is that a Käse knife?</i>

313
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,351
- What?
- That one.

314
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,251
No, that's not a steak knife.
What you've got is a steak knife.

315
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:12,658
Why I got a steak knife?

316
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,923
Because what you're eating is a schnitzel,
and that's something like a steak.

317
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,998
<i>So you're using a sharp knife
going mit it.</i>

318
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,433
<i>Oh,yeah.</i>

319
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,456
- That's German style.
- Otherwise you can't cut it ...

320
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,457
if you use a regular knife on it.

321
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,553
What is -What's this knife?

322
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:52,131
That's a steak knife.

323
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,966
- Have you got a steak knife too?
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:58,236
Yeah.

325
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:01,774
Steak fork?

326
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,502
That's just an ordinary fork.

327
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:09,472
<i>The environment is probably
the biggest factor in this case ...</i>

328
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:12,609
in that it is an unusual environment ...

329
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,745
not only in terms of how the children
were raised ...

330
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,916
but in the question of the bilingualism
used in the home.

331
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:23,554
These children were constantly
listening to two models ...

332
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:25,928
both of them actually being defective.

333
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:34,134
<i>Yeah.</i>

334
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:39,478
<i>What are you coloring now?</i>

335
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,811
<i>You're coloring the head, Gracie.</i>

336
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,283
<i>You're not finished.
Now you get the rest of it.</i>

337
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,786
<i>Grace, don't shake the cushion.</i>

338
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:55,754
<i>Ja, ist gut, Ginny.</i>

339
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:57,796
<i>Gracie, hold it.</i>

340
00:25:57,898 --> 00:26:01,197
<i>I have my red pen. You have your blue pen.</i>

341
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:03,963
<i>One red und one blue.</i>

342
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,539
<i>- Here.
- One red, one blue.</i>

343
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,938
<i>Ja. The whole Gans pretty.</i>

344
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,275
<i>- HeyI GinnyI
- GinnyI</i>

345
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:17,480
From the very beginning,
when the parents were told ...

346
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:22,146
that there was a good possibility
these children could be retarded ...

347
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:27,124
the parents, at least from what
we have learned from them ...

348
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:32,062
have raised the children with that thought
always in the back of their mind ...

349
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:37,125
in that they wanted to watch them
and, um ...

350
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:41,196
isolate them and essentially
keep a very close watch ...

351
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,471
on what they were doing
and what they'd be exposed to.

352
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:48,344
These children never had an opportunity
to run and to play ...

353
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,746
and to ride a bike and go to the park ...

354
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:55,049
and to, um, you know,
meet with other children.

355
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,555
They were essentially kept in the home ...

356
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:03,425
where they could be watched
and had solely one another to interact with.

357
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:24,141
<i>I think, um ...</i>

358
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,778
<i>ever since we began to know
Grace and Ginny ...</i>

359
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:30,948
<i>Grace has always been the dominant one.</i>

360
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,719
<i>She's always been the leader.</i>

361
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:36,284
<i>And the parents tell us
that this was the same situation ...</i>

362
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:42,596
<i>in, um, their development
until we saw them.</i>

363
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,933
<i>Ginny seemed to rely on Grace quite a bit ...</i>

364
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,305
<i>to always be first and to guide her.</i>

365
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,275
Okay.

366
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:40,252
Yeah.

367
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:45,361
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

368
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:56,538
We were the initial ones to help them.

369
00:28:56,643 --> 00:29:00,374
We were constantly with them,
and they became very attached.

370
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,213
And also, we were exposing them
to everything that was new and exciting -

371
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:09,277
toys that they had never seen before,
books and pictures.

372
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:13,325
Everything was stimulating.
They were anxious to learn.

373
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,860
And consequently, you know ...

374
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:21,161
we were able to provide this for them,
and we became their immediate friends.

375
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,668
- What's your name?
- Ginny.

376
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,965
- What's your name?
- Gracie.

377
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,040
- Very good.
- What do you call each other?

378
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,904
What does Gracie call you?

379
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:32,979
Ginny.

380
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,276
Oh, sometimes she calls you something else.
What does she call you?

381
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,874
- Cabengo.
- Cabengo, right.

382
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,579
What do you call Gracie?

383
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,622
- Poto.
- Poto. Right.

384
00:29:44,724 --> 00:29:46,624
We're gonna look at some things today.

385
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:51,288
I'm gonna ask one of you what it is
that I'm gonna show you, okay?

386
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,424
- Yes.
- Maybe I'll even let you pick one.

387
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:56,297
- Wanna do that?
- Yeah.

388
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,098
Okay.

389
00:29:58,205 --> 00:30:00,833
Okay. First of all, you can't peek, okay?

390
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,533
Can you hide your eyes?

391
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,439
- How do you hide your eyes?
- Who should be first?

392
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,910
- Cabengo.
- Who - Cabengo?

393
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:07,809
Yeah.

394
00:30:07,914 --> 00:30:11,941
Okay, Virginia will be first.
Okay, can you hide your eyes?

395
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:15,613
How do you hide you eyes?
Close your eyes.

396
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:17,019
Don't peek.

397
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:20,456
I'll help you. I'll help you put your hand
in there and pick something out, okay?

398
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,222
You close your eyes.
Real tightly.

399
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,298
Can you do it without covering them
with your hands?

400
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:27,093
How do you close your eyes?

401
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,667
Good girl. Okay.

402
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:30,895
Now pick something out.

403
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,471
Cup.

404
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:35,370
What did she get?

405
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:37,136
- What is that?
- Cup.

406
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:40,907
Good. She knew what that was.
Whose turn is it?

407
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:42,572
- Poto.
- Right.

408
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:45,082
Can you close your eyes?

409
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:47,210
Close your eyes.

410
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,981
Shut 'em. Got it?

411
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,818
Ah, they're not closed.

412
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:54,418
What are you gonna find?
What'd you find?

413
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:55,994
Comb.

414
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:57,495
- What did you find?
- Comb.

415
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:00,122
Aha. Virginia, what'd she find?

416
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,894
Comb.

417
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:04,470
Good.
Whose turn is it?

418
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,466
Whose turn?

419
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,042
- Right. Can you -
- It's Ginny's turn.

420
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:13,579
Close your eyes?
Good girl.

421
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,272
Pick something out.

422
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:18,646
What is she gonna get?

423
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,346
What'd she find? What'd you find?

424
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:24,014
What is it called?

425
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,686
Do you know what this is?

426
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:34,859
It wasn't just their speech
and language skills that were delayed.

427
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:37,266
They were delayed in overall development.

428
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,033
Their gross motor skills, such as running
and jumping and climbing ...

429
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:45,271
their fine motor control, like how
they manipulated even puzzle pieces ...

430
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:49,712
or a pencil or a crayon,
was very rudimentary.

431
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:54,150
And it's taken them this year ...

432
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:57,052
with a lot of extra stimulation
and a lot of help ...

433
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:59,887
to bring up their level of functioning.

434
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:05,829
They show a steady increase
in their level of functioning right now.

435
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:11,393
I believe Grace is functioning
within the normal range ...

436
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:15,235
and Ginny is just slightly below that
in the borderline range.

437
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:19,972
However, mental retardation
cannot be ruled out yet.

438
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:23,282
The girls are now able to interact more ...

439
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:25,317
with other people ...

440
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:27,852
that they've grown a great deal ...

441
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:31,082
in their cognitive achievements ...

442
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:35,457
that they can deal
with their surroundings ...

443
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:39,521
and understand situations much more.

444
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:41,964
They think more abstractly now ...

445
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,626
and not so concretely ...

446
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:45,864
and can use their language
very abstractly ...

447
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:49,533
rather than just in concrete labeling.

448
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:52,702
Um, I want to put - in the van.

449
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:55,246
Who?

450
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,806
- Jean-Pierre?
- Jean-Pierre -

451
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,977
A lot of things in the van.

452
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,789
You can sit in the front with now.

453
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:07,189
- Okay.
- Orange.

454
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,789
<i>So that's how
we had come to talk to each other.</i>

455
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,960
<i>Because someone at lunch break
at the cafeteria of Children's Hospital ...</i>

456
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,231
<i>had said that there might be a big case ...</i>

457
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:22,103
<i>in the speech, hearing
and neurosensory center ...</i>

458
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,110
<i>the P.R. department of the hospital
leaked word to the press ...</i>

459
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,806
<i>and news traveled fast.</i>

460
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:32,282
<i>And that's how Gracie and Ginny
got their fame.</i>

461
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,876
<i>And ultimately, that's how I came.</i>

462
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:38,421
<i>They had been swamped by reporters ...</i>

463
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:43,155
<i>and, most likely, the kids didn't know why
everyone was so interested.</i>

464
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:47,097
<i>They couldn't care less
about my fascination for their past.</i>

465
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,603
<i>They saw me as an avenue to the world,
and they wanted to go out ...</i>

466
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:53,433
<i>so we went out.</i>

467
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,032
<i>But in San Diego,
"going out" means the zoo.</i>

468
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:04,748
<i>- I want to go to the zoo today.
- I want to go to the zoo now.</i>

469
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,258
<i>I thought about
the together-together monkeys ...</i>

470
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:02,273
<i>who were raised together
in complete isolation, fed by machines ...</i>

471
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:06,505
<i>then one day are thrown in a cage
where other monkeys ...</i>

472
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,844
<i>have developed "normally".</i>

473
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,918
<i>And they are so mortified
that they cling to each other ...</i>

474
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:15,487
<i>and that sometimes they die.</i>

475
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:35,998
<i>And here I was, showing them the world ...</i>

476
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:39,840
<i>realizing but a little late
that I had never dealt with kids ...</i>

477
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:44,610
<i>and not knowing if I was going to be able
to handle the excitement.</i>

478
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,952
And ... ride around there, and it was -

479
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,323
I don't want to ride around.
I want to stay-

480
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:57,623
I want to go back home,
have the library-

481
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:03,191
But if we take the -
the bus to go around the animals -

482
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:06,272
Take the train, not a bus!

483
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,507
We're not going out of the bus.

484
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:12,134
There is no -There is no train.
It's a bus.

485
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:13,735
It's a bus that runs -

486
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,973
I'm not going out of the bus.

487
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,607
- You don't want to go out of the bus?
- No.

488
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:20,851
Why?

489
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:24,355
Because then we wouldn't be
next to the animals.

490
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:25,947
What are you crying -

491
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:33,327
- And then we wouldn't be next to the animals.
- Okay. Okay.

492
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:35,663
So we don't go to the animals.
We gotta go away.

493
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:37,998
I want to go to the animals, ride around.

494
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:40,664
We gotta go away.
We gotta go to the library.

495
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,138
Yes.

496
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,971
- And ride around! I want to ride around!
- No!

497
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,205
- You don't want to ride around?
- No.

498
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,871
I want to ride around.

499
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,746
No, you're not going.
You're going to the library.

500
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:54,411
No, I'm not going to the library.

501
00:36:57,123 --> 00:37:01,253
- I am. You stay-
- I don't want to go to the library.

502
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:04,922
If Gracie doesn't want to come to
the library, you want to go to the library alone?

503
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:06,293
Yes.

504
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,991
Um, I want to go with you.

505
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,468
<i>In this pair of Alices in reverse ...</i>

506
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:15,063
<i>the one I was getting
the closest to was Ginny.</i>

507
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:17,904
<i>Ginny was terrified of showers ...</i>

508
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:21,845
<i>because she had been told once
that she had water in her brain.</i>

509
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,143
Um, I want to go with you.

510
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,083
Okay. But you don't want to go with Gracie?

511
00:37:27,186 --> 00:37:31,452
Gracie want to ride around.
I go to the library. Gracie go to the zoo.

512
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,081
- Really?
- Go ride around!

513
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,691
What about this one, huh?

514
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,264
Wait. This one has a home.

515
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,236
A big book!

516
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:52,174
I take this book home, Erica.

517
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,303
Erica, I take this book home.

518
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:57,916
Heavy.

519
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,622
I take this book home.

520
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:07,318
<i>It was Ginny who had
the strange request to go to the library.</i>

521
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:12,688
<i>But these weren't books.
They were things to feel, to touch, to bang ...</i>

522
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,267
<i>and most of all,
to want to take home.</i>

523
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,596
<i>They were acting like four years old ...</i>

524
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:22,072
<i>and I had to explain to them
that they couldn't keep these books.</i>

525
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:26,176
<i>So we went to a bookstore,
and Gracie, always practical ...</i>

526
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:28,713
<i>bought the Volkswagen Repair Manual ...</i>

527
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:31,784
<i>and Ginny,
a treatise on astrophysics.</i>

528
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:48,028
I can take home.

529
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,602
Little books.

530
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,880
I take this book and -

531
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:45,722
You can read while I -

532
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,560
I want to go to the zoo today again.

533
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:50,890
No, not -

534
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,693
...the bus.

535
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,564
- I want to go to the zoo today.
- On the bus again?

536
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:58,899
But yesterday you didn't
want to be in the zoo.

537
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,873
I want - I want -
I want to ride around in the bus again.

538
00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:04,875
You want to ride around in the bus?

539
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:06,706
Today!

540
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:11,049
Yes. I want to go to the zoo today.

541
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,744
I say hello to the animals.

542
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:15,787
With my book. I read a book in the bus.

543
00:40:15,888 --> 00:40:17,549
Let's see what animals -

544
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:20,820
Laying down in the -

545
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,725
I want to go to the zoo today.

546
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,731
I take my book,
and I - I go to zoo with this.

547
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,732
<i>What was overwhelming
was how slow I was for them ...</i>

548
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:33,897
<i>lumbering around with my film equipment.</i>

549
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:36,770
<i>I tried to make them stay
for one more shot.</i>

550
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:41,438
<i>I offered to show them
the music department of the library.</i>

551
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:43,572
<i>When we arrived in the music department ...</i>

552
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:47,619
<i>the tape recorders on the wall
must have triggered memories of therapy ...</i>

553
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,681
<i>and they started playing Ann and Alexa
and to involve my name in the game.</i>

554
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:56,853
<i>I tried to follow them,
but they were too fast ...</i>

555
00:40:56,963 --> 00:41:01,866
<i>and suddenly I really felt like
I should give up my job.</i>

556
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:04,429
Um, where Alexa?

557
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:06,903
- You come back here, Alexa.
- Hey.

558
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:09,038
Hey, guys.

559
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,772
Hey, stop.

560
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,972
- Alexa!
- Hey, guys.

561
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:18,011
Jean-Pierre calling you.
Well, anyway-

562
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:20,642
Please. I'll take you to the bookstore.

563
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,120
You come here.

564
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:30,859
It's only going to last five minutes.

565
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:33,796
Two minutes. Two minutes.
Only two minutes.

566
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,130
Back here -

567
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:39,396
Put up here.
Where are your glasses?

568
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:41,973
Could you stay here, please?

569
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,109
And on 17 too. And 18.

570
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:57,883
Please, guys. Please, could you stop?

571
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,254
One second. One second.

572
00:42:01,193 --> 00:42:02,683
What?

573
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:08,830
Where's Melanie then?

574
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:10,732
Melanie -

575
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,270
Hmm. Our teacher's gone, Melanie.

576
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,068
You don't want to listen to music?

577
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,646
No, no music. I'm sorry.

578
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,944
Mozart. You don't want to listen to Mozart?

579
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,620
<i>The next day we had planned a picnic ...</i>

580
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:37,287
<i>but when I came to pick them up,
there was a surprise in store for me.</i>

581
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,457
<i>Granny had invited herself.</i>

582
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:42,932
<i>It would be the first time
that she would see the sea in four years.</i>

583
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:45,936
<i>And Tom and Chris
could have a day to themselves.</i>

584
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,066
<i>We went to the house
I was renting for the summer.</i>

585
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,143
Keep it goin'.

586
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:55,213
<i>But when Granny saw the state
of my backyard ...</i>

587
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:57,475
<i>she immediately started weeding.</i>

588
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:00,814
<i>Gracie and Ginny and I
went on to prepare the picnic.</i>

589
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:04,881
You can put your fingers now -

590
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:14,489
Okay. Look at that. Look at that.

591
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:17,461
- You see that?
- Yeah.

592
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,061
See inside?

593
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:22,668
You see that?

594
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,006
What is -What is in the inside?

595
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:26,578
Inside?

596
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:28,408
It's the seeds.

597
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,609
See? How beautiful that is?

598
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:36,782
Okay, Ginny.
Put the - Put the egg in the pot.

599
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:39,756
<i>Okay, Ginny.
Put the-Put the egg in the pot.</i>

600
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:41,757
<i>Slowly.</i>

601
00:43:42,428 --> 00:43:45,864
Slowly. Good. Okay.

602
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,667
There we go.

603
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,965
You take every little piece like that. Okay?

604
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:53,265
Okay.

605
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:55,203
And do it here.

606
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:57,002
What you doing?

607
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:06,676
Oh!

608
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:10,085
See? Gets cut into little pieces.

609
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,089
So you have to do it now.

610
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,926
I'll give you -

611
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:18,463
<i>So you have to do it now.</i>

612
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:25,430
<i>So you have to do it now.</i>

613
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,567
Over there. Here. Here. Here.

614
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:31,732
- Hey.
- What?

615
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,641
Here. Here.

616
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:35,839
Over there. Here. Here. Here. Hey.

617
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:37,313
Here? What?

618
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,680
Here. Here.

619
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:41,218
I go now.

620
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,719
<i>I go now.</i>

621
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:44,312
<i>I go now.</i>

622
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,046
Ginny, stop!

623
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:23,288
<i>There was no way I could escape it.</i>

624
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:27,354
<i>Their story wasn't with me,
but back home with their family.</i>

625
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:37,265
<i>At the end of the day,
I took them back to Linda Vista and went home.</i>

626
00:45:46,185 --> 00:45:50,246
<i>It was a complicated story,
the story of Gracie and Ginny.</i>

627
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:53,416
<i>Because the Kennedys had been told
they might be retarded ...</i>

628
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:55,687
<i>they had been kept protected in the home.</i>

629
00:45:56,529 --> 00:45:59,498
<i>And the closest presence in the home
had been Granny.</i>

630
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:02,726
<i>And through Granny
they had been given Germany.</i>

631
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:07,772
<i>An inheritance that August Sander
had photographed in the faces of German women.</i>

632
00:46:15,047 --> 00:46:18,505
<i>It had to do with sternness ...</i>

633
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:20,141
<i>posture ...</i>

634
00:46:20,252 --> 00:46:23,187
<i>constraint, authority ...</i>

635
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:25,757
<i>discipline, distance ...</i>

636
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:27,325
<i>respect ...</i>

637
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,794
<i>and pride.</i>

638
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:39,664
<i>But if Granny was their inheritance,
Chris was their present and their future.</i>

639
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,498
<i>Chris, who had always wanted to move ...</i>

640
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:47,003
<i>and had followed her dreams to the U.S.</i>

641
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:51,678
<i>Listening to her talk
brought to mind the image of the mother ...</i>

642
00:46:51,784 --> 00:46:53,979
<i>in the Katzenjammer Kids cartoon.</i>

643
00:46:55,154 --> 00:46:57,384
<i>Ship ahoy, everybody.</i>

644
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,855
<i>What seems to be the good word?</i>

645
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,325
<i>Dere ain't fun !
Everything is befritzed ...</i>

646
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:03,690
<i>und their finger is pinched ...</i>

647
00:47:03,796 --> 00:47:07,493
<i>und their wash is coo-coo
und I got to see der nerve doctor.</i>

648
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,359
<i>I knew what this way
ofbutchering English meant.</i>

649
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,098
<i>The pathetic, tough,
desperately funny fight ...</i>

650
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,175
<i>of the immigrant landing in a culture
which is not his.</i>

651
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,475
<i>There was a ring of Ellis Island
to their story-</i>

652
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,174
<i>Ellis Island revisited 50 years later.</i>

653
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:28,280
<i>It was Chris's energy
which had kept things moving.</i>

654
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,652
<i>Chris, who seemed to be
so central to this story ...</i>

655
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:34,157
<i>and most likely had been behind
their move to California ...</i>

656
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,093
<i>when creditors had come
knocking at their door.</i>

657
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:39,892
<i>This trip cross-country
that they had taken ...</i>

658
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:43,901
<i>sleeping in parking lots at night
because there was no money ...</i>

659
00:47:44,003 --> 00:47:45,994
<i>to end up in San Diego.</i>

660
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:50,063
And that's the only place we could get
when we came back from Phoenix ...

661
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:52,837
because all the rest of'em, uh -

662
00:47:52,945 --> 00:47:55,004
either they wanted that you be employed ...

663
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:57,412
or they want a huge, big deposit -

664
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,576
first month, last month
and maybe, uh, on top of that ...

665
00:48:00,686 --> 00:48:04,554
another deposit, you know, for drapery
and carpet cleaning and all that.

666
00:48:04,657 --> 00:48:06,557
So this was the only thing we could get.

667
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:09,958
We had to sleep four nights in the car
just to get this place here.

668
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:13,688
And we still had to sleep -Without furniture,
we had to sleep on the floor.

669
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,460
On top of that,
'cause we had to buy new furniture.

670
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,932
What makes it work is five years of hardship.

671
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:28,879
Makes it, you know, keep it together.

672
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:32,439
For one thing,
I know if I would leave my family ...

673
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:35,611
I don't think the rest of my family
would be able to survive.

674
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:38,349
Because only we all together as a unit ...

675
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,449
be able to survive whatever, you know,
we've been tossed into.

676
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,460
And we have been in pretty rough times.

677
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:52,762
It's a lot of tension because, see,
the owner is Mexican-American ...

678
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:57,035
and the manager
has immigrated from Mexico.

679
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,339
So, uh,just recently ...

680
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:02,676
about at the end of last year ...

681
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:05,773
when people move out,
they have gotten their own people in.

682
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:09,216
And the last three families
that are left in here ...

683
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,789
they have unluckily all dogs too ...

684
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,790
which they no longer allow.

685
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:15,484
And so they're trying all -

686
00:49:15,594 --> 00:49:18,563
every trick in the book
to get those three families out.

687
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,393
And we have liaisons in here ...

688
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,660
that already have given a 60-day notice ...

689
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:25,168
because they say
it's too many Mexicans around here.

690
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,797
So they are leaving in two months.
They're already looking for something else.

691
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:30,807
Do you want to leave this place?

692
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:34,174
Oh, I sure do. As soon as I get the money.
I would move tomorrow ...

693
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:36,406
if I have the money
to go someplace else.

694
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:38,474
"You gotta move the car
because the trashman is coming. "

695
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,602
And he was not coming.
He was coming the next day.

696
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:44,011
And I had to move the car
just because his royal highness said so.

697
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,281
You know, it seems like he's moved in every-

698
00:50:49,388 --> 00:50:52,186
all the Mexicans -
all his relatives, he's moved in -

699
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,952
every single one of them.

700
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:57,495
But when it comes to us -
I come and visit. I'm from up the street, right?

701
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,326
I come visit her. I have my little dog
to bring for a walk.

702
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,491
He comes in there and kicks my dog out.

703
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,466
- He comes in -
- But he's got a cat.

704
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,094
- Yeah.
- He's got a cat.

705
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:08,139
The owner's in Maryland.

706
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,038
Well, look at me.
I have - I had -The owners were before -

707
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:12,940
- they- uh, new owners, right?
- Yeah.

708
00:51:13,045 --> 00:51:16,105
And he's trying to make me get rid of my dog,
and what am I supposed to do?

709
00:51:16,215 --> 00:51:18,206
My daughter-

710
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:20,751
My daughter put two ads in the paper ...

711
00:51:20,853 --> 00:51:22,718
and no one wants him
because he's too old.

712
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:25,085
- So what am I supposed to do? Put him to sleep?
- Yeah.

713
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,557
- Then they'll probably raise your rent next.
- They already did.

714
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,595
But he, you know,
with this Proposition 13 and all -

715
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:33,790
You know what he did?
He thinks he's slick.

716
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:36,094
He raised the rent.
He said ...

717
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:41,070
<i>"Due to the recent
tax increases and repairs. "</i>

718
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:42,640
See, now we can't get a -

719
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,869
And you know something?
Her toilet up there - I was sitting on the pot ...

720
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,947
and the damn water come
flushing up my butt.

721
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:01,621
<i>Were they having Anglo-German dreams ...</i>

722
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:05,026
<i>like Hans and Fritz,
the Katzenjammer Kids?</i>

723
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:10,899
<i>Ven the cat is away, der mice love to play.</i>

724
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,631
<i>But maybe the cat
is having a good time too.</i>

725
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,573
<i>Where vould ve be
if Columbus didn't discover America?</i>

726
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,338
<i>Vould ve be Eskimos or just Chinks?</i>

727
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:23,539
<i>What vould happen if the Indians
had vent to Europe ...</i>

728
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:25,879
<i>and discovered Columbus?</i>

729
00:52:25,984 --> 00:52:27,952
<i>The vorld is full mit riddles.</i>

730
00:52:45,304 --> 00:52:48,967
They want us to get rid of it.
He carried the thing to the court.

731
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:50,803
We have to react within five days ...

732
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,639
'cause he's probably in the - in the -
in the institution for leukemia ...

733
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:55,736
because he's in Maryland.

734
00:52:55,847 --> 00:53:00,978
So - So, I imagine that, uh,
he's in some sanitarium or something.

735
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:05,221
So what they're trying to do is they're
trying to get the rest of the people out.

736
00:53:05,324 --> 00:53:07,349
- Since we all have a dog -
- He doesn't want us here anyway.

737
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:09,791
- That's right.
- He wants the Chicanos here.

738
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,760
He don't mind, are we paid or not ...

739
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:16,527
but he'd rather have his own kind
even if they don't pay the rent ...

740
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:18,626
when they got no incomes.

741
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,039
So -

742
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,048
The only way you ever get rich in this life ...

743
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:36,677
if you help other people become rich,
and I believe it.

744
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:41,655
<i>If you ever read Napoleon Hill's
How to Become a Millionaire ...</i>

745
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,389
<i>or The Master-Key to Riches,
he tells you all about that.</i>

746
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:49,957
And most of your great successful men
have become wealthy by helping other people.

747
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:54,532
So if you help other people,
you in turn will be helped.

748
00:53:55,073 --> 00:53:57,132
And I feel that way
about the real estate business.

749
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:59,540
You're trying to meet people's needs ...

750
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:04,981
and helping them acquire what they need
to meet their own specific needs.

751
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,881
And it's a challenge.
And I enjoy it.

752
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,387
I fully enjoy the work.

753
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,457
Much more than I ever did accounting.

754
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:23,260
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

755
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:26,769
- Shake your-
- Shake my what off?

756
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:31,432
Or I'll shake your hat off.

757
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,810
I want to shake -
No?

758
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:44,648
What did you just say?

759
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:46,656
Nothing.

760
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:57,361
What?

761
00:54:58,203 --> 00:55:00,433
Why do you want the -

762
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:04,604
We had a training session
at Herbert Hawkins's training class today.

763
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,201
- Mm-hmm?
- And, uh, it was real good.

764
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:10,304
I think I learned a lot.
Uh, I want to practice on you.

765
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:13,350
- Oh, you want me for a guinea pig?
- Yeah, will you play the client ...

766
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:15,647
- and I'll play the salesman?
- Okay.

767
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:19,281
- You're the salesman, all right.
- All right. Uh, let's see.

768
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:21,825
Let's think about a situation.

769
00:55:22,394 --> 00:55:27,491
Okay. We're looking at this house,
and it's a big house.

770
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,328
Mm-hmm. How big?

771
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:31,732
And, uh, well -

772
00:55:31,837 --> 00:55:35,136
You're gonna love this house
because it has seven bathrooms.

773
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,265
And with your, uh -
I mean four bathrooms.

774
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,775
Yeah, because I don't need seven bathrooms.

775
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,369
You have four bathrooms in this house.
You're gonna love it -

776
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:45,143
- Okay. How many-
- because you have four bathrooms in this house.

777
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,241
- How many bedrooms?
- And with your seven kids ...

778
00:55:47,352 --> 00:55:50,014
this'll give all your kids time to use
the bathroom in the morning ...

779
00:55:50,122 --> 00:55:52,613
and also you and your husband
time to get ready for work.

780
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,589
Okay. And how many bedrooms
does it have?

781
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:57,184
- Four.
- Four. Four bedrooms.

782
00:55:57,295 --> 00:56:00,526
- In your opinion -
- Seven kids. It's a little small.

783
00:56:00,632 --> 00:56:03,999
- In your opinion, would it be too small?
- It sure would.

784
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:07,697
I mean, seven kids in four bedrooms?
Uh-uh. It gotta be bigger.

785
00:56:07,806 --> 00:56:10,468
I have another one we could look at,
and it has five bedrooms.

786
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:14,306
Because price is no problem.

787
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,141
- Price is no problem?
- No.

788
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:20,048
And it has to have a swimming pool
because my kids are nuts about swimming.

789
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:22,120
Well, this house - this house has a pool.

790
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,314
- Good, because I won't settle without one.
- And it's only 150,000.

791
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,256
- Hmm. Sounds good. How about a -
- It is a bargain.

792
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,126
- How about a gourmet kitchen?
- Beautiful kitchen. All electric. Total electric.

793
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,063
I also go for a sunken - sunken tub
in the master bedroom.

794
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:37,101
- Sunken tub in the master bedroom?
- Mm-hmm.

795
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:38,692
- It has this.
- It has?

796
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:41,864
- Yeah.
- How about a walk-in closet?

797
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:44,134
Walk-in closets, you have that.

798
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:45,937
Extra powder room?

799
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:47,944
You know, separate for the master suite?

800
00:56:48,046 --> 00:56:49,570
Extra powder room? Well -

801
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:54,880
Or a dressing area, you know,
separate from the, uh - from the bedroom?

802
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:58,217
This could be arranged at a little additional cost.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind that.

803
00:56:58,323 --> 00:57:01,190
Mm-hmm. Okay.
What about landscaping?

804
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,523
- Landscaping is excellent.
- It's excellent?

805
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,826
The prior owner had a landscaper,
and it's just beautiful, well-kept grounds.

806
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:09,696
Have you tested all the plumbing?

807
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,669
Plumbing has to be tested by real estate law.
It has to be in working condition.

808
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:15,740
- It's in working condition.
- At the close of escrow.

809
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:20,301
Because I don't want to move in and later on
I have - end up with a stuffed-up toilet.

810
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,320
Well, I say the value of publicity
always helps in any production ...

811
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,293
or any type of sale of any kind ...

812
00:57:35,393 --> 00:57:39,329
because, uh, it's what the country
was founded on: advertising and publicity.

813
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:43,561
I feel good about it because, uh,
I know the value of publicity.

814
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,602
It can only mean good.

815
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:48,605
Well, not always, because look
what happened to Lindbergh.

816
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:52,743
Oh, I act as my own agent.

817
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,608
And I have this one.

818
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:58,638
- You have this one.
- Well, they come to me.

819
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,650
Like I say, the publicity's laid, so ...

820
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:03,380
naturally, they come to me,
they know the value of the property.

821
00:58:04,256 --> 00:58:06,190
They're not dumb.

822
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,781
They come around.

823
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:11,385
Two weeks ago we had reporters here
from BBC in London.

824
00:58:11,496 --> 00:58:14,431
An this started in July of'77.

825
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,365
And it hasn't died down.

826
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:21,303
<i>But on that mystery
which had brought us together ...</i>

827
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:24,569
<i>I knew that science
had already given its verdict.</i>

828
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,476
<i>Together Elissa and I spent many hours ...</i>

829
00:58:29,581 --> 00:58:31,310
<i>just listening to the videotapes ...</i>

830
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:34,317
<i>trying to translate them into English.</i>

831
00:58:34,419 --> 00:58:38,082
<i>In the first weeks we had a very hard time
understanding anything ...</i>

832
00:58:38,189 --> 00:58:40,919
<i>but as we listened to it
again and again and again ...</i>

833
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:43,551
<i>we gradually could understand their speech.</i>

834
00:58:43,662 --> 00:58:46,062
<i>In part we were aided
because the twins tend to be ...</i>

835
00:58:46,164 --> 00:58:48,530
<i>rather repetitive
in the things that they talk about.</i>

836
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,659
<i>The bulk of the language that they're using ...</i>

837
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,362
<i>appears to be English.</i>

838
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:54,995
<i>What they seem to be doing ...</i>

839
00:58:55,106 --> 00:58:59,566
<i>is producing a lot of distortions
in the normal sound patterns of English.</i>

840
00:58:59,678 --> 00:59:04,706
<i>Once you, uh, ignore the sound changes
that they're producing ...</i>

841
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:08,183
<i>um, the syntax is English ...</i>

842
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:12,950
<i>with some kinds of constructions
that they don't seem to have mastered.</i>

843
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,987
<i>Their output, it varies tremendously
from one time to the next ...</i>

844
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:04,899
<i>and that variation-
it's not really systematic  ...</i>

845
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:07,699
<i>uh, in the sense that they'll always make  ...</i>

846
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:10,536
<i>the same changes
from the appropriate English word.</i>

847
01:01:10,642 --> 01:01:13,839
<i>All of these phonological distortions
or transformations ...</i>

848
01:01:13,945 --> 01:01:15,776
<i>which are characteristic of their speech ...</i>

849
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,711
<i>are of a probabilistic nature.</i>

850
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:22,082
<i>It's the fact that these transformations
are very probabilistic  ...</i>

851
01:01:22,187 --> 01:01:24,712
<i>which makes their speech
so densely unintelligible.</i>

852
01:01:24,823 --> 01:01:27,519
<i>So, in this one example,
for instance, of "potato"  ...</i>

853
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:31,083
<i>they have enormous amount of variation
in the way they say that.</i>

854
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,454
<i>I don't think, uh, there's good reason to say  ...</i>

855
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:11,365
<i>that the variation which I find in doing
phonetic transcriptions of their speech ...</i>

856
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:14,165
<i>necessarily indicates invention.</i>

857
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,038
<i>It may be that their phonological system
hasn't crystallized  ...</i>

858
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:22,170
<i>to the extent that they're capable of
producing a consistent output  ...</i>

859
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,339
<i>or they-</i>

860
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,508
<i>We don't know.
They may not hear things  ...</i>

861
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:30,213
<i>and their processing of auditory information
may not be perfect.</i>

862
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:32,482
<i>We don't know really
about these things yet.</i>

863
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,559
<i>But I have no reason to say that-
right now at least-</i>

864
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,892
<i>no reason to say that they are being
purposefully inventive in the speech.</i>

865
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:43,559
<i>It doesn't appear to be,
uh, an invented language.</i>

866
01:02:44,102 --> 01:02:46,093
Oh, I see a great future for the girls.

867
01:02:46,204 --> 01:02:48,604
Uh, maybe not Shirley Temple status ...

868
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:50,936
but in the long run
it'll be beneficial to 'em ...

869
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:53,738
and I think it already has been
beneficial in a lot of aspects ...

870
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:56,678
because it's brought 'em out of
a lot of their shyness ...

871
01:02:56,781 --> 01:02:58,442
a lot of their introvertedness.

872
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,211
They're more extroverted now.

873
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,445
Uh, they're more open with people.

874
01:03:02,554 --> 01:03:06,320
Uh, at one time they were even
a little bit leery of all strangers ...

875
01:03:06,424 --> 01:03:10,656
but now when they have so many people
around constantly, most of the time ...

876
01:03:10,762 --> 01:03:13,526
uh, they accept people,
and this is good ...

877
01:03:13,631 --> 01:03:15,599
because it can only help them
when they, uh ...

878
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,691
go into the business world as adults.

879
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,104
<i>So the mystery was solved ...</i>

880
01:03:21,206 --> 01:03:23,697
<i>but I knew that the story wasn't finished  ...</i>

881
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:27,266
<i>and I was left with a question.:</i>

882
01:03:27,378 --> 01:03:29,209
<i>What was going to happen to them?</i>

883
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:37,620
<i>Six months later,
the Kennedys had left Linda Vista.</i>

884
01:03:37,722 --> 01:03:42,489
<i>They had moved to a bigger house in Mira Mesa,
near Miramar air force base.</i>

885
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:47,588
<i>It was one of these new tract housing districts
popping up in the wastelands of San Diego.</i>

886
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:50,794
<i>With the money of the film,
they had bought a used Cadillac ...</i>

887
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:54,030
<i>and I remember how
my European values were shaken ...</i>

888
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:58,666
<i>when I discovered that Cadillacs were now
the cars of the ghettos -black and white.</i>

889
01:04:20,365 --> 01:04:23,493
<i>I knew the look that Tom had on his face.</i>

890
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,398
<i>He looked battered.</i>

891
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,738
Well, we moved in, uh, September.

892
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,741
September the 1 st
we moved, uh, to the house here.

893
01:04:31,843 --> 01:04:33,811
- The 4th.
- Oh, the 4th? Was it the 4th?

894
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,345
The Labor weekend.

895
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:38,608
Well, first part of September then.

896
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,211
We decided we would like
to get a bigger place ...

897
01:04:45,323 --> 01:04:47,814
uh, one that would be
more accommodating to the whole family.

898
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,689
Uh, this way the girls have a -
each have a bedroom of their own ...

899
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:53,286
and their grandmother has a room,
and we have our bedroom ...

900
01:04:53,398 --> 01:04:56,697
so we're not so congested as we were
in the old place.

901
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,797
And, uh,
I think it's much better for the family.

902
01:04:59,904 --> 01:05:02,270
We've got a bigger yard
for the girls to play in.

903
01:05:07,045 --> 01:05:08,979
Oh, I think it's been - been much better.

904
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,449
Um, we, uh -we enjoy living up here
much better than we did in the old place, and so -

905
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,519
- Oh, yeah.
- We, uh -

906
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,783
The girls are making
wonderful progress in, uh - in school.

907
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:20,858
We just had a teacher with a -

908
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,926
a conference with their teachers
last month ...

909
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:26,588
and they both say they're making
wonderful progress, splendid.

910
01:05:27,565 --> 01:05:31,092
So we're -we're well pleased with the way
things have been going recently for us -

911
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:33,102
for the family, for the girls.

912
01:05:35,273 --> 01:05:37,901
Real estate is a little bit slow right now
because of the holidays ...

913
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:40,170
and high interest rates ...

914
01:05:40,278 --> 01:05:42,405
uh, priced a lot of people out of the market ...

915
01:05:42,513 --> 01:05:45,505
but hopefully it'll pick up again
around January ...

916
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:47,811
or the first part of next year.

917
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:52,248
<i>Chris was clinging
to a dream that my filming had reinforced.</i>

918
01:05:53,057 --> 01:05:56,959
So far we have managed.
Then we also hope that, uh ...

919
01:05:57,061 --> 01:06:00,292
since the movie people ...

920
01:06:00,398 --> 01:06:03,265
that they are negotiating with -
they have a 90-day option.

921
01:06:03,368 --> 01:06:05,529
So the 90 days are almost over.

922
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:10,801
I think by the end of this - this month
they have to make a final decision on it.

923
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:14,207
And since it already has been mentioned
on national television ...

924
01:06:14,312 --> 01:06:16,746
<i>on the America Alive show ...</i>

925
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,181
the next day they had forgotten
that the day when we were interviewed ...

926
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:24,015
that there was a negotiation
about a movie in the making ...

927
01:06:24,122 --> 01:06:26,920
and so they have -
they mentioned it the next day ...

928
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:31,654
so we're pretty certain that, uh,
it's only a matter of maybe a few weeks or so ...

929
01:06:31,763 --> 01:06:33,958
that anything gonna come out of that.

930
01:06:34,065 --> 01:06:36,431
So there would be financial help also in it ...

931
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:41,801
<i>that kind of gets us over a slack time
mit the real estate business and so on.</i>

932
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:45,842
So, so far we have managed pretty good,
and I think we will too.

933
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:30,577
<i>Gracie and Ginny had their own rooms.</i>

934
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:34,291
<i>Their chatter seemed lost in this big house.</i>

935
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,051
<i>Tom and Chris had made their move ...</i>

936
01:08:02,153 --> 01:08:05,418
<i>because more than anyone
they had bought the media fairy tale.</i>

937
01:08:05,523 --> 01:08:08,492
<i>But Gracie and Ginny
were not front-page news anymore.</i>

938
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:11,657
<i>The media did not care to follow up
on this story ...</i>

939
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:14,492
<i>that they had distorted so much
in the first place.</i>

940
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:17,226
<i>The twins had lost their language ...</i>

941
01:08:17,335 --> 01:08:20,031
<i>and were each day more in tune
with the real world.</i>

942
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:22,831
<i>I got the sense that
at the end of this story ...</i>

943
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,704
<i>everybody in this family
would be left high and dry.</i>

944
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,040
Now come do your job.

945
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,217
Please stand up.

946
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:38,778
Hey!

947
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:43,558
That's okay. He's not hurting anybody.

948
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,128
Really?

949
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:47,195
Okay.

950
01:08:47,298 --> 01:08:49,198
Put your right hand over your heart.

951
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:54,965
I pledge allegiance to the flag ...

952
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:57,836
of the United States of America ...

953
01:08:57,942 --> 01:09:01,605
and to the republic for which it stands ...

954
01:09:01,712 --> 01:09:04,203
one nation under God ...

955
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:08,445
indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

956
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:11,613
" My country, 'tis of thee ...

957
01:09:11,722 --> 01:09:14,782
Sweet land of liberty ...

958
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:17,690
Of thee I sing ...

959
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:20,992
Land where my fathers died ...

960
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:24,295
Land of the pilgrims' pride ...

961
01:09:24,402 --> 01:09:27,701
From every mountainside ...

962
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:30,171
Let freedom ring."

963
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,174
Please sit down.

964
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:36,039
Gracie and Aaron were not singing.

965
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:42,952
Okay? Make you a deal,
when we come back, you better sing ...

966
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:46,490
on Monday after vacation,
or you'll be singing by yourself.

967
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,998
<i>Two blocks away,
Ginny was going to another school.</i>

968
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,763
<i>Therapists and educators
had decided to separate them.</i>

969
01:09:59,971 --> 01:10:03,634
<i>They would rely less on each other,
and it would help their progress.</i>

970
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,938
Okay, talk, Ginny. Okay?

971
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:12,748
Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick ...

972
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:17,844
Jack jump over the candlestick.

973
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:23,154
He jumped high,
he jumped low.

974
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,026
He jumped over and burned his toe.

975
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,236
My hopes for the future is that, uh ...

976
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:37,000
we'll, uh ...

977
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:41,704
improve, and the girls will improve,
and, uh ...

978
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:45,145
we, uh, just want to stay together
and be - be a family.

979
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:47,308
We're a real close-knit family.

980
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:50,546
And, uh, I can see a wonderful future
for the girls ...

981
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:55,524
if, well, they continue making
the rapid progress that they are doing now.

982
01:10:56,394 --> 01:10:59,192
And I think they'll develop wonderfully.

983
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:18,246
<i>Three months later,
the Kennedys couldn't meet their rent.</i>

984
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:21,443
<i>In all this time,
Tom had only sold one house ...</i>

985
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:24,544
<i>and had to split the commission
with three other salesmen.</i>

986
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:27,282
<i>There was no money for gas.</i>

987
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,655
<i>He couldn't make the rounds anymore.</i>

988
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,490
<i>The twins stopped going to therapy.</i>

989

<i>Chris told me that she wished
miracles would grow on trees.</i>
