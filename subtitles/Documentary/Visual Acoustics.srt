00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:19,093
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked

3
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,500
"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders?

4
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
They don't wash their hands before they eat!"

5
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Jesus replied,

6
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,900
"And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?

7
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
For God said, 'Honor your father and mother'

8
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'

9
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,500
But you say that if a man says to his father or mother,

10
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'

11
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:51,526
he is not to 'honor his father' with it.

12
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

13
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
You hypocrites!

14
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:

15
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,700
" 'These people honor me with their lips,

16
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,900
but their hearts are far from me.

17
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,700
They worship me in vain;

18
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,200
their teachings are but rules taught by men.

19
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
Jesus called the crowd to him and said,

20
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,000
"Listen and understand.

21
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,500
What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,'

22
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.' "

23
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
Then the disciples came to him and asked,

24
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"

25
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
He replied,

26
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,300
"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.

27
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Leave them; they are blind guides.

28
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,900
If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."

29
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Peter said,

30
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,700
"Explain the parable to us."

31
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them.

32
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
"Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?

33
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,000
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart,

34
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
and these make a man 'unclean.'

35
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,000
For out of the heart come evil thoughts,

36
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:27,106
murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.

37
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
These are what make a man 'unclean';

38
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,000
but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.' "

39
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,200
Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

40
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,900
A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out,

41
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,500
"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me!

42
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:09,008
My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."

43
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,500
Jesus did not answer a word.

44
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,200
So his disciples came to him and urged him,

45
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,800
"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."

46
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:24,065
He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."

47
00:14:26,000 --> 00:-10:-40,-300
He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."

48
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,000
The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said.

49
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,500
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."

50
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,500
"Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."

51
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,500
Then Jesus answered,

52
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,700
"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted."

53
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,500
And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

54
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,300
Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee.

55
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,700
Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.

56
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
Great crowds came to him,

57
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,000
bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others,

58
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,000
and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.

59
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,300
The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking,

60
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,000
the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing.

61
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And they praised the God of Israel.

62
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,500
Jesus called his disciples to him and said,

63
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
"I have compassion for these people;

64
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,800
they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.

65
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,500
I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."

66
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
His disciples answered,

67
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"

68
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked.

69
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,900
"Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."

70
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.

71
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,500
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish,

72
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:30,783
and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples,

73
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
and they in turn to the people.

74
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
They all ate and were satisfied.

75
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,000
Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

76
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,300
The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children.

77
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,500
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.

78
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,100
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him

79
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,800
by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.

80
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,200
He replied,

81
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,000
"When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'

82
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,200
and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.

83
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky,

84
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,800
but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.

85
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,500
A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it

86
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,700
except the sign of Jonah."

87
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,800
Jesus then left them and went away.

88
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.

89
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
"Be careful," Jesus said to them.

90
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,800
"Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."

91
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
They discussed this among themselves and said,

92
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
"It is because we didn't bring any bread."

93
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked,

94
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:37,000
"You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?

95
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,500
Do you still not understand?

96
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,865
Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand,

97
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:45,146
and how many basketfuls you gathered?

98
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:48,971
Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?

99
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:56,577
How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread?

100
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:02,673
But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."

101
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread,

102
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,500
but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

103
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,940
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,

104
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
"Who do people say the Son of Man is?"

105
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,700
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist;

106
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,300
others say Elijah;

107
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,800
and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."

108
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,500
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"

109
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,300
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

110
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
Jesus replied,

111
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,900
"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah,

112
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,938
for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.

113
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,000
And I tell you that you are Peter,

114
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,300
and on this rock I will build my church,

115
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,700
and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.

116
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,000
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven;

117
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,

118
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,800
and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

119
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.

120
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,000
From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples

121
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,400
that he must go to Jerusalem

122
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,500
and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law,

123
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:28,300
and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.

124
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.

125
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,646
"Never, Lord!" he said.
"This shall never happen to you!"

126
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,500
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan!

127
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,500
You are a stumbling block to me;

128
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:57,385
you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."

129
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,400
Then Jesus said to his disciples,

130
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself

131
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
and take up his cross and follow me.

132
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,500
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it,

133
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,900
but whoever loses his life for me will find it.

134
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,500
What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?

135
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

136
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,000
For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels,

137
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,000
and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.

138
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I tell you the truth, some who are standing here

139
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,600
will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

140
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,500
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James,

141
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and led them up a high mountain by themselves.

142
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,500
There he was transfigured before them.

143
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,700
His face shone like the sun, and his clothesbecame as white as the light.

144
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.

145
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,000
Peter said to Jesus,

146
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
"Lord, it is good for us to be here.

147
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,000
If you wish, I will put up three shelters—

148
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,000
one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."

149
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them,

150
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
and a voice from the cloud said,

151
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,000
"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"

152
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.

153
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:57,500
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said."Don't be afraid."

154
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,500
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.

155
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,800
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them,

156
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
"Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."

157
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,600
The disciples asked him,?"

158
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,500
"Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first

159
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,900
Jesus replied,

160
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,800
"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.

161
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,500
But I tell you, Elijah has already come,

162
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished.

163
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,500
In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."

164
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.

165
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.

166
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,500
"Lord, have mercy on my son," he said. "He has seizures and is suffering greatly.

167
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,000
He often falls into the fire or into the water.

168
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."

169
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,300
"O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied,

170
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,500
"how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?

171
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Bring the boy here to me."

172
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,600
Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy,

173
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,000
and he was healed from that moment.

174
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,300
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked,

175
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,400
"Why couldn't we drive it out?"

176
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
He replied, "Because you have so little faith.

177
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
I tell you the truth,

178
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,900
if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain,

179
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,800
'Move from here to there' and it will move.

180
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,600
Nothing will be impossible for you."

181
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
(But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.)

182
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,500
When they came together in Galilee, he said to them,

183
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,300
"The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.

184
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,600
They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life."

185
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,600
And the disciples were filled with grief.

186
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,600
After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum,

187
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,872
the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked,

188
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,900
"Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"

189
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
"Yes, he does," he replied.

190
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,600
When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak.

191
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
"What do you think, Simon?" he asked.

192
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
"From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—

193
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
from their own sons or from others?"

194
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
"From others," Peter answered.

195
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,600
"Then the sons are exempt," Jesus said to him.

196
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,600
"But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line.

197
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,100
Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin.

198
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."

199
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked,

200
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"

201
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,600
He called a little child and had him stand among them.

202
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,200
And he said: "I tell you the truth,

203
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:19,375
unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

204
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,800
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

205
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,800
"And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me

206
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,600
But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,

207
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,000
it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.

208
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,000
"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin!

209
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,100
Such things must come,

210
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
but woe to the man through whom they come!

211
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:19,100
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.

212
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,000
It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled

213
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:28,040
than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

214
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,000
And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.

215
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,400
It is better for you to enter life with one eye

216
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:41,449
than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

217
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,100
"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones.

218
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,600
For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.

219
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,600
(The Son of Man came to save what was lost.)

220
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
"What do you think?

221
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,600
If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away,

222
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?

223
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,100
And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep

224
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:25,878
than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.

225
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
In the same way your Father in heaven

226
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,044
is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.

227
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,600
"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you.

228
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,100
If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.

229
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:53,600
But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'

230
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,100
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church;

231
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,500
and if he refuses to listen even to the church,

232
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,014
treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

233
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,300
"I tell you the truth,

234
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,000
whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,

235
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,600
and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

236
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
"Again, I tell you

237
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,600
that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for,

238
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.

239
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,400
For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."

240
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,100
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,

241
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,200
"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me?

242
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,100
Up to seven times?"

243
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,300
Jesus answered,

244
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,600
"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

245
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,300
"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king

246
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

247
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,600
As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.

248
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children

249
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,761
and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.

250
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,300
"The servant fell on his knees before him.

251
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,600
'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'

252
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,000
The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.

253
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,000
"But when that servant went out,

254
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:48,084
he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii.

255
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,500
He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded.

256
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,100
"The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'

257
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,300
"But he refused. Instead, he went off

258
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,460
and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.

259
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed

260
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,800
and went and told their master everything that had happened.

261
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,900
"Then the master called the servant in.

262
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,200
'You wicked servant,' he said,

263
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,200
'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.

264
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,300
Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'

265
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,700
In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured,

266
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:03,219
until he should pay back all he owed.

267
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you

268
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
unless you forgive your brother from your heart."

269
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee

270
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,000
and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.

271
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,400
Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.

272
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,700
Some Pharisees came to him to test him.

273
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,200
They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"

274
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
"Haven't you read," he replied,

275
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:05,641
"that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'

276
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,500
and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,

277
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,500
and the two will become one flesh'?

278
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So they are no longer two, but one.

279
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,800
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."

280
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
"Why then," they asked,

281
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:29,500
"did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"

282
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,900
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard.

283
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,000
But it was not this way from the beginning.

284
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,500
I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery."

285
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The disciples said to him,

286
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:51,062
"If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."

287
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,600
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.

288
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
For some are eunuchs because they were born that way;

289
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,000
others were made that way by men;

290
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven.

291
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,300
The one who can accept this should accept it."

292
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,500
Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them.

293
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,900
But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.

294
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,500
Jesus said,

295
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,700
"Let the little children come to me,

296
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:40,743
and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."

297
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,600
When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.

298
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Now a man came up to Jesus and asked,

299
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
"Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"

300
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,000
"Why do you ask me about what is good?"

301
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good.

302
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,300
If you want to enter life, obey the commandments."

303
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
"Which ones?" the man inquired.

304
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Jesus replied, " 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,

305
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,100
honor your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"

306
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,000
"All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"

307
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,300
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor,

308
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,500
and you will have treasure in heaven.Then come, follow me."

309
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,200
When the young man heard this, he went away sad,

310
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,900
because he had great wealth.

311
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Then Jesus said to his disciples,

312
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:14,500
"I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

313
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,900
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

314
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,500
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,

315
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
"Who then can be saved?"

316
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,200
Jesus looked at them and said,

317
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,000
"With man this is impossible,

318
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,500
but with God all things are possible."

319
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,500
Peter answered him,

320
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,800
"We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"

321
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,

322
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,400
at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne,

323
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:09,000
you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

324
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:18,300
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake

325
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,500
will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.

326
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,500
But many who are first will be last,

327
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,500
and many who are last will be first.

328
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,500
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner

329
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,500
who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.

330
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.

331
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,500
"About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.

332
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,800
He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.'

333
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:07,553
So they went.

334
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,500
He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.

335
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,000
About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around.

336
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,500
He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'

337
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.

338
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
"He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'

339
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,

340
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,900
'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'

341
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,500
"The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.

342
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,500
So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more.

343
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
But each one of them also received a denarius.

344
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,500
When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.

345
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,000
'These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said,

346
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,500
'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'

347
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,500
"But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unfair to you.

348
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,500
Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

349
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Take your pay and go.

350
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you.

351
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money?

352
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,600
Or are you envious because I am generous?'

353
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,500
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last."

354
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,500
(for many be called, but few chosen.)

355
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,600
Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them,

356
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,800
"We are going up to Jerusalem,

357
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,200
and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.

358
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,000
They will condemn him to death

359
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,200
and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked

360
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
and flogged

361
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,500
and crucified.

362
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,500
On the third day he will be raised to life!"

363
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.

364
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
"What is it you want?" he asked.

365
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:41,500
She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom."

366
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,500
"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them.

367
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,500
"Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?"

368
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,200
"We can," they answered.

369
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,000
Jesus said to them,

370
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,500
"You will indeed drink from my cup,
(and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with:)

371
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,500
but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.

372
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,820
These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."

373
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.

374
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
Jesus called them together and said,

375
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,900
"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,

376
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,000
and their high officials exercise authority over them.

377
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,800
Not so with you.

378
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,000
Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,

379
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,500
and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—

380
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,500
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,

381
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
and to give his life as a ransom for many."

382
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,500
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.

383
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted,

384
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,500
"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"

385
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,500
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet,

386
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,200
but they shouted all the louder,

387
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,000
"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"

388
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,500
Jesus stopped and called them.

389
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,000
"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.

390
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,000
"Lord," they answered, "we want our sight."

391
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,200
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes.

392
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,000
Immediately they received their sight and followed him.

393
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,200
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives,

394
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,900
Jesus sent two disciples,

395
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,300
saying to them:"Go to the village ahead of you,

396
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,700
and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her.

397
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:42,991
Untie them and bring them to me.

398
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:49,000
If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away."

399
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,500
This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:

400
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,500
"Say to the Daughter of Zion,
'See, your king comes to you,

401
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,287
gentle and riding on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' "

402
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,500
The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.

403
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,300
They brought the donkey and the colt,

404
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,000
placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.

405
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,000
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,

406
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,500
while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

407
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,800
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,

408
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,800
"Hosanna to the Son of David!"

409
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,500
"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"

410
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,300
"Hosanna in the highest!"

411
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:45,000
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"

412
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:51,500
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."

413
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,083
Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there.

414
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

415
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:37,000
"It is written," he said to them, " 'My house will be called a house of prayer,'

416
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,000
but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'"

417
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,500
The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.

418
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:15,700
But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did

419
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:22,300
and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.

420
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,500
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him

421
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,000
"Yes," replied Jesus,

422
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:49,000
"have you never read," 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"

423
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,500
And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.

424
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.

425
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,200
Seeing a fig tree by the road,

426
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,400
he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves.

427
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,700
Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.

428
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed.

429
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,000
"How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.

430
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,600
Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth,

431
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
if you have faith and do not doubt,

432
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,500
not only can you do what was done to the fig tree,

433
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:47,000
but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.

434
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:54,000
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."

435
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,400
Jesus entered the temple courts,

436
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,700
and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him.

437
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,500
"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"

438
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,500
Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question.

439
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

440
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:28,000
John's baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?"

441
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,200
They discussed it among themselves and said,

442
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,000
"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'

443
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But if we say, 'From men'—we are afraid of the people,

444
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,000
for they all hold that John was a prophet."

445
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,200
So they answered Jesus, "We don't know."

446
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,600
Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

447
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,500
"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons.

448
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,300
He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'

449
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,300
" 'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.

450
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
"Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing.

451
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,000
He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.

452
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
"Which of the two did what his father wanted?"

453
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,000
"The first," they answered.

454
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth,

455
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,500
the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.

456
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,200
For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him,

457
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,500
but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did.

458
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,000
And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

459
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
"Listen to another parable:

460
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,600
There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.

461
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,200
He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower.

462
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,500
Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.

463
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,500
When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.

464
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,500
"The tenants seized his servants;

465
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,500
they beat one,

466
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,500
killed another,

467
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,500
and stoned a third.

468
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time,

469
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
and the tenants treated them the same way.

470
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.

471
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,500
"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir.

472
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,400
Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'

473
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,400
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

474
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"

475
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,200
"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied,

476
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,300
"and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants,

477
01:04:10,568 --> 01:04:14,268
who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."

478
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,500
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures:

479
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,300
" 'The stone the builders rejected
has become the capstone;

480
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,800
the Lord has done this,
and it is marvelous in our eyes'?

481
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,300
"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you

482
01:04:32,644 --> 01:04:35,844
and given to a people who will produce its fruit.

483
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,500
He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces,

484
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,400
but he on whom it falls will be crushed."

485
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables,

486
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,500
they knew he was talking about them.

487
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,300
They looked for a way to arrest him,

488
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,000
but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.

489
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,600
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:

490
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,000
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king

491
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,000
who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.

492
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,500
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come,

493
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
but they refused to come.

494
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,200
"Then he sent some more servants and said,

495
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,500
'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner:

496
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,000
My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered,

497
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,300
and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'

498
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,200
"But they paid no attention and went off—

499
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,000
one to his field,

500
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,000
another to his business.

501
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:23,800
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.

502
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,800
The king was enraged. He sent his army

503
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,500
and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

504
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:44,300
"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready,

505
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,100
but those I invited did not deserve to come.

506
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
Go to the street corners

507
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:55,000
and invite to the banquet anyone you find.'

508
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,500
So the servants went out into the streets

509
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:08,500
and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad,

510
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,700
and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

511
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,800
"But when the king came in to see the guests,

512
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,500
he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.

513
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,800
'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?'

514
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,500
The man was speechless.

515
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,500
"Then the king told the attendants,

516
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,500
'Tie him hand and foot,

517
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:05,900
and throw him outside, into the darkness,

518
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,100
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

519
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:22,500
"For many are invited, but few are chosen."

520
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,100
Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.

521
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,500
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians.

522
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,800
"Teacher," they said,

523
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:47,650
"we know you are a man of integrity

524
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:52,705
and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

525
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,200
You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.

526
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Tell us then, what is your opinion?

527
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:10,900
Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"

528
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,500
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said,

529
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,200
"You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?

530
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,500
Show me the coin used for paying the tax.

531
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,700
" They brought him a denarius,

532
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,700
and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"

533
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,500
"Caesar's," they replied.

534
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:47,900
Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."

535
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,500
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.

536
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:07,500
That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.

537
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
"Teacher," they said,

538
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:16,300
"Moses told us that if a man dies without having children,

539
01:10:16,942 --> 01:10:21,342
his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.

540
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,000
Now there were seven brothers among us.

541
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:33,000
The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.

542
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:40,000
The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.

543
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,000
Finally, the woman died.

544
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,500
Now then, at the resurrection,

545
01:10:47,602 --> 01:10:52,602
whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"

546
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.

547
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:18,000
At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage;

548
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,000
they will be like the angels in heaven.

549
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,200
But about the resurrection of the dead—

550
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
have you not read what God said to you,

551
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,200
'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?

552
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,500
He is not the God of the dead but of the living."

553
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

554
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,900
Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.

555
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:59,300
One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:

556
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,700
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

557
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,200
Jesus replied:

558
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,000
" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'

559
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,900
This is the first and greatest commandment.

560
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,000
And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'

561
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,300
All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

562
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,000
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

563
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,400
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"

564
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,800
"The son of David," they replied.

565
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,500
He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'?

566
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,700
For he says,

567
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:48,300
" 'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand  until I put your enemies under your feet." '

568
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,500
If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"

569
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,900
No one could say a word in reply,

570
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,000
and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.

571
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,500
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:

572
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:17,700
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.

573
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,800
So you must obey them and do everything they tell you.

574
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:33,559
But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.

575
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders,

576
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,300
but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.

577
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,300
"Everything they do is done for men to see:

578
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;

579
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,500
they love the place of honor at banquets

580
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,300
and the most important seats in the synagogues;

581
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,870
they love to be greeted in the marketplaces

582
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and to have men call them 'Rabbi.'

583
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,100
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,'

584
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,500
for you have only one Master

585
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,500
and you are all brothers.

586
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,000
And do not call anyone on earth 'father,'

587
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.

588
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:44,000
Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ.

589
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,600
The greatest among you will be your servant.

590
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:00,000
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

591
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

592
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,000
You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces.

593
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,500
You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.

594
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

595
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You travel over land and sea to win a single convert,

596
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,500
and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.

597
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,000
"Woe to you, blind guides!

598
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,500
You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing;

599
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,200
but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'

600
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
You blind fools!

601
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:11,000
Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?

602
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,700
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing;

603
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:21,900
but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.'

604
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,200
You blind men!

605
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:31,500
Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

606
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,200
Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.

607
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,000
And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.

608
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:54,000
And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.

609
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:08,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

610
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cummin.

611
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,600
But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—

612
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
justice, mercy and faithfulness.

613
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,500
You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.

614
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,500
You blind guides!

615
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,000
You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.

616
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! .

617
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You clean the outside of the cup and dish,

618
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,900
but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

619
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,200
Blind Pharisee!

620
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,300
First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean

621
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

622
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,400
You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside

623
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.

624
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous

625
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:52,000
but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

626
01:18:54,700 --> 01:19:03,000
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

627
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,900
You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.

628
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,700
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers,

629
01:19:13,758 --> 01:19:18,758
we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'

630
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,600
So you testify against yourselves

631
01:19:23,668 --> 01:19:27,268
that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.

632
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:35,500
Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers!

633
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,300
"You snakes!You brood of vipers!

634
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
How will you escape being condemned to hell?

635
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,300
Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers.

636
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,500
Some of them you will kill and crucify;

637
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:12,200
others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.

638
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:20,300
And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth,

639
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,200
from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah,

640
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:32,300
whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

641
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:42,500
I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation.

642
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,500
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,

643
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,100
you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you,

644
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:31,100
how often I have longed to gather your children together,

645
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:36,150
as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.

646
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,500
Look, your house is left to you desolate.

647
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,300
For I tell you, you

648
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,300
will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'

649
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,400
Jesus left the temple and was walking away

650
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,300
when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.

651
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,700
"Do you see all these things?" he asked.

652
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:58,300
"I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."

653
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:15,100
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately.

654
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:25,400
"Tell us," they said, "when will this happen,

655
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:31,012
and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"

656
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,900
Jesus answered:

657
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,300
"Watch out that no one deceives you.

658
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:49,300
For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,'

659
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,300
and will deceive many.

660
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,800
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars,

661
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,300
but see to it that you are not alarmed.

662
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,300
Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.

663
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,300
but the end is still to come.

664
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,000
Nation will rise against nation,

665
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,300
and kingdom against kingdom.

666
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,500
There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.

667
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,000
All these are the beginning of birth pains.

668
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:44,900
"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death,

669
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,800
and you will be hated by all nations because of me.

670
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,800
At that time many will turn away from the faith

671
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,600
and will betray and hate each other,

672
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:20,500
and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.

673
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,000
Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,

674
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,900
but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.

675
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:37,500
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations,

676
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,300
and then the end will come.

677
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:48,200
"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,'[b] spoken of through the prophet Daniel—

678
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,300
let the reader understand—

679
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,800
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

680
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,500
Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house.

681
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,300
Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.

682
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:09,200
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

683
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,300
Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath

684
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:20,500
For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—

685
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,981
and never to be equaled again.

686
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,700
If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive,

687
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:36,500
but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.

688
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,400
At that time if anyone says to you,

689
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,200
'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it

690
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,100
For false Christs and false prophets will appear

691
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,500
and perform great signs and miracles

692
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,800
to deceive even the elect—if that were possible.

693
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,600
See, I have told you ahead of time.

694
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:28,800
"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out;

695
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:33,900
or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.

696
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:40,300
For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west,

697
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,500
so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

698
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,300
Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.

699
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,900
"Immediately after the distress of those days " 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;

700
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,800
the stars will fall from the sky,

701
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,700
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'

702
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,000
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky,

703
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,800
and all the nations of the earth will mourn.

704
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:19,800
They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.

705
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,300
And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call,

706
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,300
and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

707
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,300
"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree:

708
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,700
As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out,

709
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,000
you know that summer is near.

710
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Even so, when you see all these things,

711
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,600
you know that it is near, right at the door.

712
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,300
I tell you the truth,

713
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:53,100
this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

714
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:01,000
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

715
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,900
"No one knows about that day or hour,

716
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:09,800
not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

717
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,800
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

718
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,900
For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking,

719
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:24,500
marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;

720
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,900
and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.

721
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,600
That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

722
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:42,100
Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.

723
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,900
Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.

724
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:55,010
"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

725
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:04,700
But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming,

726
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:09,400
he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.

727
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,600
So you also must be ready,

728
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,100
because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.

729
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,900
"Who then is the faithful and wise servant,

730
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,100
whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household

731
01:30:26,186 --> 01:30:28,186
to give them their food at the proper time?

732
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,900
It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.

733
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,100
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

734
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,400
But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself,

735
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
'My master is staying away a long time,'

736
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,600
and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.

737
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,900
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him

738
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,582
and at an hour he is not aware of.

739
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,400
He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites,

740
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,600
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

741
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,600
"At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins

742
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:23,989
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

743
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,200
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.

744
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,000
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.

745
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:43,600
The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.

746
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:49,600
The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

747
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,600
"At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'

748
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,100
"Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.

749
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,600
The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'

750
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,700
" 'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you.

751
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,200
Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'

752
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:21,100
"But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived.

753
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,100
The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet.

754
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:29,100
And the door was shut.

755
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:36,100
"Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'

756
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:45,100
"But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.'

757
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:58,100
"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

758
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:15,100
"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.

759
01:33:20,532 --> 01:33:22,332
To one he gave five talents of money,

760
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:24,542
to another two talents, and to another one talent,

761
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,900
each according to his ability.

762
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:32,100
Then he went on his journey.

763
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:39,600
The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more.

764
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:43,300
So also, the one with the two talents gained two more.

765
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,800
But the man who had received the one talent went off,

766
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,998
dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

767
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:00,100
"After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.

768
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:09,100
The man who had received the five talents brought the other five.

769
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:15,500
'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.'

770
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,300
"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant!

771
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:23,300
You have been faithful with a few things;

772
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,900
Come and share your master's happiness!'

773
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:30,900
"The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said,

774
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:35,900
'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.'

775
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,600
"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant!

776
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:47,100
You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things

777
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,100
Come and share your master's happiness!'

778
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,100
"Then the man who had received the one talent came.

779
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,900
'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man,

780
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,900
harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.

781
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,100
So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground.

782
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,600
See, here is what belongs to you.'

783
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,500
"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant!

784
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:21,100
So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?

785
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:27,600
Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers,

786
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:32,100
so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

787
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:39,500
'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.

788
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:54,100
For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance.

789
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:59,300
Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.

790
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:03,800
And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness,

791
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:09,065
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

792
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:17,600
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,

793
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,600
he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.

794
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,100
All the nations will be gathered before him,

795
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,400
and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

796
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,100
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

797
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,100
"Then the King will say to those on his right,

798
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:53,600
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.

799
01:36:55,100 --> 01:37:01,100
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat,

800
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,600
I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,

801
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,400
I was a stranger and you invited me in,

802
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,600
I needed clothes and you clothed me,

803
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:19,100
I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'

804
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:28,100
"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,

805
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:32,200
or thirsty and give you something to drink?

806
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,100
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?

807
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,600
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'

808
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,800
The King will reply,

809
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,900
'I tell you the truth,

810
01:37:52,100 --> 01:38:00,100
whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'

811
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:14,500
"Then he will say to those on his left,

812
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:30,200
'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

813
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:37,100
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat,

814
01:38:37,308 --> 01:38:41,108
I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,

815
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,400
I was a stranger and you did not invite me in,

816
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,900
I needed clothes and you did not clothe me,

817
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:56,600
I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'

818
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:04,300
"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry

819
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:11,500
or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'

820
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:19,100
"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth,

821
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:29,600
whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'

822
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:43,100
"Then they will go away to eternal punishment,

823
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,100
but the righteous to eternal life."

824
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:15,200
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,

825
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:20,300
"As you know, the Passover is two days away—

826
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:24,470
and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."

827
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:44,800
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,

828
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:51,000
and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.

829
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:59,100
"But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."

830
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:29,100
While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper,

831
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:34,700
a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume,

832
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:39,200
which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.

833
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,100
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant.

834
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,100
"Why this waste?" they asked.

835
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:06,400
"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor",

836
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,100
Aware of this, Jesus said to them,

837
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
"Why are you bothering this woman?

838
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,800
She has done a beautiful thing to me.

839
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:19,000
The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.

840
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,100
When she poured this perfume on my body,

841
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,500
she did it to prepare me for burial.

842
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,500
I tell you the truth,

843
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:38,100
wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world,

844
01:42:38,413 --> 01:42:43,413
what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."

845
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:55,300
Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked,

846
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:01,800
"What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?

847
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:22,100
So they counted out for him thirty silver coins.

848
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:40,100
From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

849
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:25,600
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked,

850
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,100
"Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

851
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,400
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,

852
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:39,700
'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near.

853
01:44:40,279 --> 01:44:44,979
I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.' "

854
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:51,700
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.

855
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,400
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.

856
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:16,200
And while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."

857
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:28,400
They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other,

858
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,000
"Surely not I, Lord?"

859
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:40,300
Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.

860
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:01,800
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him.

861
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,400
But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man!

862
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,200
It would be better for him if he had not been born."

863
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:27,200
Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?"

864
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,200
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."

865
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,900
While they were eating, Jesus took bread,

866
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:42,000
gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,

867
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:48,200
"Take and eat; this is my body."

868
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,900
Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying,

869
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,800
"Drink from it, all of you.

870
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:34,800
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

871
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:53,200
I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day

872
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:58,227
when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."

873
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:09,400
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

874
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,400
Then Jesus told them,

875
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:20,100
"This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:

876
01:49:20,112 --> 01:49:24,112
" 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'

877
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,200
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."

878
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:34,500
Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."

879
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,400
"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered,

880
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:56,200
"this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

881
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:04,700
But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."

882
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:21,900
And all the other disciples said the same.

883
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:45,700
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane,

884
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:50,900
and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."

885
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,400
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him,

886
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,000
and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.

887
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,900
Then he said to them,

888
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:17,100
"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

889
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,400
Stay here and keep watch with me."

890
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:49,500
Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,

891
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:15,900
"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.

892
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:24,300
Yet not as I will, but as you will."

893
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:49,900
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.

894
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:55,400
"Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.

895
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:05,700
"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.

896
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,300
The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."

897
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,300
He went away a second time and prayed,

898
01:53:48,900 --> 01:54:13,100
"My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."

899
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:54,500
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.

900
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:06,900
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.

901
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:19,000
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them,

902
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,600
"Are you still sleeping and resting?

903
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,100
Look, the hour is near,

904
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,700
and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

905
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Rise, let us go!

906
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:52,330
Here comes my betrayer!"

907
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:59,400
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived.

908
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:04,700
With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs,

909
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:08,400
sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.

910
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:17,700
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them:

911
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:25,400
"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."

912
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,500
Going at once to Jesus, Judas said,

913
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,100
"Greetings, Rabbi!"

914
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:01,500
and kissed him.

915
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,100
Jesus replied,

916
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,900
"Friend, do what you came for."

917
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:27,500
Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.

918
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,500
With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword,

919
01:57:31,635 --> 01:57:36,235
drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

920
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,600
Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him,

921
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:45,000
"for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.

922
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:54,500
Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?

923
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:03,500
But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"

924
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:08,400
At that time Jesus said to the crowd,

925
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:13,000
"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?

926
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:17,300
Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.

927
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:23,100
But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled."

928
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:22,700
Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.

929
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:38,200
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest,

930
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:41,800
where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.

931
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:47,600
But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest.

932
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:57,900
He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.

933
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:06,500
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus

934
02:00:06,955 --> 02:00:09,255
so that they could put him to death.

935
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:14,100
But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.

936
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:16,500
Finally two came forward and declared,

937
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,900
"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.' "

938
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:26,800
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus,

939
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
"Are you not going to answer?

940
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:33,800
What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"

941
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:36,700
But Jesus remained silent.

942
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:42,700
The high priest said to him,

943
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:50,200
"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."

944
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,700
"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.

945
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,700
"But I say to all of you:

946
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:04,500
In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One

947
02:01:04,777 --> 02:01:06,877
and coming on the clouds of heaven."

948
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:09,700
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said,

949
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,200
"He has spoken blasphemy!

950
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,700
Why do we need any more witnesses?

951
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:24,000
Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.

952
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,800
What do you think?"

953
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,700
"He is worthy of death," they answered.

954
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:37,800
Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists.

955
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,100
Others slapped him and said,

956
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:51,200
"Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"

957
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:55,000
Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard,

958
02:01:55,700 --> 02:02:01,100
and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.

959
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,900
But he denied it before them all.

960
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:10,200
"I don't know what you're talking about," he said.

961
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:28,400
Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him

962
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:32,200
and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."

963
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,800
He denied it again, with an oath:

964
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,700
"I don't know the man!"

965
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:03,300
After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said,

966
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:07,700
"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."

967
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:13,500
Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them,

968
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,700
"I don't know the man!"

969
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:21,300
Immediately a rooster crowed.

970
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,900
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken:

971
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:32,200
"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."

972
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:37,300
And he went outside and wept bitterly.

973
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:59,400
Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.

974
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:04,900
They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.

975
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:24,500
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned,

976
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:26,900
he was seized with remorse

977
02:04:27,063 --> 02:04:32,063
and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.

978
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:57,000
"I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood."

979
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:06,400
"What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."

980
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:22,100
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left.

981
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:27,700
Then he went away and hanged himself.

982
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:32,700
The chief priests picked up the coins and said,

983
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:38,200
"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."

984
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:44,700
So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.

985
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:50,000
That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.

986
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:56,700
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:

987
02:05:57,700 --> 02:06:03,200
"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,

988
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:08,200
and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

989
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:44,700
Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him,

990
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:48,700
"Are you the king of the Jews?"

991
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:56,700
"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.

992
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:07,700
When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.

993
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:14,700
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"

994
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:23,500
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.

995
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:30,700
Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.

996
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:37,700
At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.

997
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,300
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them,

998
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:45,700
"Which one do you want me to release to you:

999
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:51,900
Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"

1000
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:56,000
For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.

1001
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:09,000
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message:

1002
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:14,200
"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man,

1003
02:08:14,429 --> 02:08:19,429
for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."

1004
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:35,400
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas

1005
02:08:35,538 --> 02:08:38,538
and to have Jesus executed.

1006
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:47,500
"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor.

1007
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:52,300
"Barabbas," they answered.

1008
02:08:55,300 --> 02:09:00,200
"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked.

1009
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:05,400
They all answered, "Crucify him!"

1010
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:24,400
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate

1011
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:29,400
But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"

1012
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:38,900
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting,

1013
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:42,900
he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd.

1014
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:54,300
"I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"

1015
02:09:54,900 --> 02:10:01,300
All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"

1016
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:13,400
Then he released Barabbas to them.

1017
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:23,900
But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.

1018
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:33,300
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium

1019
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:36,200
and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.

1020
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:40,200
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,

1021
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:45,100
and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.

1022
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,900
They put a staff in his right hand

1023
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:55,400
and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!"they said.

1024
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,700
They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.

1025
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:05,600
After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him.

1026
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:09,900
Then they led him away to crucify him.

1027
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:18,800
As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon,

1028
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:21,400
and they forced him to carry the cross.

1029
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:29,000
They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).

1030
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:57,700
There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall;

1031
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:01,700
but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.

1032
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:52,900
When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

1033
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:57,700
And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.

1034
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:24,500
Above his head they placed the written charge against him:

1035
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:28,800
THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

1036
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,500
Two robbers were crucified with him,

1037
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:37,300
one on his right and one on his left.

1038
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:41,500
Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads

1039
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:47,300
and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,

1040
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:52,300
save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"

1041
02:13:55,200 --> 02:14:00,900
In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.

1042
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:05,000
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!

1043
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:11,600
He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.

1044
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:21,900
He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' "

1045
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:34,200
In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.

1046
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:48,900
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.

1047
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,900
About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice,

1048
02:14:55,100 --> 02:15:02,900
"Eloi, Eloi lama sabachthani?"

1049
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:11,300
—which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

1050
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:17,600
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."

1051
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,900
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge.

1052
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:27,400
He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.

1053
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:35,900
The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."

1054
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,600
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

1055
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:39,000
At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

1056
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:42,100
The earth shook and the rocks split.

1057
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:48,200
The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.

1058
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:51,600
They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection

1059
02:16:51,928 --> 02:16:54,928
they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.

1060
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:58,900
When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus

1061
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:03,400
saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified,

1062
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:09,900
and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son[e] of God!"

1063
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:19,400
Many women were there, watching from a distance.

1064
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:24,400
They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.

1065
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:33,400
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

1066
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:44,700
As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph,

1067
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:48,400
who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.

1068
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:52,900
Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body,

1069
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:56,400
and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.

1070
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:12,900
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

1071
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:17,700
and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock.

1072
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:24,400
He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.

1073
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:30,300
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.

1074
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:44,000
The next day, the one after Preparation Day,

1075
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:47,900
the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.

1076
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:55,900
"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said,

1077
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:58,700
'After three days I will rise again.'

1078
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,600
So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.

1079
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,200
Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body

1080
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:12,400
and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.

1081
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:15,500
This last deception will be worse than the first."

1082
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:31,000
"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."

1083
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,400
So they went and made the tomb secure

1084
02:19:43,999 --> 02:19:48,199
by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

1085
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:57,200
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,

1086
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:01,800
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

1087
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:17,400
There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven

1088
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:22,600
and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.

1089
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:45,000
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

1090
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,900
The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

1091
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:51,500
The angel said to the women,

1092
02:20:51,533 --> 02:20:56,033
"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

1093
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:59,600
He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

1094
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,700
Come and see the place where he lay.

1095
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,700
Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead

1096
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:13,800
and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.'

1097
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,600
Now I have told you."

1098
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,800
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy,

1099
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,100
and ran to tell his disciples.

1100
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:33,100
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said.

1101
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,500
They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.

1102
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:50,100
Then Jesus said to them,

1103
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:53,600
"Do not be afraid.

1104
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:19,600
Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

1105
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:52,800
While the women were on their way,

1106
02:22:52,963 --> 02:22:54,363
some of the guards went into the city

1107
02:22:54,867 --> 02:22:58,567
and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

1108
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,600
When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan,

1109
02:23:07,726 --> 02:23:11,726
they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,telling them,

1110
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:19,700
"You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'

1111
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:29,600
If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."

1112
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:42,400
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed.

1113
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:48,100
And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

1114
02:23:53,600 --> 02:24:00,000
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

1115
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:03,000
When they saw him, they worshiped him;

1116
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,500
but some doubted.

1117
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,800
Then Jesus came to them and said,

1118
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:13,500
"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

1119
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:20,400
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

1120
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:33,200
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

1121
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:38,200
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

1122
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:50,100
And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

1123
02:25:33,743 --> 02:25:43,743
