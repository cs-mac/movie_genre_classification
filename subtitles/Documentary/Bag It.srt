1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,400
This story begins with a single plastic bag

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,060
to carry home a single container of peach yogurt

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,940
Once I got home I shoved the bag

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,710
in with all the other bags next to another bag full of other bags

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,680
And I never really thought about it

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,150
Maybe I tried NOT to think about it

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,630
I mean I’m an average guy I’m not what you’d consider a tree-hugger

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,970
I try to be informed. I try to do the right thing but I find

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,270
that it can be a bit overwhelming at times

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,150
I live in a small town in Colorado

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,890
and it wasn’t until my town challenged another town

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,730
a few hours away to see who could reduce

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,460
their use of plastic bags the most that

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,180
I first started to think about plastic bags and what we do with them

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,380
I mean we all have a lot of bags right

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,870
Everybody does the same thing

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,170
We collect them, we shove them anywhere they’ll go

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,430
like under the sink, into closets, junk drawers

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,030
We throw a pile away every now and then just to be done with them

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,180
because they're disposable, right?

21
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,620
They were created to be thrown away

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,230
But let’s face it: there’s a dirty little secret here

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,770
even if we won’t admit it

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,470
Just because plastic is disposable

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,790
doesn’t mean it just goes away

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,410
After all, where is away?

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,070
There is no away

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,840
It actually sticks around for a really long time

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,710
That got me thinking about all the endless products made of plastic

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,610
A lot of them designed to be used for less than one day

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,710
Heck, less than fifteen minutes even

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,280
Once I began looking around

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,680
pretty much everything seemed to be made of plastic

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,990
Could all this plastic in my life maybe be bad for me?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,360
So I started looking into it

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,820
The fact that it is everywhere

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,990
The way it doesn’t go away

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,570
The way it pollutes

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,140
the way it flies and floats and drifts

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,290
and clogs and entangles

41
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,750
The way it gets into things so big and so small

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,020
the way we can't escape it anymore

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,480
the way, eventually, we may not have any recourse

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,490
we'll all just simply all have to stand up and say

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Bag It

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,960
You know that thing when you learn something for the first time

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,150
and then it starts popping up everywhere?

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,200
Like, you meet someone for the first time

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,570
and everywhere you go there’s that person

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,580
That was what it was like for me with plastic bags

51
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,650
They were everywhere

52
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,810
Let me just say this

53
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,760
first of all:

54
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,040
Plastic is an incredible material

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,850
It’s lightweight, it’s moldable,

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,420
durable, versatile, inexpensive

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,800
You can do amazing things with plastic

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,580
In the 1960's, the idea of plastic being the wave

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,240
of the future seemed like a bit of a joke

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,850
I just want to say one word to you

61
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,540
Just one word

62
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,430
Are you listening?

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,910
Yes, I am.

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,080
Plastics.

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,050
Exactly how do you mean?

66
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,600
There’s a great future in plastics.

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,200
In retrospect, this scene seems less like a joke and more like a prophecy

68
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,610
We were fed the concept of disposable living

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,030
Life would be easier and more convenient

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,610
Why do the dishes when you can just throw them away?

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,110
Plastic is an incredibly valuable resource

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,040
It’s something that really has a purpose in this society

73
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,440
and it needs to be used for that purpose

74
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,780
Petroleum is way too scarce and way too important

75
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,650
to us to be thrown away as a plastic bag.

76
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,930
Plastic bags are made of polyethylene

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,280
which is a polymer made of ethylene monomers

78
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,200
which is made from

79
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,300
well, actually, what they’re made from is a really good question

80
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,510
The United States uses, you know, roughly

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,930
estimates are about 100 billion plastic bags per year

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,960
It takes about 12 million barrels of oil.

83
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,500
In North American because we have an abundant supply of natural gas

84
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,520
they’re predominantly made out of natural gas

85
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,810
The key feedstock for making plastics is petroleum

86
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,230
In North America we don’t use oil, we use natural gas.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Plastic bags

88
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,890
are made of polyethylene

89
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,900
The building block is oil.

90
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,490
The bottom line is, they’re made from fossil fuels

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,190
which are non-renewable resources

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,200
That means, once they’re are gone, there isn’t any more.

93
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,610
And in this very short amount of time

94
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,450
we’re up to consuming about a million a minute

95
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,650
World plastic bag consumption is estimated

96
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,490
at about 500 billion bags per year.

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,920
So how do we learn how to shop

98
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,770
like our grandparents did?

99
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,880
I mean we haven’t always had plastic. Right?

100
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,820
What if we shopped using our bags over and over

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,590
you know, old school?

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,100
Some say that plastic bags have been singled out

103
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,750
that they have become an easy target

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,100
That there are much bigger

105
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,980
environmental issues out there

106
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,700
So why pick on plastic bags?

107
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,550
It would be great to come up with

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,620
the real cost of a plastic bag

109
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,240
because that is the number one consumer item in the world

110
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,250
We are not going to use those little plastic produce bags

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,220
We have our own bags

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,850
Here we go.

113
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,690
Here we go.

114
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,350
I’m going to use my own bag

115
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,470
for some deluxe salted nuts

116
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,480
There we go

117
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,580
Anne is the creative director at a newspaper

118
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,590
Thankfully, she’s pretty much on board for all of this

119
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,910
Plastic bags are being banned around the world

120
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,310
From New Delhi India and Bangladesh

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,070
where bags were clogging storm drains

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,570
and were contributing to severe floods

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,610
to the kingdom of Bhutan

124
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,070
where bags were banned to better foster

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,520
gross national happiness

126
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,630
In 2008, China banned ultra-thin plastic bags

127
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,760
It’s estimated that in the first year

128
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,040
it eliminated 40 billion

129
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,790
In May of 2009

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,840
the state of South Australia banned plastic bags

131
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,400
hoping to set an example for the rest of the nation

132
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,250
Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Zanzibar

133
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,470
and South Africa have all banned ultra- thin plastic bags

134
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,010
Many countries and cities in Europe

135
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,240
have either banned

136
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,620
or placed fees on plastic bags

137
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,900
Ireland placed a fee on plastic bags

138
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,910
and reportedly reduced consumption 90 percent in the first year

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,700
What’s the policy on plastic bags?

140
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,560
Like plastic carry-away bags

141
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,840
They’re 22 cents each.

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,670
22 cents?

143
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Yeah.

144
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,740
Okay.

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,980
It’s the government’s policy, it’s not actually the shop policy

146
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,180
Is that all of Ireland?

147
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,670
Do you find that most people

148
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,930
do most people not take them?

149
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,180
Do they bring their own bag?

150
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah, most people won’t take them.

151
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,170
How fast did you see a difference from when the tax went in?

152
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,930
It was instant. It was an overnight success as a campaign.

153
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,490
If you want to find out

154
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,250
what the people really think in Ireland

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,670
there’s only one place to go

156
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,490
to the pub.

157
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,000
Plastic bags in the bushes

158
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,460
plastic bags in the rivers

159
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,420
plastic bags in the canals

160
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,280
plastic bags everywhere.

161
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,110
Yeah, it has cleaned up the countryside an awful lot.

162
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,590
A pint of Guinness doesn’t come in plastic

163
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Slancha

164
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,780
In England, the village of Modbury became Europe’s first plastic bag free town

165
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,060
when the local merchants got together

166
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,810
and decided to voluntarily do something to help protect

167
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,800
their coastal environment.

168
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,530
We live 4 miles from some of the most beautiful coastline in the UK

169
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,090
You know, what legacy are we leaving

170
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,560
It’s really not to be quite selfish for the moment

171
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,350
and to think about the next generations to come.

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,740
In environmental news

173
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,580
a top UN official is urging a global ban

174
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,130
on plastic bags

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,400
in part because

176
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,200
plastic is the most pervasive form of ocean litter

177
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,750
Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the U.N Environment Program

178
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,530
said quote “Single use plastic bags

179
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,240
which choke marine life

180
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,250
should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere

181
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,170
There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore, anywhere

182
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,000
So what are we doing here at home?

183
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,250
Thirty rural communities in Alaska have banned plastic bags completely

184
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,050
In June of ‘09, Washington DC became the first US city

185
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,910
to place a fee on plastic bags.

186
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,420
California has been at the forefront of the plastic bag debate

187
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,630
San Francisco becomes the first city in the nation to ban plastic bags.

188
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,630
In San Francisco, those ubiquitous plastic shopping bags

189
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,220
have been ordered to Get out of town

190
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,250
People think San Francisco is a bunch of crazy radicals

191
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,430
We didn’t want to pursue a ban

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,340
So we tried for a year

193
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,090
to move forward with a fee

194
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,720
We thought that’s the most progressive way to do it

195
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,010
it’s the fairest way to do it

196
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,510
If you don’t use bags, you don’t pay

197
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,610
But the plastic bag lobby of the American Chemistry Council

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,820
quietly pushed through a law

199
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,760
prohibiting charging fees for plastic bags

200
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,380
anywhere in the state of California

201
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,390
The plastic bag lobby basically

202
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,880
pushed us into a corner through

203
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,070
strong arm tactics, back door deals in Sacramento

204
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,140
with our legislature

205
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,050
We had no option

206
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,740
The predictions from the plastic industry was

207
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,940
doom and gloom

208
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,440
You know, San Francisco will grind to an absolute halt

209
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,110
How can they live without plastic bags?

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,400
In the two years since we’ve had it in place

211
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,210
not one single complaint in our office, not one.

212
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,220
After San Francisco, other towns in California tried to pass their own bans

213
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,750
The American Chemistry Council’s and other pro-plastic groups’ response?

214
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,910
Was to sue

215
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,060
They claimed

216
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,300
it would just make people use paper bags instead

217
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,310
which would be even worse for the environment.

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,720
Even though city governments are being fought every step of the way

219
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,840
a lot of retailers have decided to take matters into their own hands.

220
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,490
At Costo and Sam’s Club

221
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,550
people have never been given bags

222
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
On earth day of 2008

223
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,550
Whole Foods became the first U.S. Supermarket

224
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,230
to completely do away with plastic bags

225
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,830
It’s paper versus plastic

226
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
And what do you do?

227
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,290
And I guess tote bags are the thing.

228
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
That’s what I’ve heard on the streets.

229
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,230
You could get a nice tote to go with your sweaters

230
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,630
Yeah well you know once I get my Bedazzler

231
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,620
I could you know...

232
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,110
Oftentimes the plastics industry

233
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,060
will say when you’re making the choice between paper of plastic

234
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,720
plastic is the better choice environmentally

235
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,590
Plastic is very lightweight

236
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,190
It takes fewer fossil fuels to transport plastic

237
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,220
So what’s left out of the equation

238
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,260
very conveniently is

239
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,940
what happens to our plastic

240
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,230
when it winds up into the ocean

241
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,670
If that were quantified

242
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,790
and if that became part of the analysis

243
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,980
there would be no contest

244
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,580
The eternal question: paper or plastic

245
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,140
How did San Francisco justify using paper?

246
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,980
The paper bags in San Francisco

247
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,350
many of them are 100% recycled content

248
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,200
and that means that no new trees are being cut down

249
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,030
Paper bags are being recycled at least ten times

250
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,190
more than plastic bags are being recycled

251
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,140
That significantly changes their environmental impact

252
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,460
So I think we have to really watch out for

253
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,390
the lobbying efforts of the American Chemistry Council

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,660
and other plastics industry

255
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,730
They’re really trying to protect their market share and their profits

256
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
That’s the bottom line

257
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,990
So who is the American Chemistry Council, anyway?

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,920
Well, the American Chemistry Council, otherwise known as the ACC

259
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,250
with over 130 member corporations

260
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,590
basically protects the interest of plastics and chemicals

261
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,090
One of the ACC’s branches is the Progressive Bag Affiliates

262
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,040
and the Progressive Bag Affiliates

263
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,330
has formed groups with friendly names like the Coalition

264
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,840
to Support Plastic Bag Recycling

265
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,200
And then there’s Save the Plastic Bag...

266
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,090
you know, like Save the Rainforest

267
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,800
or Save the Panda, or Save the Manatee

268
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,810
Yeah, Save the Plastic Bag

269
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,790
Just reading our e-mails from the plastic industry

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,440
So far, this many people have agreed to be in the film

271
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,800
If we’re going to be more than one-sided

272
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,390
we need to hear from more than one side

273
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,400
and if one side won’t talk to us... kind of problematic

274
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,010
Ooh, ooh, no bag, no bag

275
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,940
Thanks. I didn’t bring a bag but...

276
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,310
Would you like a bag?

277
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,720
No, no, no. Thanks.

278
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,920
I’m going to do it commando style

279
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,660
Alright!

280
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,020
You don’t even need a bag for your produce

281
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,510
Did you know that?

282
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,290
Yeah.

283
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,880
Yeah. I like my lettuce loose... like my ladies!

284
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,150
Are you sure you don’t need a bag?

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,970
We’ve got bags on sale for 99 cents.

286
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,980
I got it covered. I got it covered. I can do it. I can do this. Oh thank you. K.

287
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Thank you so much. Have a good day.

288
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,780
People kept referring to plastic bags

289
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,900
as this thing called a single- use disposable

290
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,260
Single-use disposable plastic

291
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,510
Think about it

292
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,220
Why would you make something

293
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,760
that you’re going to use for a few minutes

294
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,610
out of a material

295
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,880
that’s basically going to last forever

296
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,060
and you’re just going to throw it away?

297
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,070
What’s up with that?

298
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,180
From things like yogurt containers, yogurt tubes

299
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,060
plastic forks, plastic spoons

300
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,220
don’t even get me started on Snackables

301
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,590
stackables, Lunchables

302
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,070
pizza on a cookie

303
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,430
to- go containers

304
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,090
all kinds of packaging created to be ripped off then tossed off

305
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,270
sandwich bags, snack bags, candy wrappers

306
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,080
drinking straws...

307
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,270
and of course, the big three

308
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,420
the three things that we Americans love to use and throw away the most.

309
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,390
Bags, bottles, and cups.

310
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,620
So I just went into a very well known coffee chain

311
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,250
Which will remain nameless

312
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,590
Let’s just say that it rhymes with “Marbucks.”

313
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,700
And everybody’s sitting around drinking coffees

314
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,580
and lattes, and chais,

315
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,910
and soy mochas

316
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,700
and everybody has a to-go cup

317
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,660
The to-go cup is for things to go

318
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,670
Which, uh, coincidentally has a little lining on the inside made out of plastic

319
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,410
Did you know that?

320
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,820
Your cardboard coffee cup has a lining made out of plastic?

321
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,830
Let’s take a disposable, single-use coffee cup, of which we use 300 million a day

322
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,000
You drink the coffee in 10, 20 minutes.

323
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,250
If it’s a Styrofoam package, that package is going

324
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,620
to be around longer than the statue of David.

325
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,590
Now, we’re being convinced by marketing geniuses

326
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,600
that we’re supposed to use to go cups... in our own homes!

327
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,160
So we just found out some very exciting news

328
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,790
Yes

329
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,660
Didn’t we?

330
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,080
Yes, we did

331
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,440
We’re going to have a baby.

332
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,530
We’re having a baby.

333
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,540
We’re having a baby!

334
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,310
Well I’m a little freaked out

335
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,430
Yeah, well, so am I.

336
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,000
You are? Yeah. OK. Good.

337
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,000
And excited

338
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,880
And excited

339
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,960
And excited

340
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,650
Yup. Better clean this place up. Pink... or blue?

341
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,280
How about yellow or green?

342
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,890
Green!

343
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,710
OK, let me just clarify something: when I said I was freaked out,

344
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,140
I am freaked out, but not in a bad way.

345
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,250
I’m very excited about having a baby

346
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,050
But I’m also freaked out about this whole plastics issue.

347
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:56,060
You know, how it's going to affect our baby. Our baby's health... I gotta find out more.

348
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,490
Why should we make a cup or a piece of cutlery

349
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,460
that you gonna be using for five minutes,

350
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:12,290
why should we make it out of a drop of oil that takes 70 million years to make?

351
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,270
It’s not making sense

352
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,280
In 1970, the United States was one of the largest exporters of oil.

353
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,820
And here we are in 2008, and we are the largest importer of oil.

354
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,430
The sheer numbers of packaging that we’re each individually responsible for are staggering

355
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,280
The average American contributes 800 pounds of packaging

356
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:46,290
to the waste stream per person per year

357
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,460
This is packaging rage, an affliction suffered daily by millions.

358
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,160
Think about how ridiculous it’s become

359
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,400
We package everything in plastic

360
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,400
Even things that are already perfectly packaged by nature come packaged in plastic

361
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,790
We package paper in plastic

362
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,740
We even package plastic in plastic

363
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,910
One single-use disposal item we can definitely avoid is disposable diapers

364
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,290
It says “Buy cloth diapers instead of disposables and save up to $1,200.”

365
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,530
That’s good. That’s the diaper right there?

366
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,610
It’s beautiful

367
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,640
It’s very stylish

368
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,360
It’s very stylish.

369
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,580
It also says reusable cloth diapers prevent up to one ton of landfill waste.

370
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,340
So you don’t have to throw them away

371
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,250
You don’t throw them away

372
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,570
That’s good.

373
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,200
You wash them

374
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,210
Alright. I’m in.

375
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,110
I’ve done several images on single use disposable plastics.

376
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,620
One of them is an image of 60,000 plastic bags,

377
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,260
which is the number of plastic bags, sacks, and wraps

378
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:13,270
consumed in the United States every 5 seconds

379
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,140
Plastic water bottles

380
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,330
That to me is another one of the most insane things in our world right now.

381
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,140
There are 1.2 billion people -- almost 20 percent of the world’s population --

382
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,870
who lack access to safe drinking water on a daily basis.

383
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,950
And at the same time as that is happening,

384
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,960
we’re spending untold amounts of money and resources shipping tap water from Fiji to Miami,

385
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,360
Bottled water has now surpassed sales of beer and milk

386
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,710
and analysts think that within three years it may surpass soda sales

387
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,190
We go through the equivalent of 17 million barrels of oil making the

388
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,810
bottles that are used in the United States each year

389
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,430
Making those bottles generates two and a half million tons of carbon dioxide.

390
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,800
They had hundreds of millions of dollars to spend telling us to drink more water.

391
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,710
They used celebrities and models and used athletes so that their product was linked with wellness.

392
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,050
Utilities don’t have millions of dollars hanging around in their budgets to spend on advertisements saying

393
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,530
"Drink from your sink;" you know,

394
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,540
And so the category grew and grew, and in 2008,

395
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,910
What is plastic made out of? Do you know?

396
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,050
Not really. No

397
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,150
I have no idea what the chemical compound is

398
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,950
Plastic is made of... plastic

399
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Plastic is made of Yellow Dye No. 5

400
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,430
It turns out one of the biggest environmental consequences

401
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,440
of making bottled water is making the plastic that makes up the bottle.

402
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,750
If you were to fill any bottle about 25 percent of the way up with petroleum

403
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,370
that’s the amount of oil required the make the bottle itself

404
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,930
But that’s not the whole story

405
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,070
On top of it, we then have to transport it

406
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,980
If you’re moving it a long way, it requires a lot more energy,

407
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,990
maybe as much as another quarter.

408
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,530
It would be nice if people started to think of

409
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,420
buying single use bottled water like driving a Hummer.

410
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:05,070
Because it’s basically what it is.

411
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,510
They don’t necessarily do it this way in the rest of the world

412
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Enter Germany, home of the bratwurst, Beethoven, BMW and Oktoberfest oompah bands

413
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,320
They also take the recycling of plastics very seriously.

414
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,240
I basically collect all the plastic bottles, and just carry them to the supermarket,

415
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,250
and you put them into this machine and you get a receipt back and with this receipt it’s worth money.

416
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,940
This bottle is getting used a couple of times

417
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:40,950
As you can see there are like the little marks on it which says how often this bottle is in this recycling circle.

418
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,020
And this one is 22nd times.

419
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,030
They’re getting cleaned, refilled, relabeled and coming back into the circle.

420
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,920
So this is all the plastic that I collected this year so far

421
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,980
This is Beth Terry

422
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,340
Two years ago she decided to stop using plastic altogether,

423
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,020
and whatever plastic she can't avoid, she saves

424
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,400
These are like used spaghetti sauce jars

425
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:15,410
And so I just take them with me to the store. So there’s sugar that I can get in bulk... and lentils.

426
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,400
I stopped using plastic bags because I just... hate them

427
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,400
But Michael is a real conservation, use-what-you-have kind of person,

428
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,830
so he washes out the plastic bags that we already have.

429
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,180
This is our bathroom

430
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,800
The easiest thing in the bathroom is just not to use liquid soap

431
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,640
You know. So we use bar soap

432
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,410
Beth uses an antique all-metal razor

433
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,870
She swears by it.

434
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,280
- You need three blades, you know why? - But you don’t

435
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,460
Because the first blade pulls the hair out, and then the second blade pulls it out a little more and smacks it around

436
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,770
You’re a product of marketing!

437
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,520
When I was growing up, we didn’t have bottled water

438
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,140
I mean, people made jokes about Evian being “naive” spelled backwards

439
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:04,010
I think that, for me, it was the idea of harming other living creatures

440
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,840
and other people and harming the planet.

441
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,750
That’s what really woke me up.

442
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,770
Making changes in your own life gives you a sense of ownership

443
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,330
It makes you feel like We’ve got to do so much more

444
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,080
 I’ve got to talk to other people

445
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,750
 I’ve got to talk to my representatives.

446
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,620
I’ve got to start writing to companies

447
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,660
I’ve really got to up my game

448
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,810
But I think it starts on the individual level.

449
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,860
When we started our film, Seattle’s City Council had already approved legislation

450
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:37,870
placing a fee on disposable plastic and paper bags;

451
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,480
They dropped $200,000 into a campaign to get signatures to put the ordinance on the ballot

452
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:55,010
By August of 2009, the ACC had upped their spending to 1.4 Million dollars

453
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,760
So why would the plastics industry spend over a million dollars fighting a bag tax in Seattle?

454
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:08,770
Well, it’s not all about Seattle. They worry about other cities and want to get the message out fast.

455
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,940
I feel a real responsibility as an American to stand up to these American corporations and say,

456
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I’m angry. They have no business being here: I want their hands off Seattle!

457
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:44,050
So, I just want to say that we took on the most powerful industry in the country

458
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,410
So, I think we won.

459
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,390
Thank you so much for everything you’ve done

460
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Keep on the good fight

461
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,550
Every time we go and we buy something,

462
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,180
we decide who we give our money to

463
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,130
This machine can stop as soon as we decide to say

464
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,710
“No. I do not want that plastic bag

465
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,170
I do not want to buy your stuff and throw it away.”

466
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,320
So here’s a recap of the basics

467
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,290
The way I see it: Bring your own bag

468
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,690
Bring your own coffee cup.

469
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,920
Bring your own water bottle.

470
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,540
Oh and bring your own brain

471
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,180
Consider less packaging

472
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,320
Go single-use free for a single day

473
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,400
Start there

474
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,860
Become aware of your habits.

475
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,530
It’s not as easy as you think

476
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,580
But guess what?

477
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,940
It makes you think!

478
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,950
Ice cream doesn’t come in plastic

479
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,140
So, it seems like in this society, we like to consume

480
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,690
And a lot of the stuff that we like to consume is made of plastic or it comes in plastic

481
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,530
But once we’re done with that, where does it go?

482
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,540
We put out garbage at the end of the driveway

483
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,110
and the sanitation crew comes and picks it up and it goes away

484
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,240
Where’s away?

485
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,410
You know?

486
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,370
There is no away!

487
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,060
If you can imagine Yankee stadium, as a Tupperware container

488
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,660
We fill it three times a day with garbage here in New York City

489
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,160
And certainly a huge amount of it is also plastics.

490
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,210
Here we are in New York City

491
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,220
I’ve got my man purse. OK?

492
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,370
Something. Oooh, look at that. Oh sorry. Yeah, see that thing?

493
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,950
Look at that

494
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,930
Okay, that is not wildlife, people. Okay?

495
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,660
That is not nature. That’s a plastic bag

496
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,850
It’s a bit of a workout  to chase them around.

497
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,220
I don’t have to go to the gym now.

498
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,370
If I just say “plastic bags,” to you, “in New York.” What do you say?

499
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,240
We use them,

500
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,630
They’re a convenience for a couple of minutes, a couple of hours,

501
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,640
and they remain an environmental burden for hundreds of years.

502
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,300
One of the biggest problems in the city is that we use about a billion plastic bags a year

503
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,570
People joke that the New York City flower is a plastic bag stuck in a tree.

504
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,590
That’s a bad emblem.

505
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,060
Hi, welcome to Wendy’s, what can I  get for you today?

506
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,400
Um, I have a question for you

507
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:46,410
I’m trying not to use packaging and I brought my own plate and my own cup.

508
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,510
Is it possible to get it served on my own plate?

509
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,580
Hold on one second

510
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,110
Thanks

511
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,010
We cannot put it on ourselves, but we can give it to you and you can put in on though

512
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,010
Me taking their food out of their packaging and putting it on my own plate,

513
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,950
sort of defeated the whole purpose.

514
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,880
So, I decided to try Taco Bell.

515
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,680
I’m sorry, sir, we can’t do that.

516
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,910
That’s called cross contamination, and we can’t take anything from the outside in.

517
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Oh. Are you able to put a soda in my own glass?

518
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,970
Cross contamination. Okay!

519
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,850
It’s not exactly true they can’t take anything through the window.

520
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,710
They’re fine taking our cross- contaminated money

521
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,720
I'm sorry you can't film here, ma'am!

522
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,360
There’s no ah-haa moment, it’s just sort of hacking away at it little by little

523
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,670
And that’s how you can  go a year and end up with 32 pounds of garbage

524
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,640
Okay, I get this whole concept of using less and producing less waste,

525
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,260
but with plastic packaging, can't we just recycle it?

526
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,110
I spend a lot of time in my book asking “Is recycling doing any good?

527
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,470
Is it worthwhile, should we continue to do it?”

528
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,770
And the short answer is a resounding “Yes, yes, yes.”

529
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,860
It saves enormous amounts of energy to make new goods from old goods

530
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,500
instead of continually pulling raw materials from the earth,

531
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,720
and transforming them, transporting them, and then

532
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,170
sending them on this one way trip to the landfill.

533
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,700
For every barrel of waste we put on the curb,

534
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,310
there are 71 barrels of waste generated upstream

535
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,650
in making all these consumer goods.

536
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,410
And every time we recycle whatever we can,

537
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,230
we’re chipping away at those 71 barrels upstream.

538
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,100
This stuff isn’t recyclable-

539
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,920
It’s recyclable.

540
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,810
ANNE No, it’s not.

541
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,890
That’s recyclable.

542
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,400
No, it’s not.

543
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,320
You put it all in there and they’ll figure it out.

544
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,820
There, there’s the thing.

545
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,260
See? Recycle.

546
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,980
Why would they put that on if you can’t recycle it?

547
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,360
Right. Okay.

548
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,510
I’ll do it.

549
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,210
Thank you.

550
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,650
You shouldn’t be carrying stuff.

551
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,410
No, you shouldn’t.

552
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,270
I thoroughly believe people are recycling because they think it’s the right thing to do

553
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,870
As soon as they get rid of it, into that container, they never think about it any more

554
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,890
I don’t even think they know where it goes after it leaves our site

555
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,890
I don’t know where it goes after it leaves this site!

556
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,220
I think it could be a feel-good thing for people.

557
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,750
I have such a love-hate relationship with recycling.

558
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,790
Because I love recycling in that it’s sort of an on-ramp

559
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,230
or a gateway drug to bigger, better environmental activism.

560
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,680
But what I hate about it is it lulls people into thinking that they’re making a difference.

561
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,270
You know, you buy this thing, you know that it’s overpackaged.

562
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,330
But at least you can recycle it. You put it in that blue bin and it’s like Ahhhhhh.

563
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,300
This is recycling arrows

564
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,850
Yeah

565
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,030
	It’s a chasing arrow

566
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,490
So most people would assume that means, “Hey I can recycle that.”

567
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,080
Yeah, that was brilliant marketing on the American Chemistry Council

568
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,540
and the American Plastic Council’s part.

569
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:16,220
They use that chasing arrow to make us all think that it’s all recyclable.

570
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,440
Turns out, there’s no regulation with the recycling symbol.

571
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:25,260
We’ve been duped into believing that all these products are getting recycled.

572
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:31,270
The truth is that really only a few of those numbers, 1 and 2, are highly recycled.

573
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,120
Those other  numbers are going straight to the landfill or the incinerator.

574
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,900
Okay I’ve seen these numbers on the bottom of plastic before,

575
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,140
and I always wondered what they meant...

576
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:48,700
And now the society of plastics industry coding system:

577
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,620
Number 1: polyethylene terephthalate

578
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,360
Number 2: high density polyethylene

579
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,660
Number 3: polyvinylchloride

580
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,860
Number 4: low density polyethylene

581
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,600
Number  5: polypropylene

582
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,250
Number 6: polystyrene

583
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,480
And number 7?

584
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,390
Other!

585
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,140
I was feeling pretty confused as to which plastics could and couldn’t be recycled

586
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,290
So I decided to put on a recycling challenge,

587
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,700
in order to find out if other people were as confused as I was.

588
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,090
I recycle, so I think I know things that should be recycled.

589
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,970
Here’s your recycling bin. Here’s your trash can

590
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,210
Aaaand, Go

591
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,880
Well, guess what.

592
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:45,130
It turns out that everyone was pretty much as confused as I was.

593
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,350
Especially the bagpiper.

594
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,570
For those of you looking for an easy answer, there isn’t one.

595
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,310
Every municipality across the country has different guidelines

596
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,820
as to what they do and don’t accept.

597
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,430
With a lid, you can’t. My wife taught me that one.

598
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,790
Good, good, good.

599
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,940
Do you recycle these?

600
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,820
Well, I’d be giving it away wouldn’t I?

601
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,410
Yeah, you’re pretty sharp.

602
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,420
The most common items taken are Number 1 and Number 2, but only the bottles.

603
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,800
Currently in the U.S., recycled plastic bottles are not made back into new bottles

604
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,810
but are downcycled into products that can not then be recycled.

605
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,050
So they tend to get just one more life.

606
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,060
Unlike an aluminum can or a glass container that can theoretically be recycled forever.

607
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,440
The plastics industry, they like to buy, fresh out of the refineries,

608
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,450
plastic pellets that they can turn into really clean high grade material;

609
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,810
so they don’t really even want the recycled content back.

610
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,970
Their only incentive in promoting recycling

611
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,680
is to be able justify to the consumer that this product is good.

612
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,350
If they don’t want it, where does it go?

613
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,870
Well, as a matter of fact, a lot of our plastic goes to Asia.

614
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,890
Shiploads of our plastic garbage is going over there.

615
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,580
And the reason it’s going over there is it’s yucky to reprocess it.

616
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,130
It’s technically impossible to really recycle it.

617
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,730
It’s dirty and stinky and gross and we don’t want that stuff here.

618
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,380
What they do is they take it into a big yard and they pop it open

619
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,150
open and they have people working under very low wages

620
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,310
with very bad working conditions,

621
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,050
and they will cherry pick out the things that they can melt down and do something with.

622
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,350
But the human rights and labor issues related with that

623
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,810
the toxicity issues of some of the open plastic melting that they do

624
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,380
-- to me those do not fit in a recycling model.

625
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,040
Recycling can’t do everything for us.

626
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,550
It’s more important to reduce what we consume

627
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,430
and to reuse things that have already been made.

628
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,110
But even more important is this fourth R, which comes ahead of these three.

629
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,900
And it’s Redesign: redesigning goods to last longer,

630
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:02,510
to contain fewer toxins, and to be easier to take apart and rebuild or repair.

631
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,800
Michael Braungart is a German chemist well known for his cradle to cradle concept.

632
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:13,810
So you define everything no longer from cradle to grave but from cradle to cradle.

633
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,120
So you always plan the next life of a product in it.

634
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,960
We have this idea that our worth as a nation is based on gross national product.

635
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,260
And that consumption and a high standard of living equals happiness.

636
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,480
The number one thing that makes people happy is the strength of our social relations.

637
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,660
If we stop putting so much of our life energy into getting more and more and more stuff

638
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,300
we take it out of that system

639
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,410
and we plug it into our communities and families and friends,

640
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,420
not only do we create less waste, but we actually have more fun.

641
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,810
Buy less stuff, that is the simplest thing that I can say to people.

642
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,820
How about not using something that needs to be disposed of or dealt with in the first place?

643
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,450
Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.

644
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,310
If you don’t need it, don’t buy it.

645
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,390
We think of a lot of plastic products as being cheap and disposable.

646
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,450
If it breaks, no problem, just get another one.

647
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,060
But here’s the thing: disposable plastic isn’t really that cheap.

648
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,640
Someone has to pay.

649
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:29,650
Whether it’s the cost of making it, transporting it, or the cost of throwing it “away.”

650
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,160
And how about the unquantifiable amount it costs

651
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,760
when plastics end up loose in the environment?

652
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,770
who pays for that?

653
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:49,810
So I recently found out that there is all this trash sitting in the middle of the ocean.

654
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,420
And a lot of this trash is plastic.

655
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,760
And, my first thought was, well, alright, but that’s...

656
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,200
I didn’t do that.

657
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,920
Where does that trash come from?

658
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,080
Trash gets loose on the land, it blows into a river,

659
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,240
and the trash goes into the ocean.

660
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,480
So, that is our plastic out there.

661
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,650
And there’s a lot of it.

662
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,250
People ask me: Why should I care about the ocean?

663
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,590
It seems so obvious.

664
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,990
The ocean is the cornerstone of earth’s life support system.

665
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,660
It shapes climate and weather; it holds most of life on earth.

666
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,420
Ninety-seven percent of earth’s water is there.

667
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,700
It’s the blue heart of the planet.

668
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,330
We should take care of our heart.

669
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:38,340
It’s what makes life possible for us.

670
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:47,470
We still have a really good chance to make things better than they are.

671
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,650
They won’t get better unless we take the action

672
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,780
-- and inspire others to do the same thing.

673
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,810
No one is without power.

674
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Everybody has the capacity to do something.

675
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,060
How bad is the situation with plastic in the ocean?

676
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,250
I think it’s bad because it’s unnecessary.

677
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,580
It doesn’t have the be there.

678
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,230
There are clear environmental consequences in terms of that we know

679
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,890
that over 260 species that are affected by plastic debris,

680
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,010
through entanglements and ingestion.

681
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,470
So just based on the statistics of production,

682
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,350
how we’ve gone from half a million tons of plastic per year produced

683
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,360
in the 1950's to over 260 million tons today.

684
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,830
To put that into context, okay

685
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,680
-- the first decade of this century, by 2010,

686
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,160
will have produced more plastic than the whole of the century that preceded.

687
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,080
And most of that material is going to make throwaway items

688
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,720
that are then ending up in landfill or the ocean.

689
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:53,460
Eighty percent of all marine debris actually starts from a land-based source.

690
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,890
All drains do lead to the ocean.

691
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,020
We dump things.

692
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,260
They end up going down a storm drain or into a wetland,

693
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:08,270
going down streams and rivers, straight into the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean.

694
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,610
It’s estimated that about six million pieces of litter enter the oceans

695
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:19,020
every day and that the majority of this is plastic.

696
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,220
Camillo Beach has a very white sand look,

697
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,200
and it’s not really sand at all,

698
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,200
it’s mostly white plastic covering the beach,

699
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,880
sometimes up to a foot thick of plastic pieces.

700
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,950
Wait a second. This is Hawaii?

701
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,660
I’ve seen pictures of Hawaii. Hawaii is beautiful.

702
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,860
This is not what a beach in Hawaii is supposed to look like.

703
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,690
There’s just far too much of it in our ocean right now,

704
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,700
and what is washing up on our beaches is a small indication of what’s really out there.

705
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,750
Mainly what we find are fragments of plastic.

706
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,980
Stuff like this.

707
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,670
And all this debris is coming from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre,

708
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,300
or the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

709
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,970
There are actually five major “gyres” --

710
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,520
swirling systems of currents in our oceans.

711
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,770
One in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean and two in the Pacific Ocean.

712
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,250
The gyre that has been studied the most is the North Pacific Subtropical gyre

713
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,330
-- otherwise known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

714
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,430
Estimated to be anywhere from twice the size of Texas

715
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,590
to the size of the entire United States.

716
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,990
Debris of all kinds floats into this gyre and there it stays.

717
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,070
Swirling.

718
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,940
Now the problem is that when this debris is made of plastic,

719
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,860
it doesn’t biodegrade, it photodegrades.

720
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:45,630
That means that sunlight breaks it down into smaller and smaller pieces,

721
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,050
which marine life can mistake for food.

722
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,340
So what exactly does this garbage patch look like?

723
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,250
We went to the Algalita Marine Research Foundation for some answers.

724
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,600
They have spent over a decade studying plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

725
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:07,010
It’s not a floating island of trash that can be cleaned up or scooped out.

726
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,940
It’s way worse than that.

727
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:13,460
It’s tons of little bits of plastic floating under water,

728
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,340
like a plastic soup.

729
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,190
It’s our thickest sample yet.

730
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,040
We’ve been finding more plastic by weight than plankton.

731
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,390
And the ratio keeps going up. That’s our concern.

732
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,090
Over the years, they have seen in their trawls through the Patch,

733
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:35,100
plastic-to-plankton ratios that have gone from six-to-one to as high as forty-to-one.

734
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,220
What that means is that in some parts of the ocean,

735
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:45,230
there is now 40 times more plastic than food.

736
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,600
No bueno. (No good)

737
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,450
To raise awareness about plastic in our oceans,

738
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,850
Dr. Marcus Eriksen and a fellow scientist

739
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,810
decided to set sail across the pacific on a boat made of plastic.

740
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,290
Hi!

741
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,610
Hi Dr. Eriksen. Why exactly are you making this trip?

742
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:12,170
The point is to get the nation talking about

743
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,210
how do we end the age of disposable plastics.

744
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:21,220
We need to end this mass consumption of single- use plastic materials.

745
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,920
So the idea here is to sail from California to Oahu

746
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,460
on a boat made of 15,000 recycled plastic bottles, correct?

747
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,900
Exactly. And those bottles are held together by derelict fishing nets.

748
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,990
It’s name is Junk, because it’s made of junk.

749
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,520
What has to happen is a global recognition

750
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,150
that disposable plastics have no place in our environment.

751
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,050
According to Dr. Eriksen, the plastic in the ocean is carrying toxins at high concentrations.

752
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,600
Animals are then eating the plastic fragments.

753
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,620
They think it’s food.

754
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,860
They just open up their mouths and take a big gulp.

755
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:04,770
What amounts to a big gulp of Persistent Organic Pollutants, or POP’s.

756
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,620
These are chemicals and toxins -- like DDT, DDE and PCB’s among others

757
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,430
-- that latch onto plastics and become super- concentrated.

758
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,610
The plastic acts like a sponge!

759
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,480
And then when the plastics are mistakenly eaten by marine life,

760
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,960
the toxic chemicals go with them.

761
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,580
When you eat a large fish like a swordfish,

762
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,390
it might be the fifth step in the food chain

763
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,510
because it’s eaten a smaller fish that ate smaller fish

764
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,260
and they ate zooplankton and eventually they ate phytoplankton;

765
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,370
and at every step you’re getting a multiplication factor of ten times

766
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,190
or a hundred times or even a thousand times those chemicals.

767
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,640
And the plastics are facilitating this:

768
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:46,260
they sort of sop up the toxic chemicals and concentrate them in their flesh

769
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:52,270
so that we can end up eating them on our dinner plates.

770
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:57,170
This is Midway Atoll, a tiny speck of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

771
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:03,180
where plastic is having a direct impact on the fate of the Laysan albatross.

772
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:12,020
Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge is home to the largest albatross colony in the world.

773
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,040
These birds are fantastic flyers, they forage throughout the Pacific,

774
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,690
but because they forage so far,

775
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,180
they're really good indicators of the health of the Pacific

776
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,300
and what's happening out there.

777
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,350
In the 1950s when people looked at dead albatross at Midway,

778
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,080
they didn't see any plastic at all; and it wasn't until the '60s

779
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:37,090
that we started to see in at Midway and in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

780
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:42,300
Every dead bird at Midway has plastic in them.

781
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,320
So this is kind of the extreme:

782
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,880
plastic everywhere and very little food.

783
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,790
Nineteen caps of some sort,

784
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,090
and then of the 19, there were about 14 bottle caps.

785
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,540
The plastic they use for the top isn’t recyclable right now --

786
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:05,550
so maybe that’s one of the reasons why you find so many plastic tops around.

787
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,060
The albatross that are surrounding us here today

788
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,510
face numerous threats over the course of their life,

789
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,210
to successfully come back here and

790
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,450
have chicks of their own

791
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,780
They’ve got to fly hundreds of miles to find food;

792
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,150
they’ve got to survive for several years at sea;

793
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,950
and the plastics in the ecosystem are just

794
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,960
another hurdle in that path to come back here.

795
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:37,360
All the plastic that you see here was brought to the island by an adult albatross and fed to a chick.

796
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,850
We can calculate how much plastic is brought to Midway each year by the adult albatross

797
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,660
and it comes out to be five tons of plastic.

798
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,110
That’s every year. Five tons.

799
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,530
What’s happening to Midway will soon be happening around the globe

800
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,580
unless we change the way that we operate as a people.

801
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,740
And he totally agrees.

802
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:03,750
He thinks that was very well stated. I know.

803
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,000
It’s not just albatross that are feeling the effects of plastic in the oceans.

804
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,920
Over 260 marine species are being impacted by plastic,

805
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,580
either through ingestion or entanglement.

806
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:22,110
This 26 foot long Bride’s whale was stranded on a beach in Australia and died.

807
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:28,120
It was found that the whale’s stomach was packed with over 19 square feet of plastic.

808
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:36,360
In fact, it is estimated that plastic kills 100,000 marine animals each year.

809
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,720
Just about every big animal in the ocean is down 90 percent.

810
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:49,530
Animals aren’t going to be fine unless we figure out how to help them.

811
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,570
But imagine if every morning your breakfast was a bowl of cereal

812
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,590
and half the stuff in the bowl was little Styrofoam balls and half of it was cereal.

813
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,660
In some parts of the ocean, there’s enough plastic out there that animals are eating a lot of it.

814
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,160
And it’s not good.

815
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:13,340
Sea turtles are fascinating animals that have been on our planet since the time of the dinosaurs,

816
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,020
but now all sea turtle species in U.S. waters are listed as

817
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:20,640
threatened of endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

818
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,280
They just eat what’s out there.

819
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:28,290
And, not that long ago, everything that they would find was edible, or at least biodegradable.

820
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,880
If you could envision what a plastic bag would look like floating in the ocean,

821
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,910
it looks like a jellyfish;

822
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,100
and many sea turtle species eat jellyfish.

823
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,010
Ach, it’s another No. From the plastics industry.

824
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,490
To be interviewed in our film.

825
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,350
So far, everybody from the plastics industry has declined to be in our film.

826
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Even the ones that we interviewed.

827
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,770
See Jeb, this marine debris issue is way overblown.

828
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,080
To say that “Oh, we cut open a dead animal and

829
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,850
we found a bunch of plastic fragments in it

830
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,870
therefore the animal died because of plastic?”

831
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,570
How do we know that the animal wasn’t sick and dying

832
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,330
and that it just ate a bunch of plastic at the end of its life

833
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,280
because it was sick and dying?

834
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,750
Did they do a toxicology autopsy on them?

835
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,160
No, they don’t do that on animals, they do that on people.

836
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,440
When scientists are conducting necropsies,

837
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,420
which are animal autopsies,

838
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,050
they’re finding that sea turtles’ stomachs are full of tiny little pieces of plastic.

839
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,260
Some sea turtle species like the Pacific leatherback,

840
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,800
it’s estimated that they could go extinct within the next couple of decades.

841
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,980
We’re really in a position where every dead sea turtle counts,

842
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,720
and we need to do whatever we can to keep them alive

843
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,000
and to recover healthy sea turtle populations.

844
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,440
Here’s a question I’ve got...

845
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,140
When did they start doing this?

846
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,780
On milk... and juice.

847
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,070
It’s supposed to open like this.

848
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,280
I don’t get it.

849
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,930
There’s really no cleaning it up.

850
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,150
I’ve heard the scenario that to clean up the North Pacific Gyre,

851
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:24,110
it would be akin to vacuuming the entire continental United States three times over.

852
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,380
That’s a monumental task.

853
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,810
So we’re stuck with that plastic in the ocean as it is.

854
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,080
Although there’s no real way to clean all this plastic out of the ocean,

855
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,540
some people are at least trying.

856
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,980
We’ve been here for approximately two weeks now on our marine debris trip.

857
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,170
We do this every year in conjunction with NOAA.

858
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,420
We brought two cargo containers because that’s what they filled last year.

859
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,380
There’s so much debris this year that we’re going to

860
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,900
overflow the two containers that we brought.

861
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,610
I think maybe if people saw the amount of debris we that collected in these quantities

862
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:01,430
it’d make them think twice about the amount of plastic they use in their daily life.

863
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,260
We need help from industry and people

864
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:07,100
involved in product and packaging design to help with material reduction.

865
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,070
Reducing the quantities of plastic that we use for single-use one-trip items

866
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,800
and then they’re thrown away --

867
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,040
and that’s to my mind, you know,

868
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,970
a third of all the plastics we make,

869
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,710
that’s what we’re using them for --

870
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,990
that’s the area that really needs to be targeted

871
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,350
if we want to help to reduce the problems

872
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:28,360
of contamination in the marine environment.

873
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,300
Nature solves its problems.

874
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,780
nd if we’re a problem, nature will solve us as a problem.

875
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,700
To be an environmentalist, to be a conservationist is really a question of self-preservation.

876
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,340
We’re really working to make sure that we survive.

877
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,580
The earth will survive.

878
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:54,590
But if we don’t learn to live in harmony with its ecosystem then we will simply disappear.

879
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,780
Even though we can’t clean up what’s already in our oceans,

880
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:03,570
we can make sure that we do all we can to not add more to it.

881
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,440
Can I use my own container?

882
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,650
If plastic is affection our oceans so dramatically,

883
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,000
could it be impacting human health?

884
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:16,180
And what about our child?

885
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:22,190
I’ll take the free-range chicken.

886
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,090
You know I’ve never been one of those people

887
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,630
that worried about chemicals and toxins and stuff;

888
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,520
I thought it was a little bit overboard.

889
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,670
But, when you’re going to have a baby,

890
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,070
you do start to worry about that kind of thing.

891
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,080
And you start to look around at your house at the stuff that you have.

892
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,400
The stuff that’s for your baby, that’s going to go on your baby’s skin.

893
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:46,650
And the stuff that people start giving you for your baby.

894
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,420
I don’t even know what kind of chemicals are in this stuff.

895
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,390
All day long you’re getting exposed to very small amounts

896
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,920
of many different things and each industry will say

897
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,020
“Oh it’s just a little bit of our chemical,”

898
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,060
but the problem is,

899
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,840
we think the cumulative impact during that whole day

900
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,410
is what’s causing that health effect in the human.

901
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,280
Basically there are no requirements

902
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,470
for testing chemicals for health and safety effects.

903
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,400
The current regulation is so weak

904
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,660
that the EPA tried to use this law to ban asbestos,

905
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,470
and they failed.

906
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,180
There’s something like 125,000 chemicals

907
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,970
registered for use around the globe and

908
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,050
very few have been tested for the effects on human health.

909
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,180
The Europeans put in the program REACH

910
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,730
where chemicals had to be proven safe

911
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,520
instead of the reverse where in our system,

912
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,870
first they have to be proven harmful.

913
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,030
So a chemical is innocent until proven guilty.

914
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,380
In this country.

915
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,930
Maybe we shouldn’t give chemicals the kind of rights that people get.

916
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,350
The chemicals we’re testing for now include

917
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,070
phthalates, which are the chemicals that are used to soften plastic,

918
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,170
bisphenol A which is a chemical used to harden plastic.

919
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,090
Phthalates and bisphenol A have been getting a lot of attention lately

920
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,930
because they’re both known as endocrine disrupters,

921
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,330
meaning they disrupt or inhibit our normal hormone function.

922
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:13,230
Let’s start with bisphenol A, otherwise known as BPA, which is a synthetic estrogen.

923
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,820
BPA is the main component of polycarbonate,

924
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,560
the hard, clear plastic sometimes used to make such items

925
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:23,950
as water bottles, food storage containers, sports equipment, and electronics.

926
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,370
But wait! There’s more.

927
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,790
So you think you’ll avoid plastic

928
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,490
you’ll do the right thing and you’ll buy something that comes in a can

929
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,000
and then you find out that the can is lined with...

930
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,800
guess what... You got it: plastic.

931
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,830
And this plastic that lines this very can contains bisphenol A.

932
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,120
Which means it also lines soda, juice, and beer cans, and -

933
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,310
guess what else BPA is in?

934
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,340
Infant formula can liners and baby bottles.

935
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,560
That’s right, baby bottles.

936
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,500
Bisphenol A exposure at phenomenally low doses

937
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,730
during the early period after birth

938
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,750
when babies are drinking infant formula laced

939
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,940
with bisphenol A out of baby bottles made with bisphenol A.

940
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,650
What you get is animals that are hyperactive

941
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,830
and show learning impairment.

942
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:22,250
Remind you of a human condition called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?

943
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,890
This is a poster chemical for that.

944
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,990
Basically, we have released a lot of chemicals into the environment

945
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,780
that can interfere with the way our children are constructed

946
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:37,580
from the moment of fertilization until they’re born 38 weeks later.

947
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:43,590
Not only health-wise but also in the way they behave and in their intelligence.

948
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:50,540
Academic and government scientists are showing an array of harm from bisphenol A

949
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,420
that is frightening to the brain, to the reproductive system.

950
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,390
And one of the things you see happening

951
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,450
with Bisphenol A is gender neutrality.

952
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,410
That means our boys are become feminized feminized and our girls are becoming masculinized.

953
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,790
And furthermore, many scientists believe that BPA exposure is linked to prostate cancer,

954
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,770
breast cancer, hypospadias, low sperm count, early puberty, uterine fibroids,

955
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:20,780
miscarriage, polycystic ovary disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, ADHD, and autism.

956
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:26,480
Right now, it is predicted that one out of every third child --

957
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,750
and if you’re a minority, it’s one out of every two children born --

958
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,550
is going to develop diabetes sometime in their life.

959
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,770
Autism -- one in a hundred and fifty children.

960
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,690
This can’t be genetic because it’s happening too fast.

961
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:46,310
And in most instances, they were rare disorders before the 1970’s.

962
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:52,320
Of the more than 200 government funded studies, 92 percent show harm related to BPA exposure.

963
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Of the less than 20 studies funded by chemical corporations, 0 percent show harm.

964
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:05,050
A Centers for Disease Control study detected BPA in the urine of 95% of adults sampled.

965
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,850
Those with the highest levels had more than twice the risk of heart disease and diabetes...

966
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:15,860
The FDA cites two studies, both of those studies funded by the plastics industry.

967
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,180
Scientists have measured BPA in the blood of pregnant women, in umbilical cord blood,

968
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,780
and in the placentas, all at levels demonstrated in animals to alter development.

969
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,400
Where is the FDA?

970
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,570
Have an FDA warning to tell you about this morning.

971
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,270
Now in a shift in the agency’s position

972
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,520
the FDA is saying that the chemical is of some concern.

973
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:39,780
...Especially on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children.

974
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:43,210
The government agency is encouraging families to limit their children’s exposure...

975
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,590
The American Chemistry Council says BPA is safe.

976
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,930
I’m calling Rob Krebbs from the American Chemistry Council.

977
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,440
Rob Krebbs-

978
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,590
Hey Rob Krebbs, it’s Jeb Berrier, from the Bag It movie.

979
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,820
From Bag It movie?

980
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:04,680
I e-mailed you a few weeks ago. We’re doing a documentary.

981
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,540
Uh, okay, I’m sorry.

982
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:12,130
Jeff, I’m literally on the phone with someone else right this second.

983
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,250
Can you shoot me an e-mail, again? Just to remind me?

984
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,770
Okay, no problem, I’ll e-mail you again. Thanks.

985
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,600
Honey?

986
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,690
Yes dear?

987
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,350
I’m doing the dishes.

988
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,460
Thank you.

989
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:32,470
Because you are so... pregnant!

990
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,320
There are certain plastic containers that we stopped getting.

991
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,100
We kind of cut back on can usage altogether.

992
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:46,110
We stopped reheating anything in plastic.

993
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,030
The other chemical we’re concerned about,

994
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,430
phthalates, is actually a family of chemicals.

995
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,300
Phthalates are commonly found in polyvinyl chloride plastic,

996
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,210
otherwise known as PVC.

997
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,620
Phthalates are “plasticizers” that are used to soften plastic.

998
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,630
They’re used in a wide variety of products --

999
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,250
anything from vinyl flooring and all other things vinyl

1000
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:14,190
 to personal care products to... children’s toys.

1001
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,970
You take a rubber ducky.

1002
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:20,600
In order to make that brittle material seem like rubber,

1003
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:26,540
you actually have to have more phthalate in it than you do polyvinyl-chloride.

1004
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,820
When a baby puts that in its mouth, it’s like a phthalate lollypop.

1005
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,210
Phthalates have been linked to:

1006
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,910
renitis, eczema, asthma, allergies,

1007
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,200
premature birth, obesity, premature breast development,

1008
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:42,670
thyroid dysfunction, insulin resistance, lower sperm counts,

1009
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,110
decreased sperm motility, shorter ano-genital distance,

1010
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,120
undescended testicles and smaller penis size.

1011
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,860
It’s not just our Johnsons that are suffering,

1012
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,940
it’s our swimmers as well.

1013
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,040
Over the past several decades scientists have found

1014
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:04,530
the sperm counts have been dropping dramatically.

1015
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,630
Paul McCartney knew about this far earlier.

1016
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,880
You know “Yesterday.” The second part.

1017
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:14,890
“Suddenly, I’m not half the man I used to be.”

1018
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,020
We’re loosing dramatically fertility.

1019
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:25,030
So taking us compared to our fathers, we’re only half the men.

1020
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,960
What we found with the human study is that

1021
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,870
the moms that had greater exposure to phthalates

1022
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,780
were more likely to have sons with feminized reproductive organs

1023
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,330
was that those were at everyday levels of phthalates,

1024
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,280
those were not unusual exposure levels,

1025
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:43,270
those were at levels that people are being exposed to in the U.S. today.

1026
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,040
You’re constantly being washed in phthalates every day.

1027
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:51,740
That chemical is not required to be on the label for any personal care product.

1028
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,650
So if you see “fragrance” on the label,

1029
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,650
that is often phthalates.

1030
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,870
Basically it’s an industry loophole that prevents the consumer

1031
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,120
from finding out what ingredients are in the product.

1032
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,500
Fragrance can be a collection of hundreds of chemicals,

1033
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,480
or it might be just a handful, we really don’t know.

1034
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:14,050
One question that you may have is “Are phthalates safe?”

1035
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,700
The answer is “Yes.”

1036
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,470
My name is Steve Risotto of the American Chemistry Council,

1037
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,910
and we represent the companies that manufacture

1038
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,280
a family of versatile chemicals called “phthalates.”

1039
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,650
The University of Washington tested dozens of babies’ urine

1040
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,140
and found that the more of these baby products they used,

1041
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,050
creams, lotions, powders, shampoos,

1042
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,330
the higher their levels of man-made chemicals called phthalates.

1043
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:41,630
Phthalates are used in baby products to help the fragrance stay on the babies’ skin.

1044
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,080
Babies are not little adults.

1045
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,920
Nothing you learn about a chemical in an adult

1046
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:51,980
can be applied to tell you what that chemical will do in a baby.

1047
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,410
This was pretty shocking news for Anne and me.

1048
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,230
I mean wouldn’t anyone want to err on the side of caution?

1049
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,910
Um, I had a question about one of your products. It’s a baby lotion.

1050
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,800
It’s called Grins and Giggles.

1051
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:12,490
I wonder if it has any phthalates in it.

1052
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,140
I’m on hold.

1053
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:20,150
The music’s really nice though.

1054
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:28,220
Peter Coyote is a well-known actor.

1055
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,400
What most people don't know is that he's also

1056
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:33,680
a committed activist and has been for many years.

1057
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:35,570
He is one of few people in this country

1058
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,210
to have his body burden tested.

1059
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,930
That's a test that identifies and quantifies

1060
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,630
hundreds of chemicals present in your body.

1061
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,340
When the results came, I was really shocked,

1062
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:52,660
and then I was angry because I had in my body,

1063
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,750
stuff that should not be in a human being.

1064
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,450
And when I was reviewing it I thought -- quite literally --

1065
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,460
who gave these sons of bitches permission to poison the commons?

1066
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,220
I decided to do my own Body Burden experiment

1067
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:11,140
I wanted to see how much my levels of BPA and phthalates

1068
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:17,150
would go up simply by using normal, everyday, supposedly safe consumer products.

1069
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,890
I did a pretest to find out what my normal levels were.

1070
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,840
And then I spent two days in a friend’s apartment eating canned food,

1071
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:30,990
microwaving in plastic, using shampoo, lotion, deodorant, air fresheners.

1072
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,490
These are all products that will supposedly be safe for my baby.

1073
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,180
You know this place just needed a little... something.

1074
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,390
Air Fresh. Freshen it up....

1075
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,400
I’m about to shampoo with kids’ shampoo.

1076
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:54,600
This is all stuff that people use pretty much every day.

1077
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:01,600
This is my last supper. I don’t get to eat like this very often. I don’t feel good.

1078
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,390
At the end, I got tested again.

1079
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,790
By the way, whatever the levels are, they’re reversible.

1080
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,800
So, it’s never too late to stop ingesting, absorbing and inhaling these chemicals.

1081
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,250
And now we’re just waiting for the results.

1082
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:23,220
Hi Catherine, it’s Jeb Berrier.

1083
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:28,940
Calling you back from the movie Bag It, the documentary about plastic.

1084
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:33,750
And I’m really hoping to get an interview with you,

1085
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,370
about, specifically about BPA and phthalates.

1086
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,560
We are keeping chemicals afloat in our environment

1087
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:45,520
in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence from other countries.

1088
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:49,960
Because the information is being systematically withheld from us.

1089
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,830
Who are the people that allow this? They’re supposed to be our leaders.

1090
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,840
They’re supposed to be mediating between the needs of the citizens and the needs of the corporations.

1091
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,840
Not giving the corporations everything they ask for and asking the citizens to pay the bills.

1092
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:10,850
If you don’t want a deadly poison in the biosphere, you don’t make it. Period. End of story.

1093
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Okay. I finally got my results.It’s 144 pages of numbers.

1094
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:25,190
So, I am at the house of Dr. Theo Colborn. World renowned environmental health analyst,

1095
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,590
and she is going to help me decipher what my test results mean.

1096
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,240
Your results were very interesting. Why don’t we start with bisphenol A?

1097
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:37,590
Okay. So, my BPA levels went up 110 times.

1098
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,850
Yeah, that is high, I’ll be quite frank with you. You really spiked.

1099
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:46,770
Now these are the phthalates. This one went up 53 times.

1100
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:52,780
Okay now, here we are. This one went up from 2.7 to 143.

1101
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:57,560
So if you sum this overall and then take the difference,

1102
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:01,570
you had about 11 times increase of phthalates.

1103
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:07,580
If Anne who’s pregnant had those levels, what would that mean? For the baby?

1104
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:17,650
It could mean that that baby would be partially feminized. In other words, reduced  ano-genital distance.

1105
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,590
You know. Maybe a smaller penis.

1106
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,390
Wow.

1107
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,870
Yeah. I always feel uncomfortable talking to people

1108
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,870
who are expecting children or planning to have children.

1109
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,140
Because this is the critical period,

1110
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,330
from fertilization to birth.

1111
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,670
As a citizen, don’t you feel

1112
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,590
that we have enough evidence now to say we should not be using these products.

1113
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,190
Absolutely. I don’t want any of these in my body.

1114
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,840
I don’t want any of these in the mother of my child’s body.

1115
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,440
I don’t want them in my child’s body.

1116
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,610
No. They’re going to be.

1117
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:53,060
It’s not about being against chemistry or against plastic;

1118
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:59,070
it’s about being against stupid plastic. Silly, stinking, toxic stuff.

1119
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,230
When you reach the point where it becomes a public health issue --

1120
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,110
and this is a major public health issue at the population level --

1121
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,680
the government has to step in.

1122
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:14,590
But I will frankly say, government is no longer government -- it’s corporate control.

1123
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,870
What we’re asking for is for a law that will make sure

1124
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,590
that chemicals are tested before they go into products.

1125
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,840
We want to be able to go into a store and buy any product.

1126
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,390
The products on the shelf should be safe for us.

1127
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,870
We have lost a whole generation of children already

1128
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,060
because we haven’t even begun to take action on one of these chemicals.

1129
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,820
Though you may feel that going up against corporations is impossible,

1130
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,770
and that government moves way too slowly,

1131
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:45,780
what we cannot forget is that we are the government, that we influence industry.

1132
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,930
Thanks to the outcries of concerned parents,

1133
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,660
a law was passed in 2009 banning six phthalates from children’s toys.

1134
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,810
And due to consumer demands, Wal-Mart and Toys R Us

1135
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,640
decided to remove all baby products containing BPA from their shelves.

1136
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:07,600
This led six different baby bottle manufacturers to completely remove BPA from their baby bottles.

1137
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:13,610
I’m trying to find out whether people in town would support a fee on paper or plastic shopping bags.

1138
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:21,550
Yeah to try to reduce the amount people use disposable shopping bags.

1139
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,590
Go big or go home.

1140
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,190
Would you guys support some kind of measure in town....

1141
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:37,200
Remember that part about how we were expecting a baby? Well, it’s happening.

1142
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,610
Well, I did start out making a movie about plastic bags,

1143
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:26,790
but like any journey, things developed and changed along the way,

1144
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,590
it became about so much more.

1145
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,550
I still think plastic is an incredible substance.

1146
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,450
But it’s not supposed to end up in our oceans or in our bodies.

1147
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:40,640
And just to make sure I really, really got all this, Anne got pregnant;

1148
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:45,970
and it became about the fate of our child and all our children.

1149
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:50,190
I’m still an average guy... but even average people can make changes.

1150
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,570
You know, everybody keeps asking me: So what can I do? Well.

1151
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,750
Here are some things we’ve come up with while making this film.

1152
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,590
Things you can do, too. Starting today, right now.

1153
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,690
You can cut way WAY back on single-use disposables.

1154
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,670
Don’t drink bottled water.

1155
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,390
Choose products with less packaging

1156
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,690
When you need something, buy it used.

1157
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,640
Think outside the bag -- bring your own container.

1158
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,690
Buy less stuff.

1159
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,990
Remember, recycling comes after reducing and reusing.

1160
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,190
And how about volunteering in your community to do litter clean ups?

1161
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,380
But most important, you can simplify... your... life.

1162
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:39,390
I keep coming back to how my grandparents lived.

1163
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,890
They didn’t have all this plastic in their lives, but that didn’t seem to make them any less happy.

1164
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,890
When it comes down to changing your life and living with less plastic,

1165
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:54,470
And look at that: foam cups.

1166
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,890
Stay back.

1167
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:01,900
We just have to rethink how we do things. It all comes down to common sense.

1168
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:09,390
Well there you have it. The end of one odyssey, the beginning of another.

1169
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,130
We’ve decided to live life with a little less plastic.

1170
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:15,940
How about you? Is your life a little too plastic?

1171
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:21,590
Cause if it is, there’s only one thing you can do about it...

1172
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,600
Bag it.

1173
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:34,900
Alright. I think I got it that time.

1174
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,020
Buy bulk food, don’t buy small packaged things

1175
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:12,030
and suddenly your trash is really minimized.

1176
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:22,840
Hey look everybody! It’s a single-use disposable camera.

1177
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:28,850
Use it once, and throw it away!

1178
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:40,400
I’d put no plastic into a microwave or an oven.

1179
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
When you don’t use a lot of plastic... you eat better.

1180
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,090
That’s my girl.

1181
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,250
You really should think, when making decisions,

1182
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,800
of how this is not only going to impact yourself and your children,

1183
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:14,810
but your children’s children’s children. Out seven generations.

1184
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:26,620
Look at that. No plastic bag in the bathroom garbage can. You don’t need it.

1185
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:33,300
Plastic’s a useful thing, but single use plastics are just instant garbage and... we don’t need it.

1186
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:46,110
Maybe you’re forced to eat a plastic bag if you use one, to know how the fish feel.

1187
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:55,100
That’s a good idea.

1188
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,240
I’m still waiting to hear back from the American Chemistry Council.

1189
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:33,250
I’m starting to think that maybe they don’t want to talk to me.

1190
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,900
Babies don’t come in plastic.
