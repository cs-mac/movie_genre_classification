0
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,526
All right, if you'll just
put this under your belt.

1
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:08,822
- What?
- Actually, just--

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,881
Sorry.

3
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,113
lt's okay, it's still dark outside.

4
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,538
lt's fine.

5
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:27,653
lt's fine. It's dark outside.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,270
You motherfucker.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,847
Check out the frame.
It looks good l think.

8
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,307
Yeah. It's cool.

9
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:45,532
All right. Here we go.

11
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,839
Darkthrone was the first

12
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:57,349
to release an album
in this black metal genre

13
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:02,930
and Gylve was the leader
of the group, so to speak.

14
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,170
He's more like a philosopher
than somebody who...

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,749
more than an ideologist.

16
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:16,909
The band was very successful
and in many ways was the band.

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,330
Gylve as l said is a special person
with special goals,

18
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,189
and it's impossible to know
what his goals are.

19
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:26,849
He...

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,349
He's successful at what he's doing.

21
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,499
l guess he's happy with that.

22
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Have you been standing
there the whole time?

23
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:41,630
They busted me
on the fucking tear gas.

24
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,650
They didn't find any drugs,
of course.

25
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,620
So...

26
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,089
l had to say,
''Yes, l had the tear gas.''

27
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,750
And...

28
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,739
l gotta pay a fine. Big Deal.

29
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,719
l had to drop my pants.

30
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,690
They really were hoping
for the big bust, man.

31
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,299
l don't know.

32
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,479
Funny thing, you know,

33
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,080
they always wear
these intimidating gloves

34
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,460
so that you're supposed to ''fess up''
before they start looking up your ass.

35
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,229
But they don't look up your ass.

36
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,060
lt's a trick.

37
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,359
Norway. It's beautiful.

38
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,320
lt's like New Zealand
only just grimmer.

39
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,429
The Norwegian personality is

40
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,859
when you stand in line for the bus,

41
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,589
you don't stand too close.

42
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,630
You keep a couple of meters
away from the next guy.

43
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,830
l think that says it all.

44
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,839
They're going to give medicine to people.

45
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,989
They're announcing it.
People are like, ''Oh! Where is it!''

46
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,479
lt's amazing that people
are eating this trash.

47
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,700
Chemical. All the time, you know.

48
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,130
Sleeping pills and all this.

49
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,539
lt's like a chemical lobotomy, you know.

50
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,130
l just started going really musically.

51
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,380
And direct my interest
into more and more music.

52
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,299
Music, music, music.

53
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,820
And he was more into politics.
So we just sort of--

54
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,380
...took different paths.

55
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,760
The contact just faded into obscurity.

56
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,600
The thing that made
this music different

57
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,150
was that we rebelled
against the traditional song structure.

58
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:42,270
But still, you know, he made
an incredible impact with his early albums.

59
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,419
And l'm eternally grateful for that.

60
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,929
l wanted the music to be
more epic or storytelling.

61
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,069
He just recorded,

62
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,779
like, basically everything
he did himself.

63
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,309
He was right on the money

64
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,689
when it came to
the black metal sound.

65
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,539
That was the shit, man.

66
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:12,980
And that is what made this new--

67
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,289
so-called new music style different.

68
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,539
Because that is what
the Darkthrone did

69
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,770
that is what Burzum did.

70
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,510
And we were like the first
who did this in this period.

71
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,880
lt's been years
since we had contact.

72
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,860
l tried to send him some music

73
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,250
but it wasn't what he was searching for.

74
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,750
He was searching for some music

75
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,799
and he couldn't really
explain what it had been.

76
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,340
So l just gave up on it.

77
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,480
l'm kind of like

78
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,569
you know, what's it
called, ambivalence?

79
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,539
l have an ambivalent feeling
in this context

80
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,000
because in one sense
of course, it's hard

81
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,890
to have to be without freedom to move
wherever l want and stuff like that.

82
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,020
But in another sense
it's kind of positive

83
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,569
because l have the opportunity
to, like, read books

84
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,120
and focus on more important things.

85
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,100
lt's like a--

86
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,470
l consider it like
a stay in a monastery.

87
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,350
ln our contemporary society,

88
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,679
youth are pretty much lost.

89
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,179
They have no direction.

90
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,470
Nobody is telling them what to do.

91
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,610
That is, people are teIling
them what to do

92
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:51,240
but the youth have an instinct
telling them this is wrong, you know?

93
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,919
People are telling them
that Christianity is good.

94
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,140
People are telling them
that the USA is good.

95
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,980
NATO is good.
Our democracy is good.

96
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,970
But we know, if not intellectually,

97
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:06,600
we know instinctly that this is wrong.

98
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,709
This is fucking revenge.

99
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,980
We recorded the first
black metal album

100
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,039
A Blaze In the Northern Sky,

101
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,199
sent it to Peaceville, and they were like,

102
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,390
''We're remixing this.
What the hell are you guys doing?''

103
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,610
You know?
''This is black metal.

104
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,150
This is what black metal is supposed
to sound like.'' It was, like, all cold.

105
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,230
lt's cold right now as well.

106
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:44,140
l said, ''l'm not remixing the album.

107
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,520
''This is what black metal sounds like
and if you don't want it,

108
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,380
''then we'll just make
Euronymous release it

109
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,329
"on his Deathlike Silence label.''

110
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,620
And then Peaceville said
''No. We can't have that.

111
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,189
''Because we will lose face if a new band
in our stall is leaving us.

112
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,439
''So we better just fucking release it,
you know?''

113
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,709
And now they're really happy about that,
money-wise, l guess.

114
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,049
We just went with our hearts and we thought
we were going to sell, like,

115
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,709
maybe 1500 copies of that
Blaze In the Northern Sky album.

116
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,429
We thought people would react
the same way Peaceville did.

117
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,360
Basically we knew that there were

118
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,220
just a few people listening to
and being ''black metal,''

119
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,720
but people picked up on it.

120
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,250
And that's one of the albums
now that is a classic within the style,

121
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,980
so it still sells a lot
ten years down the line.

122
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,809
When l recorded my album,
you know, l told the producer,

123
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,120
''Give me the worst
microphone you have.''

124
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:49,480
We set up the drums, you know,
we didn't do anything

125
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,350
to make the song sound
any particular-- special.

126
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,990
You know, ten minutes
everything was ready.

127
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,809
And he was, you know,
''Don't you want to do anything?''

128
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,490
You know, you always
have to adjust

129
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,169
the sound of the drums
and everything.

130
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,860
No! Because it was like a rebellion

131
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,740
against this...

132
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,150
good production.

133
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,470
So...

134
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:16,360
We called it ''necro-sound,''
you know, ''corpse sound''

135
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,169
because it's supposed to
sound the worst possible.

136
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,490
So actually l ended up
with a headset as a microphone.

137
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,390
That was the worst
we could find.

138
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,000
And used that as a microphone.

139
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,419
So-- And we used
this tiny Marshall amplifier,

140
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,740
it was this big, because that was
the worst amplifier we could find.

141
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,240
lt was terrible sound, it was--

142
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,199
We had, like, an album cover
with our guitarist,

143
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,750
an eerie shot with corpse-paint on it,

144
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,990
and at that time
every death metal album,

145
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:06,459
every thrash metal album

146
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,620
basically had painted covers,
you know, ''cover art.''

147
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,980
And people hadn't seen,
like, photos.

148
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,409
Well, the underground knew that Mayhem
used corpse-paint and shit,

149
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,299
but people in general looking
through the vinyls and CD racks,

150
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,209
they were just like,
''What the hell is this?

151
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,049
A blast from the past?
This is cold!''

152
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,340
The way l perceived Mayhem
was fucking magic for me.

153
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,039
l'm still listening
to the Deathcrush album.

154
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,319
That's probably
my favorite Mayhem album.

155
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:47,010
They released Deathcrush
and they just lived

156
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,309
on reputation only in the late '80s.

157
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,539
Mayhem started out
in '84 l guess, around there.

158
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,520
And it was the only Norwegian band,
so it's sort of special for us.

159
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,069
l went to rehearsals and came
like, awestruck back.

160
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,610
They did a show in 1989
which is legendary.

161
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,510
Euronymous invented
the typical Norwegian black metal riff.

162
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,679
lt's sort of derived from Bathory,

163
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,350
but it was a new way of playing a riff

164
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,049
that had really not been done

165
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,390
and not been stylized by anyone before.

166
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,100
That's what Euronymous did.

167
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,610
You have a chord.
You don't play one and one,

168
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:48,350
you play one and one
up and down

169
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,400
and you have the notes
cling together

170
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,909
so that you have
the fucking eerie notes

171
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,959
and they all string together

172
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,360
creating this incredible, eerie sound.

173
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,269
lt sends fucking chills down your spine.

174
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,130
l started in Mayhem in March 1988.

175
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,860
When l first met Euronymous,
l gave him, like,

176
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,300
a demo tape of me playing the drums.

177
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,050
He listened to it maybe five minutes

178
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:21,290
and he heard it was like double bass

179
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,429
and blast beats in t,here
and it was like

180
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,269
''Yeah, okay. You're in the band.''

181
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,459
The next day l actually
moved to their location

182
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:41,219
which was, like
30 minutes outside of! Oslo.

183
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,810
l met the other guys.

184
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,570
l met Necrobutcher.

185
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,630
And of course, l met Dead
which was a Swedish guy.

186
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,540
l never had the chance
to see Mayhem with Dead,

187
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,659
but Demonaz did so he can
say something about it.

188
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,870
Yeah. l saw Mayhem in Oslo
with Dead.

189
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,310
And he had make-up.

190
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,659
That was the first show
l saw ever with make-up.

191
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,610
And didn't they

192
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:52,900
carry Dead in in a coffin?

193
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,110
No, they didn't.
They were supposed to do that.

194
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,759
They were supposed to do that, yeah.

195
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,189
So we were really waiting
for that but it didn't happen.

196
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,070
But he had this sacrifice knife

197
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,169
which he was cutting himself with.

198
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,800
lt was a good show.

199
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,370
When it's cold

200
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,999
and when it's dark

201
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:16,449
the freezing moon can obsess you.

202
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,820
He was extremely depressed, really.

203
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,900
Just dreaming of Transylvania

204
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,679
and vampires
and all this gothic imagery,

205
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,449
and it's an escape
just like computer games

206
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,310
and role-playing games,
and that was his escape.

207
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:36,530
Come on, Liepzig!

208
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,019
Come on! Join us!

209
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:43,949
Pure fucking Armageddon.

210
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,189
We agreed that l should send him
some ammo for his shotgun.

211
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,919
He didn't have any ammo.

212
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,969
And l did when l came back home
and a month later he shot himself.

213
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:58,989
Many people speculate
that Aarseth himself killed Dead.

214
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,340
Per Ohlin. It's one of the many rumors
in this movement.

215
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,650
There are a lot of rumors,.
l don't think that's true

216
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,749
simply because he was
out of town when it happened.

217
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,620
And when he came back home
he didn't have a key,

218
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,709
they only had a couple of keys t,o the house
and he didn't have it

219
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,519
so he had to crawl
in the open window.

220
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,749
And when he crawled in
he found Dead--

221
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:26,630
Dead dead in the bed

222
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,580
with his, you know, his brains
blown out, literally.

223
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,780
He shot himself in the forehead.

224
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,689
The brain had fallen
out from his skull.

225
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,290
lt was, you know, grotesque.

226
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,509
And the first thing he did
was not to call the cops.

227
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,419
lt was

228
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:45,699
''Where's my photo equipment?''

229
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,959
l'm born in Bergen in 1973.

230
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,070
l grew up in an idyllic society, really.

231
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,130
Homogeneous, no crime.

232
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,249
Everything was basically perfect.

233
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,530
We had stables with girls
riding horses.

234
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,070
We were playing on the outside.

235
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,300
There were no problems.

236
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,969
But at a certain point,
when we grow older,

237
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,699
of course there were problems,
but we didn't see them.

238
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,530
That's basically the truth, eh

239
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:39,400
But when you grow older
you start to see that things

240
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,590
isn't the way you want it to be.

241
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,509
McDonald's didn't appear
until '91 or '92, and when it did

242
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,429
we actually took a rifle

243
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,070
and a bicycle and we bicycled--

244
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,850
Rode our bikes up to McDonald's

245
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:58,449
and we set down and started to fire
on their windows.

246
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,209
You know, we were sneaking up
and ''Boom!''

247
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,769
We were shooting at McDonald's.

248
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:07,070
We stockpiled weapons,
munitions to prepare for war.

249
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:12,330
Because we not only suspected that
there might be a third world war,

250
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,499
we hoped that there would
be a third world war.

251
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,280
Not because we enjoyed
destruction so much

252
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,140
but because we knew that if you want
to build something new,

253
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,409
you have to destroy the old first.

254
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:46,269
The ballad album of Nazareth.

255
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,030
Oh! Testament, The Ritual.

256
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,530
What a cool album.

257
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,110
This place has a cool story to it
when it comes to Darkthrone.

258
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,969
Because, well
Iet's get out of the fire.

259
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,769
lt was a question of getting, like,
a Dictaphone or something to record riffs.

260
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,429
Because me and Ted, we had
like, of course, you know,

261
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,519
we recorded rehearsals
on this fucking tape deck.

262
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,919
And that broke down.

263
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,800
So l'm sitting here in Oslo
and l'm thinking, well,

264
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,070
l probably should get a Dictaphone.

265
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,949
And so l get in touch
with Sigurd and he says,

266
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:29,199
''Well, l can get you
this fucker for 2000.

267
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,550
lt's got, like, four tracks,
it's digital and everything.''

268
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,969
And l'm saying, ''Hold it.

269
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,509
''You know, l was thinking
more along the lines

270
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,810
''of a little-- to get the riffs in.''

271
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,509
And then l come here, you know,
and l find this old tape deck.

272
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,159
lt can't even play out, it just goes--

273
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,719
but it can record
and l bought it for 50 kroner.

274
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:53,040
Fucking sweet.

275
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,050
l refuse to...

276
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:02,880
stand court-martialed

277
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,709
for making this whole

278
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,239
underground movement
into a trend thing.

279
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:15,030
lf it's anyone,

280
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,890
it's not us.

281
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,739
But l guess most people
would say that.

282
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,969
That's what people
usually ask, you know?

283
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,030
Like, how the hell did it happen?

284
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,919
l guess l got to buy that fucking helmet.

285
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:07,130
The mission statement was not escaping
the death metal trend.

286
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,600
But definitely we were
thinking of not stepping

287
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:13,840
in the garish footsteps

288
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,880
of what became commercial death metal.

289
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,729
Well, what do you know?

290
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:21,800
What are we looking at here?

291
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,300
l was thinking what is really

292
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,290
the culturally relevant
phenomenon of Norway?

293
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:11,669
And l just couldn't find any.

294
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,040
l think Norway is kind of exploding

295
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,679
with all this kind of mediocre
cultural activity

296
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,890
and then if there are
other relevant phenomena,

297
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,489
then they are usually
just completely ignored,

298
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,600
which is happening with this Norwegian
black metal here in Norway.

299
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,739
What interested me the most,was both
the visual aesthetics

300
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,929
this kind of stereotype
with this corpse-paint

301
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,820
that you can make it into
kind of a visual stereotype

302
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:38,370
that both is something you
feel you've seen before

303
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,459
but is not quite like what
you have seen before.

304
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,169
This Transylvanian Hunger photo,

305
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:49,150
if you compare that to ''The Scream'',
there is so much visual similarities.

306
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,229
And l don't think it's such a far-fetched
reference as many people think.

307
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:59,830
With Munch in Norway there has been
this kind of fear of Munch

308
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,689
the fear of his emotional excessiveness
and, kind of

309
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:09,199
the fear of this easy genius,
and this very, very extreme, Norwegian person.

310
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:12,070
And l think the only thing
that really had a relevance

311
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,130
to the kind of emotional content

312
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,650
of what Edvard Munch was
is Norwegian black metal.

313
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:21,130
l have this tour now which will be
four one-man shows

314
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,269
in different European museums
which will have a black metal theme.

315
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:27,810
lt was a huge shop.

316
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,729
At one point

317
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,860
Count Grishnackh was
living in the cellar.

318
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,880
Bard ''Faust'' was living
behind the counter, sort of.

319
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,689
And Euronymous himself lived there
in a small hideaway up in--

320
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,090
Like, he had a little, small--

321
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,019
Say this piece right there
was removable.

322
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,929
He was living, sleeping
up in the fucking roof.

323
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,560
We used to sit in a sofa
behind the desk

324
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,880
in a part of the shop
that was not used.

325
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,590
So it was like in a dark corner
so to speak.

326
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,320
You know, and he was drinking,
we were talking

327
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:11,840
and these heavy metal guys came in,

328
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,219
you know, with nails
all over their jackets

329
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,560
because they had the impression that you
have to have nails, you know?

330
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,669
That's a part of the game.

331
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,979
And...

332
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,669
So, we could sit there, like
talk about everything really'.

333
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,320
Like cornflakes. We were discussing--
Gylve asked me, like,

334
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,530
''So, how do you like
your cornflakes?

335
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,330
''Do you like them crispy?

336
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,540
''Or do you like them soft?''

337
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,509
And l said, ''Well, l like them crispy.''

338
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:43,969
And he said, ''No, no, no, no, no.
It's better when they're really soft.

339
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:46,729
''You have to put the milk
and let it just rest for a while,

340
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,550
''and then you eat it.''

341
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,189
And then these heavy metal guys would enter
and we stopped talking

342
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,780
because, you know, we didn't really want
to talk to them, you know?

343
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,820
We did not want to get to know them.

344
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,919
And of course he was, you know,
the drummer of Darkthrone

345
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:02,790
the boss in Darkthrone.

346
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,850
And l was playing in Burzum.

347
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,030
And we were like their--
some sort of idols of some sort.

348
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,590
So, they were watching us and...

349
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,199
if we ever talked to one of them

350
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,509
they boasted to their friends that, you know,

351
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,249
''Gylve of Darkthrone talked to me.''

352
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,400
Of course, he rarely did
because he had--

353
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,419
You know, it was like pretty much
we shared the opinion

354
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,909
that these guys weren't
particularly interesting, you know?

355
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,400
lt's sort of stigmatizing
to talk about heritage.

356
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,090
You know, it's--

357
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,079
l mean for most
of the European countries,

358
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:00,559
l mean, Christianity
more or less erased

359
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,650
our original cultures anyway.

360
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,650
There's more chaos, war, pollution now

361
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,249
than ever before in our recorded history.

362
00:35:12,749 --> 00:35:16,289
Of course, we might have
known a period

363
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,119
with even worse conditions

364
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,410
but the Christians burned all the records

365
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,809
that could tell us about it anyway,

366
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,590
like in the Library ofAlexandria.

367
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:31,280
Wherever the Catholics or Protestants
or other Christians came

368
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,380
they destroyed the culture.

369
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:34,930
They ruined the culture.

370
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,340
They burned the culture.

371
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,749
And they burned the records
of these cultures.

372
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,389
That includes the European cultures.

373
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,389
That includes African cultures.

374
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,639
Asian cultures.
American cultures.

375
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,889
Wherever they were,
they destroyed everything.

376
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,669
They want to replace our culture
with Americanization

377
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:56,910
with, you know,
the Judeo-Christian cultures.

378
00:35:57,499 --> 00:36:00,309
Christianity is the root to all problems
in the modern world.

379
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:05,539
lt's hard to know what to do

380
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,769
to oppose something.

381
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,340
Because dissident voices

382
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:15,479
are not tolerated
in contemporary society.

383
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,369
l think it's

384
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,479
to a big extent

385
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,919
nauseating,

386
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,059
you know, to see,

387
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:40,070
you know, the beauty
of specific cultures,

388
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,240
you know, being contaminated

389
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:49,530
by the not-so-beautiful
facets of other cultures.

390
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,419
But at the same time, l think it's

391
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,660
a process of--

392
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,539
lt's a step on the way to returning

393
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:01,360
to some sort of primeval source.

394
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,169
Everybody can relate to Odin
and Thor and Freya in Norway

395
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:55,979
because it's our religion.

396
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,150
We are not Christian.

397
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,809
Christianity is a Jewish religion.

398
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,329
Christianity was originally a Jewish sect.

399
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,499
Baptism is all about a symbolic, ritual murder
of the non-Jewish

400
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:08,340
of the Gentile.

401
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,200
They murder the Gentile child,

402
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,169
and then they call the Jewish name

403
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,269
that's supposed to replace the pagan soul.

404
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,889
Originally, the place was
an old pagan holy site.

405
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:36,490
lt was on top of a hill where
our forefathers used to celebrate the sun.

406
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,720
What the Christians did
was to move this church

407
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:46,030
from another place, and put it
not close to this holy site

408
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,030
but on top of it.

409
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,499
ln the midst of the circle.

410
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,910
Actually breaking up the circle.

411
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,959
And on the pagan horgh,

412
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,180
they put a big stone cross.

413
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,769
So, if they have no respect

414
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,709
for the Norwegian culture,

415
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,849
why on earth should Norwegians
respect their culture?

416
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,550
The intended result was to give people
a shock to make them open their eyes.

417
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,209
lt's like if you detonate a bomb,
they will open their eyes

418
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:05,289
for a moment, you know?
''What happened?''

419
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,519
lt was Varg who first set fire to a church.

420
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,329
But there were a lot
of church burnings.

421
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,809
ln, l guess... Was it '92, '93?

422
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:03,070
My least favorite artist
is from Central America.

423
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,970
lt is the woman who paints
all the women

424
00:42:07,499 --> 00:42:09,780
with very strong eyebrows.

425
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:12,450
She's way political

426
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,030
and l know for a fact that in Nicaragua,

427
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:26,729
for instance, l mean
the artists were persecuted,

428
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:32,130
and they always painted,
like, these really...

429
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,410
close to nature things with strong colors.

430
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:39,749
l mean, it's the perfect...

431
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,329
disease of being repressed.

432
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,610
l mean, you want everything to be shiny.

433
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,740
No, l like--

434
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,139
l more like the wealthy and troubled art

435
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,349
that comes from...

436
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,110
the exhaustion of easy life.

437
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,189
lt surprised me a little bit
when l felt the, uh...

438
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,059
not friction, but the panic

439
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,780
that people had against modern arrt.

440
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:26,849
And ''that's just something
that they threw on the canvas'' mind-frame.

441
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,019
And again l'm not a shrink,
l don't know why l reacted to that,

442
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,990
but l was like
''what the hell's wrong with it?''

443
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,490
Because l grew up--
It's my parents too.

444
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,860
They were always like that.

445
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:44,180
They were going, like,

446
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,840
''Call a spade a spade,''
and all that ordeal.

447
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,930
So maybe,

448
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,599
through the way they raised me--

449
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,439
And everyone wants to be
against their parents.

450
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,680
l never felt l needed that

451
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:01,349
but l guess l didn't realize it.

452
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,630
But that's the way l came to like modern art.

453
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,990
My parents being very conservative

454
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,169
and they wanted the,
as we call it in Norway,

455
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,369
the moose in the sunset sort of painting.

456
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:17,950
''Well, at least that's a moose in a sunset.

457
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,079
''l know what the hell that means.''

458
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,400
lt's not like l don't see these images

459
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,979
every fucking day.

460
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,669
l know the location of that
because l've been there, you know?

461
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,539
lt's like from where l'm from.

462
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,280
ls there more?

463
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,139
Not black metal Mickey?

464
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,720
Can you just use Mickey Rourke like that?

465
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,939
That is truly insane.

466
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,180
lt's just going to be decaf
on this guy from now on.

467
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,389
Thought maybe it would
just be a piece of paper with his name.

468
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:41,930
Nothing on the back.

469
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,090
Just-- Just ''here's my name.''

470
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,539
How do you like that?

471
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:58,990
Can l have a glass of water?
l fucking need it.

472
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,970
No more questions, guys?

473
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:58,309
Even l'm starting to feel
like having a smoke now.

474
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,639
We weren't involved in any
of those activities

475
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,869
with church burning and stuff.

476
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,660
We knew about it.

477
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:42,090
l mean, we thought it was...

478
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:48,320
quite entertaining.

479
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:14,700
To Aarseth everything was about image.

480
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,729
And he wanted to appear extreme.

481
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:20,300
He wanted people to think
of him as being extreme.

482
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:22,169
And the most extreme of them all.

483
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,419
But he didn't want to be extreme.

484
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,570
And he wasn't really extreme.

485
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,300
He gave people the impression
that he was organizing all of it.

486
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,180
That was what he wanted it to look like.

487
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,320
He started to talk
about this ''black metal mafia,'' this mob.

488
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,820
And he wanted it to look
as if he was some ''godfather''

489
00:50:43,419 --> 00:50:46,079
of some organization.

490
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,150
l pointed at the fact that,
''Hey, he sure has a big mouth.

491
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,970
''But is he doing anything?''

492
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:57,229
And the others would think
''Well, actually, he doesn't.'''

493
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,249
So, you know...

494
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:32,059
l was frustrated when l realized
that this movement was, you know,

495
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,220
still the same bunch
of brain-dead metal-heads.

496
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:39,320
And l wanted to do
something about it.

497
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,610
So l tried to force them
into taking another stand

498
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,059
by giving an interview to a newspaper.

499
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,220
l told him that we were behind
the church burnings and all this.

500
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,510
And l told him l could
tell him that because, of course

501
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,340
l have not done anything.

502
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:57,459
And, of course

503
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,160
he changed everything,
and instead of printing what l told him,

504
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,979
he went to the police and got me arrested.

505
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,119
And then he printed his interpretation
of what l said in the newspaper.

506
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:02,530
l could not do anything about it.
l was in prison.

507
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:07,030
And of course all of the other
journalists interviewed him

508
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:10,360
while l was in prison and l couldn't
say anything about it.

509
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,930
So his version was like the truth.
Everybody copied it, you know?

510
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,099
The police claim that l made
others burn churches.

511
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:23,360
That is, l accompanied them and, like,
''Come on.''

512
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,919
You know, ''The church.''

513
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,450
Were you worried about your friends
getting into trouble?

514
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,070
No. We were zoning at the time.
l didn't worry

515
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,209
about anything basically.

516
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,349
l guess l wanted to set fire myself.

517
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:06,119
l never went that far, you know.

518
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,430
But, no.

519
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,700
l mean, the only thing that was
worrying is when

520
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:18,320
it was all over the news.

521
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,729
And then we had something to worry about.

522
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,470
lt didn't turn out the way l wanted it to be,

523
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,160
but it sure changed a lot.

524
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,269
They started to pretend that there was
some Satanic movement

525
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,139
and conspiracy in society,

526
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:34,470
that the people who were burning churches
were really Satanists

527
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:38,160
who planned to spread evil, all this crap.

528
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,729
And when l got out of prison,
there was nothing l could do about it.

529
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,919
l told them this is nothing
to do with Satanism.

530
00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:46,269
And they never paid any attention
to what l said.

531
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:49,849
Even Aarseth was never a Satanist.
Nobody were Satanists,

532
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,050
but this was all about demonizing
a movement.

533
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,220
They wanted us to be Satanists.

534
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,769
You know, the moment the newspapers
started writing about it, it was imitated.

535
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:21,889
The problem was really that this
misinterpretation made up the foundation

536
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:26,180
of a completely different
movement of, you know,

537
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:28,939
15-year-old copycats burning churches,

538
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,249
and spraying these Satanic symbols
on the churches

539
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,680
because they thought that that's
what it was all about.

540
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,939
And, you know, that was the result.

541
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,309
And that was a result of the media coverage.

542
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:09,160
The movement, the small

543
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:13,439
but pinpointed things we had in mind,

544
00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:18,919
got blown into this big trend,

545
00:58:19,669 --> 00:58:20,780
big following thing.

546
00:58:23,939 --> 00:58:26,869
l guess the sales of black lipstick
went through the roof.

547
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:57,680
l like this shot, eh?

548
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,220
This is also not bad when he stands like this
you see the nails.

549
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,150
This is also kind of good

550
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,849
when he goes in and out of the frame.

551
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:21,039
This is good.
This l want to use.

552
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,269
This is Gylve in the forest.
Can you slow it down?

553
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,130
l think visually the best one would be
Gylve from Darkthrone.

554
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:42,619
'Cause l think he has visually the best look.

555
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:46,439
But he would never do it, huh?

556
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,360
Legacy Magazine, Diana.

557
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:11,039
Hey, hey! It's Fenriz.

558
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,689
- Hi.
- Hi. What's up?

559
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,360
Are you having a great Friday?

560
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,590
Yes, a little crazy because it was
a long night yesterday.

561
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,800
Okay. Let's start off with the interview.

562
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,229
l heard that in your private life, what is truly
quite a shock for a lot of Darkthrone fans,

563
01:00:30,999 --> 01:00:34,809
you're into house and techno music.
Is this true?

564
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:41,450
Oh sure. l was just listening to a mix CD
for Monika Kruse last night.

565
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:46,389
You should know Monika Kruse.

566
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,729
She's been in the German
techno scene for a long time.

567
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,110
We in Oslo, we are not secluding.

568
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:58,410
We usually know about a whole lot
of different sorts of styles of music.

569
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,249
We're not fucking living in a trailer camp
just listening to Anthrax,

570
01:01:02,769 --> 01:01:04,610
if you know what l'm saying.

571
01:01:04,939 --> 01:01:08,720
We like a lot of different music
but l guess l'm the first one

572
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:12,090
who started to say that l like
a lot of different music.

573
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:17,760
But the first one who really went out
and said all that shit was Euronymous himself.

574
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,800
He was always into electronic music.
And he said it.

575
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,400
He even had Conrad Scnitzler
do the fucking intro

576
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,900
for the Deathcrush album, you know?

577
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,900
Well, what l wanted to say is that l hope

578
01:01:29,229 --> 01:01:32,630
that you do not have the intention
to bring out a house album.

579
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,030
No. That's the whole prob--
That's the whole thing, you know.

580
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:40,369
ln Darkthrone we are listening to
so many other styles of music

581
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:45,010
but we will not let that enter
into the Darkthrone concept.

582
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:46,900
lt is not Darkthrone.

583
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:49,689
Then, we shall not be influenced by it,
but we can listen to it.

584
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,919
Other people, they hear two electronic albums
they like, and they suddenly go like,

585
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:57,419
''Oooh! Maybe we can put this in the metal!
Maybe that will be cool!''

586
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,289
Hey, that's not Darkthrone.

587
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,869
But l know a whole lot of people
that have been doing that.

588
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:19,079
Wow! Wow! You think so?
That is so interesting

589
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:23,090
because l think, like, eight years ago
l didn't really do provoking shit

590
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:27,160
because Christian people were not going
to read my lyrics, right?

591
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,499
So they were not going to be provocative.

592
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,010
What l wrote then, l see now in hindsight,

593
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,360
l see that this is what people

594
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:39,760
that were into occult or obscure
and anti-Christian things,

595
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:43,039
that was the sort of lyrics they wanted to read.

596
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:44,959
lt maybe given them strength.

597
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,200
But it was also sort of fiction and maybe
a creative outlet for my fucking head.

598
01:02:48,669 --> 01:02:51,039
What l've been doing on the last two albums

599
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:54,459
is what should drive people to suicide.

600
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:58,169
And it's really taking out the strength, right?

601
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,809
Because you can't really get strength
from the lyrics on the last two albums,

602
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,490
while you probably could from an album
like ''A Blaze In The Northern Sky.''

603
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,769
So l'm thinking l'm really just pleasing
and, you know, l'm caressing

604
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,610
the dog with its hairs, you know,
as we speak,

605
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:18,200
the dogs being the fans or whatever,
everyone listening to the album.

606
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,829
l'm just-- It turns out l was writing
just what they wanted, okay?

607
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:26,900
And now l'm writing what no one wants
because that is to be really fucking depressed,

608
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,349
if you really understand it, and then wanting
to take your fucking life.

609
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,280
At least l do. Because l'm looking
at my lyrics for the last two albums

610
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,419
and l'm seeing my fucking world in hell.

611
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,689
- Okay.
- Okay.

612
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,360
Thanks for taking the time.

613
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,530
Thanks for your time.

614
01:03:43,729 --> 01:03:45,039
And l wish you a nice evening.

615
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,700
Oh, have a beautiful evening. All right.
See you later. Hey, hey.

616
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:50,099
Bye.

617
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:53,840
One down, one to go.

618
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:55,729
l chose the name Frost when l entered
Satyricon and became a member of the band.

619
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:01,599
l wanted a name that l could identify with
as a black metal artist.

620
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:07,380
And l wanted it to be like a purification

621
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,459
of that side of me

622
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:15,860
that was into the darkness and the grimness
and the coldness of black metal.

623
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:19,019
lt's an alter-ego, you know?

624
01:05:24,729 --> 01:05:26,309
lt helps me getting more focused

625
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:31,139
and also it adds to the totality
of darkness and grimness

626
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,329
that we do create with our music.

627
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,720
The obscurity in black metal is part
of the darkness that we are trying to create.

628
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:44,400
lt goes very much hand in hand
with that darkness.

629
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:49,889
And then l'm talking about darkness
with a capital ''D'' then.

630
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:52,910
lf you understand what l mean.

631
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:03,050
Well, if someone running...

632
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,139
a big art magazine
and wanted to use my picture,

633
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:10,700
that is kind of flattering,

634
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:15,249
so l wouldn't feel it should be necessary
for them to ask me first

635
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,570
if they are allowed to do it
because it's somehow

636
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:25,300
presented in a neutral way.

637
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,669
lt couldn't be connected to something
that l do not like

638
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,740
or do not want to be connected to.

639
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:37,249
l've been obsessed with, like
these Norwegian black metal bands.

640
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,610
So my new show is, like, just dedicated
to black metal.

641
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,209
lt's just, like, pure, like,
the most uncommercial music.

642
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:46,200
lt's like pure death. It's, like, pure, like--

643
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,450
lt's like-- It's like the pits of death.

644
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,559
lt's the most uncommercial music.

645
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:57,570
l went to Norway where all the guys burned
the churches down and murdered each other

646
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,110
and, like, are in prison making music.

647
01:07:00,419 --> 01:07:03,849
l, like, visited, like, Euronymous' grave
and death and all this

648
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,329
because l love black metal.
The most extreme music in the world.

649
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:52,229
Most of them are in prison now.
They killed their Messiah, Euronymous.

650
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:28,179
They were confirming the media's version

651
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,089
and making all of it even worse.

652
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:34,939
The media was misinterpreting.
l said, ''Hey, you're wrong.''

653
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:39,240
And then these guys sort of confirmed that,
''No, we're right. Look at these guys.''

654
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,589
How can you stand for this crap, you know?
It's impossible.

655
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:50,780
And at this point

656
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,979
l was starting to become
a problem in this scene.

657
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:15,259
He was planning to kidnap me.

658
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,150
He was planning to knock me out

659
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:21,200
with an electro-shock pistol
like the type that security guards carry

660
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:25,229
and tie me up, take me to the forest,

661
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:28,139
and make a snuff film
of torrturing me to death.

662
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,410
And of course l took it serious.

663
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:32,839
Apart from that he just--

664
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,790
lf he were talking about it, like,
in the shop to everybody and anybody,

665
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:39,160
l wouldn't have taken it serious.
But he didn't.

666
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,549
He just told a select group of friends.

667
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:45,330
And one of them, you know, told me.

668
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,500
And later on he wrote a letter to me
you know, as if we were friends.

669
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:53,519
Which of course confirmed my suspicion
that he had some plans.

670
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,370
Why did he suddenly want
to be friends, you know?

671
01:09:57,769 --> 01:10:01,170
Of course, to have an excuse to
you know, get close to me

672
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,580
without awaking any suspicion.

673
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:08,330
The only reason he had to contact me was
a contract between Burzum and his label.

674
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:11,500
So he sent me the contracts
and wanted me to sign them.

675
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,410
And he wanted to meet
when we were signing them.

676
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,750
Okay. There's no reason to wait.

677
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,120
Let's just go to Oslo and get done with it.

678
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,979
So l drove to Oslo.

679
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,009
But of course it takes
some time to get to Oslo.

680
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:28,250
You know, it's 500 kilometers
of bad roads and mountains.

681
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,610
So, it took some time to reach.

682
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,000
l think we were there at 3:00
or maybe 4:00.

683
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:36,780
So he was sleeping.

684
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,000
l told him, ''Well, l don't care
if you're sleeping, just open the door.''

685
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:42,879
And he opened the door...

686
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,860
which is rather strange really.

687
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:49,189
You know, he just opened the door,
even though he had plans to kill me.

688
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,070
And he had his beeper, you know?

689
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,150
And when l got up in the apartment,
he panicked.

690
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:58,570
Because, you know, he probably--

691
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,650
He had plans to kill me.
l was aggressive.

692
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:05,839
You know, so he panicked.
He attacked me. He kicked me in the chest.

693
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:09,519
l just threw him to the ground,
a bit stunned really.

694
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,200
Because, you know, he attacked me
and l didn't expect it at the time.

695
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:18,200
And l was stunned for a while.

696
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,870
He was just sitting on the floor.

697
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,139
And suddenly he got up trying to get
to his knife in the kitchen.

698
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,269
And l thought, ''Well, if he's going to have
a knife, l'm going to have a knife.''

699
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:31,410
l had a pocket knife--
this small pocket knife.

700
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,219
l got it up and prevented him
from getting to the kitchen, you know,

701
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:38,750
so he didn't manage to get his knife.

702
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,599
And then he started off against--
started to run off towards his bedroom

703
01:11:44,269 --> 01:11:46,700
where he kept the shotgun
that Dead shot himself with

704
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:49,740
as well as the electro-shock pistol.

705
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:54,219
lt turned out, later on, that he didn't have
any of these things in the bedroom,

706
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:56,629
but l believed it at the time.

707
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,969
And that is the reason l followed him.

708
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,799
And instead of going into the bedroom,
he just left the building, really.

709
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,580
He just started to run down the stairs.

710
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,710
And l followed him
and managed to stop him.

711
01:12:10,299 --> 01:12:11,759
And, of course
l had a friend with me.

712
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,679
Actually, the guitarist of Mayhem.

713
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:15,929
And, of course, he was rather shocked.

714
01:12:16,269 --> 01:12:19,339
And l waited because l didn't know
how he was going to react, you know?

715
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:21,979
He was the guitarist in Mayhem.

716
01:12:22,349 --> 01:12:25,070
So for all l knew, he could attack me as well.
Maybe they planned it, you know?

717
01:12:25,519 --> 01:12:27,509
You get a bit paranoid in situations like that.

718
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:30,070
So l just waited for-- for-- for--

719
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,000
What's going to happen?
l just waited.

720
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,629
Aarseth was on the floor.

721
01:12:33,889 --> 01:12:36,549
He broke a lamp on the wall

722
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:40,150
so he was swimming in glass fragments

723
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:44,410
with only his underwear,
so he was rather bloody.

724
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,750
And this other guy just ran past me.

725
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:52,360
And of course l understood that, okay,
he's not a part of it.

726
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:55,469
So l asked him, ''Are you okay?''
And he just ran off.

727
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:58,839
And then l remembered
that he had my car keys.

728
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,429
And l had blood all over myself.

729
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:04,339
And Aarseth got up and attacked me again.

730
01:13:04,759 --> 01:13:09,620
So l finished Aarseth off. l just--

731
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,469
What do you say?
Stabbed? Chopped?

732
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:15,700
Stabbed him in the skull
so he died immediately.

733
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,509
And l followed the other guy.
He ran to the car.

734
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,030
So, l managed to calm him down.
He gave me the car keys.

735
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:26,200
l opened the car, you know,
and we drove back.

736
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:09,129
l wouldn't speak negatively about him

737
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,670
in the sense l speak negatively
about the others.

738
01:14:12,059 --> 01:14:14,460
He never said that he was going
to do anything.

739
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,080
And he never did anything.
But that's an honorable thing, isn't it?

740
01:14:18,599 --> 01:14:21,349
lt's worse when you say
you're going to do it and you don't do it.

741
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:25,229
Gylve, as l said, is a special person
with special goals,

742
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:27,939
and it's impossible
to know what his goals are.

743
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:31,530
He--

744
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,469
He's successful at what he's doing
and l guess he's happy with that.

745
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:08,650
We did not think it was Count Grishnackh.

746
01:15:10,509 --> 01:15:13,120
So we were looking out, we were looking.

747
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:15,990
We were watching our backs.

748
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:24,759
l thought what the hell can l do
for Euronymous? He's dead, man.

749
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:29,780
l dedicated the A Blaze
In the Northern Sky album to him.

750
01:15:30,429 --> 01:15:33,040
Who can l support now?
Well, it's the guy that's still alive.

751
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:36,460
And he's, like, muffled in jail.

752
01:18:01,519 --> 01:18:05,000
When l got the sentence l already knew
that l was going to get 21 years.

753
01:18:05,559 --> 01:18:07,200
That's the maximum penalty in Norway.

754
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,420
lt's not much by American standards,

755
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:12,259
but that's maximum in Norway.

756
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:16,280
So, the judge was really eager to,
you know,

757
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:21,179
as if she was happy, you know?
''Twenty-one years. Great.''

758
01:18:21,839 --> 01:18:23,650
Because she wanted to underline that

759
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:26,400
''we do not tolerate this type
of rebellion in Norway.''

760
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:31,089
And of course they were expecting me
to be, like, wetting my pants or something.

761
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,790
And it just made me smile, really.

762
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:38,309
l turned my head to the audience
you could call it, and just smiled.

763
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,540
And from what l gathered,
they smiled back.

764
01:18:46,799 --> 01:18:49,410
Varg always will be a great guy.

765
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:59,950
Even though his views on everything

766
01:19:00,509 --> 01:19:04,110
are deemed, like
an abomination by Norway.

767
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:12,710
He fucked up.

768
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,799
He's a very intelligent guy.
He's a very talented guy.

769
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:19,540
But he wanted to live differently from us

770
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:22,080
so he decided to burn these churches.

771
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:24,129
lt must have been
one hell of a rush for him.

772
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,780
But now he's in jail,

773
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,920
and that must suck for him.

774
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,969
But, you know,

775
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,500
he has himself to thank for it.

776
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:54,519
lt's very hard to recognize the truth

777
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:58,729
when you are bombarded
by lies all the time.

778
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:02,339
Every minute of the day,
you have to go to sleep.

779
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:06,089
But even in sleep, because you dream
of the impressions you have during the day.

780
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:10,450
You're bombarded by commercials
and completely senseless information

781
01:20:11,049 --> 01:20:12,799
every single day.

782
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,990
lf you turn on the TV,
you're bombarded.

783
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,339
lf you turn your head
in some direction

784
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:21,759
you see some sign,
some commercial.

785
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:25,110
Read magazines, newspapers,
senseless information.

786
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:28,339
The news are themselves
products being sold.

787
01:20:28,799 --> 01:20:31,139
Everything is meaningless.

788
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:35,400
Sure the truth is out there--
l know l sound like some X-files

789
01:20:36,009 --> 01:20:37,740
but the truth is of course to be found.

790
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,110
But in a sea of lies
it's just impossible to fin' d it.

791
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:46,849
Unless you know how to look,
where to look, and when to look.

792
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:51,519
And of course it's not possible to just,
you know, get up in the morning and just say,

793
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,679
''Okay, l'm going to find the truth this day,''
you know, and go find it.

794
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:57,670
You have to try and fail

795
01:20:58,089 --> 01:21:00,700
and eventually you will weed out all the lies

796
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:04,259
and you'll end up with something

797
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:06,849
at least similar to the truth.

798
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:14,849
The truth is hidden, you know?
Under grass, under some rocks,

799
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:17,929
in a hidden trail, a forgotten trail
in the forest, you know?

800
01:21:18,349 --> 01:21:21,809
And when you're trying to find
these trails, you will stumble.

801
01:21:22,349 --> 01:21:25,309
You'll get some branches in your face.

802
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:30,710
You'll make mistakes
before you finally find it.

803
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,469
So, how do you like the prison?

804
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:17,099
But the thing is, it's out there now.
It's everyone's property.

805
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:22,939
Like, for people who want to do humor
or whatever, it's out of our fucking hands.

806
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:26,809
Black metal for me is still
those secluded things

807
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,059
that people are not the fuck interested in,
you know?

808
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:36,559
So black metal is like a brand now, you know?

809
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:38,769
Everyone can deal with it.

810
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,099
lf someone does it in a completely,
you know, disgusting way

811
01:23:43,729 --> 01:23:46,950
l might go, like, ''Damn it!''

812
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:51,379
But what can l do? What's the point?

813
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:01,009
l kind of got interested for this project

814
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:03,879
when Bjarne told me

815
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,910
the destructivity that l

816
01:24:07,349 --> 01:24:11,830
was supposed to vibrate
throughout the performance.

817
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:16,799
So of course l wouldn't have been
interested in the first place

818
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,240
if that didn't seem fascinating to me.

819
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:45,839
l wonder what Munch's paintings would be

820
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:50,839
if he didn't feel the agony of living

821
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:56,099
or the easiness

822
01:24:56,799 --> 01:25:01,839
of being alive compared
to the inevitable death.

823
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:05,059
l have no problems being self-destructive

824
01:26:05,839 --> 01:26:06,889
if the whole thing

825
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:08,059
is something that l like.

826
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,070
l'll give them a sign
if something goes wrong.

827
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:38,879
Well, a big part of me wishes that

828
01:27:39,599 --> 01:27:41,559
this whole thing

829
01:27:44,799 --> 01:27:46,969
didn't turn into a trend.

830
01:27:47,339 --> 01:27:51,150
l mean, that's what fucking sucked.
And sucks still.

831
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:56,900
Then again, you know,
people like to dress up.

832
01:28:04,549 --> 01:28:07,269
How do you like the transformation?

833
01:28:13,299 --> 01:28:14,610
Oh, boy.
