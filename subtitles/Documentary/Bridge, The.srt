1
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,599
- Want toast?
- Yes.

2
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,268
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

3
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,228
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

4
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,022
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

5
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,982
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

6
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,609
Yes, please.

7
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,653
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

8
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:47,613
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

9
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,573
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

10
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:52,117
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

11
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,995
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,913
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

13
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,039
Very cute.

14
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:00,959
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

15
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,127
Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

16
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,965
May Belle?

17
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,050
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

18
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:13,512
OK, who hid my sneakers?

19
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:16,890
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

20
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,600
What? Mom!

21
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,395
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

22
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,690
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

23
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,609
These are girls' ones.

24
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:31,278
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

25
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,822
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

26
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:36,366
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

27
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,410
- And?
- My sneakers.

28
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,538
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

29
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,582
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

30
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,584
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

31
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:51,130
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

32
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:54,091
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

33
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,802
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

34
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,554
Just about to.

35
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:39,549
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

36
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,302
Give it to me.

37
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:44,679
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

38
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,097
I found it!

39
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:51,352
You're kidding me.

40
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,520
OK, that's enough.

41
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,356
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

42
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,066
All right, settle down.

43
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:00,068
Good one, Janice.

44
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:02,779
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

45
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,406
- "Monster Mouth." Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

46
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,244
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

47
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:12,162
A few ground rules for this classroom.

48
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,249
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

49
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,418
If you download essays
off the Internet,

50
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,296
you'll be downloaded into detention.

51
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,924
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

52
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,760
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

53
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:31,889
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
Know what that is? My loser detector.

54
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:35,225
Jesse Aarons!

55
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:39,271
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

56
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,606
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

57
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,066
He hit me.

58
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,278
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

59
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,362
be quiet!

60
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:52,574
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

61
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,660
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

62
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:57,829
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

63
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,915
He asked you a question,
twinkle toes.

64
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:08,047
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

65
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,675
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

66
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,429
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

67
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:18,932
Thank you, Principal Turner.

68
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:22,018
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

69
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:25,146
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

70
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,485
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

71
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,072
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

72
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:36,531
Yes?

73
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:40,452
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

74
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:43,705
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

75
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,916
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

76
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,710
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

77
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:53,005
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

78
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,632
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

79
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,802
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

80
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,388
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

81
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,224
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

82
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,979
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

83
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,480
What I said was,

84
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,858
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

85
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,277
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,321
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

87
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:23,908
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

88
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,261
Yeah!

89
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,473
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

90
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,269
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

91
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,355
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

92
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:59,191
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

93
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,984
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

94
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:05,488
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

95
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,865
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

96
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:09,492
Hey, I'm talking to you!

97
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:12,411
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

98
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:16,998
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

99
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,174
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

100
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,018
Go! Go, Jess, go!

101
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,272
Come on!

102
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,023
Come on! You can do it!

103
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,275
Come on, Jess!

104
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,235
Go, Jess, go!

105
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,917
Jess, Jess, did you win?

106
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,756
Hey, Jess, right?

107
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,809
- Idiot!
- What?

108
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,063
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

109
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,945
Thank you.

110
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,657
Are you following me?

111
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,492
No. I live over there.

112
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:43,369
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

113
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,247
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

114
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,082
You got any Barbies?

115
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:51,460
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

116
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:55,464
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

117
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:58,633
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

118
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,051
Never heard of that before.

119
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,011
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

120
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,681
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

121
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:07,808
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

122
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,270
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

123
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,604
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

124
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:13,605
Hey, Dad.

125
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:16,650
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

126
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,360
See ya.

127
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,947
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

128
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:26,075
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

129
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,619
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

130
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:31,497
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

131
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,916
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

132
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,542
You're not little kids anymore.

133
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,845
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

134
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,889
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

135
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,516
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

136
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,810
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

137
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,978
Is he picking on you?

138
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,690
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

139
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,367
How'd that race go?

140
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,869
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

141
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:17,080
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

142
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,169
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

143
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,339
One drop.

144
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:29,717
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

145
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,178
Are these ever gonna grow?

146
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:36,556
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

147
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,517
May Belle's flowers.

148
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:43,646
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

149
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,316
They are so cool.

150
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,735
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

151
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,529
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

152
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,699
The bell's gonna ring!

153
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:59,077
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

154
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,162
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

155
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,499
- No!
- No? I am.

156
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,709
Come and get your instruments.

157
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,544
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

158
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,923
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

159
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:16,051
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

160
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,179
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

161
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:22,474
It's awfully quiet.

162
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:25,351
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

163
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:27,770
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

164
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,993
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

165
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,704
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

166
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,914
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

167
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:37,250
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

168
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,170
We just
can't keep going like this.

169
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:43,423
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

170
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,967
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

171
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:48,844
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

172
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:52,514
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

173
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,225
Dead meat.

174
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:00,480
Wow.

175
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:03,233
You're really good at drawing.

176
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:06,152
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

177
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:07,737
Uh... Thanks.

178
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,951
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

179
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,370
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

180
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:22,000
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

181
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,420
which is important for any writing.

182
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:30,174
Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.

183
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,135
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

184
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,470
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

185
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,439
"I'm moving gently forward,"

186
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,860
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

187
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm floating in silence,

188
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:56,323
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

189
00:14:56,406 --> 00:15:00,160
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

190
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:02,120
the place where I've come from,

191
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:04,539
and will go back to
when I am done here.

192
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:06,958
I'm diving.

193
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,585
I'm a scuba diver.

194
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:13,088
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

195
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,050
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

196
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,887
As I swim through the water,

197
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,473
bubbles burst from me,

198
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,309
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

199
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,269
I check my air.

200
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:31,188
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

201
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,941
"but that is what makes it so special."

202
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,195
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

203
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,407
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

204
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,577
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

205
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,079
Leslie?

206
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:50,206
What if you can't watch this program?

207
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,709
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

208
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,712
But... what if you don't have a TV?

209
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,595
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

210
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:09,807
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

211
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:11,976
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

212
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,812
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

213
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:18,398
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

214
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,525
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

215
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:27,990
Hey, Leslie, come here.

216
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:31,160
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

217
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:47,592
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

218
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:51,720
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

219
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,599
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

220
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:00,353
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

221
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,246
You're really asking for it.

222
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:23,249
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

223
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,418
So might as well have some fun.

224
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:29,088
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

225
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,384
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

226
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:36,178
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

227
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,306
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

228
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:40,640
- What?
- You can't do it.

229
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,393
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

230
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,483
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

231
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,653
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

232
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,613
- Sure.
- Thanks.

233
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:00,867
You're lucky to have a sister.

234
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,703
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

235
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:06,038
I'd love to have a dog.

236
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,290
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

237
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,710
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

238
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,156
Come on, Jess!

239
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,324
Come on!

240
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,288
What about sharks?

241
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:55,459
You ever see any sharks while you're

242
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,627
scuba-ing or whatever?

243
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,255
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

244
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,967
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

245
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,220
It's different from lying.

246
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:11,765
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

247
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,476
No, but...

248
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,357
Hey! Look at that!

249
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,609
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

250
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,985
I wouldn't trust it.

251
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,529
Come on. Just try it.

252
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,241
OK.

253
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,623
You got it? That's it.

254
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,459
Thanks.

255
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,839
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

256
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:49,967
OK.

257
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:00,977
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

258
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:22,956
OK.

259
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,931
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

260
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,766
Feels like flying.

261
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:13,001
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

262
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,921
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

263
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:19,674
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

264
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,342
Yeah, but...

265
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:24,470
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

266
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,932
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

267
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:30,684
I don't know. What if?

268
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,895
OK, well...

269
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,564
...what if the only way
we could enter it

270
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,858
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

271
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:40,777
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

272
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,238
Come on.

273
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:50,202
Leslie!

274
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:52,496
Leslie!

275
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,674
Leslie.

276
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,930
- Come on!
- Wait up.

277
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,791
Ahh!

278
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,335
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

279
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:47,338
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

280
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,013
Hey! What's that?

281
00:22:58,014 --> 00:23:01,434
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

282
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,106
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

283
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:10,234
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

284
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:14,947
- What's that?
- What?

285
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,116
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

286
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:21,036
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

287
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:23,621
What prisoners?

288
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:26,040
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

289
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:32,629
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

290
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,465
What is it?

291
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,970
Look at this.

292
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,604
Wow. This is amazing.

293
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,943
Wow.

294
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:08,204
This is it.

295
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,344
Warriors.

296
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,724
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

297
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:33,018
From the treetop provinces.

298
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:38,231
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

299
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:44,195
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

300
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:46,614
whose people have been imprisoned.

301
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:51,493
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

302
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,790
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

303
00:24:57,374 --> 00:25:00,043
We have come to free you.

304
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,711
Do you hear us?

305
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:03,671
Show me that you hear us!

306
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:14,640
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

307
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:20,895
Can't hear you!

308
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,137
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

309
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:21,548
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

310
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,177
Uh... She's... She's fine.

311
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:29,055
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

312
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:30,764
...forget. There are four of us.

313
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:32,057
OK.

314
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,811
Remember to bring your bag.

315
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,313
Why would anyone
want to wear that?

316
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,069
Janice!

317
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:46,696
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

318
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,448
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

319
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,450
On purpose.

320
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:54,036
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

321
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,330
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

322
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:01,000
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

323
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:19,726
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

324
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:22,520
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

325
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,272
Jeez.

326
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:27,650
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

327
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:30,236
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

328
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:36,074
Why would Dad do this?

329
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,993
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

330
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,370
Mom, this is Leslie.

331
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,288
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

332
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,916
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

333
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,502
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

334
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,839
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

335
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:54,424
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

336
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:59,929
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

337
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:03,600
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

338
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,685
- They're writers.
- Writers?

339
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:08,729
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

340
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,356
That explains you.

341
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:15,068
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

342
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,529
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

343
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:21,366
You know a lot about hardware?

344
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:23,284
No. Why?

345
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:26,746
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

346
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,414
OK.

347
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:31,500
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

348
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,168
...not your parents.

349
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:39,007
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

350
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:43,344
Not really.

351
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:47,390
What's that?

352
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:50,226
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

353
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,605
Come on!

354
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,402
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

355
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:04,364
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

356
00:30:04,697 --> 00:30:07,158
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

357
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,411
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

358
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,753
This is not good.

359
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,966
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

360
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:28,886
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,355
Les...

362
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:42,607
Leslie?

363
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:47,403
Leslie. Leslie!

364
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:51,490
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

365
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,829
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

366
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:09,006
Look at it.

367
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:11,675
It's all ours.

368
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,053
From the mountains to the oceans.

369
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:20,433
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

370
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:23,353
Just close your eyes...

371
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:25,104
...but keep your mind wide open.

372
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:40,410
Wow.

373
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:44,038
What do we call this place?

374
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,459
Terabithia.

375
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:59,177
Shh.
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

376
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,305
Happy birthday!

377
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,277
Make a wish.

378
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,988
- Yay!
- What'd you wish for?

379
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:29,163
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

380
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:31,915
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

381
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,626
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

382
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,629
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

383
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:41,966
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

384
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:50,849
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

385
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:54,061
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

386
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:56,355
These vegetables are our livelihood.

387
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:59,482
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

388
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:02,235
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

389
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:08,783
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

390
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:12,369
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

391
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:15,956
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

392
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,584
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

393
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,888
Under the seat.

394
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,686
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

395
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,567
- Like it?
- Wow.

396
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,737
It must've cost a fortune.

397
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,364
What's it matter what it costs?

398
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,449
I don't know.

399
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,828
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

400
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,373
Thanks... a lot.

401
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:18,763
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

402
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,473
Hey, here he comes.

403
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:23,893
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

404
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,814
Ms. Edmunds?

405
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,650
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

406
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,987
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

407
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:38,865
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

408
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,200
Thank you.

409
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:50,000
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, boys.

410
00:34:56,882 --> 00:34:59,134
How come you're so good at that?

411
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:01,302
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

412
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:02,845
You're good at it for a girl.

413
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,681
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

414
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:08,142
You know what I mean.

415
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:11,228
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

416
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,105
OK, OK, truce.

417
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:19,444
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

418
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,821
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

419
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:24,365
What's that?

420
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,617
Show yourselves!

421
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:41,965
It's a giant troll!

422
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:44,175
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

423
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:46,636
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

424
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:48,888
Come on.

425
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:52,224
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

426
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:55,686
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

427
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,900
That's how big its feet are.

428
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:08,072
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

429
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:11,533
What should we do?

430
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,500
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

431
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,211
Hey, look at that! Come on!

432
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:27,256
I think it went that way!

433
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:31,302
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

434
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:37,432
I'll race you to the rope.

435
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,690
I love this place!

436
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,416
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

437
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,555
What do you think you're doing?

438
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:24,434
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

439
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:27,270
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

440
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:30,606
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

441
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,025
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

442
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:35,277
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

443
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,072
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

444
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,199
money we earn and time we don't have.

445
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,369
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

446
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,536
and do as I say.

447
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:48,205
OK.

448
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,025
Good night, sweetheart.

449
00:38:20,694 --> 00:38:22,237
Sweet dreams.

450
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:26,490
Lights out, Jess.

451
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:28,159
Night, Dad.

452
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:36,750
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

453
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,461
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

454
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:42,922
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

455
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:46,634
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

456
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:48,511
They thought you were their king.

457
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:05,693
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

458
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,863
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

459
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,698
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

460
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,450
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

461
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:15,661
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

462
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:17,245
I'll eat them, not lose them.

463
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:25,419
Jess! Jess!

464
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:29,381
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

465
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:33,135
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

466
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:35,304
And she makes you pay to pee!

467
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,265
It's a dollar, shorty.

468
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:41,893
But I don't have a dollar.

469
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:45,396
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

470
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,731
Free to pee!

471
00:39:46,814 --> 00:39:49,900
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

472
00:39:52,695 --> 00:39:53,737
Let's go.

473
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,958
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

474
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,877
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

475
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:14,256
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

476
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,342
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

477
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,552
You'll get your butt kicked.

478
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:23,389
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

479
00:40:23,473 --> 00:40:26,100
She stole my Twinkies.

480
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,311
Come on.

481
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:32,815
It's all right, May Belle.

482
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:36,610
We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

483
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,658
Don't let
the Terabithians hear you.

484
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,576
They thought you were their king.

485
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,929
Jess! Jess!

486
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,400
Oh... Hi! Look at you!

487
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:25,029
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

488
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,989
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

489
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:29,366
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

490
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,785
Wow, Jess. Thank you.

491
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,124
I name you Prince Terrien,

492
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,960
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

493
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:42,921
P.T. for short.

494
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,467
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

495
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:54,306
Oh, no! We've got company!

496
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,516
Dead meat! Dead meat!

497
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,228
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

498
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,731
What's that?

499
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,322
It's a giant troll.

500
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,660
Nice feet.

501
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,497
Run!

502
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,751
Oh, my gosh!

503
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,217
I think we lost it.

504
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:39,639
Leslie...

505
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,183
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

506
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,685
I don't know!

507
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:48,314
Just making it madder!

508
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:50,566
P. T!

509
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,696
That's it! That's its weak spot!

510
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,614
It's ticklish!

511
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,659
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

512
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,704
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

513
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:06,831
Good dog.

514
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:14,588
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

515
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:18,675
Eighth-grade girl...

516
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:20,468
...probably eighth-grade boys.

517
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:22,512
Who's she got a crush on?

518
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:25,098
I don't know. Let's see...

519
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:28,559
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

520
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,102
...Willard Hughes.

521
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,563
- That's it.
- What's it?

522
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,691
Write, "Dear Janice..."

523
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:39,361
- You do it.
- No way.

524
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:41,821
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

525
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:43,072
It's gotta be you.

526
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:46,993
OK.

527
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:48,953
"Dear Janice,

528
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:52,373
you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known."

529
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:56,168
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

530
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,675
"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,"

531
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:06,969
I think you are so cool.

532
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:10,764
"You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school."

533
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,307
OK. Write this,

534
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:15,852
"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real."

535
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,691
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

536
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:25,111
...I was looking for you.
Me? Why?

537
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:28,280
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

538
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,449
All right, I'll take a look.

539
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:38,915
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

540
00:44:38,957 --> 00:44:42,126
We can ride home together
and talk about us."

541
00:44:43,795 --> 00:44:46,339
Underline and capitalize the "us."

542
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,507
"All my love, Willard."

543
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:54,596
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

544
00:45:04,022 --> 00:45:06,649
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

545
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:08,234
That was really sweet.

546
00:45:08,317 --> 00:45:10,569
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

547
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:13,280
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

548
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:15,991
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

549
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:18,160
They're totally in love.

550
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:21,371
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

551
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:23,706
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

552
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:34,591
Look at Janice!

553
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,930
Hey, Janice, what happened?

554
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,182
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

555
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,270
Where's your boyfriend, Janice?

556
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:59,447
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

557
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:07,997
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

558
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,915
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

559
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:13,418
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

560
00:46:13,502 --> 00:46:16,671
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

561
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:18,590
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

562
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,804
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

563
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:27,056
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

564
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:29,642
- We need your help.
- Come on.

565
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:36,857
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

566
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,067
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

567
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:41,361
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

568
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:44,322
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

569
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,991
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

570
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,659
Grab one and get going.

571
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:51,537
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

572
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:55,040
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

573
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:03,131
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

574
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:05,967
Yeah.

575
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,469
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

576
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:11,180
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

577
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:13,223
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

578
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:53,260
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

579
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:21,744
Hey, guys.

580
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:24,247
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

581
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,832
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

582
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:29,543
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

583
00:48:29,627 --> 00:48:32,129
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

584
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:34,923
is working hard at work worth doing.

585
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:50,312
Hey...

586
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:54,733
...have you taken art classes?

587
00:48:54,816 --> 00:48:58,111
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

588
00:48:58,153 --> 00:48:59,863
You're really talented.

589
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:06,285
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

590
00:49:08,496 --> 00:49:11,624
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

591
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,712
I just went to use the girl's room.

592
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:20,006
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

593
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,091
and I think it's Janice Avery.

594
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,052
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

595
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,928
No way. But come here.

596
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,767
Free to pee!

597
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,894
Get out of here!

598
00:49:33,977 --> 00:49:37,272
Get out of here, now!

599
00:49:39,107 --> 00:49:41,943
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

600
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:45,238
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

601
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:47,531
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

602
00:49:47,615 --> 00:49:50,534
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

603
00:49:50,618 --> 00:49:54,413
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

604
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:27,610
Sorry.

605
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:30,863
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

606
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:33,365
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

607
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,914
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

608
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,631
No way! I like Tony!

609
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,970
Her dad gets really mad at her.

610
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,682
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

611
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,892
- He hits her.
- Oh.

612
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,771
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

613
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:10,816
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

614
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,862
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

615
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:20,950
Well, what did you say to her?

616
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:24,370
Well, I told her about not having a TV

617
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:26,289
and everyone laughing at me.

618
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,250
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

619
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,210
Then what'd she say?

620
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,337
She asked me for advice.

621
00:51:34,463 --> 00:51:36,298
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

622
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,675
- Yeah.
- And?

623
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:41,010
Well, I told her just to pretend

624
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:44,097
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

625
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,809
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

626
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:50,686
Man...

627
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:52,312
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

628
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:55,607
- We should go.
- Yeah.

629
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:59,569
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

630
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:02,405
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

631
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:04,449
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

632
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,868
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

633
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:12,164
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

634
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:13,749
See ya!

635
00:53:03,002 --> 00:53:05,963
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

636
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:12,636
I'm really glad I came.

637
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,472
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

638
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:17,807
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

639
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:20,185
It's nailing holes through your hands.

640
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:23,771
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

641
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:26,607
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

642
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:29,110
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

643
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:32,780
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

644
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:35,532
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

645
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,285
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

646
00:53:38,326 --> 00:53:40,370
God will damn you to hell when you die.

647
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:42,580
Wow, May Belle.
Where'd you hear that?

648
00:53:42,622 --> 00:53:44,332
That's right, huh, Jess?

649
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:48,461
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

650
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:50,921
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

651
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:54,633
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

652
00:53:54,716 --> 00:53:57,260
He's too busy running all this.

653
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:05,810
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

654
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:08,896
Yeah. I'm coming.

655
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:12,941
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

656
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:32,668
You haven't managed
to kill those yet?

657
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,419
Not funny.

658
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,629
Look.

659
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:38,298
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

660
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:54,688
Jess. Jess.

661
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,858
- Where are my keys?
- What?

662
00:54:57,941 --> 00:55:00,735
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

663
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:10,202
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

664
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:13,330
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

665
00:55:13,372 --> 00:55:16,291
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

666
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,876
They gotta be right here.

667
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:21,087
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

668
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:24,215
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

669
00:55:24,298 --> 00:55:26,425
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

670
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:27,885
I said I'll find them.

671
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:35,892
You look awful.
What's the matter?

672
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:37,811
I lost the keys where my dad works,

673
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:40,563
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

674
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:42,190
May Belle?

675
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:44,567
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

676
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,902
- What?
- He...

677
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:50,072
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

678
00:55:50,698 --> 00:55:53,367
You know the bells
we talked about making?

679
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,620
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

680
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,538
All that clanking metal and junk.

681
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,166
And... May Belle wanted to help.

682
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:02,709
And you let her?

683
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,546
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

684
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,090
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

685
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:11,508
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

686
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,052
I was waiting for the right time.

687
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,348
So you know where the keys are?

688
00:56:28,524 --> 00:56:29,733
See ya later.

689
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,447
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

690
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,742
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

691
00:56:46,165 --> 00:56:47,667
Whoa.

692
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,753
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

693
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:58,510
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

694
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:01,971
- Make yourself useful, draw me money."
- What are you going on about?

695
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:04,974
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious."

696
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:09,228
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

697
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:16,777
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

698
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:19,946
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

699
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,210
Leslie, get behind me.

700
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:39,506
Jess, turn around. There's more.

701
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,091
Here, take this.

702
00:57:45,553 --> 00:57:47,471
Jess!

703
00:57:57,147 --> 00:57:58,356
P.T., get him!

704
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,740
Good boy, P.T.

705
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:21,127
Yeah!

706
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:24,338
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

707
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:28,134
Run!

708
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:30,719
Come on! Faster!

709
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:33,555
Dead meat! Dead meat!

710
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:36,892
Dead meat! Dead meat!

711
00:58:42,438 --> 00:58:43,981
Told you they were grenades.

712
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,073
Jess!

713
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:54,783
I got you, Leslie!

714
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:56,827
I got you!

715
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:00,163
Up ahead! Get ready!

716
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,712
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

717
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,889
He's watching us.

718
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,019
Where are the keys?

719
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,229
Here, open this.

720
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:41,951
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

721
00:59:41,993 --> 00:59:43,786
I don't know.

722
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,250
Great. Now there's three of us.

723
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:58,425
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

724
00:59:58,466 --> 00:59:59,884
Attack!

725
01:00:08,684 --> 01:00:12,730
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

726
01:00:14,189 --> 01:00:15,148
Come on.

727
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:19,069
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

728
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,257
Be careful!
You're almost there.

729
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:52,474
Jess!

730
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:54,184
Jess!

731
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:12,826
Hey.

732
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,789
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

733
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,752
Jess! I called you three times.

734
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,045
It's your girlfriend.

735
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:57,130
She's not my girlfriend.

736
01:02:58,089 --> 01:03:00,133
- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.

737
01:03:00,216 --> 01:03:02,176
Wait. Who is this?

738
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,804
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

739
01:03:04,846 --> 01:03:09,058
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

740
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:12,853
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

741
01:03:17,149 --> 01:03:19,859
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

742
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,569
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

743
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:25,990
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

744
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:28,743
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

745
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:34,706
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

746
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,298
- All set?
- Yeah.

747
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,716
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

748
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:54,558
Forget something?

749
01:03:56,435 --> 01:03:58,687
No. I'm good.

750
01:04:33,385 --> 01:04:35,012
Wow.

751
01:04:40,141 --> 01:04:41,768
Honey, honey, stay here.

752
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:47,315
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

753
01:04:47,398 --> 01:04:50,359
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

754
01:04:50,442 --> 01:04:53,612
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

755
01:04:58,283 --> 01:05:01,244
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

756
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:03,538
You've been to a museum before, right?

757
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:06,916
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

758
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,585
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

759
01:05:47,536 --> 01:05:49,329
It's such a nice day out.

760
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:53,458
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

761
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:57,379
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

762
01:05:57,462 --> 01:06:00,548
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

763
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:02,550
But I do try to keep an open mind,

764
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:05,094
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

765
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:08,722
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

766
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:10,391
Leslie Burke is right.

767
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:13,936
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

768
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:25,238
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

769
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:28,783
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

770
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:35,747
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

771
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:37,791
Oh, my God, Jess!

772
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:42,545
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

773
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:45,923
Mom...

774
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:48,342
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

775
01:06:48,426 --> 01:06:51,011
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

776
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:52,846
Dead?

777
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,682
What's going on?

778
01:07:02,146 --> 01:07:04,482
Your friend Leslie's dead.

779
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:07,985
She drowned in a creek this morning.

780
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:11,530
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

781
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,740
They think she hit her head.

782
01:07:15,492 --> 01:07:18,828
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

783
01:07:18,912 --> 01:07:22,373
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

784
01:07:22,415 --> 01:07:24,375
But it did.

785
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:31,048
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

786
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:35,761
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

787
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:09,305
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

788
01:09:09,388 --> 01:09:12,015
I... I gotta do my chores first.

789
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:14,768
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

790
01:09:30,115 --> 01:09:31,825
Jess, your father and I thought

791
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,411
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

792
01:09:34,494 --> 01:09:36,747
Just the three of us.

793
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:39,124
Paying what?

794
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:01,394
Prince Terrien. Shh.

795
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,105
You must be Jess.

796
01:10:12,946 --> 01:10:17,450
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

797
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:19,994
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

798
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,587
She loved you, you know.

799
01:10:30,546 --> 01:10:32,005
You know, Leslie,

800
01:10:32,047 --> 01:10:35,842
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

801
01:10:35,926 --> 01:10:39,095
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

802
01:10:43,182 --> 01:10:45,518
She said
if it wasn't for you...

803
01:10:47,812 --> 01:10:49,980
You're the best friend she's ever had.

804
01:10:50,064 --> 01:10:51,940
I wanna thank you for that.

805
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,360
You're welcome.

806
01:10:58,363 --> 01:11:01,241
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

807
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:08,080
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

808
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:17,422
- Jess.
- Next time,

809
01:11:17,464 --> 01:11:20,341
we should invite Leslie to go.

810
01:11:22,135 --> 01:11:24,262
She'd like that.

811
01:11:33,353 --> 01:11:34,813
Hey, kid.

812
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:38,275
Sorry about your friend.

813
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:44,989
The purpose
of object pronouns...

814
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:48,075
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

815
01:11:50,369 --> 01:11:52,371
It's a joke, dude.

816
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,710
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

817
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:01,254
Go wait for me out in the hall.

818
01:12:02,672 --> 01:12:05,007
Silent reading until I get back.

819
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:15,684
Jess...

820
01:12:22,065 --> 01:12:24,817
When my husband died...

821
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:27,778
...people kept telling me not to cry.

822
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:31,156
People kept trying to help me to forget.

823
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:36,536
But I didn't wanna forget.

824
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,872
Excuse me.

825
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:44,001
The things that girl came up with.

826
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:48,464
I don't get students like her too often.

827
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:55,220
So I realize...

828
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:57,889
...that if it's hard for me...

829
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,392
...how much harder it must be for you.

830
01:13:46,058 --> 01:13:48,144
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

831
01:13:57,152 --> 01:13:58,820
Hey.

832
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,072
Leslie?!

833
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:11,845
Jess!

834
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,347
Leslie!

835
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:16,725
- Jess!
- Leslie!

836
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:24,482
Lesl...

837
01:15:24,565 --> 01:15:27,443
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

838
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,487
May Belle?

839
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:34,908
Hold on! Don't move!

840
01:15:36,493 --> 01:15:38,870
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

841
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,460
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

842
01:15:46,544 --> 01:15:49,213
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

843
01:15:49,797 --> 01:15:52,508
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

844
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:54,343
This is our place!

845
01:15:58,305 --> 01:15:59,639
I said go home!

846
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,904
Honey, what's the matter?

847
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,740
What's the matter?

848
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,658
What's the matter, baby?

849
01:17:22,674 --> 01:17:24,342
No!

850
01:17:25,843 --> 01:17:27,511
Jess!

851
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:31,098
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

852
01:17:31,181 --> 01:17:32,891
It's all gone.

853
01:17:36,228 --> 01:17:38,605
Is it like the Bible says?

854
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:40,523
Is she going to hell?

855
01:17:41,149 --> 01:17:42,900
I don't know everything about God,

856
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:45,695
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

857
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:48,989
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

858
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,618
Don't you think that even for a minute.

859
01:17:52,659 --> 01:17:55,203
But it is.

860
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:59,332
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

861
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:02,585
I didn't wanna invite her.

862
01:18:02,669 --> 01:18:05,838
I wasn't there to go with her.

863
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:08,924
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

864
01:18:09,008 --> 01:18:11,010
It's not your fault.

865
01:18:11,093 --> 01:18:13,637
None of that makes it so.

866
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,847
It's a terrible thing.

867
01:18:15,889 --> 01:18:20,310
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

868
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:28,651
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

869
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:34,031
That's what you hold on to.

870
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:39,369
That's how you keep her alive.

871
01:18:58,803 --> 01:19:00,055
May Belle?

872
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:09,772
Look.

873
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:13,317
I'm sorry I pushed you.

874
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:18,530
That was stupid and wrong...

875
01:19:20,532 --> 01:19:22,533
...and I really miss you talking to me.

876
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:03,654
She's in your hands now.

877
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:27,009
Hey!

878
01:20:28,844 --> 01:20:30,012
Wait!

879
01:20:32,014 --> 01:20:32,973
Wait!

880
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:36,560
Hey!

881
01:20:42,273 --> 01:20:45,193
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

882
01:20:45,276 --> 01:20:48,863
Can I use the lumber by your house?

883
01:20:48,946 --> 01:20:50,572
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

884
01:20:50,614 --> 01:20:53,283
Anything you see, you just...

885
01:20:54,117 --> 01:20:57,329
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

886
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:00,498
but I... can't seem to give him up.

887
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,210
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

888
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,795
Yeah.

889
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:29,121
We're playing. By ourselves.

890
01:22:30,581 --> 01:22:34,376
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

891
01:22:34,418 --> 01:22:37,379
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

892
01:22:37,462 --> 01:22:41,424
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

893
01:22:41,466 --> 01:22:44,969
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

894
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:46,470
She's nothing but a baby.

895
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:49,682
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

896
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:51,558
You have to train her and stuff.

897
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,519
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

898
01:23:03,861 --> 01:23:05,530
Step down.

899
01:23:08,866 --> 01:23:10,242
Watch your step.

900
01:23:17,457 --> 01:23:19,209
You're not peeking, are you?

901
01:23:21,211 --> 01:23:23,880
Step up. There you go.

902
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,721
All right.

903
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:40,770
OK. Open them.

904
01:23:46,317 --> 01:23:50,237
Wow. Did you make this?

905
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:53,240
Yep.

906
01:23:55,951 --> 01:23:57,661
Hold on a second.

907
01:24:06,002 --> 01:24:09,213
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

908
01:24:09,296 --> 01:24:13,884
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

909
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:17,137
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

910
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:19,389
They've been waiting.

911
01:24:19,431 --> 01:24:21,349
Where?

912
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:24,769
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

913
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:27,104
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

914
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:29,398
anything you can imagine.

915
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,358
But you gotta look really hard.

916
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,194
But keep your mind wide open.

917
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,245
So, what do you think?

918
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:50,793
Can there be purple flowers?

919
01:24:52,836 --> 01:24:55,130
Anything you want.

920
01:24:56,089 --> 01:24:58,008
Wow.

921
01:24:59,342 --> 01:25:00,593
And a castle.

922
01:25:00,677 --> 01:25:03,346
A big one, with towers and flags.

923
01:25:03,388 --> 01:25:05,640
Of course.

924
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,061
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

925
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:16,441
Is there a king?

926
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:17,859
Are you the king, Jess?

927
01:25:17,943 --> 01:25:20,445
Only if you're princess.

928
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:06,445
Terabithia.
