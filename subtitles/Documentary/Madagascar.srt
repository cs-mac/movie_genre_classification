1
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,455
Surprise!

2
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,004
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

3
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,256
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

4
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,426
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

5
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,678
Hey, man, thanks.

6
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,141
Hey, I got something stuck in my teeth.

7
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,227
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

8
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,563
You came to the right place, my friend.

9
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,900
Dr Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

10
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:54,030
Please hop on top of my sterilised
examination table, if you may.

11
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,284
-I don't see anything.
-It's on the left.

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,410
Oh, sorry.

13
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,371
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

14
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,417
Right here.
What the heck is this doing in there?

15
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,960
Happy birthday!

16
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,755
Hey, thanks, man.

17
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,674
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

18
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,677
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

19
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:21,474
-Look at that. Look at that.
-Look at that. It's snowing.

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,227
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

21
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,604
Double digits. The big 1 -0.

22
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,316
You don't like it?

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,819
-No, no, it's great.
-You hate it.

24
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,904
I should've gotten you
the Alex alarm clock.

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,531
That's the big seller.

26
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,450
No, no, no. The present's great, really.

27
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,328
It's just that
another year's come and gone

28
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,664
and I'm still doing the same old thing.

29
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:49,836
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,171
-I see your problem.
-Maybe I should go to law school.

31
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,049
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

32
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,968
-How?
-Throw out the old act.

33
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,137
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

34
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,974
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

35
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,309
-Really?
-You know, make it fresh.

36
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,854
Fresh, huh? Okay. I could do fresh.

37
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,021
Works for me.

38
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,028
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

39
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,780
It's fun people fun time!

40
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,659
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

41
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,622
-What day is it?
-It's Friday. Field trip day.

42
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,165
Yes, it's field trip day.

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,919
Let's get up and go in ten more minutes.

44
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,508
Come on! Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

45
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,176
Wake up! Rise and shine!

46
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,846
It's another fabulous morning
in the Big Apple.

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,180
Let's go.

48
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,225
-Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
-What?

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,438
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

50
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,523
Right there. You see?

51
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,735
Melman, you know it's all in your head.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,070
Let's go! Come on!

53
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,960
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,799
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

55
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,511
Straight out the ground. Tasty fresh!
Freshalicious.

56
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,265
Ziploc fresh.

57
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,352
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

58
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,021
the CentraI Park Zoo proudIy presents...

59
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,105
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,733
...the king of New York City.

61
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,235
-Alex the lion.
-Alex the lion.

62
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,696
It's showtime.

63
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,203
Roar!

64
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,841
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

65
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,387
Check out the zebra taking care of biz.
That's right.

66
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,758
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

67
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,927
Kowalski, progress report.

68
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,596
We're 500 feet
from the main sewer line.

69
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,017
-And the bad news?
-We've broken our last shovel.

70
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,685
Right.

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,022
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

72
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:00,234
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

73
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,652
And me, Skipper?

74
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,864
I want you
to look cute and cuddly, Private.

75
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,825
Today we're going to blow this dump.

76
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,578
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

77
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,834
Yeah!
You don't see that on Animal Planet.

78
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,586
Ha-ha.

79
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,757
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

80
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,217
I hope you thought it was fresh.

81
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,719
I'll be here all week.

82
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,388
In fact, I'll be here for my whole life.

83
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,932
Three hundred and sixty-five days
a year,

84
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,853
including Christmas, Hanukkah,
Halloween, Kwanzaa.

85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,482
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

86
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,027
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

87
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,704
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

88
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,081
I sprechen.

89
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,334
-What continent is this?
-Manhattan.

90
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,295
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

91
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,589
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

92
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,425
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

93
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,469
What are you guys doing?

94
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,097
We're digging to Antarctica.

95
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,140
Ant-who-tica?

96
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,352
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,734
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

98
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,572
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

99
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,951
This is all
some kind of whacked-out conspiracy.

100
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,247
We're going
to the wide-open spaces ofAntarctica.

101
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,915
To the wild.

102
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:43,003
The wild? You could actually go there?

103
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,797
That sounds great.

104
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,718
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

105
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,140
You didn't see anything.

106
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,392
-Right?
-Yes, sir.

107
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,644
I'm sorry. No, sir.

108
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:06,193
For his final appearance of the day,
the king of New York City.

109
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,945
Alex the lion.

110
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,697
Roar!

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,828
Thank you. Thank you very much.

112
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,746
You guys are great.
You're a great crowd.

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,084
Give yourselves a hand.
Thank you. Thank you.

114
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,086
Well. Thank you.

115
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,422
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

116
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,717
Underpants!

117
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,720
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

118
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,097
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

119
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,900
This is the life.

120
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,152
That's the spot.

121
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,945
I'm in heaven.

122
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,124
-It's Marty's birthday.
-Just rip it open.

123
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,045
-What is it?
-Come on. Open it up. What you got?

124
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,588
A thermometer.

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

126
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,178
I wanted to give you
something personal.

127
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,472
That was my first rectal thermometer.

128
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,599
-Mother...
-I'll miss that bad boy.

129
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,935
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

130
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,065
Happy birthday to you

131
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,067
You live in a zoo

132
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,736
You look like a monkey

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,572
And you smell like one too

134
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,659
I say.

135
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,455
Well, now,
you guys are just embarrassing me.

136
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,790
And yourselves.

137
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,042
What? We worked on that all week.

138
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,920
Let's go. Let's make a wish, babycakes.

139
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,595
-What'd you wish for?
-Nope. Can't tell you that.

140
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,763
Come on. Tell.

141
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,391
No siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

142
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,768
You want some bad luck, I'll blab it out.

143
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,354
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

144
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,232
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

145
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,441
Okay.

146
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,737
I wished I could go to the wild!

147
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,114
The wild?

148
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,120
I told you it was bad luck.

149
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,540
The wild? Are you nuts?

150
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,710
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

151
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,297
It's unsanitary.

152
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,258
The penguins are going. So why can't I?

153
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,051
The penguins are psychotic.

154
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,471
Come on.
Just imagine going back to nature.

155
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,517
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

156
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,437
I hear there's wide-open spaces
in Connecticut.

157
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,648
-Connecticut?
-You got to go over to Grand Central.

158
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,444
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... North?

159
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,031
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

160
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,492
Come on. What would Connecticut
have to offer us?

161
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,036
-Lyme disease.
-Thank you, Melman.

162
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,537
No, I just want...

163
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,331
There's none of this in the wild.

164
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,251
This is a highly refined
type of food thing

165
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,003
that you do not find in the wild.

166
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,340
You ever thought there might be
more to life than steak, Alex?

167
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,426
He didn't mean that, baby. No, no, no.

168
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,969
Doesn't it bother you guys

169
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:23,098
that you don't know anything
about life outside this zoo?

170
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,102
Nuh-uh. Nope.

171
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,731
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

172
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,942
You got a little schmutz
right there on your...

173
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:43,118
Thanks, guys. Thanks for the party.
It was great.

174
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,453
Really.

175
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,212
What's eating him?

176
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:57,132
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

177
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,095
Hey, I already gave him a snow globe.
I can't top that.

178
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,681
I can see where this is going.

179
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,727
It is getting late. I guess I'm going to...

180
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,572
Come on. He's your best friend.

181
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,659
All right, all right. Okay.

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,161
-Night, Marty.
-Night, Glo.

183
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,103
What a day.

184
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,524
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't get
any better than this, you know?

185
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,487
It just did. Even the star's out.

186
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,991
Not going to find a star like that
in the wild.

187
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,534
Helicopter.

188
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,290
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

189
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,624
Everybody has days when they think

190
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,127
the grass might be greener
somewhere else.

191
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,378
Alex.

192
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,964
Look at me.

193
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,842
I'm ten years old. My life is half over.

194
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,554
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes

195
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,806
or white with black stripes.

196
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,730
Marty.

197
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,066
I'm thinking of a song.

198
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,943
Alex. Please. Not now.

199
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,072
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

200
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,495
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. No, no, no.
I'm not listening.

201
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,499
Start spreadin' the news

202
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,583
I don't know you.

203
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,294
l'm leaving today

204
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,504
We are a great big part of it

205
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,631
He's funny. Who is that?

206
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,928
Come on.
You know you know the words.

207
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,846
Two little words.

208
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,139
New York.

209
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,849
New York

210
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,019
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

211
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,021
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

212
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,732
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

213
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,859
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

214
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,946
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

215
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,533
-You're a bigmouth lion.
-See? Mr Grumpy Stripes.

216
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,910
We make a great team, the two of us.

217
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,663
We sure do. No doubt about it.

218
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,333
So, what are you going to do?
Go running off to the wild by yourself?

219
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,543
-No.
-Good.

220
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,127
You and me. Let's go.

221
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,379
-What?
-The wild.

222
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,839
Come on. You and me together.

223
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,218
It's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue
to Grand Central.

224
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,262
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

225
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,889
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

226
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,891
You're joking. Right?

227
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:01,108
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking.
Give me a break.

228
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,569
Like we're going to get a train.

229
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,281
Don't do that.
You really had me worried there.

230
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,742
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

231
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,413
Yeah, me too.
I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow.

232
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,417
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

233
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,961
Give them a little jolt. You know?

234
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,506
Good night, AllyAl.

235
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,893
They forgot
to turn off the ambience again.

236
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,062
Don't worry. It's cool.

237
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,732
You know, I got it.

238
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,574
Much better.

239
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,974
Come on, now, baby.

240
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,143
My little filet.

241
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,480
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

242
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,317
I like that. I like a little fat on my steak.

243
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,571
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

244
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,407
Alex. Alex. Alex!

245
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,992
What? What?

246
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,952
You suck your thumb?

247
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,162
What is it, Melman?

248
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,123
You know
how I have that bladder infection

249
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,750
and I have to get up every two hours?

250
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,296
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

251
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,131
I don't know why, but I did. And...

252
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,841
What? What's going on?

253
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,718
It's Marty. He's gone.

254
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,846
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

255
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,391
How long has he been working on this?

256
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,185
Marty! Marty!

257
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,812
He wouldn't fit down there.

258
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,647
Marty? Marty! Marty!

259
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,858
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

260
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,821
-Connecticut!
-He wouldn't.

261
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,615
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

262
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,201
I mean, we got to call somebody!

263
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,709
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

264
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,295
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

265
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,217
-Hello? Hello?
-Wait a second.

266
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,803
-We can't call the people.
-What the... ?

267
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,265
They'll be really mad.

268
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,685
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

269
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,978
I know that's right.

270
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,771
-We got to go after him.
-Go after him?

271
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,064
He's not thinking straight.

272
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,443
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

273
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,739
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

274
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,533
Poor little guy.

275
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,098
Come on.

276
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,434
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

277
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,771
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

278
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,273
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

279
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,150
-You should take Lexington.
-Melman!

280
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,779
-Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
-What about Park?

281
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,490
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

282
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,994
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Centre.

283
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,374
Well, of course
we're going to throw poo at him.

284
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,093
We should've taken Park.

285
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,596
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

286
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,473
I don't know! That's what Melman said.

287
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,016
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

288
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,145
That room has some nifty little sinks
you can wash up in, and look!

289
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,939
Free mints!

290
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,649
This isn't a field trip.

291
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,735
This is an urgent mission to save Marty
from throwing his life away.

292
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,737
Now, where's the train?

293
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,989
Here it comes.

294
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,329
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

295
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,208
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

296
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,294
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

297
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,257
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

298
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,765
What you got to do is go straight back
down West 42nd.

299
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,017
-It's on your left after Vanderbilt.
-Okay.

300
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,187
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

301
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,147
Thanks a lot, officer.

302
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,776
Hey! Wait for the light.

303
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,362
Freak.

304
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,031
-Did you say "zebra"?
-That's right. A zebra.

305
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,700
Right in front of me.

306
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,577
-Can I shoot it?
-Negative.

307
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,204
Then I'm going to need some backup.

308
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,719
-Knicks lost again.
-What are you going to do?

309
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,014
Did that say "Grand Central Station"
or "my aunt's constipation"?

310
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,181
This is it.

311
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,103
Grand Central Station.

312
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,939
It's grand and it's central.

313
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,792
Move aside.
We have an emergency here.

314
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,794
This is an emergency situation.

315
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,757
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

316
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,009
Upstairs, downstairs.

317
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,510
How do you like that?

318
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,140
Lady! What is wrong with you?

319
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,477
Get a grip on yourselves, people.

320
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,728
You're a bad kitty.

321
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,483
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

322
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,402
Looks like I'll have to take
the Stamford local.

323
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,279
I got him! I've got him!

324
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,405
He's got him!

325
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,616
He's got him! He's got him! He's got...

326
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,701
I got something for you!

327
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,456
I'm okay. I'm okay.

328
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,084
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?

329
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,796
-I am so glad we found you.
-We were so worried about you.

330
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,383
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

331
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,302
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

332
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,222
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

333
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,932
Because I was wondering...

334
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,977
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

335
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,104
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

336
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,481
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

337
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,150
-Do you hear him?
-Guys, we're running out of time.

338
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,319
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

339
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,906
...do this again!
Don't you ever, ever do this again!

340
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,366
Come here.

341
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,624
We've been ratted out, boys.

342
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,876
Hold your fire!

343
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,927
Cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.

344
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,308
If you have any poo, fling it now.

345
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,396
It's the Man.

346
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,607
Good evening, officers.

347
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,152
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

348
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,987
You're not good
with the "putting words together

349
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,781
"and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

350
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,744
Hey! How you doing? You know what?
Everything's cool.

351
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,789
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

352
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,876
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

353
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,879
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

354
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,672
Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head.

355
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:06,634
Just shush! I will handle this.

356
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,219
Oh! I got him!

357
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,055
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

358
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,390
Would you give a guy a break?

359
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:18,146
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

360
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,691
No harm, no foul, right?

361
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,820
Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion.
From the zoo.

362
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,660
What's the matter with them?

363
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,590
I feel really, really weird.

364
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,136
I love you guys.

365
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,889
I love you so much.

366
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,454
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand CentraI

367
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,500
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

368
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,586
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

369
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,172
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

370
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,093
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

371
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,221
-Hey. Little help?
-He's awake! He's awake!

372
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,806
Do something!

373
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,559
Oh, man.

374
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,114
Oh, my head.

375
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,243
What the...?

376
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,745
Wait. Where? What?

377
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,250
I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no!
Not the box.

378
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,336
Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me!

379
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,007
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

380
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,176
Darkness creeping in.

381
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,303
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

382
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,513
Walls closing in around me.

383
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,933
So alone. So alone.

384
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,769
-Alex! Alex, are you there?
-Marty?

385
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,023
-Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
-Oh, Marty! You're here!

386
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,984
-What's going on? You okay?
-This doesn't look good.

387
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,236
-Alex, Marty, is that you?
-Gloria!

388
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,489
-You're here too!
-I am loving the sound of your voice.

389
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,575
-What is going on?
-We're all in crates.

390
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,951
Oh, no!

391
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,747
-Sleeping just knocks me out.
-Melman!

392
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,873
Is that Melman?

393
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,584
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm fine.

394
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,378
I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI.

395
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,881
-You're not getting an MRI.
-CAT scan?

396
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,343
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

397
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,055
Zoo transfer? Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

398
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,641
I have an appointment
with Dr Goldberg at 5:00.

399
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,018
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

400
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,604
No other zoo
could afford my medical care.

401
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,814
And I am not going HMO.

402
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,442
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

403
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:14,239
-We are going to be okizay.
-No, we're not going to be okizay.

404
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,282
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

405
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:20,245
Because of me?
I fail to see how this is my fault.

406
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,539
-You're kidding, right, Marty?
-You. You ticked off the people.

407
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,209
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

408
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,086
"I don't know who I am.

409
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,672
"I got to go find myself in the wild."
Oh, please.

410
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,050
I did not ask you to come after me,
did I?

411
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,677
He does have a point.

412
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:39,055
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

413
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,598
Melman, just shut it.

414
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,892
You suggested this idea to him
in the first place.

415
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,436
-Leave Melman out of this.
-Thank you, Gloria.

416
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,647
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

417
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,150
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

418
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,570
-I feel nauseous.
-Melman, you always feel nauseous.

419
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,953
Progress report.

420
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,123
It's an older code, Skipper.
I can't make it out.

421
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,125
You, higher mammal.

422
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,876
Can you read?

423
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,963
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

424
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,387
Ship to Kenya.

425
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,015
Wildlife preserve.

426
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,141
Africa!

427
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,935
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

428
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,606
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

429
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,150
-Guys, listen.
-A king. Loved by my people.

430
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,903
-Let's be civil.
-And you've ruined everything!

431
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,029
"Loved"?

432
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:22,367
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

433
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,620
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

434
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,747
I thought I knew the real you!

435
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,501
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

436
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,503
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

437
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,172
You're not helping the situation.

438
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,049
Status.

439
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,344
It's no good. I don't know the codes.

440
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,972
Don't give me excuses. Give me results!
Navigation.

441
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,770
All right. Let me think.

442
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,480
And shut him up!

443
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,569
-I did it!
-Let's get this tin can turned around.

444
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,639
Guys?

445
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,933
Oh, no.

446
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,226
Gloria!

447
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,561
Melman!

448
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,854
Marty!

449
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,273
Alex!

450
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,567
Marty?

451
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,861
Alex!

452
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,987
Marty!

453
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,990
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

454
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,367
Don't go.

455
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,539
Marty?

456
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,083
Melman?

457
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,628
Gloria?

458
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,093
Marty? Melman? Gloria?

459
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,348
Marty!

460
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,809
Melman! Gloria!

461
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,688
Hey, anyone! Hello!

462
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,779
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

463
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,408
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

464
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,161
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

465
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,121
Matt, Katie, Al.

466
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,629
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

467
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,049
Get me out of this thing right now!

468
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,385
Hello? Somebody?

469
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,053
Melman!

470
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,305
Alex? Is that you?

471
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,809
Melman, I got you. Hang on! Hang on.
I got you.

472
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,692
Melman! I got you, buddy.

473
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,075
Wait a sec, Melman. Wait right there.

474
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,996
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting you out of the box.

475
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,707
-Relax.
-Alex?

476
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,294
Giraffe, corner pocket!

477
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,546
Here goes nothing!

478
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,340
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-Hold still!

479
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,758
-Wait, Alex.
-Hold still.

480
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,927
-No, come on.
-Here I come!

481
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,804
Look! Look! Look! Look!

482
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,016
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

483
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,477
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

484
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,687
Oh, my...

485
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:31,866
Gloria!

486
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,164
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

487
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,290
Gloria!

488
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,875
Alex!

489
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,296
-Marty?
-Marty!

490
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,717
Yeah! All right! That's right!

491
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,763
Left! Left! Left. No, no, your left!
Your left! Your left!

492
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,390
Right here's good.

493
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,561
I don't have anything on me right now.
I'll have to get you later.

494
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,858
To you too.

495
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,279
Marty! Marty!

496
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,034
Alex!

497
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,998
-Marty!
-Alex!

498
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,876
-Marty!
-Al!

499
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,420
Marty!

500
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,297
Alex?

501
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,007
Marty!

502
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,345
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

503
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,471
Martin!

504
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,181
-Hold up!
-I'm going to kill you!

505
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,017
-Come here! Don't run away from me!
-Calm down!

506
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:44,105
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

507
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,856
Oh, look at us.

508
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,235
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

509
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah, here we are.

510
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,949
Where exactly is "here"?

511
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,215
-San Diego.
-San Diego?

512
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,800
White sandy beaches,

513
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,054
cleverly simulated natural environment,
wide-open enclosures.

514
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,391
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

515
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,268
Complete with fake rocks.

516
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,145
Wow, that looks real.

517
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:28,482
San Diego?
What could be worse than San Diego?

518
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,569
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

519
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:35,197
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

520
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,241
-I'll kill you!
-Take it easy!

521
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,534
-Strangle you!
-Calm down.

522
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,620
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

523
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,498
-20-second timeout.
-I'll never talk to you again.

524
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,084
Now, look.
We're just going to find the people,

525
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,172
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

526
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,509
Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego.

527
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,430
Now I'll have to compete with Shamu
and his smug little grin.

528
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,599
I can't top that. Can't top it.

529
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,269
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

530
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,606
It's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me.

531
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,778
Come on, Alex. Do you honestly think
I intended all of this to happen?

532
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,781
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

533
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,282
Okay, I'm...

534
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,326
He just shushed me.

535
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,079
Marty, look, you've got to be
just a little bit more und...

536
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,917
-Don't you shush me.
-Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

537
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,631
-I hear it now.
-Where there's music, there's people.

538
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,425
-Go to the head honcho.
-A sidewalk would be nice.

539
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,135
Yeah, what a dump.

540
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,304
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

541
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:45,643
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

542
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,188
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

543
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,900
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

544
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,117
What the...?

545
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,795
Oh, no!

546
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,264
Okay, let's make a good impression
on the people.

547
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,475
Smiles, everyone. Let's get it together.

548
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,728
-Is that the best you can do?
-Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

549
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,273
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

550
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,575
-Wow!
-It's not people. It's animals.

551
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,035
California animals. Dude.

552
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,580
This is like a Puffy party.

553
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:51,166
l like to move it, move it
l like to move it, move it

554
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,043
-Ya Iike to
-Move it

555
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,547
l like to move it, move it
l like to move it, move it

556
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,382
l like to move it, move it

557
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,384
-Ya Iike to
-Move it

558
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,846
l like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

559
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,723
She like to move it, move it

560
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,725
-He Iike to
-Move it

561
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,102
All girls all over the world

562
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,522
OriginaI King JuIien 'pon yer case, man

563
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,984
l love how all the girls
that love to move their body

564
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,736
When ya move your body, ya do

565
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,323
Move it nice and sweet and sassy,
all right

566
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,741
What kind of zoo is this?

567
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,328
I just saw 26
blatant health code violations.

568
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,414
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

569
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,999
Twenty-seven.

570
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,252
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

571
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,881
Physically, physically, physically fit
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

572
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,467
We should've brought chips and dip.

573
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,968
Wait.

574
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,847
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

575
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,808
I don't know where he's at, but he's
missing one heck of a party.

576
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,020
The foosa!

577
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,065
The foosa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

578
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,658
-Foosa hungry.
-Foosa eat.

579
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,954
I hate spiderwebs.

580
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,956
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

581
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,042
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

582
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,966
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

583
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,344
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

584
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,805
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

585
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,350
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

586
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,311
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

587
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:38,315
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

588
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,025
Well, howdy-do.

589
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,868
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

590
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,747
-Maurice, did you see that?
-He scared the foosa away.

591
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,377
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

592
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,587
Get it! Get it! Get it!

593
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,632
-That's it! Smack it!
-Get it, get it!

594
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,592
Whip it! Whip it good! Where'd it go?

595
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,805
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?

596
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,852
They are aliens.
Savage aliens from the savage future.

597
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,395
They've come to kill us.

598
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,398
And take our women.
And our precious metals.

599
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,278
Get up, Mort.
Do not be near the king's feet, okay?

600
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,991
We're hiding. Be quiet, everyone.
Including me.

601
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,910
Who's making that noise?
Oh, it's me again.

602
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,996
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

603
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,291
-Enough! Enough with the stick.
-I think she got it.

604
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,960
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

605
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,296
It's okay. It's gone.

606
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,298
They are savages.

607
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,216
Tonight we die.

608
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,595
The feet. I told you... I told you to...
I told every...

609
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,930
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

610
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,349
He did tell you about the feet.

611
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,229
-Wait. I have a plan.
-Really?

612
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:04,651
I have devised a cunning test
to see whether these are savage killers.

613
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,118
Hi there.

614
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,872
You let me handle it. Alex handles it.
Marty does nothing.

615
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,046
Hi there.

616
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,593
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

617
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,931
-Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
-Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

618
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,684
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

619
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,440
-Alex!
-Oh, you poor little baby.

620
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,443
Did that big mean lion scare you?

621
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:50,948
He did?
He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

622
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,784
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Look at you.

623
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,161
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

624
00:40:56,246 --> 00:41:01,291
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

625
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,128
They're just a bunch of pansies.

626
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,379
I don't know.

627
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,298
There's something about that one
with the crazy hairdo

628
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,509
that I find suspicious.

629
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,344
Nonsense, Maurice.

630
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,973
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

631
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,196
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

632
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:35,367
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

633
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,667
He's got style.

634
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,218
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

635
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,346
I think it's a squirrel.

636
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,683
Welcome, giant pansies.

637
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,394
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

638
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,313
-Definitely a squirrel.
-Yep. Squirrel.

639
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:09,610
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the foosa.

640
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,528
-The "whossa"?
-The foosa.

641
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,532
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

642
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,034
-and ripping our limbs off.
-Good.

643
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,412
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

644
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,873
What big teeth you have. Man!

645
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,583
Shame on you, Maurice.

646
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,878
Can you not see
that you have insulted the freak?

647
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,255
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

648
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,218
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

649
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,803
And just where are you giants from?

650
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,890
We're from New York and...

651
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:45,145
-All hail the New York giants!
-New York giants!

652
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,399
Is this
some sort of inbreeding programme?

653
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,569
I say we just got to ask these bozos
where the people are.

654
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:56,740
Excuse me.
We bozos have the people, of course.

655
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,909
Hey, the bozos have the people.

656
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,204
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

657
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,414
They're up there.

658
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,713
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

659
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,215
Wow.

660
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:17,010
So do you have any live people?

661
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,388
No. Only dead ones.

662
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,224
I mean,
if we had a lot of live people here,

663
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,103
it wouldn't be called the wild, would it?

664
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,938
-The wild?
-Whoa.

665
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,524
Hold up there a second, fuzzbucket.

666
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,775
You mean, like,

667
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,488
the "live in a mud hut,
wipe yourself with a leaf" type wild?

668
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,116
-Who wipes?
-Oy vey.

669
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,951
-Oy vey!
-Oy vey, everybody!

670
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,036
Oy vey!

671
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,497
Could you excuse me for a moment?

672
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,463
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

673
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,174
-Help!
-What are you doing?

674
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,302
I'm swimming back to New York.

675
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,179
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

676
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:04,891
-You can't swim!
-I said my chances are slim!

677
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:10,022
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off!
I can't see! I can't see!

678
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,233
I can see!

679
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,821
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

680
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,324
The people didn't dump us here
on purpose.

681
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:24,494
As soon as they realise what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

682
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,829
Yeah, right.

683
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know the words
But we're born free

684
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,670
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

685
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:44,097
Well, boys, it's going to be
ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

686
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,769
Rico.

687
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:55,734
Well, since I'm doomed to die
on this forsaken island,

688
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,153
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

689
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,615
being of sound mind and unsound body,

690
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,369
have divided my estate equally
among the three of you.

691
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,288
Sorry, Alex.

692
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:13,085
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

693
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:16,630
No, it's not a latrine. It's a grave.

694
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,257
You sent Melman to his grave.
Are you happy?

695
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,801
Come on.

696
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,221
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

697
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,556
This could be the best that's happened.

698
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:31,061
No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No. No. No.

699
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,063
This is not the best thing
that's happened to us.

700
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,524
You abused the power
of the birthday wish

701
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,484
and brought bad luck on all of us.

702
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,986
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

703
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,948
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

704
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,076
-You guys made me tell you.
-Oh, okay.

705
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,955
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

706
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,041
Look around.
There's no fences, no schedules.

707
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,419
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

708
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,963
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

709
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:02,926
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

710
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,762
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

711
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,266
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

712
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,060
This is the good side
for those who love New York

713
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,103
and care about going home.

714
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,523
-Come on.
-No, no. Back! Back!

715
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,150
You know what? This isn't good.

716
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:22,612
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

717
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,157
And if you need me, I'll be over here,

718
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:29,244
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

719
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,787
This is the fun side,

720
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:34,124
where we'll have a great time surviving
until we go home.

721
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,793
-A yabbadabbado old time!
-This side's the best.

722
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,295
That side stinks!

723
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,964
You're on the Jersey side
of this cesspool!

724
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,049
-Wilma!
-Now what do we do?

725
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,552
Don't worry.
I have a plan to get us rescued.

726
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:51,725
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

727
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:58,523
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

728
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,784
Shut up, Spalding.

729
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:20,587
I've been standing here for hours, man.
How long do I have to pose like this?

730
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,965
She is finito.

731
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,678
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

732
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,014
to miss this baby.

733
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:35,018
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

734
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,897
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

735
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,691
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

736
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:45,028
-How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
-Great. Idiot.

737
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,613
I heard that.

738
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,699
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

739
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,952
That's wild fire.

740
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,996
We're not using wild fire
on Lady Liberty.

741
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,457
-Now, rub, Melman.
-I've been doing...

742
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:02,003
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.
I ju... I can't do it!

743
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:07,175
Fire.

744
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,470
Fire! Fire!

745
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,850
Oh, my.

746
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,352
Fire!

747
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,020
Not yet! No, no! No!

748
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,897
Fire!

749
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,440
Melman, hold still!

750
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,068
Jump! Alex, jump!

751
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,238
Don't worry, cats always land on their...

752
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,324
Face? Man, what kind of cat are you?

753
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,002
You maniac!

754
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,256
You burnt it up! Darn you!

755
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,551
Darn you all to heck!

756
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,095
Can we go to the fun side now?

757
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,600
Everybody, calm down. Come on.
Into your chairs.

758
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,603
Everybody, calm down. Let go of his tail.

759
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,063
Separate those two, would you, please?

760
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,898
You here, you there. Everyone...

761
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,611
Calm down, people, okay?

762
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:11,781
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

763
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,118
You know, et cetera, et cetera. Hooray.
Let's go.

764
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,870
Now, everybody,

765
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:21,791
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

766
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,627
-Yes, Willie?
-I like them.

767
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,131
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

768
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,799
I liked them right away.

769
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,301
You hate them
compared to how much I like them.

770
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,720
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

771
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,099
Now, for as long as we can remember,

772
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:42,687
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded foosa.

773
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,482
The foosa! The foosa are attacking!

774
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,571
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

775
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,281
Please. Maurice.

776
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,451
Quiet!

777
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,372
Come on, y'all. They're not attacking us
this very instant.

778
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,460
So my genius plan is this:

779
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:10,924
We will make the New York giants
our friends and keep them close.

780
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:16,137
Then, with Mr Alex protecting us,
we will be safe

781
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:21,059
and never have to worry
about the dreaded foosa ever again.

782
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,190
I thought of that. I thought of that.
Yes. Me. I did.

783
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,527
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

784
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,780
I mean,
does anyone wonder why the foosa

785
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,241
were so scared of Mr Alex?

786
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,494
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

787
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,747
What if Mr Alex
is even worse than the foosa?

788
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,419
I tell you, that dude
just gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

789
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,130
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

790
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:53,967
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

791
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,263
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

792
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,515
No? Good. So shut up.

793
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,060
When the New York giants wake up,

794
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:09,482
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

795
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,611
Now, who would like a cookie?

796
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:42,098
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

797
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,643
There's room on the fun side
for one more.

798
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,353
No, thanks.

799
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:51,566
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

800
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,611
I don't know,
you might even enjoy yourself.

801
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,697
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

802
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,241
I just want to go home.

803
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,746
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

804
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,250
it really isn't the fun side without you.

805
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,726
I know. And then...

806
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,648
-It's him.
-Who is it?

807
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,443
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

808
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:38,112
Yes? Can I help you?

809
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,074
Can I come to the fun side?

810
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,994
Beg your pardon?

811
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,288
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

812
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:53,169
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

813
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,806
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

814
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,641
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

815
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,275
-Alex!
-Mi casa is su casa.

816
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,242
Very impressive.

817
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,995
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

818
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,915
This is seawater.

819
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,251
Oh, you don't swallow it.

820
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,545
It's just temporary
till the plumbing's done.

821
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,755
Hey, y'all look hungry.

822
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,384
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

823
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,095
You have food?

824
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,140
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

825
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,767
Seaweed on a stick.

826
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,311
Seaweed?

827
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,647
On a stick. Don't love it till you try it.

828
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,616
That's unbelievable.

829
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,286
-So good.
-Well, thanks.

830
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,247
It does kind of hit the spot, doesn't it?

831
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,834
Well, maybe it could use a little lemon.

832
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:23,092
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

833
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,928
Oh, but it does.

834
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,263
Check this out.

835
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,564
Wow. Would you look at that.

836
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:41,110
It's like billions and billions
of helicopters.

837
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,613
It's a shooting star. Make a wish. Quick!

838
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,699
How about a thick, juicy steak?

839
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,201
You know what, Alex?

840
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:53,164
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

841
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,666
Thanks, Marty.

842
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,835
It is getting late. I guess I'm going to...

843
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,088
I think I'm going to hit the sack too.

844
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,131
Sweet dreams, everyone.

845
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,871
Alex.

846
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,842
What are you doing?

847
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:51,305
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

848
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,683
Looks like
you're black with white stripes after all.

849
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,935
Dilemma solved. Good night.

850
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,866
You see, Maurice,
Mr Alex was grooming his friend.

851
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,369
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

852
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:16,039
How can you have the heebie-jeebies
for Mr Alex?

853
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,709
Look at him. He's so cute and plushy.

854
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,545
I don't think he was grooming him.

855
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,048
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

856
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:28,301
Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care.

857
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:32,513
Soon we will
put my excellent plan to action.

858
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:38,895
All we have to do is wait
until they are deep in their sleep.

859
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,487
How long is this going to take?

860
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,348
Well, this sucks!

861
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:22,855
Wake up, Mr Alex.

862
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,525
Rise and shining.

863
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,903
Wakey-waking, Mr Alex!

864
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,114
Wake up! Alex!

865
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,740
You suck your thumb?

866
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,954
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

867
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,664
What do you think? Take it easy.

868
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:43,167
-Who built a forest?
-Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

869
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:44,460
While you were asleep,

870
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:48,840
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

871
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,300
Welcome to Madagascar.

872
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,678
-Mada-who-ah?
-What?

873
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:56,139
No, not whooha. Ascar.

874
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,439
Marty. It's...

875
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:08,067
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

876
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:12,238
Oh, no, fella,
that is the real deal right there.

877
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,615
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

878
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,661
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

879
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,914
-That's the real version of...
-How about once around the park?

880
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,459
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

881
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,086
Who's with me?

882
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,422
Naw. I don't think I could... You're it!

883
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,591
Hey! Want to play around?

884
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,844
Got you there!

885
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,470
Come here!

886
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,722
You're it.

887
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,850
Hey, stop that! Hey, you're crazy!

888
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:46,272
Okay, Marty, I'm it. I'm it. I'm it. You win.

889
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,025
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

890
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,818
I haven't eaten in two days.

891
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,821
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

892
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,531
I don't think that's your problem.

893
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:58,451
First of all,
that's not how you run in the wild.

894
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,788
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!
You just have to let out that inner lion.

895
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,209
-Now, who's the cat?
-Marty, I really don't...

896
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,462
You are, that's who. Come on!
Here we go!

897
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,340
That's it. Let's build up some steam!
You the cat.

898
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:15,384
-Who's the cat?
-You the cat.

899
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:23,184
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

900
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,604
I'm the cat!

901
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,153
Surprise!

902
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:45,289
You're it. You're it!
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

903
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:53,506
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

904
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:57,551
-Let's go wild!
-Now you're talking!

905
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,728
Man! I feel different.

906
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,856
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

907
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,735
Kind of charged up or something.

908
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,488
-Like you said, baby, it's...
-Crackalacking.

909
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,409
-Ain't that right, Melman?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

910
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,122
I'm in heaven.

911
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:31,043
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the foosas are nowhere to be seen.

912
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:37,717
It could be said that my plan is working
in a very good working kind of way.

913
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,261
Alex. You got to try some of this.

914
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,932
I feel good. Feel like a king again.

915
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:46,892
King?

916
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,395
You should see his act.

917
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,565
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act?

918
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,735
Oh. No,
I really don't think I could... Okay.

919
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,821
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

920
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,282
The wild proudly presents:

921
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,992
The king.

922
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,536
Alex the lion!

923
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,289
E flat, fellas.

924
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,134
Yeah! The king is in the house!

925
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,470
See, if he is the king,
then where is his crown?

926
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,846
I've got a crown.

927
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,266
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

928
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,602
Look at it. Have I got it on?

929
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,443
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

930
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,993
Wow. I've never heard that one before.

931
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,454
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

932
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,624
Break out the wave!

933
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,277
Excuse me.

934
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,613
You're biting my butt.

935
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,992
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

936
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,247
-What did you do?
-You just bit me!

937
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,374
No. I didn't. Did I?

938
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,209
-You kind of did.
-He just bit me on the butt!

939
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,670
What the heck is wrong with you?

940
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,297
Why'd you bite me?

941
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,259
-Man, it's because you are his dinner.
-What?

942
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,594
-Excuse me?
-That's dumb.

943
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,057
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

944
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:52,059
Here, give me a nibble.

945
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,896
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

946
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,606
What are you talking about?

947
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,442
Your friend here is what we call

948
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,611
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

949
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:06,115
And he eats steak, which is you.

950
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,786
-Get out of here.
-Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

951
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,455
The plan failed.

952
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,666
All is lost! We're all doomed.

953
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,671
The foosas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because

954
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,340
we are all steak.

955
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,800
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

956
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,136
Mr Alex cannot stay here.

957
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,599
He belongs with his own kind
on the foosa side of the island.

958
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,559
By the power vested in me,

959
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,021
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

960
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,314
-Be gone!
-What?

961
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:41,108
Come on, do I look like a steak to you?

962
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,443
Yeah!

963
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,446
See, I told you I don't look like a...
Wait. What you say?

964
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,615
Oh, yeah!

965
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:52,870
-He's going savage.
-Run for your lives.

966
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,540
Marty, run!

967
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,811
-A bull's eye. Excellent shot, Maurice.
-Thank you.

968
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,110
Marty?

969
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,281
I'm so sorry, Marty.

970
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,829
What is wrong with me?

971
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,043
Oh, no.

972
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:45,881
What have I done?
It's true. I'm a monster.

973
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,008
I got to get out of here.

974
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,810
What have I done? This is a nightmare.

975
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,020
And it's all my fault.

976
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:07,481
Now, because of me, we've lost Alex.

977
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,233
Well, what are we going to do?

978
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,860
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

979
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,112
Okay.

980
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,989
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

981
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:19,326
We're tough. We're gritty.
We're adaptable!

982
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:23,205
And we are not going to lay down
like a bunch of Melmans.

983
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,541
No, we're not.

984
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,042
Oh. Gloria.

985
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:30,713
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

986
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,548
-The boat!
-The boat?

987
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:36,802
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

988
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,638
There it is!

989
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,557
-Hey, over here!
-Over here!

990
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,100
Over here! Yo!

991
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,728
Melman, give me a lift. Hurry up!
Lift me up!

992
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,479
Help! Help! Help!

993
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,274
-Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
-Over here!

994
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,986
-Melman! Steady. This way!
-You have no idea how much this hurts.

995
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,196
Hey, boat! We're over here!

996
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:02,369
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

997
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:04,663
Come on! Come on, baby!

998
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,458
Yes! You guys.

999
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,835
You flag down that boat. I'll get Alex.

1000
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,838
Whoa! Hold on there.

1001
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,424
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1002
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,885
Come on. I know Alex.

1003
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,554
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1004
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,931
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1005
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,934
Melman's right.
The people will know what to do.

1006
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:28,520
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1007
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,458
Now, this is more like it.

1008
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,961
You? Oh, ma... Where are the people?

1009
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,631
We killed them and ate their livers.

1010
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,383
Got you, didn't I?

1011
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,637
Just kidding, doll, the people are fine.

1012
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,306
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1013
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,975
Hey, I know you two.

1014
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,355
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1015
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,400
Marty? He's righ... Where did he go?
He was right behind us.

1016
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,987
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1017
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,282
Well, boys,
our monochromatic friend's in danger.

1018
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,201
Looks like we have a job to do.

1019
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:27,120
Captain's log:
Embarking into hostile environment.

1020
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:30,457
Kowalski. We'll need to win the hearts
and the minds of the natives.

1021
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,544
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1022
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,088
We're going to face extreme peril.

1023
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,590
Private probably won't survive.

1024
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:48,225
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1025
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,686
The boat's here! We can go home!

1026
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:07,703
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1027
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:14,626
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1028
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:18,964
Alex!

1029
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,175
Marty?

1030
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,552
Snap out of it, Alex.

1031
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,138
The boat came back.
We can get out of here.

1032
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,183
We can go back to civilisation,
and everything will be like it used to be.

1033
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,768
Stay back.

1034
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:33,979
Please.

1035
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,899
I'm a monster.

1036
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,485
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1037
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,405
We're a team. You and me, remember?

1038
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:53,582
I don't want to hurt you.

1039
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,198
Alex.

1040
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,242
I ain't leaving without you.

1041
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:48,220
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1042
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,057
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1043
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,229
Start spreadin' the news

1044
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:02,150
l'm leaving today

1045
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,822
We are a great big part of it

1046
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:13,745
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1047
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,373
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1048
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,918
You really don't want to hear me
sing this by myself.

1049
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:26,842
Alex? Could you come out here
for a minute?

1050
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:30,387
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1051
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,639
Help me!

1052
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,768
Alex! Help!

1053
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,608
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1054
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,279
Help!

1055
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,500
-Melman?
-That's right, baby.

1056
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,045
Run!

1057
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:07,215
-What's the plan?
-This is the plan.

1058
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,842
-Foosa hungry.
-Foosa eat.

1059
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,261
This is the plan?

1060
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,721
Foosa halt.

1061
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,393
Ooh.

1062
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,353
Foosa aaahh.

1063
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,191
Foosa ooh.

1064
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,111
Foosa aaahh.

1065
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,238
Come and get it.

1066
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,740
Foosa.

1067
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,421
-Take that.
-Foosa ow!

1068
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,465
There's too many of them, Skipper.

1069
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,676
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1070
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,017
Alex?

1071
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,020
That's my kill.

1072
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,355
Mine.

1073
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,487
Alex hungry.

1074
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,989
Alex eat.

1075
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,550
It's showtime.

1076
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,555
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1077
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:38,473
Man, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

1078
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,267
You can't just come sneak up on me.

1079
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:43,228
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1080
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,773
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1081
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,900
Like I said, it's showtime.

1082
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,695
Mine.

1083
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,239
My kill.

1084
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,617
They're all mine.

1085
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,496
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1086
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,707
-Don't eat me!
-He's big and scary!

1087
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,586
Fear me!
Savagery beyond comprehension.

1088
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,506
-I am far too young to die!
-You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1089
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:14,092
-And, you!
-Me?

1090
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:23,018
Oh, you want some of this?
You better run for your lives.

1091
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:26,438
-Somebody call a cop!
-He's psychotic!

1092
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,198
This is my territory. Understand?

1093
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,453
I never, ever
want to see you on my turf again.

1094
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,628
Boo.

1095
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,132
Yeah! You the cat!

1096
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,635
Got my boy back!

1097
01:15:58,471 --> 01:15:59,596
I did it!

1098
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,808
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1099
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:07,062
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1100
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,314
I am very clever king.

1101
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:11,775
I am super genius.

1102
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,402
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1103
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,447
-Compute, compute.
-So, what's for lunch?

1104
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,244
-Close those eyes.
-Why do I have to?

1105
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,662
-Do it.
-They're closed.

1106
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,997
-Tighter.
-Yes, sir.

1107
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,499
-No peeking.
-They're closed.

1108
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,959
Rico.

1109
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,339
Hai.

1110
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,176
Open that hatch.

1111
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,345
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1112
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:44,057
Chew like you mean it. Savour it.

1113
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,559
-And?
-Well?

1114
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,770
Pretty good, right?

1115
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,855
There's always Plan B.

1116
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,776
This is better than steak.

1117
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,778
I love it. I love it!

1118
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,863
The kitty loves the fishy.

1119
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:03,994
Well, I propose a toast.

1120
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,621
Now, he may be
a pain in the butt at times...

1121
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,790
And trust me, I know.

1122
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,876
But this cat proved to me
without a doubt

1123
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,337
that his heart is bigger
than his stomach.

1124
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:16,339
-To Alex.
-To Alex.

1125
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:25,056
Enough! Stop it!

1126
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,894
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1127
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:34,441
I don't know. I mean, this is your dream.
You sure you want to leave?

1128
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,484
I don't care where we are.

1129
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,988
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1130
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,656
Well, in that case...

1131
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,993
Yo. Rico. I'll take 300 orders to go.

1132
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,411
Hai.

1133
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:50,165
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1134
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:53,293
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1135
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:57,839
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1136
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:03,136
I have decided to thank you
for bringing peace to our home.

1137
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,846
And to make you feel good,

1138
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,849
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1139
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,602
No, I couldn't.
Really, I can't take your crown.

1140
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,979
That's okay, I've got a bigger crown.

1141
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,564
It's got a gecko on it.

1142
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,859
Look at him shake. Go, Stevie, go!

1143
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,529
-Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
-Thanks for everything!

1144
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,323
-So long!
-Bye-bye, now.

1145
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,741
-Arrivederci.
-Bye-bye.

1146
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,702
-Toodle-oo!
-See you later, crocodile.

1147
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:30,872
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1148
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,917
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1149
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,961
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1150
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,339
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1151
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,342
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1152
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,636
-Maybe Paris.
-You just read my mind.

1153
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,055
-I was thinking Spain.
-Run with the bulls.

1154
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,308
-What about Fiji?
-Canada. Can we?

1155
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,435
Cheap meds.

1156
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,021
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

1157
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:57,357
-I could do that.
-You could say that again.

1158
01:18:57,441 --> 01:19:00,527
-Skipper?
-I always wanted to go to Australia.

1159
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:04,197
Don't you think we should tell them
that the boat's out of gas?

1160
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,743
Nah. Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.
