00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,516

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,511

00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,358

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,670

Cool it!

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,554
It ends in four numbers,
I won't give you the beginning.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,557
Penelope, are you there?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,353

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,239

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,909
Lisa calling...

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,910
INVISIBLE

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,596
Bruno, it's Noel. Are you there?

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,599
Are you awake?

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,312
You haven't forgotten the meeting
or the demo?

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,230
I've promised the producer
she'd hear something.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,120
I hope you're on your way.
See you.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,918
She helped, not like your mum!

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,999
I don't need help. I'd like us
to enjoy moving in alone.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,435
That's fantastic, zilch!

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,311
I have to put these boxes away!

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,317
Don't, just push them!

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,195
I thought
these were the men's tollets.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,519
I'II go out. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,273
A quarter of an hour Iate
Is no blg deal.

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,913

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,833
"Yes, I've been chaslng after you

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,912
Instead of that

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,189
Well done!

46

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,633
We were part of the trend, but...

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,354
We only stole two pleces,
It's nothlng.

58
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,155
Two whole pleces
and blts and pleces, here and there.

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,352
That's water under the brldge,
no one cares now.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,471
I'm lnterested

A soon as we know

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,150
- You haven't hung up?
- No, I tried to call back.

82
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,557
You didn't want
to give your number.

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,113
Take it again.

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,118
I did take it the first time,
0 1-44-54...

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,675
No, it's 0 1-45...

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,556
Who's calling?

87

Who is it?

88
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,713
Marquis is fine,
I noted your number, but...

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,512
I tried but got no answer.

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,919
I know It's Iate but you aren't
often In durlng the day.

91
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,154
I wanted to lntroduce myself.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,152

93

100
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,630
Any palnklller would do.

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,589

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,268

Good ldea, soundprooflng,

108
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,154
of complalnts and lncldents
In towns?.

109
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,590
That's why I soundproofed the place.

110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,916
Not to hear other people's nolse.

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,995
Keep the box.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,510
No, you probably
often have headaches too.

113

I Ilke lt. I Ilstened

139
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,919
I don't like eavesdroppers.

140
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,274
Nelther do I, very much.

141
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,116
You aren't a regular

142
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,828
- What are you after?
- I don't know.

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,235
And you?.

144
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,233
Don't put the light on,
wait for me in the room.

145
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,193
Don't talk to me, do nothing.

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,154
And after?.

147

I leave first, we never meet again.

148
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,199
You're in a hurry?

149
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,431
Couldn't we talk a bit?

150
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,712
Or smoke a cigarette?

151
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,513
I can't find my cigs.
I need the light on.

152
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,476
Calm down. I won't start a fire.

153

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,109
You're not lnto that, are you?.

165
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,715
Really?.

166
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,794
Slnce when?.

167
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,358
I thought these chatllnes
were full of welrdoes.

168
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,959
There are all sorts.

169
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,593
Depends what you're Iooklng for.

170
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,916
What are you Iooklng for?.

171
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,830
When I've found It I'II tell you.

172
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,271
- Anythlng else to put away?.
- Hand me that cable.

173
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,635
- The red or the green?.
- The red one.

174
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,717
Have you taken your drawlngs?.

175
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,716
Yes, who Is lt?.

176
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,672
Same time, same place, same rules.

177
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,512
Why dld you call me agaln?.

178
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,393
I felt Ilke lt.

179
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,590
You'II pull the same trlck
each tlme?.

180
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,239
There's no trlck.

181
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,069
- And no each tlme.
- Stay then.

182
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,359
- You're never scared In the dark?.
- Yes.

183
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,038
Each tlme I thlnk
It mlght be Jack the Rlpper.

184
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,719
No one would know.

185
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,750
But I'm dlsappolnted,
no one's trled to klll me.

186
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,873
There have been many?.

187
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,151
I'm not very convincing.

188
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,354
Gentle rather.

189
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,436
Can you guess what I look like?

190
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,231
I'd rather imagine.

191
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,558
I want to know.

192
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,029
The cheeks...

193
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,749
Full cheeks.

194
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,275
The nose...

195
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,712
Straight,
with perhaps a little bump...

196
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,717
I haven't finished.

197
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,278
The mouth,

198
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,276
the teeth...

199
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,478
A prlckly cheek,

200
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,952
the Adam's apple,

201
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,713
the chest,

202
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,674
not too hairy.

203
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,671
The hole of the belly button...

204
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,195
and...

205
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,515
You tease!

206
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,471
I found your earrlng.

207
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,829
Really?.

208
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,116
Do I walt for you to call?.

209
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,277
Sorry I'm Iate.
Pretend I'm not here.

210
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,119
That's dlfflcult.
What's she dolng here?.

211
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,875
- If there's a problem...
- There's no problem.

212
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,672
I lnvlted Mlss Stevens.

213
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,472
Carole. It's slmpler.

214
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,719
- Let's be slmple.
- I lnvlted Carole to see us at work.

215
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,869
- You forgot to tell me.
- You never check your messages.

216
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,149
I wasn't at home!

217
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,557
I don't want to cause a row.

218
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,718
It's much more lnterestlng
when you play.

219
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,839
Rlght. Bruno, from the top?.

220
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,956
Carole Stevens speaking.

221
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,550
Really?.

222
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,035
Disappointed or am I waking you?

223
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,837
No, I'm surprlsed.

224
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,315
We ended on a bad note last time.

225
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,590
I thought about what you said.

226
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,512
Are you free for lunch?

227
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,676
It would help break the ice.

228
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm ready to draw up
the contract now.

229
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,393
- I haven't sald yes.
- What's mlsslng?.

230
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,999
A blg cheque.

231
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,713
Apart from that?.

232
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,949
Belng obsessed...

233
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,273
In a state of obsesslon.

234
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,995
Obsessed!

235
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,031
- I see.
- No you don't.

236
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,117
- Thank you.
- I lnslst.

237
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,314
It's my way of breaklng the lce.

238
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,475
Evening.

239
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,431
The Itallan snorlng above,
have you heard hlm before?.

240
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,436
How do you know he's Itallan?.

241
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,394
You're talklng nonsense!

242
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,592
You can't recognlse
an Itallan snorlng?.

243
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,551
Ever broken your contract?.

244
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,115
I mean, see someone several tlmes?.

245
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,029
See hlm agaln?.

246
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,116
How do you know
there've been other guys?.

247
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,991
I don't know much,
that's the problem.

248
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,670
AII the charm, on the contrary.

249
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,197
Charm, problem...
that often descrlbes women?.

250
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,199
Macho!

251
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,114
Ifyou knew me better,
you wouldn't say that.

252
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,875
I should get to know you better.

253
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,997
I hear your volce,
I want to make Iove.

254
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,839
I thlnk we're already maklng Iove.

255
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,553
Because your volce ls...

256
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,195
Intlmate...

257
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,995
Wet...

258
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,589
Wet?.

259
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,472
It wets the words.

260
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,034
I'd never been told such a thlng!

261
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,429
Walt!

262
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,399
Before Ieavlng, say somethlng
you've never sald to anyone.

263
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,036
I don't know...

264
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,992
Don't you trust me?.

265
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,955
Yes...

266
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,869
The flrst tlme I experlenced deslre

267
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,034
was when I saw a nall varnlsh ad.

268
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,510
The glrl's hand was superb.

269
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,431
I was twelve or thlrteen.

270
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,153
I was In my room.

271
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,392
And I felt the deslre
to fondle myself.

272
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,869
Here...

273
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,356
One, two, three flngers...

274
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,149
I was fllled. I was happy.

275
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,509
I must go.

276
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,556
You really want to leave?

277
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,950
Ifyou'd rather we stopped.

278
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,233
You remembered my earring?

279
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,749
Return it
and we have no reason to meet.

280
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,033
Here's the demo.

281
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,595
A rough draft.
I thlnk Bruno explalned.

282
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,190
I promlse I'II be merclless!

283
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,675
I also have rough drafts...

284
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,518
of a contract proposal.

285
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,638
Great, we'II take
a close Iook at lt.

286
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,953
Once that's sorted out, tell me
how Iong you need to rehearse,

287
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,997
so I can book the studlo.

288
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,589
A month should be flne.

289
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,230
Bruno, you Iook very penslve.

290
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,633
You thlnk I dance faster
than the muslc?.

291
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,829
Yes...

292
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,356
No...

293
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,829
Everythlng's flne?.

294
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,113
It's because Noel and I
have a Iot to do. We must go.

295
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,390
Walt, I must go too.

296
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,114
You're pleased?.

297
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,152
Wlth the rehearsals, I mean.

298
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,157
Yes, I guess so.

299
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,436
The closer we get to recordlng,
the more doubts.

300
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,437
It's normal.

301
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,956
What are you trylng to tell me?.

302
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,674
I'd rather you talked to me

303
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,154
and I'd Ilke you
to be more confldent.

304
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,032
Are you feellng lll?.

305
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,672
No, I'm flne, but In these blg cars
I get car slck.

306
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,994
That's a funky old cassette player!

307
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,671
I used to use It to record concerts

308
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,720
and I've kept It to Ilsten to them.

309
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,553
A few years ago
I often went to London.

310
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,910
On the ferry too,
there was no Eurostar back then.

311
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,393
You never go back?.

312
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,710
Sometlmes, but Iess often.

313
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,553
And the condltlons have changed.
I'm lnvlted now.

314
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,239
You mlss lt?.

315
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,312
It was another perlod.

316
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,158
You have to grow up.

317
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,235
Shlt...

318
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,396
She won't see anyway.

319
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,553
Here's your post, Bruno.

320
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,279
Can I call you Bruno?.

321
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,994
I wanted to brlng It earller.
You weren't back.

322
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,919
You needn't have,
I have a Ietterbox.

323
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,514
It's no bother!

324
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,349
Wlth all the stolen post
I prefer to hand It In person.

325
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,434
What If an lmportant Ietter

You're all dressed up,

329
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,718

330
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,269
Flne.

331
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,277
Can I come In a second?.

332
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,237
It's about the post.

333
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,432
It seems you are behlnd
In your rent.

334
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,034
What buslness Is It ofyours?.

335
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,879
Don't take It badly.

336
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,436
I dldn't want you to be too upset
by thls Ietter.

337
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,074
I don't Ilke
to brlng people bad news.

338
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,516
Especlally,
slnce everyone goes through

339
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,557
bad patches, don't they?.

340
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,949
That's why I became a caretaker.
Not to pay rent.

341
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,958
No more horrlble formal notlces.

342
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,755
I always have my place to stay now.

343
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,313
Of course, It's cramped
and you keep bumplng lnto thlngs.

344
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,316
A caretaker's Iodge
Is a blt Ilke a prlsoner's cell,

345
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,713
but wlth a Ilttle lmaglnatlon...

346
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,239
I'm sorry but I must...

347
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,919
Is that a DX7 or a DX9?.

348
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,029
A DX7.

349
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,873
Aren't you surprlsed
I know these thlngs?.

350
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,593
Yes... no...

351
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,193
I don't know.

352
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,879
I really don't have tlme.

353
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,594
No tlme to be surprlsed, Is that lt?.

354
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,116
I see, I feel thlngs.

355
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,716
You have an lmportant rendezvous.

356
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,876
Wlth a Iady, I suppose.

357
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,435
I really must go, I'm already Iate.

358
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,078
People don't connect nowadays,
don't you flnd, Bruno?.

359
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,319
They protect themselves,
they're more lndlvlduallstlc

360
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,832
or too attached to appearances.
They pass each other by. It's sad.

361
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,315
To please, you must charm,
play the game...

362
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,909
It tlres me out.

363
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,469
There!

364
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,355
Good dog, good girl.

365
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,954
Walt a second.

366
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,919
I Iook awful!

367
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,550
The value's malnly sentlmental.

368
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,359
That's why I thought

369
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,869
If someone found lt
they'd glve It to you.

370
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,354
No, I'm sorry.

371
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,233
Last week,
we were In room 18, I thlnk.

372
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,032
No, I assure you.

373
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,274
Before leaving, say something
you've never said to anyone.

374
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,470
Don't you trust me?

375
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,677
The first time I experienced...

376
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,113
I was twelve or thirteen...

377
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,671
The girl was superb.

378
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,232
I was twelve...

379
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,632
The Baron is here...

380
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,994
What? Red?

381
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,952
Bruno for Llsa...

382
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,909
I'm the Little Red Riding Hood...

383
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,155
Bruno for Llsa.

384
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,114
Get a hold ofyourself, pervert.

385
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,959
She's a pro.

386
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,551
You sound strange, Penelope.

387
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,711
Bruno, you seem In a hurry.

388
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,799
Get off my back!

389
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,872
What If I had the key
to all your problems?.

390
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,477
I have the spare key.
AII caretakers have spare keys.

391
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,509
Shlt!

392
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,918
Bruno seeklng Llsa.

393
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,353
Bruno for Llsa.

394
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,196
I haven't come for the room.

395
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,398
Remember the woman wlth me,
In the red dress?.

396
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,593
We see all sorts here.

397
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,753
I'm sure you do,
you saw her several tlmes.

398
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,035
Maybe you know her name.

399
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,958
We never glve such lnformatlon.

400
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,839
I understand
but I really need to flnd her.

401
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,076
Glve me a clue, anythlng.

402
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,511
In case she comes back,
I'II rent a room

403
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,876
and walt for her.
You'II make money.

404
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,991
Don't lnslst, I know nothlng.

405
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,273
Are you trylng to torture me

406
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,238
to that mushy muslc?.

407
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,956
Incredlble, you plck up a glrl

408
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,037
and ask for her number!

409
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,639
Get off my back!

410
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,549
Probably a fake number,
she gave you a phoney name.

411
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,990
Your affalr's offto a bad start.

412
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,794
Damn lt, I should have shut my trap!

413
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,516
We got a good plece out of lt.

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,392
Carole Ilked It a Iot.

415
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,398

417
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,079
You're In Iove?.

418
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,599
You hardly know her!

419

Get off my back, wlll you?.

420
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,359
All the women on your mind...

421
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,313
Should you marry them all?

422
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,193
Shlt, you're a paln wlth your songs!

426
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,678
Your voice is strange.

427
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,632
You think so?

428
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,355
The Baron is here.

00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,834

- I can call you?
- No, I'm Iooklng for Llsa.

433
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,916
Don't turn the light on,

434
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,951
wait for me to come to you.

435
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,037
Don't talk, don't do anything.

436
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,992
I decide.

437
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,753
You know Llsa?.

438
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,312
Relax.

Answer! Do you know Llsa?.

440
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,399
I don't know her.

441
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,476
Are you crazy, stop that!

442

You're Ilke a cop.

You dldn't unscrew the bulbs?.

445
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,558

447
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,158
I don't know her.

448
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,037
You sald the same words!

449
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,357
You're hurtlng me!
They're not her property.

450
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,117
I don't belleve you, you're Iylng!

457
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,349
I think we're already making love.

458
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,552
Your voice is...

459
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,114

460
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,875

461
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,669
Wet?

462
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,071
Good evening, it's Carole.

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,076
We haven't seen each other for ages.

464

00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,517
He's put on welght.

469
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,074
He's stopped all drugs
and spends hls tlme playlng Bach.

No, he was murdered.
Everyone knows that.

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,912
Not by the CIA,
by the BIack Musllms.

474
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,996
Mr Wllllam has proof.

475
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,155
He even has a phantom record
by Buddy Bolden.

00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,078
I don't know who that ls.

I won't Iet you go now.

486
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,756
Get up, Bruno,
Mr Wllllam wants to see you.

487
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,355
What's golng on?.

488
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,068
You mustn't keep
Mr Wllllam waltlng.

489
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,995
He was a model employee,
Mr William

490
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,436
Full of enthusiasm, Mr William

491
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,594
He reached forty
without being naughty

492
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,400
Without the slightest mishap

493
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,713
But one August evening,

494
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,193
the weather was so nice and balmy

495
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,115
That Mr William
went for a nice long stroll

496
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,510
Mr William you lost your manners

497
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,593
Why go down 13th A venue?

498
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,751
He met a young woman, Mr William

499
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,193
He bought her a bunch of violets,
Mr William

500
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,712
He took her to hotel of ill repute

501
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,711
But a Black
wanted to take the woman

502
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,668
Mr William, in a fury,

503
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,239
hit him with his brolly.

504
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,988
But the man in the dark
slashed his neck twice

505
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,278
Mr William, you lost your manners

506
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,599
Why go down 13th A venue?

507
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,837
You wanted to see me?.

508
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,592
I'm Iooklng for Llsa.

509
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,152
You know Llsa?.

510
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,955
Come closer.

511
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,948
Our frlend really Ilkes you,
you know?.

512
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,790
Can you help me flnd Llsa?.

513
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,430
Glve me a good reason to help you.

514
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,229
You want money?.

515
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,237
Bruno, are you mad?.

516
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,398
The BIack Swan.

517
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,599
There may be
an answer for you there.

518
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,388
BIack Swan?.

519
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,669
Yes, Ilke the blrd,
The BIack Swan...

520
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,839
Ask for Marco.

521
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,596
"The twlllght Is grand."

522
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,515
How many are you?.

523
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,956
I'm alone. At Ieast...

524
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,708
I thlnk so.

525
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,277
The club's reserved for couples.
You have to be two.

526
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,152
I'm Iooklng for Marco.

527
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,795
Marco?.

528
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,393
Yes, Mr Wllllam sent me.

529
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,676
I don't know any Marco or Wllllam.

530
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,076
"The twlllght Is grand."

531
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,793
I'II deal wlth hlm.

532
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,355
- You're dlsturblng the patrons.
- I don't care.

533
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,551
I don't want to see you around here!

534
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,272
You'd better get Iost!

535
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,432
You're slck!

536

Go on, scarper!

537
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,633
What's your problem?.

538
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,637
You want to get beaten up?.

539
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,395
Want some more?.

540
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,239
Son of a bltch!

541
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,237
I'm Carole, a frlend of Bruno's.

542
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,668
I know who you are,

543
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,433
I got the messages.

544
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,791
He can't see you now,
he needs to be alone.

545
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,638
He's In creatlve mode.

546
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,673
I must see hlm for work,
It's lmportant.

547
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,872
- Let me ln, please.
- Don't lnslst, Mlss Stevens.

548
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,674
He can't see anyone now.

549
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,669
Tell hlm I dropped by.
I expect to hear from hlm soon.

550
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,472
Of course, you can rely on me.

551
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,877
Bruno, that won't do.

552
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,355
I Iook awful!

553
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,034
Lisa calling...

554
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,397
- Good evenlng, Bruno.
- The Shark?

555
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,069
- You've been dolng thls Iong?.
- What?.

556
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,468
The chatllne, the recordlngs,
the tapes...

557
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,318
I've always done lt.

558
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,832
Impresslve, lsn't lt?.

559
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,229
Llsten to that.

560
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,833
Lisa calling.

561
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,678
No games, tell me
what you know about Llsa.

562
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,270
We must talk about you Bruno.
We're here to help you.

563
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,989
I don't glve a damn about your help!
Where's Llsa?.

564
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,677
Calm down, Bruno. Don't be afrald.

565
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,871
We know nothlng about Llsa.

566
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,315
Why send me to The BIack Swan?.

567
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,510
We thought It would allow you
to understand.

568
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,469
Nothlng happened
at The BIack Swan?.

569
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,715
You Iove Llsa?.

570
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,114
You should have known
she wouldn't be there.

571
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,309
There's nothlng there
apart from what you brlng yourself.

572
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,990
The BIack Swan lsn't Hell,

573
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,874
and you're not Orpheus
seeklng Eurydlce.

574
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,436
Besldes, you can't enter alone,
can you?.

575
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,795
We thought
It would help you understand.

576
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,598
You know what I thlnk?.

577
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,678
The guy hlt so hard
I haven't yet come round.

578
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,953
Lisa calling...

579
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,958
A handsome guy for Lisa?

580
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,757
Lisa calling.

581
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,039
Lisa for a big tomcat.

582
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,311
Evening, it's Sacha.

583
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,317
Yann, can you hear me?
It's Lisa, call me.

584
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,351
Sacha seeks a boy.

585
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,918
A wolf for Lisa.

586
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,671
It's tlme to go.

587
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,712
I have a few vlnyls
that could be useful.

588
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,079
I should have called,
we should have rehearsed.

589
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,919
Shut up,
Carole thlnks we've rehearsed.

590
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,716
You've put us In a jam.

591
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,311
What happened to your head?.

592
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,035
It's psychosomatlc,
It must be the stress.

593
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,470
It better be good.
We're supposed to be ready.

594
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,398
I've brought help.

595
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,877
Now everyone's here,
we can get down to work.

596
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,836
Bruno can't Ilve wlthout you.

597
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,109
He's always dreamt
of belng at a recordlng sesslon.

598
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,870
It's good to fulfll one's dreams.

599
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,232
I'd Ilke to say...

600
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,032
If I gave no slgn of Ilfe,
It wasn't because...

601
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,269
Because we fucked
doesn't mean you have to explaln.

602
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,756
AII I care about Is that you record
thls damned album.

603
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,757
The rest doesn't concern me.

604
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,032
I fuck wlth whom I Ilke when I Ilke!

605
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,033
The samples are great,
but there are too many of them.

606
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,235
Afrald the rlghts
wlll cost too much?.

607
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,635
No, of It belng "over-sampled".

608
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,478
I thought you Ilked thls plece.

609
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,353
Yes, but It's become too Ilkeable.

610
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,669
Isn't that what you wanted?.

611
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,714
If It's to Iayer cool sounds, flne.
But It doesn't tell a story.

612
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,911
How do you know
It doesn't tell a story?.

613
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,190
It doesn't work wlth me.

614
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,836
You're supposed to make muslc.

615
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,873
For your personal messages,
there are other means.

616
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,918
Can we get back to work?.

617
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,190
Calm down. We'II move on
and come back to thls Iater.

618
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,029
Good ldea. We're Iate
and studlo rental Is expenslve.

619
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,593
You only care about money!

620
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,351
I care about that too. And
lmposlng your muslc wasn't easy.

621
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,357
Maybe It can't be lmposed!

622
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,312
Would you Ilke a coffee?.

623
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,436
What?.

624
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,437
That was stupld and unfalr.

625
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,279
It's a blt Ilke when Charles Mlngus

626
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,438
had a falllng out wlth Atlantlc.

627
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,153
Mr Wllllam had sald...

628
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,590
That was Mlngus.
He probably had good reasons.

629
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,597
Glve me a fucklng break!

630
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,434
Bruno must have hls reasons.

631
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,756
Slnce I've known hlm,
I feel much better.

632
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,156
I sometlmes felt
I was wastlng my tlme

633
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,828
collectlng all these vlnyls

634
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,519
and not knowlng
what to do wlth them.

635
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,314
Now, I thlnk...

636
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,876
I prefer to spend my tlme
dreamlng wlth muslc

637
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,469
rather than suffer at composlng lt.

638
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,430
Carole, It's Bruno.

639
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,030
I wanted...

640
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,950
to apologlse for earller.

641
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,993
I wasn't very... I was uptlght.

642
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,558
I also wanted to say...

643
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,592

707
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,237
It was because of that.

708
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,273
When you're attracted to eyes,
to a volce,

709

It's always somethlng

Have you thought It over?.

Then we can contlnue.
