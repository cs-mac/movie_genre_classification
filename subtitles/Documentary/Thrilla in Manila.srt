25
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:09,716
- My tooth hurts.
- Show me.

No.

00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,903
Here.

Boss!
How many do you need today?

81
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,002
So your car's suspension

00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:53,313
All right.

83
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,400
Can you do heavy lifting?

84
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,675
I am a farmer,
I'm quite strong.

85
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:00,596
Bring along three more.
Those strong types.

00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,426
- Wait here, I'll be right back.
- All right.

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,402
We have nothing to eat.

172
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,450
You worked before in a bar?

173
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:51,962
Then listen well,
I don't like repeating myself.

174
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,380
If you're not dancing on stage

175
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,589
you sit in the aquarium
until the customer picks your number

176
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,797
Your job description here,

177
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:05,216
entertain the customer,
so he orders drinks as many times.

178
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,971
Tell your Mamasan
your order is vodka,

179
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:15,593
but give you water instead.

180
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,801
<i>Make your customer happy.</i>

181
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,437
Sit on his lap,

182
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:23,617
kiss him,
you touch his balls.

183
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:28,777
Just make sure he keeps on ordering
and keeps on coming back.

184
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:31,778
Because the minimum quota here
is 20 drinks per night.

185
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:38,036
Hurry up.

186
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,244
This is the dressing room.

187
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:42,556
You change clothes and
do your makeup here.

188
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:44,742
Like that, all right?

189
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,111
- How many children you have?
- I have two.

190
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,432
You can leave them here
if you have no nanny.

191
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:52,042
But I don't like brats,
this is no playground.

192
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:53,743
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Okay.

193
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,069
Let's continue.
All the girls here are clean.

194
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,683
So you'll have
to consult with this doctor.

195
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:05,141
<font color="#ffffbb">Charlie:</font>
Go to this man.

196
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,435
<font color="#ffffbb">Charlie:</font>
<i>Dr. Catacutan.</i>

197
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,015
Show him my signature.

198
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,139
Sooner the better, OK?

199
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:19,236
After you get the result,
come back to me, I'll give you a costume.

200
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,737
And by the way...

201
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,050
Remember, all of it will be
deducted from your first pay.

202
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,877
Show us your arm.

203
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,431
Spears.
Ninth Division.

204
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:44,917
- Of what year?
- 1989.

205
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,100
Were you really at the service,
or just like them,

206
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:53,785
those idiots getting tattooed,
thinking I wouldn't know.

207
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:57,183
I spent four years
in the infantry.

208
00:27:58,063 --> 00:27:58,935
And then?

209
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:03,354
Then I worked
in a clothing factory,

210
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:08,228
which closed down. So my family
went up to the Banaue province.

211
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:10,810
You're a farmer?

212
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,536
- Yes, sir.
- <font color="#ffffbb">(men laugh)</font>

213
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,362
Just like in a comedy, eh?

214
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,298
So what's your name, farmer?

215
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,578
Oscar Ramirez, sir.

216
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:26,169
You got a license?

217
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,739
Well, what the hell.
You can buy a fake one.

218
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,921
Actually I have no license at all.

219
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:35,630
I like this guy...

220
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,444
Oca, I like you because
you're not a liar.

221
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:43,178
Okay, I'll tell you
what your job is.

222
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,989
You'll be driving for the
Manila Armored Courier.

223
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:49,204
We'll be transporting money
and other valuables.

224
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:53,618
In armored trucks
with automatic weapons.

225
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,519
For only 500 pesos per day.

226
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:59,468
Quite small for such a risky job.

227
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,490
So?
Are you still interested?

228
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,020
That's a handsome
amount for my family.

229
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,762
This is just
the preliminary inquiry.

230
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:13,398
Helps us to discard
suspicious candidates.

231
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:15,404
Real interview is tomorrow,

232
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:17,440
at the main office
with our Captain.

233
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:23,579
How I can trust a former farmer
who only served once.

234
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:30,027
Why would you commit yourself to one
of the riskiest jobs in Metro Manila?

235
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,377
- Well, my daughter's tooth is aching.
- <font color="#ffffbb">(men laugh)</font>

236
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:38,811
Okay, okay...
<font color="#ffffbb">(laughs)</font>

237
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:41,833
I like you.
Here.

238
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:46,290
Fill this out,
and...

239
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,978
...come back tomorrow.

240
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:49,734
- Okay?
- Tomorrow, sir?

241
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:51,991
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

242
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:39,108
I got a job where I can earn some.

243
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:41,552
Where?

244
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:43,241
In a bar.

245
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,930
What sort of bar?

246
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:52,710
A bar, where the girls dance.

247
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,680
We don't have money.

248
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,627
We have no food.

249
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,406
We have nothing.

250
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:07,802
I'm sorry, Mai.

251
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:13,276
It's not your fault.

252
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,059
You know, sometimes...

253
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,886
we need to do desperate things
to survive.

254
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,861
We just need to have faith in God.

255
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:30,235
And I believe He
will not abandon us.

256
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,306
Someday...

257
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,636
I know we'll get
out of this situation.

258
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,751
How do I look?

259
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:19,337
My husband is handsome.
<font color="#ffffbb">(giggles)</font>

260
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:40,555
<font color="#ffffbb">(indistinct dialogue)</font>

261
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:53,471
You're late.

262
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:57,259
In this work, do you know what
it means to be on time?

263
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,927
You should arrive 15 minutes early.

264
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:00,862
I'm sorry, sir.

265
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:02,981
No need to apologize.

266
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,243
What are you wearing, Oca?
You look like a tramp.

267
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:10,977
- Maybe it was not a good idea.
- Indeed it is.

268
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:12,799
Come.
Follow me.

269
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,874
Wash your face there.

270
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:28,260
Farmer,

271
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:31,448
you give me good vibes.
Don't make me regret it.

272
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:34,906
What the heck are you doing?
That's a mouthwash!

273
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:41,236
Here, take this.
Wash it afterwards, and return it to me.

274
00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:44,286
Hold that thought.
After your work,

275
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:45,982
just buy me a new one instead.

276
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:48,002
- Okay?
- Thank you, sir.

277
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,329
All right.
Go on and lie down.

278
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,841
Raise your legs.

279
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,886
Right.

280
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,511
Spread them a little.

281
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,348
Do you know
you're pregnant?

282
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:31,059
I'd say about 5 or 6 weeks.

283
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:52,538
My daughter has a toothache,
Can you take a look?

284
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:54,867
I'm not a dentist.

285
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:03,502
There are two types of employees
in this company, Oca.

286
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,340
The inside personnel
and the drivers.

287
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,970
They can not communicate.

288
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:12,467
Because the drivers are not permitted
inside the Processing Center.

289
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:17,015
Even if you are hired,
you will not be allowed inside again.

290
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,768
Unless, of course,
you are robbed.

291
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,558
And you're summoned for debriefing.

292
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:23,892
Eyes straight!

293
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:29,323
Thank you very much
for this opportunity.

294
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:30,908
Right.
Do your best.

295
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:34,573
Officer Alvares,
your next.

296
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:37,874
Enter.

297
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:46,547
Fucking ex-cops.

298
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:50,041
They apply here and think
they're better than us.

299
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:52,961
I know because I was
a former policeman myself.

300
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:56,510
Oca, heed my advices.

301
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,433
The name of the big boss is Buddha.

302
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:01,931
But we call him
the Laughing Buddha.

303
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:05,347
Because he likes jokes.

304
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:09,189
Always asking newcomers
for some comedy.

305
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:12,298
Comedy?

306
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,362
Yes. He wants to know
if you got some personality.

307
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,778
If you are quick-witted.

308
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,241
But, I don't know any jokes.

309
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:21,408
Don't you know
about the three women

310
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,991
who applied for a job in a bar?

311
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,417
Check this, Oscar...

312
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,668
You're not qualified.

313
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:35,832
You were just recommended
by Ong.

314
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:37,495
But according to him...

315
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:40,800
You're just a farmer.

316
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:43,924
In Banaue.

317
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,933
You don't even have any
experience as a guard.

318
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:53,890
Neither as a law enforcer.

319
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:56,315
None, sir.

320
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,442
Well, you'll do.

321
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:06,145
After all, you have no idea yet
of their bad ways.

322
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,068
We'll be the ones
teaching it to you.

323
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:15,955
My way.

324
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:19,669
Oscar...

325
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,954
Tell me a joke.

326
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:24,752
A joke, sir?

327
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,007
So I'll be happy.

328
00:37:31,346 --> 00:37:34,097
There were three
women applicants in a bar.

329
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:38,725
While facing the manager,
he asks:

330
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:42,554
"If you find yourselves P500
on the floor of the bar..."

331
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:45,016
"What would you do with them?"

332
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,977
The first woman says:

333
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,980
"Well, I'll pick it up."

334
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:55,613
"Return it to the cashier."

335
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,319
The second woman says:

336
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,829
"I'll ask if someone
has lost some money."

337
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:06,533
"And if none,
give it to the cashier."

338
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:09,659
And the third one...

339
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:11,910
She says:

340
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,964
"I would step on it."

341
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,378
"If nobody is looking,"

342
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:22,761
"pocket the money."

343
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,134
So who got hired?

344
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:33,398
Well, the one with the biggest
boobs.

345
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:41,072
<font color="#ffffbb">(bursts into laughter)</font>

346
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,694
<font color="#ffffbb">"You're sexy!"
"I used Lesofat!"</font>

347
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,585
Pa!

348
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,621
- Pa, look!
- Where did you get that?

349
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,382
The doctor gave it.

350
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:09,378
He cured my tooth and gave me
free lollipops. Here, Pa!

351
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:13,423
- How did you get an appointment with the doctor?
- The Baranggay Health Center.

352
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,433
You, how was your interview?

353
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:20,640
Wow, a new polo shirt.
Where did you get it? Nice.

354
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,351
From a friend.

355
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,102
Well, a new friend.

356
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:26,187
My new boss!

357
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:29,818
Boss? What do you mean?
You got hired?

358
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:32,699
Wow, my husband is good!

359
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,913
A pair of boots.

360
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,122
A uniform.

361
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,830
A Kevlar helmet.

362
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:49,661
Sign here.

363
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:08,473
How elegant, farmer.

364
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,937
Sir, thank you very much again.

365
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,770
For everything.

366
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,060
If you want to thank me.

367
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:20,823
Do your job good.
And follow all my commands.

368
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:24,529
I'll do whatever it takes.
For you, sir.

369
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:26,955
Good.

370
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:30,368
For one month you'll accompany
me as the driver.

371
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,540
I train everyone.

372
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,587
So start keeping your eyes
and ears open.

373
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:39,549
Are you ready?

374
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:41,668
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

375
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:43,755
Let's go!

376
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:55,390
This is a ceramic vest.

377
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,059
It can block even an M-16.

378
00:40:58,815 --> 00:40:59,858
M-16?

379
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:01,066
Brother!

380
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:05,143
They won't scare us with toy guns.

381
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,190
It is the real deal!

382
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:08,948
Understood?
Come on.

383
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:22,864
He's the gate guardian.

384
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:26,370
Every morning he makes sure
the boxes are empty of money.

385
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,590
At sunset he checks them again
after our return.

386
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,031
Do we deliver the boxes?

387
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:09,083
Yes.
We deliver it to our clients.

388
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,621
How does the system works?

389
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,828
We never know how much is in there.

390
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:17,668
Every client have their keys
similar to the banks.

391
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:21,917
Our company keeps duplicates
of such keys.

392
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:26,264
Which are kept in the
Processing Center.

393
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:31,513
If those boxes are missing,
or say, stolen...

394
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:35,559
All keys are confiscated,

395
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:38,857
and would only be returned
until the boxes are recovered.

396
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:41,060
Or when the boxes are destroyed.

397
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:47,366
We drivers can never hold any key.

398
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:53,493
You can only enter the
Processing Center...

399
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:56,196
if Buddha accepts you for a job.

400
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:59,749
Or if...
You are summoned for a debriefing.

401
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:05,214
That's what the interview is called,
when you're robbed or stopped by holdup.

402
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:06,834
Debriefing.

403
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:14,470
In our company,
we have about two such cases.

404
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:18,706
Then there are not many robberies, eh?
<font color="#ffffbb">(chuckles)</font>

405
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,597
Of course there are many.

406
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:26,347
There are many, Oca.
Especially during elections.

407
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,947
- Why during the elections?
- <font color="#ffffbb">(laughter)</font>

408
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:41,537
No politician could win
without expending.

409
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:46,164
You can only win
by spending so much money.

410
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:50,997
Those politicians have no cousins
who can always win the lotto.

411
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,913
You for example.

412
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,712
Do you have any cousin
who already won the lotto?

413
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,299
Do you know anyone who
won the lotto?

414
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,259
Eh?

415
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,884
You might likely see more aliens
than winning the lottery.

416
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:10,511
But we never care. Fine.
We just keep on falling in line.

417
00:44:11,522 --> 00:44:14,095
We're betting everyday, every week.
Just betting.

418
00:44:18,028 --> 00:44:19,356
The truth is...

419
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:22,490
Everyone has a chance to win.
That's right.

420
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:27,737
All of us have the chance of winning.
Just that.

421
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:31,156
Just chance.
But actually winning, impossible.

422
00:44:57,854 --> 00:45:00,937
If the box is opened
without the key,

423
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:03,983
activates a mechanism,
a built-in fail-safe

424
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:06,434
that destroys the contents.

425
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:08,904
It blows ink.

426
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:14,484
Ever been robbed?

427
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,803
My late partner, Biboy...

428
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:56,903
We had two boxes...

429
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:01,700
They had tried to open one
without the key.

430
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:16,374
Then they wanted the key
for the other box.

431
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:24,250
When one commits injustice
without wearing a mask,

432
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:40,221
he will stick up to it to the end.

433
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:04,167
You know what happens...

434
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:07,829
when an armored car personnel
dies on duty?

435
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:15,091
The partner will become
the "courier."

436
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,925
That means...

437
00:47:17,598 --> 00:47:21,761
...you have to deliver the news and
take the personal effects to the widow.

438
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:24,678
For my case with Biboy...

439
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:31,440
I handed over... a Timex,
and the P15,000 life insurance.

440
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:36,274
And the truth he would never
see his children grow.

441
00:47:43,996 --> 00:47:45,656
That's why we train.

442
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:12,427
We do not wear hearing protection
to get used to the noise.

443
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:14,638
I have not fired since the service.

444
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:17,525
It's like riding a bike again.

445
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:20,808
I have not ridden a bike
for so long too.

446
00:48:23,154 --> 00:48:25,692
- So, how does it feel?
- Superb.

447
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,201
This is the only thing standing
between your life and mine.

448
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:34,122
So I would not become
a courier to your wife.

449
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,798
Come, let's have lunch.

450
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,985
Do not worry, it's just chicken.

451
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:26,541
You don't like it?

452
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:28,542
I'll just keep it for later.

453
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:31,712
Then it won't be as good later.

454
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:35,288
I'll buy one for you again.
Go on, eat it now.

455
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:50,436
You know, Oca.

456
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,814
Now that we're partners.
We have each other's backs.

457
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,817
Correct?

458
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:59,110
Whatever you need, boss.

459
00:50:01,113 --> 00:50:03,651
Then punch out my card
later at the office.

460
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:06,943
Well we might end up in trouble.

461
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,203
Should be okay.

462
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:11,074
No problem with it.
They never check.

463
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,212
Oca.

464
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:25,884
I just want to ask you a favor.

465
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:36,227
Tell me.

466
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:43,432
You know, Oca.
Besides wifey, I have another chick.

467
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:47,230
I know, you know,
it's not right, but...

468
00:50:48,988 --> 00:50:52,237
My missis will suspect me
if I come home late, right?

469
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,033
So I need to go to the other one
during my duty.

470
00:50:57,662 --> 00:50:59,405
You understand?

471
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:08,329
Another order here for Oca!
Oca the farmer!

472
00:51:17,762 --> 00:51:20,682
<font color="#ffffbb">[chattering]</font>

473
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:28,436
Are they crybabies?
Might wake up those sleeping.

474
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:54,240
Apprentices have time cards now?

475
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:56,545
Ong said to pick you up.

476
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:59,079
Let's have a drink.
Tuesday night. Boys' night.

477
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:00,875
I'm out of dough.

478
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:05,337
It's the bar of my family.
Don't worry.

479
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:07,795
Get changed.
Let's go together.

480
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:14,184
Did you fart in my car?

481
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:21,430
Just what do you have there?

482
00:52:22,234 --> 00:52:23,397
Chicken meal for later.

483
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,356
Well smells like chicken ass.

484
00:52:44,545 --> 00:52:46,520
Oi!
Here's the new one!

485
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,043
Welcome.

486
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:55,762
Even brought food?
Lots here. Is that chicken?

487
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:59,383
Get used to them.
We're all like brothers.

488
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,531
Tonight is boys' night!

489
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:03,653
Once a week we have this.

490
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:08,109
Nothing else to do but
be happy, and get satisfied!

491
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:10,979
Oscar, a farmer!

492
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:15,254
Get the bottle. Get the bottle.
Drink, drink!

493
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:16,702
- Drink!
- Drink.

494
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:17,656
No thanks.

495
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:18,796
- Bridget!
- Bridget.

496
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,665
Bring a couple of shot glasses
for my friends.

497
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:22,823
Very well.

498
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:25,163
Oh you.

499
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,957
Fragrant

500
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:29,490
Smells like melon.

501
00:53:30,895 --> 00:53:33,435
- Just took a bath, eh?
- Here it comes.

502
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:34,679
When you're in front of me...

503
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:39,222
Seems like I can't carry both
my wife and my mistress.

504
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:46,261
Hear this.

505
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:48,527
When I get older,
I'll become like Ong!

506
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,985
When I was young,
I'm like JJ!

507
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,490
- Go, go.
- This is for you.

508
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:59,288
- Come on!
- You can do it. It's for you.

509
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:02,319
- Tonight you are a drinker.
- All right!

510
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:06,106
Topers! Let's go, topers!
This is for us!

511
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:07,992
Oscar, it is for you.

512
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,552
- Do it.
- Shot, shot.

513
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:11,788
I've became a courier three times.

514
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:17,326
And Biboy was the most difficult.

515
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,845
May he rest in peace.

516
00:54:27,717 --> 00:54:29,238
- One more!
- One more.

517
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,214
One more!

518
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:33,113
While it's hot.
Who's gonna pour?

519
00:54:33,223 --> 00:54:35,297
- You do it.
- These guys are veterans.

520
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,741
- Look at Oscar.
- Tastes good, eh?

521
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:40,172
For our new recruit.

522
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:43,465
For Oca the farmer!

523
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,908
<i>...for good times and bad times.</i>

524
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:15,207
<i>We know we're busy.</i>

525
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:18,460
<i>I still have a lot to tell.</i>

526
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,770
<i>I thank my sponsors,
thank you Petit Monde, Sketchers...</i>

527
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:57,041
<i>and...</i>

528
00:58:08,948 --> 00:58:12,815
Rub your throat.
You'll feel better afterwards.

529
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:23,827
You've had enough today.

530
00:58:24,712 --> 00:58:25,826
I'm fine, sir.

531
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:28,090
All right.

532
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,595
<font color="#ffffbb">Genuine strength</font>

533
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:29,558
What?
Hangover?

534
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:31,514
No, sir.

535
00:59:32,311 --> 00:59:34,469
No need to call me "sir."

536
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:17,850
Wait! Wait!

537
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:19,352
<i>Hold!</i>

538
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,701
Okay, okay, okay.

539
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:41,571
<i>Go on, go on, go on.</i>

540
01:01:00,387 --> 01:01:03,222
Our truck is wide,
be careful when turning.

541
01:01:06,757 --> 01:01:08,352
That's it.
Well done.

542
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:10,020
Thank you, sir.

543
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:15,567
Nothing else to do but go to Manila
and buy your license.

544
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:26,722
A black Honda is following us.

545
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,792
Go around the whole block, Oca.

546
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:17,660
They disappeared.

547
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:24,322
They must've realized
that we have detected them.

548
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:29,087
We wouldn't be going around in circles
the whole block for no reason, right?

549
01:02:29,296 --> 01:02:30,213
Was that for real?

550
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:35,635
Possibly.
Or some crazy kids testing us.

551
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:59,268
My missis at home cooked food
for our friends. But they couldn't go.

552
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:02,489
Why not come with your wife.
Dine with us.

553
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,867
Missis dislikes the food
getting spoiled.

554
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,485
But my wife has work today.

555
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,073
Then you should come.

556
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,749
She'd be sad if you wouldn't go.

557
01:03:15,878 --> 01:03:17,123
Okay, sir.

558
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:25,470
Oscar? Sure you don't want to call your wife?
Come on, summon her here.

559
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,634
She's working, honey.

560
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,762
Well at least take some food.

561
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,303
That's very kind, ma'am.

562
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,759
Don't call me ma'am!

563
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,231
Dora. You call me Dora.
<font color="#ffffbb">(laughs)</font>

564
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,029
- Oscar?
- No, thank you.

565
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:44,230
Fancy that.
Only soft drinks for Oca.

566
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,737
- Sure.
- Well, leave that here.

567
01:03:46,946 --> 01:03:53,306
Accompany me outside. Let's smoke at the
balcony for Dora hates it inside. <font color="#ffffbb">(chuckles)</font>

568
01:04:01,876 --> 01:04:02,990
Beautiful, eh?

569
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:06,024
All Metro Manila.

570
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,423
I go here when I'm pondering.

571
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,880
You have an enviable life.

572
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:19,650
Accommodated.

573
01:04:20,725 --> 01:04:22,219
I have to ask you something...

574
01:04:24,645 --> 01:04:25,977
Where do you live actually?

575
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:29,769
In Tondo.

576
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:38,313
If the company finds out,
you're fired.

577
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,408
You work as a service courier
for an armored company.

578
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:50,540
But you're living in a place...

579
01:04:53,253 --> 01:04:56,207
with people involved in crimes.

580
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:04,459
Ever thought they might
abduct your family?

581
01:05:07,015 --> 01:05:08,806
Then blackmail you.

582
01:05:12,395 --> 01:05:14,885
Force you to rob the company.

583
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:27,761
I could be collateral damage
because of you, Oca.

584
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,045
You know?

585
01:05:39,793 --> 01:05:42,053
Ever heard the story
of Alfred Santos?

586
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:47,000
A good man.

587
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,538
Alfred was good.

588
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:51,521
Trustworthy.

589
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,754
He worked at a small company,

590
01:05:57,862 --> 01:05:59,424
<i>owned by his father.</i>

591
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,792
Their business prospered.
Many were envious.

592
01:06:04,932 --> 01:06:08,187
Especially the competing company.

593
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:13,803
The employees were threatened.

594
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:17,878
Thus Alfred had
to close the factory.

595
01:06:21,495 --> 01:06:25,830
Everyday, Alfred crossed paths
with his father's killer.

596
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:31,082
By coercion, the business went down.

597
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:33,801
It went bankrupt.

598
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,680
Alfred...

599
01:06:39,102 --> 01:06:40,532
What happened to Alfred?

600
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:50,281
What happens to a desperate man
in a desperate situation?

601
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,364
Surely ends up with
a desperate decision.

602
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,421
That could cost him his life.

603
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:05,704
For some reason I feel...

604
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:11,479
I'm also responsible
for Alfred's death.

605
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:14,980
Why?

606
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,249
<i>I worked in that factory.</i>

607
01:07:20,588 --> 01:07:24,830
<i>But I went home in my province.
In Banaue.</i>

608
01:07:25,884 --> 01:07:27,123
Instead of...

609
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:29,340
...defending his family.

610
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:31,777
Fear got to me first.

611
01:07:32,364 --> 01:07:34,341
Defend their family?

612
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,848
Then die too like them?

613
01:07:44,692 --> 01:07:46,234
Honey, it's late...

614
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,270
Oscar, for your wife.

615
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:51,269
Thank you, Dora.

616
01:07:52,323 --> 01:07:55,158
- I'm taking Oscar home.
- Very well. Be careful.

617
01:07:55,824 --> 01:07:56,640
Let's go.

618
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:09,306
That's my corner...

619
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,708
I have something
to show to you first, Oca.

620
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:43,205
This is what I have told you.

621
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,633
The place for my other woman.

622
01:08:47,037 --> 01:08:49,342
Look, there's a room here.

623
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:51,626
A shower over there.

624
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:59,217
My lover doesn't like motels.
She thinks it makes her cheap.

625
01:08:59,297 --> 01:09:02,044
So I rent this weekly.
Cash!

626
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:04,045
If you want it,
you can have it.

627
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:08,971
- Are you kidding?
- No.

628
01:09:10,307 --> 01:09:11,717
- Really?
- Yes.

629
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:14,779
Well?

630
01:09:15,353 --> 01:09:17,204
- We will live here?
- Yes!

631
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,766
The girls will be like crazy!

632
01:09:25,236 --> 01:09:27,059
- Did you put this?
- Yeah, look at it.

633
01:09:27,113 --> 01:09:28,369
Well, we were here.

634
01:09:29,418 --> 01:09:30,232
We were.

635
01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:32,545
Splendid, eh?
Right?

636
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,825
I told you so.

637
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:37,738
Problem is I can't pay.

638
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:40,563
Just four days left
until your salary, right?

639
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:42,492
I have already paid for this week.

640
01:09:43,752 --> 01:09:47,631
As soon as I get paid,
you're the first person I'll look for.

641
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:50,706
I'll do everything for this.

642
01:09:50,716 --> 01:09:52,049
No problem.

643
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:54,176
We're partners, Oca.

644
01:09:54,178 --> 01:09:56,004
Partners help each other.

645
01:09:57,639 --> 01:09:59,621
Well, let's get your girls then.

646
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:00,554
Wait.

647
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,708
They're still grimed and all.

648
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:05,182
They should be clean and presentable
when they meet you, right?

649
01:10:05,604 --> 01:10:10,043
I understand.
Well one of these days then.

650
01:10:10,525 --> 01:10:11,961
Okay, let's go!

651
01:10:14,425 --> 01:10:15,427
Pa!

652
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:20,582
<font color="#ffff80">Mai:</font> What are you
doing here?

653
01:10:20,701 --> 01:10:21,892
I've come to fetch you.

654
01:10:28,582 --> 01:10:29,946
Where are we going?

655
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,852
Wow!
It's like the Peninsula Hotel!

656
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,749
- We will live here?
- Indeed.

657
01:10:38,888 --> 01:10:40,612
How is this possible?

658
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:42,461
My partner is kind.

659
01:10:46,014 --> 01:10:47,424
Look here.

660
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,761
We have running water.

661
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:54,121
Stop that.

662
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:59,071
Well, Oca the farmer,
how was your sleep?

663
01:11:59,994 --> 01:12:02,615
Thank you very much all over again.

664
01:12:03,288 --> 01:12:06,372
You've already thanked
me a dozen times.

665
01:12:08,793 --> 01:12:10,702
I'll be able to return
the favor, sir.

666
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,161
Sounds good?

667
01:12:29,603 --> 01:12:32,140
This is what enlivens me.

668
01:12:33,606 --> 01:12:40,356
Without such music, I'm like a corpse
inside this coffin-like vehicle.

669
01:12:41,821 --> 01:12:47,026
This music. This...
cleanses the soul

670
01:12:58,961 --> 01:13:01,286
Our next destination
is not a company.

671
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:02,785
Just a sleazebag.

672
01:13:03,548 --> 01:13:06,632
That pathetic wart
thinks he's an...

673
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:09,424
American rapper!

674
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:12,298
What does he do?

675
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:17,058
The company do not care.
But I do know he's quite a tipper.

676
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,560
Goddammit, you boys
are early this morning.

677
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,233
Good morning, sir.

678
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,809
"Good morning, sir."
It's English.

679
01:13:27,527 --> 01:13:28,570
Good day, sir.

680
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:30,773
Look at this Mary Poppins.

681
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:33,277
Oh my God, is that the cops?

682
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:36,530
Baby, I own the cops.
This is Pino's town.

683
01:13:48,962 --> 01:13:50,041
Yo, hand me that gelt.

684
01:14:00,472 --> 01:14:02,014
Mary, hand me the gelt.

685
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:40,881
What?
Thinking what I'm thinking?

686
01:14:41,424 --> 01:14:42,704
What do you mean?

687
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:48,423
Oca, don't give me that
honest employee crap.

688
01:14:48,722 --> 01:14:52,849
Surely you've thought we could
blast those two bodyguards.

689
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:56,389
And their ambitious boss.

690
01:14:56,979 --> 01:15:00,679
Take their money...
and nobody would care.

691
01:15:02,108 --> 01:15:03,900
I don't want to plunder
other people.

692
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,067
Whatever you say, Oca.

693
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:10,239
We'll see.

694
01:15:11,283 --> 01:15:13,774
After all I've done for you,
let's just speculate.

695
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:19,029
You know they have lots of cash
in that house.

696
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,960
Maybe under the floors.
Perhaps dollars there.

697
01:15:24,044 --> 01:15:27,210
Along with drugs or drug money.

698
01:15:29,173 --> 01:15:30,216
What if...?

699
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,753
If I wanted to go back there
and get the money?

700
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:36,459
Would you accompany me?

701
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:39,847
So we're the robbers then.

702
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:43,848
We're not robbers, Oca.

703
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:45,977
They're the criminals.

704
01:15:48,773 --> 01:15:52,438
They're the reason why there's so many
wrong here in Metro Manila.

705
01:15:54,737 --> 01:15:57,690
We're the good guys.
You, me.

706
01:15:58,073 --> 01:16:01,738
And my ex-partner,
who they killed like a dog.

707
01:16:03,661 --> 01:16:05,120
If we do such a thing,

708
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:09,161
then we're no better than
those who killed your partner.

709
01:16:34,604 --> 01:16:38,640
- Hey, where are you taking the cat?
- It's a poor kitten.

710
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,611
Hey, that's ours.
What a meddler.

711
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,876
Stay here.
I have to pee.

712
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,414
Ong!
Come in!

713
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:08,638
Ong!
Drop them!

714
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:10,812
Buddy, who's that?
Who's that?

715
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,681
- Oca!
- Fuck! Drop them! Drop!

716
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:14,940
- Make him stop!
- Oca!

717
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,693
Oca, calm down. We're okay. There's no
problem. Lower your gun. Lower it!

718
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,191
Who's that, chum?
Who's that?

719
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,438
- I told you to stay in the truck!
- This is not in our plan!

720
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:25,364
- This is outrageous.
- Lower your weapons...

721
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:26,826
Lower them!

722
01:18:32,914 --> 01:18:35,405
There's no problem,
he's with me.

723
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,867
Business as usual.

724
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:42,877
Nothing changes.
Just the same plan we discussed.

725
01:18:47,885 --> 01:18:49,427
What the hell is this, boss?

726
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:53,428
What's going on?
Who are they?

727
01:18:53,682 --> 01:18:55,259
Oscar, listen to me.

728
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:58,050
You have to understand
everything I say.

729
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:00,974
Our future and the future
of our families

730
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:03,644
depend on what happens
in the coming hours.

731
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:12,219
When Biboy and I were ambushed
by those motherfuckers,

732
01:19:12,823 --> 01:19:15,555
they almost took
the two money boxes.

733
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:20,234
I saw my chance,
perhaps the only one I've ever had.

734
01:19:20,663 --> 01:19:24,447
So I reported to the office,
that they got away with one box.

735
01:19:27,836 --> 01:19:32,965
What if your hopes and dreams
are trapped inside that box,

736
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:39,429
at your very feet, but unable
to open it without the key?

737
01:19:41,264 --> 01:19:43,704
We're going to get the key
and you're helping me.

738
01:19:44,142 --> 01:19:45,184
What?

739
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:48,812
Jeez.

740
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:55,234
Don't avert. You have no voice.
Not even the tiniest.

741
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:59,487
You think I don't know you?
Discerning people is my job.

742
01:19:59,697 --> 01:20:02,781
Do you know you're already on my list?
Even before the interview?

743
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:08,568
Even before your name was put on top
of the papers, we've already spied on you.

744
01:20:08,778 --> 01:20:11,123
We have ways.
Therefore I know who you are.

745
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:14,742
I know where you're from.
I know your character, your situation.

746
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,648
And I know your wife.

747
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:21,132
Fuck, what sort of a man allows
his wife into prostitution?

748
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:27,535
Go ahead.

749
01:20:28,096 --> 01:20:29,013
Go ahead.

750
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:31,457
Don't fuck with me, Oscar.
Think.

751
01:20:31,516 --> 01:20:34,386
If you don't want to go to jail
with your family.

752
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:38,127
I have done nothing wrong.

753
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:40,814
Really?
You've done nothing evil?

754
01:20:41,983 --> 01:20:43,584
That apartment you're living in.

755
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,687
I paid it for one week.

756
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,443
I rented it while you were punching me
out at the office, so it was clear...

757
01:20:52,993 --> 01:20:56,572
on the record I was working
during that day. But you...

758
01:20:56,746 --> 01:20:59,774
You know I paid for it
for the whole week.

759
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,201
Do you know what name I put?

760
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:07,320
Fucking Oscar Ramirez.
The money box is inside that house.

761
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,336
Cops will find it there.

762
01:21:10,883 --> 01:21:17,392
They'd think you only joined us
to have access to the key.

763
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:22,385
That's what they would deduce.
I know how they think.

764
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:25,420
- For I was a cop!
- Son of a bitch!

765
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:43,802
You got no other options but to get
the key. You have no way out.

766
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:48,412
You can only get the key when you
enter the Processing Center.

767
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:52,786
You can only enter it
during a debriefing.

768
01:21:53,795 --> 01:21:56,475
Debriefing is done
only after a holdup.

769
01:21:56,797 --> 01:21:58,501
Then listen to me.

770
01:21:59,466 --> 01:22:01,937
Today we are
going to get robbed, Oca.

771
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:05,899
Those three bastards in the alley
will be doing it.

772
01:22:07,765 --> 01:22:08,879
Do you understand?

773
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:13,349
So calm your mind.

774
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:17,397
Put everything I said
into your head.

775
01:22:19,942 --> 01:22:21,177
Now go back to the truck.

776
01:22:56,557 --> 01:22:57,698
<i>Are we good?</i>

777
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:02,371
What you have to do right now
is concentrate,

778
01:23:02,373 --> 01:23:03,649
because this is it.

779
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:09,385
After the robbery...

780
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,515
<i>we will be allowed inside
the Processing Center.</i>

781
01:23:12,871 --> 01:23:16,126
I will be summoned first
since I am the senior.

782
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,680
I'm guaranteeing you, Oca...

783
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:25,026
It will take 15 minutes for me
to tell the whole story.

784
01:23:25,618 --> 01:23:28,630
Therefore you have 15 minutes
as well.

785
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:32,286
<i>Ascend the stairs
in the first floor.</i>

786
01:23:32,671 --> 01:23:35,826
<i>Proceed until the first left door.</i>

787
01:23:35,966 --> 01:23:37,381
<i>It is not locked.</i>

788
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:39,983
Just in front,
is the case for the keys.

789
01:23:39,985 --> 01:23:41,417
<i>That's the locked one.</i>

790
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:43,835
<i>There are six screws.</i>

791
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:45,379
<i>Unscrew them.</i>

792
01:23:46,266 --> 01:23:48,418
Then imprint the key to the mold.

793
01:23:49,644 --> 01:23:53,060
When you're done,
put back the screws properly.

794
01:23:53,093 --> 01:23:55,293
And backtrack.

795
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:59,033
You should be in front
of Buddha's office...

796
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:02,415
before I finish my interview.

797
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:09,536
Crystal?

798
01:24:10,954 --> 01:24:12,450
Let's switch places.
You drive.

799
01:24:35,892 --> 01:24:38,086
We have no money for that.

800
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,605
Pull over, Oca.

801
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:09,039
Do you really know these hoodlums?

802
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:11,108
Don't worry.

803
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:13,711
I just give them the box
and nobody gets hurt.

804
01:25:36,486 --> 01:25:38,135
Okay, you have a great entrance.

805
01:25:38,154 --> 01:25:42,109
I'm a believer. Now take
this case. I don't have all day.

806
01:25:45,248 --> 01:25:47,237
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>
Wait!

807
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:50,027
This is not about the box.

808
01:26:40,515 --> 01:26:42,226
Ong was a good man.

809
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:44,946
Unfortunately,
as his companion,

810
01:26:45,336 --> 01:26:48,513
you have to be the courier.

811
01:27:08,235 --> 01:27:10,198
Anything more to add here?

812
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,410
According to the insurance,

813
01:27:27,858 --> 01:27:30,069
your salary is suspended.

814
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,513
Until the investigation
is finished.

815
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:37,154
Well, you can keep working.

816
01:27:39,841 --> 01:27:43,200
It will accumulate as pay
nonetheless.

817
01:27:46,305 --> 01:27:48,569
I really don't have any right now.

818
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:51,248
It's still two days before pay.

819
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:11,488
Here.

820
01:28:11,831 --> 01:28:13,302
Take this for now.

821
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:18,850
You can pay me after
you receive your wage.

822
01:28:23,045 --> 01:28:24,159
Thank you.

823
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,747
You should change your shirt,

824
01:28:26,887 --> 01:28:28,493
before you go there.

825
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,558
I will not rest until I find out
what really happened.

826
01:28:45,606 --> 01:28:46,934
Thank you, sir.

827
01:29:25,307 --> 01:29:26,469
Oscar.

828
01:29:39,986 --> 01:29:41,694
When did it happen?

829
01:29:44,531 --> 01:29:46,025
This morning.

830
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:20,643
We had a money box before.

831
01:30:31,572 --> 01:30:33,813
Ong wanted it secured.

832
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:32,780
Do you know where it is?

833
01:31:43,717 --> 01:31:45,341
You son of a bitch.

834
01:31:45,552 --> 01:31:48,089
What if I expose you
to your company?!

835
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:12,661
Where's your pay for the rent?

836
01:33:12,877 --> 01:33:14,668
It's too much delayed.

837
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:17,750
- Where is Ong?
- Ong is gone.

838
01:33:19,132 --> 01:33:20,377
Who are you?

839
01:33:22,135 --> 01:33:24,044
What did you do here?!

840
01:33:24,845 --> 01:33:27,514
- I'll call the police!
- Wait, just take this.

841
01:33:29,641 --> 01:33:31,100
It's everything I have.

842
01:33:31,935 --> 01:33:34,141
Fix everything broken here!

843
01:33:34,395 --> 01:33:36,319
And you better leave on Friday!

844
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:46,188
Hey, I've been watching you. You're
not reaching quota. What's up?

845
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:48,739
Sorry.
I'll try harder.

846
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:51,864
Also your belly is getting bigger.
You're getting fat.

847
01:33:55,788 --> 01:33:56,961
How old is she?

848
01:33:59,959 --> 01:34:01,038
Nine.

849
01:34:01,252 --> 01:34:02,414
She's pretty.

850
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:04,693
We have special clients here.

851
01:34:05,213 --> 01:34:06,837
You want to earn extra?

852
01:34:08,048 --> 01:34:08,912
This is how it's gonna be.

853
01:34:08,914 --> 01:34:11,796
If you still want to work here,
she should work too.

854
01:35:11,854 --> 01:35:13,396
How much is there?

855
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:16,853
It is worthless,
unless you have the key.

856
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:19,725
Return it.
It is not ours.

857
01:35:19,944 --> 01:35:21,272
What should we say, Mai?

858
01:35:21,487 --> 01:35:24,855
That we recovered this money box
in this apartment?

859
01:35:26,825 --> 01:35:28,983
We can not stay here for long.

860
01:35:29,702 --> 01:35:31,825
We have to leave.

861
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:38,784
We made a big mistake
coming to Manila.

862
01:37:02,407 --> 01:37:03,521
Oscar...

863
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:05,700
Now you go with JJ.

864
01:37:07,536 --> 01:37:08,651
Yes, sir.

865
01:38:23,726 --> 01:38:26,134
JJ...
Punch my card for me?

866
01:38:27,438 --> 01:38:29,477
You learned much from Ong, eh?

867
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,350
Okay, I'll take care of it.

868
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:22,838
Motherfucker.
Who's that?

869
01:42:55,585 --> 01:42:57,873
Control.
Calling Control.

870
01:42:58,087 --> 01:43:03,425
I need details on Account Box 837.
Over.

871

<font color="#ffffbb">Oscar:</font> <i>You remember
the story of Alfred Santos?</i>

872
01:43:26,736 --> 01:43:28,548
<i>Alfred was unfortunate.</i>

873
01:43:29,113 --> 01:43:30,817
<i>He was desperate.</i>

874
01:43:32,491 --> 01:43:33,347
<i>But...</i>

875
01:43:33,396 --> 01:43:34,734
<i>...he did have a plan.</i>

876
01:43:41,468 --> 01:43:45,729
<i>He demanded the stewardesses
to collect money from passengers.</i>

877
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:49,929

878

<i>In that moment...</i>

879
01:43:51,716 --> 01:43:56,857
<i>was the freedom
Alfred and his family needed.</i>

880
01:44:03,803 --> 01:44:04,851
Mommy?

881
01:44:04,968 --> 01:44:07,765
Can we adopt the kitten?

882
01:44:10,357 --> 01:44:13,548
Yes, but we have to ask
your father first.

883
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:36,745
Sorry to bother you, sir.

884
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:02,775
Are you sure
these are my husband's?

885
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,986
He was shot while trying to steal
in the Processing Control.

886
01:45:08,407 --> 01:45:09,901
Good night.

887
01:45:15,992 --> 01:45:17,548
What the fuck is going on?

888
01:45:17,581 --> 01:45:18,686
Pardon me, sir.

889
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:21,758
We just got information that
your money box was targeted.

890
01:45:24,962 --> 01:45:27,519
Control Base, Control Base,
This is Eagle.

891
01:45:28,257 --> 01:45:29,678
<i>What's up, Eagle?</i>

892
01:45:30,092 --> 01:45:32,843
Positive! The money box
is here. All clear!

893
01:45:33,178 --> 01:45:35,574
- <i>Go back to Control Base.</i>
- Yes, sir.

894
01:45:35,763 --> 01:45:36,805
Sorry, sir.

895
01:45:37,015 --> 01:45:37,975
Farewell.
