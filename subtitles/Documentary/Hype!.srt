1
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,505
It is,
for better or worse...

2
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,090
Seattle-based bands

3
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:48,466
have topped the world charts

4
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,761
for the past few years.
Nirvana, Pearl Jam,

5
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,431
and Soundgarden
have sold millions of records.

6
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,433
...releases
to a major label debut...

7
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,144
...musical movements
centered around Seattle

8
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,813
in a sound and style
that became known as grunge.

9
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,690
A month before
that album came out,

10
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,108
they were...

11
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,610
...the basis
of the generation

12
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,821
of... X societies.

13
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,656
How does
the grunge movement,

14
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,867
as I understand it,
is the fact that these kids

15
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:16,536
have the ability to say
anything they want to say,

16
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,329
express anything
they want to express,

17
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:22,125
any anger, any pain,
any anguish, any torment,

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,836
and they feel
a kinship, a oneness,

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,048
that this young man
has been through, tragedy...

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,973
Thanks a lot.
This is gonna be the last song.

Remember
those big bubbles

36
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,044
that used to float
through the middle of town?

37
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,379
Yeah.

38
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:51,714
- These big bubbles, man.
- Yeah, they still do.

39
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,299
Yeah, you see them
once in a while.

40
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,010
They've got this
big pit out in the bay,

41
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,221
and it's like all,
like this weird shit

42
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,515
and it comes out of
the process, and the way...

43
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,725
the bubbles they're like this
big and they'd float around

44
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,687
and they were bad toxic things.
So, the way they get rid of it

45
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,564
is they got these
big water sprinklers

46
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,357
and they just like run
sprinklers over it to pop them...

47
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,984
But a bubble still
gets out once in a while.

48
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,527
They're huge, they're like...

49
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:13,778
Like bubble of death.

50
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,948
I went to Bothell High School
which was a suburban hell-hole.

51
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,160
Um, there's a sign
as you enter town that says,

52
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,954
'Welcome to Bothell
for a day or a lifetime'

53
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,123
and someone...

54
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,749
Someone,
I wish I had done it,

55
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,210
but someone erased
the B-O-T at one time

56
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,713
so it was 'Welcome to hell
for a day or a lifetime'.

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,715
The Northwest
is where flying saucers,

58
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,633
the term
"flying saucers" was coined.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,803
And the Northwest
is where Louie Louie's from,

60
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,555
the Northwest is where...

61
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,724
it's the serial killer
capital of the world.

62
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,560
I mean, we have more unsolved
serial killings up here

63
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,021
than any other place
in the United States.

64
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,149
I mean, the Manson family
used to vacation up this way.

65
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,443
This place is weird.
A lot of occult stuff.

66
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,238
All this stuff is a factor
in what happened in the music.

67
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,088
I mean,
when the weather's crappy,

68
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,798
you don't wanna go outside.

69
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,259
You know, you basically feel
like staying in the house

70
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,469
and, uh...

71
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,765
it's a very logical thing to
wanna go down into your basement

72
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:26,517
and, you know, make noise
to take out your frustrations

73
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,353
because you can't go outside

74
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,396
and do anything
when it's raining all the time.

75
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,232
♪ Don't get off the bus ♪

76
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,108

00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,443

Is Seattle
a nice place to live?

79
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,196
It's the best place to live.

80
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,822
And I've traveled
all over the place

81
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,199
and I honestly wouldn't
live anywhere else.

82
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,785
It has all the amenities
of a big city, but...

83
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,663
you know, there's nothing
you're missing out on

84
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,498
by being in Seattle
as opposed to another city.

85
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,583
And it's pretty, you know,

86
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,211
there's hills and mountains
and trees and water.

87
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,796
So,
all these people come here

88
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,089
and then there's
all this publicity

89
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,674
and Northern Exposure

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,467
and Twin Peaks
and all this stuff

91
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:00,718
and everyone wants
to come up here

92
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,428
and live
the good yuppie lifestyle

93
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,973
but all the time
there's all these people

94
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,683
that are underneath
that were here first

95
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,935
and they're just starving
and they're all crazy.

96
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,104
I mean, it's like one of those
end of the world places

97
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,398
you can't go no further
and still be in the US.

98
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,029
In 1980...

99
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,366
I think bands
stopped coming to Seattle.

100
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,076
Bands never used to come here.

101
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,869
They'd go as far as
San Francisco and then not...

102
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,205
not come all the way up to Seattle

103
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,831
because it wasn't
worth it to play one show.

104
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,417
There were two,
maybe two and a half clubs

105
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,878
where you could play if you
were playing your own music.

106
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,089
Some people
used to rent halls,

107
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,299
just put their
whole show on themselves,

108
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,385
take tickets,
run up do the music

109
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,637
and at the end pick up
the broom and clean it up.

112

Well, Seattle was really lame,

113
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,153
you know, specifically,
in the early '80s,

114
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,572
I mean, Seattle was like
a million second cities.

115
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,534
It had a fake Talking Heads,
it had a fake Pere Ubu,

116
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,619
it had a fake Killing Joke,

117
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,705
it had all the fake Ramones
you could shake a stick at,

118
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,124
you know,
and people from Bellevue

119
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,583
singing with English accents.

120
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,294
There was
this big poodle metal scene.

121
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,798
Bands with, um,
big fancy guitars and...

122
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,551
just tons and tons
of hairspray, eyeliner...

123
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,469
See, all the extra
sleazy punk rockers

124
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,929
used to hang out
on First Avenue.

125
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,889
There was
a donut shop right there

126
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,683
which was right next to
The Showbox

127
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,477
which is right there.
It's a comedy club now.

128
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,729
And that was like the big
punk rock venue.

129
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,981
Opening night,

130
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:01,482
the very first
punk club in Seattle.

131
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,817
This is probably worth,

132
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,902
you know, three,
four hundred bucks.

133
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,795
Nobody was
too worried about success

134
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,547
because we knew we were
living in Seattle,

135
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,007
you know, it wasn't LA,

136
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,467
nobody was gonna
come and sign us...

137
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,677
You played a show
in some small club...

138
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,096
the audience
consisted of members

139
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,807
of the other dozen or so
bands that were playing

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,893
similar bills
and similar clubs...

141
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,488
The bands
that stuck it out

142
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,781
did it because they
really, really, really enjoyed

143
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,074
playing their music

144
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,701
and that was really the only

145
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,162
positive reinforcement
that anybody got.

146
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,456
We really started
playing music cause it's fun

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,999
which probably most people say

148
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,294
but with us, it's true.

149
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,505

people played, you know?

tons of great bands too and...

163

The most interesting
music around here

164
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,721
is definitely coming from
places where people are

165
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,598
just playing in their garage,
they're playing to themselves

or playing to their friends.

Across the street,

who are in a band called
Sisters Sidekick,

my little brother's band...

We're all so
fucking bored out of our heads

180
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,012
that it was
get drunk, fall down,

181
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,639
and, uh, you know,
throw your body around

182
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,559
and all the bands that came
through Seattle at that time

183
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,561
Scratch Acid and Big Black

184
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:47,106
said that Seattle had
the most exciting, potent scene

185
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,609
going on in the US,
they all loved to play here

186
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,069
because everyone would
just like go nuts

187
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,155
and drink themselves
into a frenzy

188
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,198
and throw themselves on stage

189
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,992
and it was very flattering
for these bands, you know,

190
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,369
whereas you go to
Los Angeles and New York

191
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,746
and people stood there and went,

192
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,207
"Hmm, I don't know.
He missed a note there."

193
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,969
Best bands in Seattle were like

194
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,972
Malfunction,
The U-Men, who else?

195
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:25,269
Skin Yard, My High, Feast,
64 Spiders, Bundle of Hiss...

196
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,938
Nobody ever
remembers Psycho Pop, man.

197
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,523
We could make a long list

198
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,359
if you wanna talk
about all Tom's bands.

199
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,693
We were a good band, man.

200
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,612
We had
a band called The Fartz.

201
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,530
Red Dress, Blackouts...

202
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,449
The Blackouts
were an excellent band,

203
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,909
you know, Free Swimmers,
Beakers,

204
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:43,204
Little Bears from Bangkok,
Max Band, Quack Quack Quack.

205
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,165
Nobody knows these names,
this is ancient history!

206
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,794
One generation out from a band
is every band that shared

207
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,837
a member directly
with that band.

208
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,340
For instance, you know
Stone Gossard was in Green River

209
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,800
and then he went
to Mother Love Bone,

210
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,343
like that's one generation out.

211
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,595
So, for instance, you could
take like an early band

212
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,805
like The Blunt Objects

213
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,972
and it asks you
how many generations.

214
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,432
Let's go four generations out.

215
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,561
Um, so you sort of have
these three columns;

216
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,231
the mainstream, heavy metal,
hard rock thing that, you know,

217
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,191
Mother Love Bone
and Pearl Jam have done.

218
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,777
Then there's the Fast Backs,
the Posies and, uh,

219
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,279
The Young Fresh Fellows,
which were probably

220
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,031
the first band to really
make it out of Seattle

221
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,033
all by themselves
without moving out of town.

222
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,077
And they were just,
you know, sort of a pop sound.

223
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,455
And then the third branch
is the noise/grunge rock.

224
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,791
That was closely related
to Green River and Mudhoney

225
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,084
and The Thrown Ups,

226
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,628
all sort of Sub Pop,
you know, grunge sound

227
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,130
and it's pretty incestuous

228
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,257
but you keep bumping
into the same old people.

229
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,883
Green River.

230
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,010
This was the genesis right here,

231
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,346
Steve and Mark from Mudhoney

232
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,640
and Stone and Jeff
from Pearl Jam

233
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,976
and Alex who's now
studying to be a lawyer.

234
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,769
Room Nine
became Love Battery,

235
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,020
Bundle of Hiss became TAD,

236
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,605
Pure Joy became Flop,

237
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,025
Skin Yard, among other things,
became, uh, Gruntruck,

238
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,819
Jesse Bernstein who's dead.

239
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,197
Watch folks,
hundreds of dollars.

240
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,616
Don was in Butt Sweat

241
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,912
and, uh, they played
at one skate contest.

242
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,789
And you were too,
Tom, don't leave that out.

243
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,332
And,uh".

244
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,168
And he was also
in the Kings of Rock...

245
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,962
so was Jim Tillman from...
ex of Love Battery

246
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,047
What? Jim Tillman
wasn't in Butt Sweat?

247
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,674
He played rhythm guitar.

248
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:19,967
- Did he?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,427
Oh.

250
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:23,095
Remember friends,
this is only a movie,

251
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,638
you're free to leave the
theater at any time.

252
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,742
Someone said to me once
that there was

253
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,287
the aesthetic of dumb about
the Seattle music scene

254
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,124
that the music
wasn't stupid but it was dumb,

255
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,294
you know, Mudhoney's not stupid
but they're a little bit dumb.

256
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,881
My mom has always told me
that I'm not a loser,

257
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,843
so the whole loser thing,
I never believed in

258
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,637
'cause clearly, I'm not a loser

259
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,014
and Mark, I think your mom
has told you the same thing?

260
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,099
We're not losers.

261
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,685
I guess it's really easy
to think of yourself as a loser

262
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,854
'cause then you don't care
if people like you or not.

263
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,480
You know,
that's sort of the idea,

264
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,940
and then you can do
whatever you want.

265
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,067
And it's funny.

266
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,195
We were the guy in high school
who people used to beat up.

267
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,615
And we couldn't even talk
to the pretty girl.

268
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,870
I mean, we couldn't...
we're nerds, goddammit!

269
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,873
Well, I think ever since
Spinal Tap came out,

270
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,543
I mean, they were like
pointing the finger at bloated,

271
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,380
overly commercialized,
deluded bands,

272
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,383
and, uh,
we just looked at ourselves,

273
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,719
said well we don't have to point
at somebody else, we can...

274
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,387
When you've been
through periods where you've had

275
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:55,015
keyboard players with 50,000
pounds worth of kit onstage

276
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,602
and 82 keyboards and 95 samplers

277
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,314
you know, uh,
after a while you just go,

278
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,067
"Hang on, this is like eating
too much food at one sitting,

279
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,528
it's too much sounds,
it's too many colors,

280
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:10,197
it's... it's all got
poncy and posy,

281
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,826
um, let's go and see some bands
where they just bash it out."

282
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,703
♪ Eat my dump ♪

283
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,665
♪ Tell me that you love me ♪

284
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,166

286
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,674
Some bands get on stage

287
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,176
and they're,
they're basically entertainers,

288
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,970
they have, you know,
they have a shtick,

289
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,472
they are giving you a show.

290
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,474
Some bands get up there
and they rock,

291
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,018
and you can tell the difference.

292
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,186
That's why Seattle bands
tend to be a little bit

293
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,022
inconsistent live, I think,

294
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,024
is because most of them
aren't really up there

295
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,067
to be entertainers,
they're up there to rock out,

296
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,361
And their best shows are when
they're having the most fun.

297
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,364
Not when they necessarily
have their act down

298
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,991
because maybe they
don't have an act.

299
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,036
If it's connecting with the
audience right, I get chills.

300
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,662
- I mean, I can just,
- Yeah.

301
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,164
I finish a song
and it feels right

302
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,957
and I can just tell it's
just gonna start going fine,

303
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,667
man, I get chills
and they're rocking

304
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,377
and fuck yeah, let's go!

305
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,298
There's a million people out
there that can do what I'm doing

306
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,717
as far as producing,
recording, anything like that,

307
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,803
a lot better than I'm doing,
have better equipment,

308
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,973
but still, it's like the only
way you get good at anything

309
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,599
is to be doing it all the time,

310
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,310
so, this is
a lifetime chore for me.

311
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,770
Basically,
it's just to have

312
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,063
complete control
over everything,

313
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,190
to be able to do it
the way you want to do it,

314
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,484
have it come out the right way

315
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:56,071
and then not really have
anybody that can tell you...

316
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,574
what the hell to do.
Where you can play,

317
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,200
how you can look,
how you can dress,

318
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,910
what songs to record,
which ones not to.

319
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,371
It keeps it
on a personal level,

320
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:09,001
it keeps it where rock and roll
type things really should be.

321
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,796
It's very much
just happening right there,

322
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,258
it's not happening
in somebody's big offices

323
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,385
or in somebody's
big bank accounts or anything.

324
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:19,636
It's...

325
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,306
it's really exciting for the
people that are doing it.

336
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,306
PopLlama was a big influence,

337
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,974
Conrad can do it,
so Sub Pop can do it.

338
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,976
We wanted to do our
own record so we will, hell!

339
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,269
If these guys can do it,

340
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,731
we've seen these guys so drunk
they can't stand up, you know.

341
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,483
They can't drive a car, so,

342
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,068
and they can do this,
so we can do that.

343
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,444
That's just a given.

344
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,821
I think with people here
they don't sit around going,

345
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,491
"Oh, nothing ever happens here.
Nothing ever goes on here."

346
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,952
You know, by the time
the kid's out of high school,

347
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,079
he's already been in a band,
put out a couple fanzines,

348
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:30,165
recorded a few records, started
a label, did a radio show.

349
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,376
That was the whole lesson we
learned when we moved up here.

350
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,710
Like, you just do it.

351
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,004
We moved up here
and we saw other bands,

352
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,174
you know, no different than us
just putting out records.

353
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,009
All you really need to do that

354
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,971
is some magnetic tape
and a microphone,

355
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,431
and that's really all you need,

356
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,561
and then, you know, maybe,
just maybe, some bad reverb.

357
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,106
And they smell good,
records just smell good.

358
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,775
They, you know, there's nothing
like cracking that cellophane

359
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,568
and pulling that record out,
it just smells great.

360
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,123
When
Deep Six first came out,

361
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,794
it was chronicling something
that was suddenly going on,

362
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,588
I guess it was
by a fluke of providence,

363
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,550
kind of... a initial document of

364
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,927
what later turned into be
a pretty big scene.

365
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,387
I think we all became aware

366
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,806
that there was a certain
regional sound developing

367
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,099
and nobody had a name for it.

368
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,814
That's punk rock and...

369
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,650
one day they just sort of
started going, um...

370
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:46,867
and that was grunge.

371
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:49,828
The most noisy,

372
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,748
The most absurd,

373
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,751
The heaviest thing
that was going.

374
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,017
Yeah, we know this
is heavy rock and heavy rock

375
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,227
is kind of stupid
but it's fun anyways.

376
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,605
It's where you had a band like
The Melvins doing Kiss covers.

377
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,107
It was all in fun,
it was like we know

378
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,984
that this is the cheesiest
thing we could possibly do,

379
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,110
we gotta do it.

380
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,446
It's just ridiculousness,
complete ridiculousness.

381
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,947
What can we get away with next,
you know.

382
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,686
Bands like Green River,
basically,

383
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,563
they were sort of the
definitive grunge band.

384
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,651
It was a euphemism for just
extremes, extremes of anything,

385
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:06,405
and a lot of people say that
it's a throwback to metal.

386
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,907
Heavy metal's part of it,
it was one influence,

387
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,617
punk rock was one influence,

388
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,911
basically anything
loud and crushing

389
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,246
and extreme
was an influence.

390
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,915
We'd all been in bands
that were more controlled

391
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,209
and more dynamic,

392
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,003
you know, more... better,

393
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,548
better bands actually
and we just, well,

394
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,466
our whole thing was
we just wanted to

395
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,301
get away from all structure
and just be chaotic

396
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,513
and not worry about that.
It was kind of joyful release.

397
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,974
It's taken rock
right back to its basics

398
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,017
which is go up there
and make a hell of a noise

399
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,062
and make sure you play music
that your parents don't like.

400
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,923
First thing, actually,

401
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,008
was when we were doing
the first Soundgarden single,

402
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,843
and we were doing a song called
"Nothing To Say,"

403
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,595
which was just...

404
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,640
at the time
just seemed amazingly heavy.

405
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,433
I thought this, you know,

406
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,019
these guys can't possibly be
really playing this song,

407
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,522
this sounds like, you know,
this sounds insane,

408
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,190
it sounds
way too good for 8-track

409
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,108
and it sounds way too good
for a, you know,

410
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,735
crappy little Seattle band.

411
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,754
Bruce Pavitt
originally had the name Sub Pop

412
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,297
when he was living in
Olympia, I think.

413
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,842
He had a sort
of cassette fanzine network

414
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,970
where he put out these
little compilation cassettes

415
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,054
of local bands.

416
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,515
He was interested in
making it a vinyl mix.

417
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,184
The bands he was
interested in at the time

418
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,352
were Green River and us.

419
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,689
And John, also,
was a huge fan of ours.

420
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,108
He wanted to make a record,
start a record label,

421
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,527
so we kinda talked him
into working together

422
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,195
to put out our record.

423
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,031
Up to that time,
everyone played it really safe,

424
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,908
of all the small labels,

425
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,119
"Well, we'll put out
a single every three months

426
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,122
and, you know, we'll sell
a thousand copies of it

427
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,416
and that's cool
because I've got my day job,"

428
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,793
and John and Bruce
were having none of that,

429
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,337
they said, you know,
we don't want to work day jobs,

430
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,548
we don't want our bands
to work day jobs,

431
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,425
we want them out there
on the road,

432
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,260
we want them
in the big magazines,

433
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,721
we want their
records everywhere.

434
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,889
It is punk rock,
but we don't care.

435
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,017
We want to make it
bigger than punk rock

436
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,437
and that's why
these two gentlemen are...

437
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,315
the Kings of the scene,
as you might say.

438
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:32,277
There was a real
Indie ethic in the 80s

439
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,155
that you weren't supposed to be
proud of having hit records

440
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,406
or being a hit machine.

441
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,575
And John and I, as fans of,

442
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,535
you know, the history
of pop music in this...

443
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,621
this, uh, this country,

444
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:46,916
really admired labels like
Motown and their hit factory...

445
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,835
- Mentality.
- Yeah.

446
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,713
They definitely picked a certain
kind of band for their label,

447
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,715
which makes everybody think
that's the only thing

448
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,592
that was the only thing
that was going on in Seattle.

449
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,218
Um, they...

450
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,721
by default, I ended up
engineering all of them and...

451
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,973
they had Charles doing
all the photography.

452
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,725
So there was
definitely a package

453
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,727
an image and a sound.

454
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,522
I think every community
has their pools of talent

455
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,441
it's just a matter of
being able to take on

456
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,151
the responsibility of marketing.

457
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,030
You know, I'm a failed
pop musician myself, so...

458
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,949
you know, I kinda decided,

459
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,118
"Well, I'm gonna play in
crummy band after crummy band,

460
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,496
I may as well wrap
some of these bands

461
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,247
who might have a chance
at doing something.

462
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,459
Basically he said,
"Hey, you sing about dogs,

463
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,378
you sing about being sick,

464
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,964
you got a shtick,

465
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,592
And he basically
gave us like five chords

466
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,720
but he said, "Don't use more
than three within one song."

477
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,653
When Sub Pop finally got their
act together and they started

478
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:43,700
somehow getting this
underground hype thing going

479
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,660
which started very small.

480
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,455
They flew an English
journalist into Seattle,

481
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,873
took him to see
a Mudhoney show

482
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,500
and gave him some singles
and had him meet everybody

483
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,043
and he went back
and wrote a big article

484
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,670
in one of the
English music papers

485
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,881
and that sort of started
this big frenzy in England.

486
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,467
It just seemed like it was
a worthwhile business move,

487
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,718
- so we...
- Yeah.

488
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,138
And fortunately, Everett was
a brilliant enough guy

489
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,931
that he could
piece together a story

490
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,893
that essentially
sold the world on Seattle.

491
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,479
♪ Love me I'm rich ♪

492
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,901
♪ Come on baby
Now come with me ♪

493
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,862
♪ If you don't come
If you don't come ♪

494
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,240
♪ If you don't come
You'll die alone ♪

495
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:30,580
Sub Pop, the hype machine,
and we went along with it.

496
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,123
It seemed pretty
funny at the time.

497
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,210
They didn't really hype their
bands, they hyped their label,

498
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,086
which is a much different thing

499
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,672
and a much,
a much more original thing...

500
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,509
It gave
a record this desirability,

501
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,469
this perhaps
fictional desirability,

502
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,095
but, nonetheless,
it made the collectors

503
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,597
try and get
a hold of these things

504
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,015
and made people
talk about them

505
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,059
so, a lot of people
talked about Sub Pop

506
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,769
and how cool their records were

507
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,146
and how cool the packaging
and the bands were cool

508
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:56,815
and "Oh,
you can't get the record,

509
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,316
it's worth a lot
of money already.

510
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,361
People started looking
for the Seattle sound,

511
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,781
the same way that D.C.,
Boston, New York and LA,

512
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,241
and all those places

513
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,077
had this crazy little
identity all of their own.

514
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,038
Seattle started getting
its own identity

515
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,249
and Sub Pop decided
to exploit that.

516
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,436
♪ Well alright
Yeah, alright ♪

517

531
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,165
Suddenly there
were three times as many people

532
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,625
that had been here all along,

533
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,377
going out, seeing bands
and supporting those bands

534
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:45,465
and allowing this scene
to be far more viable.

535
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,550
What you actually see
happening in Seattle

536
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,553
is this kind
of explosion of sub culture.

537
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,430
I think it's
a very important thing

538
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,849
and a very healthy thing
to have happen anywhere,

539
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,434
particularly in
a place like Seattle,

540
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,227
it's so conservative
and so reserved

541
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,146
to have something like this
happen here's been

542
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:03,107
nothing short of, like,
major electrical shock.

543
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,527
Everything was suddenly
just buzzing with activity.

544
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,363
I mean, singles
were being put out,

545
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,990
but there was
no point earlier in history

546
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,825
that you could have
a magazine devote

547
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,955
an entire record review section
just to local record reviews.

548
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:21,000
Um, people from underground
fan 'zines across the country

549
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,169
were already starting
to snipe about Seattle

550
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,671
and how much hype
it was receiving.

551
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,590
When things started
to become spotlighted,

552
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,551
more venues opened up

553
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,304
and more opportunities
opened up for people to play

554
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:37,934
but there was never
a lack of great musical talent

555
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,686
and it was always really diverse

556
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:44,107
and there was always an unspoken
sense of community about it.

557
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,162

565
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,227

anything to do with music?

The Seattle music scene
right now is really vital.

572
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,666
I mean, it is so alive,

573
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,419
it's better than
London in the 1960s,

574
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,880
it's better than New York
in the 70s, I mean...

575
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,467
Margaret, I was in it.
I was in London in the 1960s,

576
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,470
I was in London in the 1960s,
it was awful! I mean...

577
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,180
If you say the word 'scene'

578
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,307
everybody rolls their eyes
and laughs at you.

579
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,018
"Scene."
you know, "there's no scene!"

580
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,395
So, a lot
of people thought that

581
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,856
it has reached its peak
and by next year,

582
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,108
we are all gonna go back
to doing what we were doing

583
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,653
and we are all gonna go back
to our little small town Utopia

584
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,656
and, uh, about 1990
we all sort of went,

585
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,116
"Oh, good, it's over."

586
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,660
Nirvana kinda
came out of left field,

587
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,287
uh, namely Aberdeen,

588
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,914
which is a town sort of out
in the middle of nowhere.

589
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,417
And, uh, you know,
we just got a phone call

590
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,295
at the studio one day
from this guy, you know, Kurt,

591
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,546
says his name was Kurt,

592
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:54,931
he said he was
a friend of the Melvins

593
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,799
and he wanted to come up
and just record some songs

594
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,092
and I said okay,

595
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,386
friend of the Melvins,
friend of mine, come on up.

596
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,013
You know, I didn't know
who the hell he was

597
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,056
and nobody else did either.
He just came up,

598
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,022
blew out ten songs
in five hours, we recorded them

599
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:10,021
and mixed them in one afternoon
and, uh, blew me away.

600
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:12,190
I thought "Oh, my God,
this is amazing," you know?

601
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,775
I said, "Guys, can I please keep
a copy of this for myself

602
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,527
before you go back to Aberdeen?

603
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:17,987
That was the tape
I gave to Jonathan.

604
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:33,044
This is my
penultimate grunge photo...

605
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,047
Kurt Cobain
spinning on his back.

606
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:40,301
Everyone asks "How in the hell
is he doing that?" I don't know.

612
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:54,023
At that point,
I think Soundgarden had put out

613
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,817
their first major label record,
it was doing okay.

614
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,778
I think that Screaming Trees
had put out their first

615
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,947
major label record
and I think it was doing okay.

616
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:02,657
Alice in Chains was...

617
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,534
had put out their first major
label record, it was doing okay.

618
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,496
But, Nirvana was kind of
the little brother, you know,

619
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:11,123
the runt of the litter,
so to speak.

620
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,002
And I remember Jonathan
telling me in 1990, he said,

621
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:18,089
"This band is going to be huge."

622
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,800
He said it exactly
like that, he said,

623
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,844
"Jack, this band
is going to be huge."

624
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,855
The record came out
in fall, September.

625
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:36,899
The video came...

626
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,610
I remember the first time
I saw the video,

627
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,862
I thought
"This is so cool,"

628
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:45,449
that there's no way MTV
will play this, just no way.

629
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,159
And then when that started going

630
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,120
it reached
millions of kids instantly.

631
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,164
Ben would go off and call up
people back home in Seattle,

632
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,708
he'd come back and say,

633
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,293
you know,
the latest sales figures.

634
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,712
He'd go, "Nevermind
has done 300,000."

635
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,090
"Nevermind has done 400,000."

636
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,968
"Nevermind just went gold."

648
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,082
There was an old, uh,
Brain song called

649
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:36,792
"Money Changes Everything"...

650
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,213
I think we adapted that
to "Nirvana changes everything".

651
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,670
It's probably why

652
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,589
you create in the first place,
because of the freedom.

653
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,425
Do whatever you want...

654
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,009
whatever you want on tape.

655
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,929
But again, commerce is involved

656
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,265
and as soon as it starts
going through those channels

657
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,978
those money-making channels,
everything changes, you know?

658
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,771
When these bands
started to get popular,

659
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:22,815
all of a sudden everyone
wanted to find the next Nirvana,

660
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,817
everyone wanted
to sign the next Pearl Jam.

661
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,444
All of a sudden,

662
00:41:26,694 --> 00:41:29,071
bands who'd never played
live before, practically,

663
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,031
were getting huge advances.

664
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,741
The labels start

665
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,660
bidding for bands
to get bands signed,

666
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,662
so that they could
then sell them to a major,

667
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,581
the bands get all worked up

668
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,667
and basically break verbal
contracts you make with them

669
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,294
because, well,
you don't have a contract.

670
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:44,879
I mean, when I first started

671
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,797
I didn't need contracts,
I didn't think I did, you know?

672
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,132
"Here's my friend", you know,

673
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:50,426
but someone throws, you know,
500,000 in their face

674
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:51,760
and they're like,
"Oh, we didn't have a contract."

675
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:55,389
If the major labels are like
a big, dumb Baby Huey,

676
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:59,768
you know, that "Oh,
what's going on in Athens?"

677
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,271
And waddle over to Athens
and you sit down on Athens

678
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,689
and you start buying lunches

679
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,442
and you crush three bands
by accident and, you know,

680
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,402
"Wow, the party's
in Athens, you know?

681
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:10,821
And then you kinda look over
your shoulder and go, "Oh...

682
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,575
Minneapolis and then Baby Huey
gets up and goes and sits

683
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:17,161
on Minneapolis and kills
three bands by accident

684
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,413
and buys a bunch
of lunches and, you know,

685
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,290
kind of plays that
party out and then, you know,

686
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,751
so, the idea that they were
moving in, you know,

687
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:25,127
sort of dedicated clumps,

688
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,588
I mean Seattle was
just like part of that process.

689
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:30,799

697
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,924
The effect of this whole thing
of like hyping a label,

698
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:13,842
or hyping a sound,
or hyping a place,

699
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,554
is it starts to take a lot
of the attention away from

700
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,472
the individual artists
that are making music.

701
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,141
Everyone doesn't sound the same,
everyone isn't grunge,

702
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,186
everyone doesn't have
long hair, you know, um...

703
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,106
They made a big mistake.

704
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:30,317
They didn't go further
and find more of the bands

705
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,653
that were already here
and had been here

706
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,115
even before the bands that
were exploited were, you know?

707
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:39,535
That's what makes me feel guilty
of the success of our band

708
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,620
because it should've been, uh,

709
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:45,416
spread out to the success
of like a number of bands here.

710
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,418
They focused
on this one scene

711
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:49,878
or one type of music when
really that's pretty inaccurate

712
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,463
'cause there's all kinds
of bands here, you know?

713
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,382
There's, like,
weird, funky jazz bands

714
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,259
and weird, you know,
hip-hop bands,

715
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,845
or punk rock bands,
or metal bands or whatever,

716
00:43:58,012 --> 00:43:59,555
it's like there's a whole
bunch of stuff, so...

717
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:00,806
...and cowpunk bands,
there's like

718
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,558
a shit load of different bands
here, there always has been.

719
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:04,226
In Europe,
they just started to put

720
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:05,686
stickers on things
that just said "Seattle,"

721
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:07,187
that's all the sticker said.

722
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,315
It was like the stamp, you know,

723
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,693
it's like the USDA,
it's like Seattle stamping.

Nirvana happening
or Pearl Jam happening,

745
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,220
someway seems like kind of a...

746
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,556
some kind of like
weird natural occurrence

747
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:49,475
that got rolling in 1979,

748
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,227
like it's that energy,
whatever that energy started as,

749
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,855
I think ultimately, you know,
landed with what we got now

750
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:56,940
and it's not like
it's punk rock paying off,

751
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,026
it's more like you push
the pimple hard enough

752
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,360
and it pops up
someplace else.

753
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,821
...but then it becomes
homogenized, manipulated,

754
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,032
and marketed,
and it's not intense anymore.

755
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:08,160
So, there's a constant
cycle of rebellion.

756
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:10,037
I think punk's gonna
be there forever, man...

757
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,164
- Punk is... Yeah.
- As long as there's kids that...

758
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,750
Kids are the
most important part of punk.

759
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:15,876
They wanna get wild, yeah.

760
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:17,211
There'll be no shortage

761
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,755
of disaffected American youth
over the next 50 years.

762
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:20,881
Well, even more.

763
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:22,341
Some great rock and roll
coming down the line.

764
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,138
There's
over a thousand bands

765
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,473
in Seattle right now

766
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,518
and I think a lot of that
is people moving here,

767
00:47:32,935 --> 00:47:36,313
bands moving here
in hopes of becoming famous...

768
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,524
Because of all the hype
and attention on Seattle

769
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,192
people know that
if they do something here

770
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,653
they're gonna get
recognized to some extent,

771
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,905
they won't be totally
overlooked, even if it's bad.

772
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,825
In fact, there were musicians
who moved to California

773
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,828
in the early 80s, from Seattle,
to try and get signed.

774
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,246
Who started moving back.

775
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,421
There's got
to be at least a thousand,

776
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,756
if not more
than that in Seattle,

777
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,508
and so I came up with an idea

778
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,635
to package boxsets
of Northwest bands,

779
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:09,513
so what I try and do is
I try and find ways to exploit,

780
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,806
and I like the word 'exploit',

781
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:13,559
exploit through
propaganda and television

782
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,602
the Northwest
music community as a whole.

783
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,313
Volume three is
probably my favorite set,

784
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,942
it's got... it's got some
of the most well-known bands.

785
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:24,278
You got your Hammerbox,
and your Hungry Crocodiles,

786
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:26,989
Pond, Sara Debell,
Peace, Love and Guitars.

787
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,825
It's just got, I mean it's got
so many great bands in it,

788
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,327
that if you wanna know anything
about the Northwest music,

789
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:33,912
there's my card.
If you wanna know anything

790
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,622
<i>about the
Northwest music scene,</i>

791
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,166
this is a great place
to start because all the cards

792
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,836
have the contact information
of the band on the back

793
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:42,629
and also,
if you take these cards,

794
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,506
turn them face down,
put them together,

795
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:47,092
it's a jigsaw puzzle
of a traffic jam on I5.

796
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:51,555

00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,838
Today I was in a music shop
and I saw some people

807
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,758
and it was like, "You moved
from LA, probably yesterday!"

808
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:29,551
Like, I feel sorry
for the up and coming bands,

809
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:30,928
they can't even get gigs,

810
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:33,305
you know, it takes them
years sometimes to get a gig.

811
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,682
We were together, like,
three weeks, we played a show.

812
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:40,270
You say it's a ton of bands?
The Trees way more than a ton.

813
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,398
We're a ton of band.

814
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:45,400
So, fuck 'em!

815
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,361
We got bands
all over this place, here.

816
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:48,445
We got...

817
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,490
The band in here,
Inflatable Soule

818
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:54,785
Manotypical.
Rap band in this room.

819
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:59,373
I hear a lone drummer
practicing here.

820
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,880
Industrial nonsense
comes out of that flat.

821
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,799
It's all hallways
and dark rooms.

822
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,552
Bands in the rafters,

823
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,347
Bands to the left,
bands to the right.

824
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:18,350
If you like being a
kid setting up a lemonade stand

825
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,185
and have a really
successful lemonade stand,

826
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:23,188
and all of a sudden ten of them
open up right next to you,

827
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:25,983
in your yard,
on your block

828
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,694
all competing
for the same lemonade nickel.

829
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:33,907
Only they're obviously selling
lower quality lemonade.

830
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:48,213
Right now,
Seattle is quarter until six

831
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:50,841
on Christmas Eve
at a shopping mall

832
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:52,718
when the mall closes
at six 0' clock,

833
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,761
when it's too crazy

834
00:50:55,095 --> 00:51:00,809
and it's loaded with sub-moronic
idiots, prancing around,

835
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,769
buying anything
they can get their hands on.

836
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:15,449
...by universal acclaim,

837
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,743
the nation's media
have declared Seattle

838
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,203
the coolest place
in the known universe.

839
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,123
The music of Seattle
is as progressive as the people

840
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:26,960
Listen to Pearl Jam,
Soundgarden, Nirvana.

841
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,838
Where else can you get
the Seattle sound? Best Buy.

842
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,423
Once there was
this grunge singer,

843
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,175
who did all the things
grunge singers would do.

844
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,052
♪ Puking on the carpet ♪

845
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,428
♪ I couldn't help it ♪

846
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:37,929
♪ I'm drinking from the toilet ♪

847
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,931
♪ It's just a habit ♪

848
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,394
♪ I swear that smell you smell
Is not from me ♪

849
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:46,730
It's loud music
with heavy vocals.

850
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,398
Is it
mutant rock and roll?

851
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:50,567
Have we ever used
chainsaws and axes?

852
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,862
Are they contributing
anything to the world

853
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:54,905
they're taking so much from?

854
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,909
Mudhoney is sort of like
watching the market right now.

855
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:01,036
In October 1993,

856
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:03,497
this group's "VS." album
debuted at number one,

857
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,999
with sales of 950,000 copies.

858
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,125
Jeremy.

859
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,460
- Who is Pearl Jam?
- Yeah.

860
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:09,795
Pop music for 400.

861
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:13,507
Does this look like
we're unhappy or cynical?

862
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:17,010
Okay, our next guests
are a Seattle band,

863
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,929
this right here
is their newest album.

864
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,889
- ...playing the Posies
- "Weird Al" Yankovic.

865
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:22,224
Pearl Jam!

866
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,683
Hey Butt-Head,
where's Seattle?

867
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,810
- Seattle.
- Seattle.

868
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,187
Seattle. Thanks, phone dude!

869
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,524
I think now
is the time that I should be

870
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,692
announcing my candidacy
for mayor of Seattle.

871
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,862
When the whole
thing was just out of control

872
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:38,532
and press people were
visiting our office

873
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,242
at the rate
of two or three a week,

874
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:47,207
it seemed like very few of them
had even the most remote clue

875
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:48,667
of what was really
going on in Seattle.

876
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:51,336
Glossy print ad
with a fancy red car

877
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:54,923
and a background and they're
saying something about grunge

878
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,093
They think people are
gonna go out and buy this car?

879
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,886
They're gonna look at this ad
and go, "Fuck you!"

880
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:01,680
When you're close to something,

881
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:03,682
you feel you know
the truth about it

882
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,810
and when People Magazine's
writing about it

883
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:08,436
you know they're not
gonna have the truth,

884
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,313
they have a very
distorted view of it.

885
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,066
And you realize that that's
what the entire world sees

886
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:16,444
and that's what the entire world
thinks about, and they're wrong.

887
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,990
("Second Skin" by
The Gits plays]

888
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,668
Maybe there's like
a bunch of photographers

889
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,253
and they wanna put you with
this other person

890
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,629
from another band
that you don't even know

891
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:36,673
and they want you to put your
arm around them and smile and...

892
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:39,509
"You play in band, don't you?"
"Yeah, yeah, I play in a band."

893
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:41,386
"Pearl Jam, right?"
II No-II

894
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:42,762
"Aren't you the
drummer from Pearl Jam?"

895
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,431
"No, I'm not the
drummer from Pearl Jam."

896
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,057
They didn't even say
anything about the music.

897
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:47,976
They talked about what we wore

898
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:49,686
and whether or not
the girl in the band before

899
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,188
shaved her armpits or not.

900
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:53,148
The newest thing
I heard was that

901
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:56,109
we're really bad
at interviews.

902
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,695

they possibly get that?

♪ Something I cannot
Break free of ♪

927
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:20,360
You just didn't wanna answer
any more stupid questions.

928
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:21,695
They were all the same.

929
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,363
What's Seattle like?
What are the bands like?

930
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,240
Do you know this band?
Do you know that band?

931
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:26,491
Everyone had it.

932
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,576
We put a moratorium at one point

933
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:31,746
on people calling and asking
for the Seattle story.

934
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:35,208
There was nothing to do
except just start poking fun

935
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,003
at the entire thing
and so, instead of saying,

936
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,838
"No, I really
don't know that person",

937
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:42,799
it would turn into,
"Oh, sure, every Monday morning

938
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:45,093
we eat banana splits
at breakfast time,"

939
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:47,095
"Shoo-be-doo
used to be my roommate",

940
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:50,307
or, you know, "I'll tell ya,
he has a horrible case

941
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,851
of the squirts
after he has Indian food."

942
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:55,270
And, like,
you just start making up

943
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:57,272
every single lie you can

944
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,407
and then try to...
the goal is to

945
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,860
just get crazy rumors
circulating all the time.

946
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,572
There's a big element of put on
involved with all Seattle music,

947
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:08,783
I mean, Kurt Cobain's
goofy name spelling's, uh,

948
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:12,329
a lot of Sub Pop's world
domination kind of attitude,

949
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:13,830
I mean,
the whole thing's ridiculous.

950
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,583
Seventy-five percent of what
Bruce and Jon say is a lie.

951
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:20,211
Um, but it serves them well.

952
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,213
It's essentially
been one big prank.

953
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,215
We've always pretended
we were something we weren't,

954
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,967
now that we're huge
and have a lot of money,

955
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:27,761
we're trying to pretend
that we're small and Indie

956
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:28,845
and have street cred.

957
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,556
That's one of the great things
about a lot of the bands here

958
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:33,224
that, you know, great humor,

959
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:34,809
you know?

960
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,817
It's why I'm obviously
not from here.

961
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:40,982
One of my favorite hoaxes

962
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,193
was the lexicon of grunge.

963
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,320
The New York Times
called Sub Pop records

964
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:49,783
and talked to a woman there who
just started making up words,

965
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:52,077
they were trying to find out
what the inside secret dope was.

966
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,454
"What was the,
uh, the hip language?"

967
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,623
...and I was like, "Uh,
why don't you give me a word

968
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,001
and I'll give you
the grunge slang for it?"

969
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:01,961
She just
started making stuff up.

970
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:04,172
A lot of it was kind of stuff
that she used for herself,

971
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:06,007
just for laughs,
and next thing you know,

972
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:07,634
it's on the cover
of the New York Times

973
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,928
and everybody around here was
just giggling and snorting...

974
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:12,138
If they're lame
enough to try to scrutinize

975
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:17,102
this totally stupid thing,
why not fuck with them?

As you can see...

982
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,015
I am basically...

983
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:58,685
a trendsetter
in the fashion scene

984
00:57:58,852 --> 00:57:59,936
and Rolling Stone called

985
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,856
and they were doing
a fashion spread on

986
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:04,774
"What the Indies are wearing".

987
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,985
I had to tell them that, uh,

988
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:08,361
I didn't think
they'd be interested in me

989
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,863
but that we had a fella here,

990
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:11,614
Scott McCaughey
from The Young Fresh Fellows,

991
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:14,868
who probably was just what
they were looking for, so, uh,

992
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,203
they came and they
interviewed Scott briefly,

993
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,498
and then got out this pile
of clothes and made him, like,

994
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:23,334
take off his Converse
and put on their tennis shoes,

995
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:27,630
and take off his flannel shirt,
wear their flannel shirt.

996
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,800
And then put, you know,
in the caption below:

997
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:32,510
"Flannel shirt 85 dollars."

998
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,152
Who didn't get
a flannel shirt for Christmas

999
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:50,612
from their relatives?

1000
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,155
And you tie it
around your waist

1001
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:54,073
and you run off
and do a stage dive,

1002
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:55,909
all across America.

1003
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:59,245
But up here,
because it's logger territory,

1004
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:02,624
all these goon balls
just wear flannel anyways

1005
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,959
and then that's what
became the stereotype here.

1006
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:10,548
I mean, you go around,
you know, cities everywhere

1007
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:13,760
you see some real
stereotypical grungies,

1008
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,428
you know, the Pearl Jam shirt,

1009
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,889
you know,
with the stocking cap and the...

1010
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:21,017
you know, the really
long johns with the shorts

1011
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:23,019
and then, and you just say
"I spit on you!"

1012
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,914
Mannequins in stores with,
like, long johns and shorts

1013
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:45,208
for like 300 bucks and...

1014
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,960
- It's like...
- We got them fooled.

1015
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:49,087
We wear long johns up here
because it's fucking cold.

1016
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:51,464
When Seventh Avenue decided

1017
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:55,843
that grunge-wear was something
they put on the runways

1018
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,222
and that they thought it
would be an absolute knock-over.

1019
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:02,475
Yes, that any of my clients
would be in their fashion shows

1020
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,269
and be in their fashion layouts

1021
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:07,188
and when Vanity Fair
did a spread with people

1022
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:09,566
like Joan Rivers wearing
grunge-wear...

1023
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:13,987
that was the only moment for me,
so far,

1024
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,447
That came close to unbearable.

1025
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:17,907
It was our thing

1026
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:19,617
and then all of a sudden
belonged to people who...

1027
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,122
You never thought you were
sharing your music with.

1028
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:27,709
Like mainstream periodicals
and fashion magazines

1029
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,168
and I started realizing

1030
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,004
"Well, there's a whole lot
of people out there

1031
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,716
making money by selling
the idea of the Seattle scene

1032
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:35,842
or grunge or whatever.

1033
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,635
It's so profitable.

1034
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:39,929
It's so profitable,
and they'll just keep taking

1035
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,723
and taking and taking
and they're...

1036
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,059
they just don't know
how to restrain themselves,

1037
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,021
you know, they're frothing
at the mouth over this.

1038
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,356
And the bands aren't, I mean,

1039
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,442
the bands aren't
really in it for dough,

1040
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:55,570
I mean, they just aren't.
That would, if they were,

1041
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:57,864
that would...
That would tip over the music.

1042
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,033
It's like it already,
it's obvious to see

1043
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:03,411
the Seattle scene has become
a marketed commodity.

1044
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:06,039
...but that's what
makes pop culture

1045
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:10,543
so significant to all
the little consumers out there.

1046
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:14,213
They have no interest in history
or economics or science or art.

1047
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:17,050
They're kinda interested
more in gossip,

1048
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:18,968
the nature of celebrity

1049
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:22,889
and that's not at all
encouraging to find out that...

1050
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:29,937
You participate in that
society. One way or the other.

1059
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:51,144
Bands get all big and then
everybody starts to like 'em

1060
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:56,482
and then they just become so
overplayed and kinda sold out

1061
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:58,192
and I just, I get out of them.

1062
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:02,780
That really pisses me off.
Well, I liked them first!

1063
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,907
When you hear a song
that's a great song,

1064
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,993
played a million times,
you never want to hear it again.

1065
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:11,998
"If I hear that song
one more time..."

1066
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,876
"If I see that guy's
face one more time..."

1067
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,586
I wanna fuckin' find out
his address

1068
01:03:16,753 --> 01:03:18,045
and kill that motherfucker."

1069
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:22,800
I don't blame 'em.
I've said it myself.

1070
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,970
There definitely is the idea
that success is bad

1071
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,513
and that's part
of the rebellion,

1072
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,515
that's part of the
rebellion against...

1073
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:33,936
against the '80s, you know,
um, our peers and our parents,

1074
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:37,482
that didn't really
wanna become successful

1075
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:40,902
because with that comes the
trappings of responsibility.

1076
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,904
Its seemed for a while that,
like, that "celebrity"

1077
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,906
was not really
what you wanted once you got it

1078
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,449
and yet, you look at
any of these people,

1079
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:48,242
that are now
complaining about

1080
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:49,869
being too much in the spotlight

1081
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:51,871
or always, you know,
scrutinized by everyone.

1082
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,874
What did
you expect, you know?

1083
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,959
I think a lot of people
whine about it

1084
01:03:57,126 --> 01:04:01,380
but secretly they kind of
are excited about it too.

1085
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:04,884
I don't think that
people ever can imagine

1086
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:07,220
what is gonna go along
with being popular,

1087
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:09,889
I mean, I don't think no matter
what somebody tells you,

1088
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:11,307
it's gonna be like,

1089
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:13,643
I think it's a lot different
once you get there.

1090
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:16,687
I think so too,
maybe we should try to find out.

forefront of our mind,

we knew that these were things
that went along with the job.

1117
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,700
We never really, really can

You have a favorite band, right,

1125
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:11,297
and you think
"Why isn't this band enormous",

1126
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:12,965
you know,
the world is just not a very,

1127
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:14,800
you know,
it's just an unjust place,

1128
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,178
and then you have
a band you know is amazing,

1129
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,346
and suddenly
everybody else in the world

1130
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,432
knows that they're amazing
and wants to get at them

1131
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,601
and write about them,
and you know...

1132
01:08:24,894 --> 01:08:26,937
You start wondering if success
is really a good thing

1133
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,148
because it,
it sort of makes people psycho.

1134
01:08:29,315 --> 01:08:30,816
It's nothing to strive for.

1135
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:33,903
It's actually like...
this kind of success

1136
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,197
or trying to fulfill
this kind of hype,

1137
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,990
it can destroy everything.

1138
01:08:38,157 --> 01:08:40,534
It can destroy what's real,
which is like music to you,

1139
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,162
or what's real,
which is your life,

1140
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:45,206
you know, it can destroy it...

1141
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:49,877
You know, it can make it
a commodity.

1142
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:54,882
At who's cost? At yours.

1143
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:58,260
At your life
and you know, your music.

take it all
away from you.

1146

When you're
in a band and it progresses

1166
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,765
from being in the basement,
learning how to play,

1167
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:28,851
and then you go on
to more and more steps

1168
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:30,519
and that's a natural
progression of a band

1169
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,479
and you can see that
that's a good thing,

1170
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:33,939
it's all fine,

1171
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,358
but then you get to this point
where you're looking backwards

1172
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:38,152
and you're like, well,
maybe it was better back then.

1173
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:39,528
Well imagine,

1174
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:42,031
you're a band,
you're making music for fun...

1175
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,824
because you
like writing your own songs,

1176
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:45,701
you like playing
your own songs,

1177
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:48,329
you like playing to your
friends and having them clap

1178
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:49,997
and, you know,
having a good time,

1179
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:51,624
and getting up
and jumping around on stage

1180
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,500
and, you know,
crashing into people,

1181
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,128
and um, suddenly,
every publication

1182
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:59,298
and all the media in the world
wants to get at you,

1183
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:01,091
suddenly,
people everywhere you go

1184
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,843
recognize you,
they want your autograph,

1185
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,387
suddenly your life as a
private individual is over with.

1186
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:10,809
And that's probably a pretty
heavy thing to deal with.

1187
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,102
What it looks like is,

1188
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:15,105
wow, if you wanna be
really successful, do heroin

1189
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:17,107
but what I see is,

1190
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,984
I saw people who were
making really good music,

1191
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:22,279
suddenly have like this
overwhelming need for money.

1192
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:25,324
It's
fucking heartbreaking to see

1193
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:26,825
how disillusioned...

1194
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,621
People get to where they...

1195
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:37,503
that escape is so...
sought after.

1196
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,963
I think
the first hint of it

1197
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:40,464
was when Andy Wood died.

1198
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:42,675
We started thinking,
"This is really sad

1199
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:44,927
because this guy had a great
future in front of him,

1200
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:47,513
he was a really
wonderful guy, funniest guy.

1201
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:51,767
The only rock and roll
stand-up comic in Seattle

1202
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:53,852
was Andy Wood, and, uh...

1203
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:56,689
we thought, man, you know,

1204
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:57,982
they haven't even
become stars yet,

1205
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,608
and already he's a casualty.

1206
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:04,154
Kurt, on New Year's Day, '93.

1207
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,491
Um, this was the shoot
for the cover of The Advocate

1208
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:10,494
and, uh, I really
like this photo of Kurt,

1209
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,621
we were just, we were just
talking and...

1210
01:12:12,788 --> 01:12:15,124
and I was just picking
the camera up occasionally

1211
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,959
and photographing him.

1212
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:19,545
It's rare
to see a picture where he's,

1213
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:23,090
he's emoting or doing
something with his hands

1214
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:26,719
other than in his pocket
and I really like this one.

1215
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:49,783
Symbolically, perhaps,

1216
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,785
it represented
the death of something.

1217
01:12:51,985 --> 01:12:54,121
I mean, I know when, I was...

1218
01:12:54,288 --> 01:12:57,041
it affected me in such a way
that I was seriously tempted

1219
01:12:57,207 --> 01:12:59,585
to give up everything
and go be a farmer or something.

1220
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:02,254
It was just,
it was so disillusioning to me.

1221
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,675
It was hard,
I didn't take it well.

1222
01:14:05,943 --> 01:14:07,486
If all this influence

1223
01:14:07,653 --> 01:14:09,655
that this part
of the country has

1224
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:11,240
and this musical scene has,

1225
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:12,908
if it doesn't do
anything with it,

1226
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:15,119
that would be the tragedy.

1227
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:17,454
If it doesn't
do something with it

1228
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:18,997
like make some kind of change

1229
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:20,457
and make
some kind of difference,

1230
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,876
this group of people
who feels this certain way

1231
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:25,921
this group of people who,
like, thinks these things

1232
01:14:26,088 --> 01:14:29,299
that the underdogs we've all
met and lived with think...

1233
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,093
if they'd finally
get to the forefront

1234
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,594
and nothing comes of it,

1235
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:35,681
that would be the tragedy.

To actually
be this close

1251
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:03,060
to a pop culture explosion
has been really fascinating.

1252
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:05,354
I mean also, when you can
understand what happened

1253
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:07,648
in San Francisco in '66 and '67,
you can understand what happened

1254
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,149
in England
during the punk thing

1255
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:11,735
and in during
the Mersey Beat era

1256
01:16:11,944 --> 01:16:14,238
and the subsequent stuff
that happened in London,

1257
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:15,572
I mean, all of a sudden,

1258
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:18,742
you can see how ridiculous
the whole God damn thing is,

1259
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:20,869
I mean,
it's utterly absurd, I mean...

1260
01:16:21,662 --> 01:16:22,996
It's so funny that they call it

1261
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:26,375
the Seattle scene, because
it all grew out of the region.

1262
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,628
Everybody doing what they love
because they love it.

1263
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:31,463
It doesn't matter
if they're from Bellingham,

1264
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,465
Portland, Olympia,

1265
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,425
you have people who are in bands

1266
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:37,094
because they want
to be in bands,

1267
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:40,097
who started record labels cause
they like their friends' bands

1268
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:42,558
and they want to put out
a rack of fanzines

1269
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:45,477
because no one was covering the
kind of music that they heard

1270
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:47,479
and all this was allowed to grow

1271
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:50,649
without any other force
coming in and disturbing that.

I didn't think I would be

1289
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,131
making a living at doing this.

1290
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,760
I mean, I had no idea that these
bands were going to become so,

1291
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:01,762
so popular, so famous.

1292
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,306
I would have taken
a lot more photographs of them

1293
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:05,724
if I'd have known.

1294
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,976
Our first year's tour
was a total failure, you know,

1295
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:09,311
we didn't make
more than 90 bucks

1296
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:10,812
at any show in the whole US.

1297
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:12,606
And I'm just like, they hated us
everywhere we went.

1298
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,317
We're doing basically the
same thing we were doing in '85

1299
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,611
and now people like us.
I don't know why.

1300
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,780
Let me put things
in perspective for you.

1301
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:20,947
Five years ago,

1302
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:23,367
this was a sleepy
little coastal fishing village,

1303
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,662
now, could we have the camera
pan out to the skyline here,

1304
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,165
this kind of economic
development is directly related

1305
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:32,626
to what Jon and I
have done to promote Seattle.

1306
01:18:33,377 --> 01:18:35,837
That's what's become of the
great punk rock party house

1307
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:37,422
of the mid '80s.

1308
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:39,132
It's so harsh.

1309
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:41,426
It used to be this tiny
little shack, like, set way back

1310
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:43,303
and these terrible, like,
big weeds

1311
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,389
in the middle of this,
these beautiful homes.

1312
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:49,017
And now look,
it is a beautiful home.

1313
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,986
I would love to,
in about 20 years from now,

1314
01:18:51,186 --> 01:18:54,648
be playing in, like, uh, some kind
of super-lounge-y soul band

1315
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,900
with a horn section or
something like that, you know?

1316
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,070
Yeah, probably all
be playing in R&B bands

1317
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:01,279
in Pioneer Square.

1318
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:02,864
Probably the same...

1319
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,075
Probably the same R&B band
on Pioneer Square.

1320
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,369
♪ This is the... ♪

1321
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:10,414
Wow, what did I do right
in a past life, or whatever,

1322
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,915
that I get to do this

1323
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:13,834
with my three
really good friends?

1324
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,293
I get to be in a band,

1325
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,628
and make music
with these people,

1326
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:17,713
it's a really
incredible experience.

1327
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:21,717
We just play music
when we can and do shows

1328
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,927
and record them.
We have songs...

1329
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:26,346
Every now and then we find out
Seattle got really famous.

1330
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:27,973
And we didn't

1331
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,474
It's not too bad, it's okay.

1332
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:42,167
What was the question?
