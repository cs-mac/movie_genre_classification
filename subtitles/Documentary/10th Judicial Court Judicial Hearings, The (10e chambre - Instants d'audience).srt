3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,800
    I'M WISHING ON A DREAM     

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,000
   TO FOLLOW WHAT IT MEANS     

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,700

        THAT I'VE SEEN         

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,300
    I WISH ON ALL THE PEOPLE   
       WHO REALLY DREAM        

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,200
    I'M WISHING ON A STAR      

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,500
   TO FOLLOW WHERE YOU ARE.    

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,700
             Girl:              
 MY NAME IS VIRGINIA AND I LIVE 
   ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST.   

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,100
        ( chuckling ):          
         WELL, KIND OF.         

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,700
       MY DAD'S A JANITOR.      

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
        THAT'S HOW WE GOT       
      TO HAVE AN APARTMENT      

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
  ON THE EDGE OF CENTRAL PARK.  

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,600
       AND YOU MIGHT THINK      
          THAT THE FACT         

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
  THAT I STILL LIVE WITH MY DAD 
       IS A BIT SAD AND...      

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,400
   WELL, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT...  

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
              OH!               

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,200
       BUT, I DON'T KNOW,       
    I'M ALL HE'S GOT, REALLY    

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
   AND I'M SORT OF PERMANENTLY  

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100
       BETWEEN BOYFRIENDS       
         AT THE MOMENT.         

22
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
         SO, YOU KNOW...        

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,500
       I'M JUST A WAITRESS      
    AT THE GRILL ON THE PARK    

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
     BUT ONE DAY, I'M GOING     
        TO FIND A PARTNER       

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,200
      AND OPEN A RESTAURANT     
           OF MY OWN.           

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
     ALL I NEED'S A GOOD MAN    
    WHO'S INTERESTED IN FOOD.   

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
            DID YOU SEE THIS?   

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,500
                    THIS HAS    
                    BEEN CHEWED.

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
                IT'S NOT MY JOB.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
 THIS IS AN ELECTRICIAN'S JOB,  
     BUT WHO GETS TO DO IT?     

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,100
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?            

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,800
            TO WORK, DAD, LIKE  
            I DO EVERY DAY.     

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,100
OH. UH, ON THE WAY BACK...      

34
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,700
USE THE STAIRS.                 

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
JUST IN CASE.                   

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
       ( cawing loudly )        

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,200
          WHO'S THERE?          

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
SO, WHERE EXACTLY ARE WE GOING? 

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
 TO BEANTOWN, IN THE SOUTHWEST  
 CORNER OF YOUR KINGDOM, SIR.   

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
        YOU'RE ACCEPTING        

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
THE THRONE THAT                 
THE CRAFTSMAN THERE             

42
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000

YOUR CORONATION.                

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
   WELL, IS IT MUCH FURTHER?    

44
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,200
         CAN'T WE STOP          
  AND GO HUNTING OR SOMETHING?  

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,400
VERY SHORTLY,                   
SIR.                            

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
   WE MUST MAKE A BRIEF STOP    

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,300
       AT THE SNOW WHITE        
       MEMORIAL PRISON.         

48
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
           ( sighs )            

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
 I HATE THESE OUTER PROVINCES.  

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,600
   THE PEOPLE ARE SO COMMON.    

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,700
        YOUR STEPMOTHER         
  HAS APPLIED FOR PAROLE AGAIN  

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
   WHICH WE WILL, OF COURSE,    
           TURN DOWN.           

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,800
             OH...              

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
IT'S SIMPLY A ROUTINE           
COURTESY VISIT.                 

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
            STOP IT!            

56
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,200
        YOU'RE PATHETIC.        

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
    CALL YOURSELVES TROLLS?     

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,700
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED.            

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
          SORRY, DAD.           

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
          SORRY, DAD.           

61
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,100
     IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.     

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
     THIS IS THE LAST TIME      
     I COME AND RESCUE YOU.     

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
                DAD, TAKE OFF   
                THE MAGIC SHOES.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
       I CAN HANDLE THEM.       

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
          ( groaning )          

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,700
Father:

STARTING TO THINK?

OF PEOPLE                       

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,400

71
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,600

TEN, 15 YEARS TOPS              

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
THIS COUNTRY IS FINISHED        
AS A DEMOCRACY.                 

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,300
   AS A CARING SOCIETY, WHERE   
PEOPLE DO THINGS FOR EACH OTHER 

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
   WE'RE DONE, WE'RE FINISHED   

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
WE ARE OUT                      
OF HERE.                        

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
       YOUR BARBECUE RIBS

79
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200

                FIXED IT.       

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200

                EVERYBODY CRAZY.

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600

                IN THE PIPES.   

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,700

            CARPET TREATMENT.

TO BE IN HERE!                  

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,900

EVER ALLOWED IN THERE.          

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
THIS IS WHERE                   
THEY KEEP THE QUEEN.            

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,600
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

NO, DAD, DAD, PLEASE.           

121
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,700
THIS COULD BE A TRAP.           

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,100
                    DAD, DON'T.

133
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
DID THAT HURT?                  

134

        I GET THE FIRST SHOT.   

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
                YOU WERE FIRST  
                LAST TIME.      

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,100
I ALWAYS GET THE FIRST...       

140
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300

   FROM YOUR CASTLE, WENDELL.   

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD              
HAVE STAYED THERE.              

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,900

     YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.     

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
                ON THE CONTRARY.

146
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,400
     I THINK THAT YOU WILL      
    BEG AT MY FEET FOR FOOD.    

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,600

                WHAT THIS IS?

            SPECIAL KIND OF DOG.

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
        THIS IS A MAGICAL DOG.

HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.        

163
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
                HE CAN'T ESCAPE.

164
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
            WE'RE IN A PRISON.

       JUST THE WAY IT IS.

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,900
            IN A MONTH, I WILL  
            HAVE CRUSHED THE    
            HOUSE OF WHITE.     

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,900
  I WILL HAVE WENDELL'S CASTLE  
        AND HIS KINGDOM         

233
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
  AND FOR HELPING ME TO ESCAPE  

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,200
 YOU MAY HAVE HALF HIS KINGDOM  
            TO RULE.            

235
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,000
   HALF THE FOURTH KINGDOM--    
         BUT IT'S HUGE.         

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?               

237
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?           

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
        SIMPLY ALLOW ME THE USE 
        OF YOUR CHILDREN        

239
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
        UNTIL THEY'VE CAPTURED  
        THE PRINCE FOR ME.      

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
THAT'S ALL?                     

241
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,900
        TELL NO ONE WHAT        
        YOU'VE SEEN, OF COURSE. 

242
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
     DO I GET TO CHOOSE...      

243
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,800
   WHICH HALF OF THE KINGDOM    
            I WANT?

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
WHERE'S YOUR MASTER?            

251
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,400
HOW COME YOU                    
DON'T HAVE A COLLAR?            

252
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500

596
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
         ( whooshing )          

597
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
          IS THIS HER?          

598
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,400
THIS CAN'T BE HER.              

599
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
       WHAT DO YOU MEAN?        

600
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
            OH, SHE'S SUCCULENT!

601
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,100
  WHAT A DREAMY, CREAMY GIRL!   

602
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,400
         ( whimpering )         

603
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
         ( whimpering )         

604
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,900
          ( howling )           

605
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,600
                ( fiercely ):   
                TASTY, OR WHAT? 

606
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,300
 ( all grunting rhythmically )  

607
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,200
        ( all yelling )         

608
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,800
       ( fierce yelling )       

609
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
       ( exhausted sigh )       

610
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
I'VE BEEN THINKING              
BACK OVER THE YEARS             

611
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,500
AND I FEEL THIS IS QUITE        
THE WORST SPELL WE HAVE         
EVER BEEN PUT UNDER!            

612
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,000
         WE'VE HAD SOME STINKERS
         BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS. 

613
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
 SHE'S A POWERFUL LITTLE WITCH, 
           THAT ONE.            

614
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,900
           I THINK...           
   WE MIGHT BE IN HER POCKET.   

615
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
                    HMM?        

616
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
                    WHAT?       

617
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,900
    I THINK                     

618
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,700
    SHE MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK US    
    AND PUT US IN A MATCHBOX    

619
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,800
         IN HER POCKET.         

620
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,700
              THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

621
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,500
                  YOU'RE FALLING
                  TO PIECES.    

622
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
    GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.     

623
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
  HOW CAN WE BE IN A MATCHBOX,  
           YOU IDIOT?           

624
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,900
   WHERE ARE ALL THE MATCHES?   

625
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
       ( soft boinging )        

626
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,300
WHAT THE HELL'S IT DOING?       

627
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,900
              SIX... BIG WISHES.

628
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
         IMAGINE HAVING ANYTHING

629
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
                     YOU DESIRE.

630
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
        AND FROM THE LOOK OF    
        YOUR MODEST SURROUNDINGS

631
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,100
           I'M SURE THERE       
           ARE MANY THINGS THAT 
           YOU'D LOVE TO CHANGE.

632
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,800
        I... OH...              

633
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,300
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULD...      

634
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,200
    UH... JUST GET THE HELL     
      OUT OF MY APARTMENT       

635
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
ALL RIGHT?                      
                    ( growls )  

636
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,200
WELL...                         

637
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
    THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?      
                    NO! NO...   

638
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,900
        IT'S A STANDARD         
     MULTIPLE-WISHES DEAL--     

639
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,100
   SIX WISHES; NO GOING BACK    
      ON WISHES ONCE MADE;      

640
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,800
   NO MAKING FIVE WISHES AND    
 WISHING FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND.  

641
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
         NOW, COME ON,          
      IS THAT A FAIR DEAL       

642
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,900
                        OR WHAT?

643
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
                          NOW...

644
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,800
      WHERE... IS YOUR...       
        LOVELY DAUGHTER?        

645
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
   WHAT DO YOU WANT HER FOR?    

646
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,600
       SIMPLY TO RECLAIM        
        MY LITTLE DOGGY         

647
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,900
    WHICH SHE FOUND EARLIER.    

648
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
              DOG?              

649
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
 THERE'S EVEN A REWARD INVOLVED 

650
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,600
         WHICH I INTEND         
    TO GIVE HER PERSONALLY.     

651
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,800
                       ( sighs )

652
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
IF SHE'S NOT AT WORK            

653
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,800
SHE'LL BE                       
AT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S.          
                            OOH.

654
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,900
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING             
TO TURN VIRGINIA AGAINST ME.    

655
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
         DOES THIS MOTHER-IN-LAW
         LIKE, UH, FLOWERS?     

656
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
SHE LIKES MONEY.                

657
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
     THAT'S THE ONLY THING      
      THAT IMPRESSES HER.       

658
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,200
                ADDRESS, PLEASE.

659
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,600
           IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

660
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,800
                    WAIT. HOLD  
                    ON A SECOND.

661
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,300
              HOW LONG DOES THIS
              TAKE TO WORK?     

662
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,000
       OH, DON'T WORRY--        
    THE FIRST THREE HOURS...    

663
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,800
         ARE THE WORST.         

664
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,200
           ( sighs )

667
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
             OOH...

       FOR A MOMENT THERE       

681
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
 I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR MOTHER.

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,200
        WELL, I'M SORRY         
       TO DISAPPOINT YOU.       

684
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,700
         WOULD YOU MIND         
 IF I STAYED THE NIGHT TONIGHT? 

685

           YOU KNOW,            
   SHE'LL COME BACK ONE DAY.    

686
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,200

    SWAN IN WITHOUT A WORD.     

687
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,100
        YOU DON'T THINK         
 SHE COULD BE IN ASPEN, DO YOU? 

688
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
                 SHE ALWAYS

     I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE     
       COME BACK BY NOW.        

691
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,000
     I DON'T KNOW, 14 YEARS     
 IS A LONG TIME FOR APRES-SKI.  

692
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,100

    HE'S PROBABLY GOT FLEAS.    

699
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,800
                   AW, YOU DON'T
                   HAVE FLEAS.  

700
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,100
                 DO YOU HAVE    
                 FLEAS? NO. SHH.

701
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,400
                            SHH.

702
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,400
       ( Roland barking )       

703
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
                    THANKS.     
YOU KNOW                        

704
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,500
YOU COULD STILL BE SOMETHING    
IN SOCIETY, VIRGINIA.           

705
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
I HAVE CONNECTIONS, YOU KNOW.   

706
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,200
YOUR MOTHER'S DEBUT             
AT THE RITZ CARLTON             

707
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,600
          WAS... AH...          

708
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,100
         A CORONATION.          

709
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,700
AT NINETEEN                     

710
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,800
SHE COULD HAVE HAD ANY BACHELOR 
  IN THE WHOLE OF NEW YORK...   

711
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,900
 AND WHAT DOES SHE END UP WITH? 

712
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
                    DAD.        

713
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,700
            DAD.                

714
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,100
DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE      
THE WAY SHE DID, VIRGINIA.      

715
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,300
   I CAN SEE THE WHOLE THING    
   HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN.    

716
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,900
YOU'RE A WAITRESS,              
FOR GOD'S SAKES.                

717
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WHO ARE YOU GOING               
TO MEET?                        

718
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,900
       SOME... ELIGIBLE         
       SHORT-ORDER COOK?        

719
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,400
     ( Virginia laughing )      

720
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,000
                    NO.         

721
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
      ( knocking on door )      

722
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,700
      ( knocking louder )       

723
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,500
      UH... SO, OF COURSE       

724
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,000
   YOU NEVER FIXED THE PIPES    
      LIKE YOU PROMISED--       

725
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,500
   THAT I'VE COME TO EXPECT--   

726
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,500
                       BUT THIS!

727
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,900
      I CAN, UM... THIS...      

728
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,000
   I CAN EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS,   
      AND I'M GOING TO...       

729
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,900
I'LL GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY,      
        MR. MURRAY.             
                            NO. 

730
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
    "I'M GOING TO GET ON IT"    
      IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.       

731
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,800
  I WANT YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER  
  OUT OF THIS APARTMENT TODAY!  

732
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,600
                   YOU'RE FIRED!

733
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,700
         FIRE... FIRED?         
   NO, PLEASE, MR. MURRAY...    

734
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,100
      WHAT, YOU BIG JERK?       

735
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,500
             I WISH             
   YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY   

736
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,400
       WOULD KISS MY ASS        

737
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
AND BE MY SLAVES                
FOREVER.                        

738
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,100
     WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?     

739
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,600
          OH, MASTER.           

740
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
    ( short laugh )             

741
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
             Burly:             
      HOW LONG DO YOU THINK     
      THIS SPELL WILL LAST?     

742
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
IT CAN'T LAST LONG.             

743
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
                    100 YEARS?  

744
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
            AT MOST.            

745
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
         MAYBE ONLY 50.         

746
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,800
                WELL, WE'LL JUST
                HAVE TO MAKE    

747
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
 THE MOST OF OUR IMPRISONMENT.  

748
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
      AND AGREE NOT TO EAT      

749
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,100
                    EACH OTHER. 

750
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
ABSOLUTELY.                     
ABSOLUTELY.                     

751
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,800
WE'LL DO                        
THE HUNDRED YEARS               

752
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,500
AND MAYBE IF WE'RE LUCKY        

753
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,900
WE'LL ONLY HAVE TO DO           
TWO-THIRDS OF THE SPELL         

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
AND GET OUT EARLY.              

755
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,600
       ( doorbell rings )       

756
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
    ( gasps )                   

757
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,100
              OH.               

758
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
       I... THERE MUST BE       
         SOME MISTAKE.          

759
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,300
        I DO APOLOGIZE.         

760
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,100
       I WAS LOOKING FOR        
    VIRGINIA'S GRANDMOTHER.     

761
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,900
           I AM SHE.            

762
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,700
        THAT CANNOT BE.         

763
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
HER YOUNG SISTER, PERHAPS.      

764
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
    HER MOTHER                  

765
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
PERHAPS.                        

766
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
BUT HER GRANDMOTHER?            

767
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,100
    PAH!                        

768
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,000
    YOU ARE A...                

769
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
DAZZLING BEAUTY.                

770
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,700
                    OH.         

771
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,600
            WELL, I, I DON'T    
            HAVE MY MAKEUP ON   

772
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
                OR ANYTHING YET.

773
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
MAY I COME IN?                  

774
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,800
I HAVE FLOWERS.                 

775
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
        YEAH, BUT WHO ARE YOU?  

776
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,300
I AM VIRGINIA'S SUITOR.         

777
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,700
HER BETROTHED.                  

778
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
                BETROTHED?      

779
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,900
        SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
        ABOUT A FIANCE.         

780
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
HOW LIKE HER.                   
HOW MODEST.                     

781
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,200
MOST GIRLS WOULD                
BRAG AND BOAST                  

782
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
ABOUT DATING THE HEIR           
TO AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE          

783
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,300
BUT NOT VIRGINIA.               

784
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,600
        OH, WELL, DO COME IN.   

785
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,800
            I'LL, I'LL JUST GO  
            AND GET DRESSED.    

786
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
OF COURSE.                      

787
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
          GET DRESSED.          

788
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,000
          ( humming )           

789
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,100
   OKAY, WISH MASTER, GIVE ME   
 A NEVER-ENDING SUPPLY OF BEER. 

790
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
              TWO?              

791
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,900
   YOU CALL THAT A WILD NIGHT   
      WHERE YOU COME FROM?      

792
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
              OH!               

793
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,500
    HEY, OH, MURRAY! MURRAY!    

794
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,300
                MURRAY! YOU GOT 
                TO SEE THIS.    

795
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,000
       THE REFRIGERATOR,        
      IT JUST KEEPS GO...       

796
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?       

797
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,700
   I'M WORRIED THAT THEY'RE     
   NOT CLEAN ENOUGH, MASTER.    

798
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,400
 SHALL I LICK YOUR SHOES AGAIN? 

799
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
    LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE.     

800
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
           ALL RIGHT,           
       FIVE MORE MINUTES.       

801
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER COMING       
WITH THAT DOOR?                 

802
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,700
            OH, UH... AL-ALMOST 
            DONE NOW, MASTER.   

803
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
                JUST HURRY...   

804
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,000
                STOP. NO, NO.   

805
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,800
        ONCE WAS ENOUGH.        

806
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,900
                HERE. OPEN THIS.

807
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,600
WHAT SHALL I WISH FOR           

808
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
                    NEXT?       

809
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
           I WISH...            

810
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,600
     I WISH I HAD SOMETHING     
THAT WOULD CLEAN THIS APARTMENT 

811
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,400
ALL BY ITSELF, AND I WOULD NEVER
     HAVE TO LIFT A FINGER.     

812
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,900
          ( whirring )          

813
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
        OH, HERE WE GO.         

814
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
          ( gasping )           

815
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,900
          ( laughing )          

816

        HUSBAND'S 40th BIRTHDAY

 I, UM, I THINK THERE MIGHT BE  
SOMEONE TRAPPED IN THE ELEVATOR.

947
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,400

00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,000
        THEY WERE BOTH ENORMOUS.

1052
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,300
   THEY COULDN'T STOP EATING.   

1053
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,900
     EVERY DAY I CAME HOME      
          FROM SCHOOL           

1054
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,700
  IT WAS, "EAT THIS. EAT THAT.  
           EAT HER!"            

1055
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,300
 YOU SHOULDN'T PUNISH YOURSELF. 

1056
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,600
    OH, I SHOULD. I SHOULD.     

1057
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,700
      I'M BAD. I'M SO BAD.      

1058
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,300
 I'VE DONE SO MANY BAD THINGS!  

1059
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,700
  BUT THAT WASN'T ME, YOU SEE?  

1060
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,300
  THAT WAS WHEN I WAS A WOLF.   

1061
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,300
        DOC, I WANT TO CHANGE!  

1062
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,100
                I WANT TO BE    
                A GOOD PERSON.  

1063
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
        OH, CAN'T THE LION      
        CUDDLE UP WITH THE LAMB?

1064
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,300
        CAN'T THE LEOPARD       
        RUB OUT ALL ITS SPOTS?  

1065
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,100
THIS IS THE EXACT SPOT          
WHERE I FOUND YOU               

1066
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,700
SO THIS IS REALLY               
WHERE WE HAVE TO GO             

1067
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,300
OUR SEPARATE WAYS, OKAY?        

1068
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,300
( sighs )                       

1069
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,600
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ADVENTURE     
TYPE, YOU KNOW?                 

1070
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,100
I MEAN, I'M A WAITRESS.         

1071
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
THIS JUST REALLY...             

1072
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
THIS ISN'T MY THING.            

1073
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,800
WHOEVER THESE PEOPLE ARE        
WHO WANT YOU                    

1074
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,300
THEY CAN HAVE YOU.              

1075
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,400
NO, I GOT TO GO.                

1076
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
        GOOD-BYE. I GOT TO GO.  

1077
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,600
           ( whines )           

1078
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,200
            HERE IS THE READING 
            LIST I STRONGLY     
            RECOMMEND NOW.      

1079
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
    OKAY.                       

1080
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,600
        WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK 
        AND SEE ME NEXT WEEK?   

1081
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,200
OH, BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.   

1082
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,700
I WON'T BE HERE NEXT WEEK.      

1083
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,900
                UH, UH, UH, UH. 

1084
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,100
                YOU'RE NOT GOING

1085
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,400
                TO INTIMIDATE ME
                WITH SUICIDE.   

1086
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,900
                THAT'S BETTER.  

1087
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
    OKAY.                       

1088
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
           Policeman:           
        IF YOU COOPERATE        

1089
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,900
AND GIVE US                     
THE DEALER'S NAME               

1090
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,800
MAYBE I'LL PUT IN               
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.            

1091
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
        "DEALER"? WHAT DEALER?  
        I'M NOT TAKING DRUGS.   

1092
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,100
            YEAH, RIGHT.        
            YOU DON'T REMEMBER  
            STEALING THE MONEY  

1093
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,700
            BECAUSE YOU WERE    
            UNDER THE INFLUENCE 

1094
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,200
            OF THESE MAGIC      
            MUSHROOMS, RIGHT?   

1095

       "MAGIC MUSHROOMS"?       

1096
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
      NO, I DIDN'T TAKE...      

1097
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,900
       WELL, I SWALLOWED        
       THE BEAN, BUT...         

1098
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
         I ALMOST FIXED         
   THE ELEVATOR NOW, MASTER.

       WE'RE GOING DOWN.

      IS THAT GOOD OR BAD?      

1112

     WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER      
        THE UNDERWORLD.

            DAD, I DON'T THINK  
            HE IS A DOG.        

1167
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,600
                HE'S TRYING     
                TO SAY SOMETHING

1168
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,800
TALK TO ME OR SOMETHING         

1169
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,900
BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND          
WHAT HE'S SAYING.               

1170
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
TRYING TO TALK?                 

1171
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,300
            YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. 

1172
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,900
ALL RIGHT,                      
YOU WATCH THIS.                 

1173
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,400
I WISH THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND  
EVERYTHING THIS DOG IS SAYING.  

1174
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
                        WHAT?   

1175
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,200
   YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER.   

1176
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
                    BOTH OF YOU.

1177
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,100
IT WORKED.                      
IT WORKED!                      

1178
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
                    IF YOU VALUE
                    YOUR LIFE   

1179
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,400
YOU HAVE TO DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

1180
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
LISTEN! SHH. WHAT?              

1181
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
 WE HAVE TO FIND THE WAY BACK.  

1182
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,100
HE'S TALKING.                   
CAN'T YOU HEAR HIM?             

1183
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,100
                            NO. 

1184
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,900
( police voices coming closer ) 

1185
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,900
    COME HERE.                  
                        WHAT?!  

1186
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,800
        ( all yelling )         

1187
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,600
            WHY ARE ALL THESE   
            COPS AFTER YOU?     

1188
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,400
            AND WHY ARE YOU     
            WEARING HANDCUFFS?  

1189
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,900
THEY THINK I DID                
A BANK JOB.                     

1190
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,900
                        WHAT?   

1191
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,400
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.             

1192
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,300
         STOP RABBITING         
  AND HELP ME FIND THE MIRROR.  

1193
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,700
            NOW, IT'S A MIRROR  

1194
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,400
            BUT IT MAY NOT      
            LOOK LIKE A MIRROR  
            FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

1195
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,200
        YOU HAVE TO LOOK        
        VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.   

1196
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,900
            WE'RE LOOKING       
            FOR A MAGIC MIRROR. 

1197
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,600
YEAH, OF COURSE WE ARE.         

1198
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,300
   ( Prince Wendell barking )   

1199
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,600
JUST LOOK FOR A PIECE OF FOREST 

1200
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,000
            THAT DOESN'T FIT.   

1201
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
    I'M SURE THIS IS WHERE...   

1202
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,800
             LOOK.              

1203
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,000
                    THERE IT IS.

1204
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,700
Tony:                           
THAT'S WEIRD.                   

1205
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,800
Blabberwort:                    
THERE THEY ARE!                 

1206
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,300
    IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES,    
           FOLLOW ME.           

1207
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
UH, UH... COME ON.              

1208
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,000
    ( gasps )                   

1209
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,200
        WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?  

1210
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
I DON'T KNOW                    

1211
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,400
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE             
IT'S NOT CENTRAL PARK.          

1212
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,900
           FOLLOW ME.           

1213
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,100
        THE DOG SAID FOLLOW HIM.

1214
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,900
                    HURRY UP!   

1215
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
  WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY?   

1216
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,700
                    WELL, THE   
                    SAME THING  

1217
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,800
            THAT HAPPENED       
            TO YOU, OLD CHAP--  

1218
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,400
    TROLL DUST!                 

1219
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
                IT LOOKS LIKE   
                IT'S STARTING   
                TO WEAR OFF.    

1220
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,800
IS THAT DOG                     
TALKING AGAIN?                  

1221
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,000
                        COME ON.
                        COME ON.

1222
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,800
      SO, WHAT SHALL WE DO      

1223
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
WHEN WE HAVE                    
OUR OWN KINGDOM?                

1224
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
      AH, I KNOW, I KNOW.       

1225
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,500
     WE'LL HAVE SERVANTS--      

1226
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
    THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS     
          OF SERVANTS           

1227
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,600
            TO POLISH OUR SHOES.

1228
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
DAD, LET'S GO HOME.             

1229
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,700
                    NO, I CAN'T 
                    GO BACK YET.

1230
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,700
            POLICE ARE ALL      
            OVER CENTRAL PARK   
            LOOKING FOR ME.     

1231
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,900
WELL, WE CAN'T STAY HERE.       

1232
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,800
  SHH! I CAN SMELL THE TROLLS.  

1233
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,000
                HE SAYS HE CAN  
                SMELL TROLLS.   

1234
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,900
WE'LL HAVE                      
FOOTWEAR PARTIES                

1235
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,600
                WHERE YOU HAVE  
                TO CHANGE SHOES 

1236
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,800
            SIX TIMES AN HOUR!  

1237
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,900
AND ANYONE FOUND                
HAVING DIRTY SHOES              

1238
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,900
 WILL HAVE THEIR FACE SEWN UP!  

1239
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,700
          ( laughing )          

1240

       COME ALONG, THEN.        
           FOLLOW ME.

1242
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,100
  I'M NOT GOING TO FOLLOW YOU.  

1243
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,300
         WHERE ARE WE?          

1244
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,600
 WE'RE IN THE SOUTHERNMOST PART 
        OF MY KINGDOM--         

1245
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,800
WHERE I WAS ATTACKED            
BY MY STEPMOTHER                

1246
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,100
AND TURNED INTO A DOG.          

1247
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,900
THIS IS THE SNOW WHITE          
MEMORIAL PRISON, HOUSING        

1248
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,600
THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINALS    
IN ALL THE NINE KINGDOMS.       

1249
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
      ALL RIGHT, BACK UP.       
         THE NINE WHAT?

00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,000
KINGDOMS.                       

1251
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,500
      I AM PRINCE WENDELL       

1252
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,800
GRANDSON OF THE LATE SNOW WHITE

KING                            

1254
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,100
     OF THE FOURTH KINGDOM.     

1255
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,500
AND WHO                         
MIGHT YOU BE?                   

1256
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,100
    I'M TONY LEWIS, JANITOR.    

1257
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,800
    I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW    

1258
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,300
MY DAUGHTER                     
VIRGINIA.                       

1259
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,900
      THE "TROLL KINGDOM."      

1260
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,600
 "RED RIDING HOOD FOREST." WOW! 

1261
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,000
    WAIT. HOLD ON A SECOND.     

1262
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,400
        SO WHAT IS THIS?        

1263
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,000
IT'S CINDERELLA-SLEEPING BEAUTY 
       FAIRY TALE STUFF?        

1264
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,500
            WELL...             

1265
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,900
THE GOLDEN AGE WAS              
ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO            

1266
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,900
WHEN THE LADIES                 
YOU REFER TO                    

1267
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,300
HAD THEIR GREAT MOMENTS         
IN HISTORY.                     

1268
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,300
THINGS HAVE GONE DOWNHILL       
A BIT SINCE THEN.               

1269
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,700
 "HAPPY EVER AFTER" DIDN'T LAST 
     AS LONG AS WE'D HOPED.     

1270
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,300
ALL THE RULERS                  

1271
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,600
OF THE OTHER KINGDOMS ARE       
DUE TO ATTEND MY CORONATION.    

1272
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,900
SOME WILL HAVE                  
TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES.      

1273
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,700
THE KINGDOMS ARE VAST.          

1274
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,200
NO ONE CROSSES THE BORDERS      
EXCEPT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.    

1275
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,700
     WHO WAS THE STEPMOTHER     
   WHO TURNED YOU INTO A DOG?   

1276
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,900
   SHE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS    
     AND EVIL WOMAN ALIVE.      

1277
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
 SOUNDS LIKE MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.  

1278
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,800
LOOK, WE CAN'T                  

1279
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,500
  SIT AROUND TALKING ALL DAY.   

1280
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,700
          WE MUST FIND          
     MY STEPMOTHER'S CELL.      

1281
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,300
           THIS WAY.            

1282
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,000
VIRGINIA,                       
HE SAID FOLLOW HIM.             

1283
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
COME ON. COME ON.               

1284
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,500
             LOOK!              

1285
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,400
 THERE'S A DOG BOWL DOWN HERE.  

1286
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,200
         THAT'S THE DOG         
      THAT'S GOT MY BODY!       

1287
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,300
OH, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!            

1288
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,700
  WHAT DID SHE DO, THIS WOMAN?  

1289
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,800
SHE POISONED                    
MY MOTHER AND FATHER.           

1290
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,700
   TRIED TO KILL ME, AS WELL.   

1291
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,600
      BASICALLY, POISONED       
        HIS MOM AND DAD         

1292
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,100
                AND TRIED TO    
                KILL HIM, TOO.  

1293
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,300
  VIRGINIA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  

1294
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,400
I... I FEEL WEIRD BEING IN HERE.

1295
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,800
           YOU OKAY?            

1296
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,100
      YEAH. I'M JUST GOING      

1297
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,600
 TO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE.  

1298
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,800
   THE TROLLS HAVE BEEN HERE.   

1299
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
            OKAY, JUST DON'T    
            GO TOO FAR, OKAY?   

1300
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,300
STAY OUTSIDE                    
THE DOOR.                       

1301
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,300
           VIRGINIA!            

1302
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
    PRINCE! PRINCE! PRINCE!     

1303
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,800
        I WASN'T SCARED.        

1304
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,400
 IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE MUSTN'T  
    SEE ME AS A DOG, ANTONY.    

1305
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,200
            IT'S DEEPLY, DEEPLY 
            EMBARRASSING.       

1306
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,600
       I COULD CARE LESS        

1307
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,500
ABOUT YOU                       
BEING A DOG!                    

1308
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,000
      VIRGINIA! VIRGINIA!       

1309
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,700
        WHERE ARE THEY?         

1310
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,400
      I NEVER SHOULD HAVE       
 TRUSTED TROLLS TO DO ANYTHING. 

1311
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,700
BE CAREFUL                      
WHAT YOU SAY.                   

1312
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,900
I'M THE ONLY REASON             

1313
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,200
YOU GOT OUT OF PRISON           
IN THE FIRST PLACE.             

1314
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,600
                    OF COURSE,  
                    YOUR MAJESTY

1315
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,700
            AND FOR THAT I'M    
            ETERNALLY GRATEFUL  

1316
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,600
                BUT I CAN'T STAY
                HERE ANY LONGER.

1317
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,700
        NO ONE MUST SEE         
        THE PRINCE LIKE THIS.   

1318
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,400
( barking )                     

1319
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,100
            HAVE YOUR CHILDREN  
            BRING THE DOG TO ME 

1320
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,700
            WHEN THEY RETURN.   

1321
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,400
                    I AM NOT    
                    YOUR LACKEY!

1322
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,600
                I AM RELISH     
                THE TROLL KING! 

1323
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,000
                YOU WILL DO WELL

1324
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,300
                TO REMEMBER IT. 

1325
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,700
OF COURSE, YOUR MAJESTY.        

1326
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,300
AND I WILL                      
REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY           

1327
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,800
WITH HALF                       
OF WENDELL'S KINGDOM            

1328
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,200
AS I PROMISED.                  

1329
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,200
            JUST EXACTLY WHEN   

1330
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,100
                    DO I GET IT?

1331
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,400
        SOON.                   

1332
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,700
BUT NOW I MUST GO.              

1333
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,800
    I HAVE STAYED               
    TOO LONG ALREADY.           

1334
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,300
( panting )                     

1335
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
                OH, GET IN      
                THE CARRIAGE!   

1336
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?      

1337
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,000
 THERE'S NOWHERE YOU CAN HIDE.  

1338
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,700
            WHEN THEY FIND OUT  
            YOU'VE ESCAPED      

1339
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,700
        THERE WILL BE           
        ROADBLOCKS EVERYWHERE.  

1340
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,700
   THEY'LL SEARCH EVERY HOUSE   
  AND CARRIAGE IN THE KINGDOM.  

1341
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,600
            NOT EVERY CARRIAGE. 

1342
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
            SHOULDN'T WE GO     
            BACK FOR THE DOG?   

1343
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,400
    NO, WE CAN'T.               

1344
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,500
    THE TROLL DUST              

1345
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
      WILL BE WEARING OFF.      

1346
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,700
          ( ringing )           
         WAIT A MINUTE!         

1347
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,800
       DO YOU HEAR THAT?        

1348
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,200
     THEY'RE ALL WAKING UP.     

1349
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,600
     LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.     

1350
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,700
            OH, THE QUEEN       
            WILL BE VERY ANGRY. 

1351
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,900
 AW, THE QUEEN CAN SUCK AN ELF  
        FOR ALL I CARE!         

1352
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,600
            WE'VE CAPTURED      
            THE WITCH FROM      
            THE TENTH KINGDOM!  

1353
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,900
            LET'S GO TELL DAD.  

1354
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,500
 WHAT ABOUT THE WITCH'S FATHER? 

1355
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,100
 PERHAPS HE'S A GREAT WARLOCK.  

1356
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,600
OH, HE'S HANDCUFFED.            

1357
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,400
                A GREAT IDIOT,  
                MORE LIKELY.    

1358
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,900
    I WISH I COULD BE THERE     

1359
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,000
  WHEN THE GOVERNOR FINDS HIM   
      IN THE QUEEN'S CELL.      

1360
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,300
( laughing )                    

1361
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,100
             Tony:              
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?       

1362
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,400
         I CAN'T FIGHT.         

1363
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,700
                IT WAS SOME     
                KIND OF SPELL.  

1364
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,100
                ME AND THE LADS 
                BEEN LAID UP    
                FOR OVER A DAY. 

1365
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,800
I'VE SEARCHED                   
EVERY INCH OF THE PRISON        

1366
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,800
BUT THE QUEEN'S                 
GONE, SIR.                      

1367
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
                    I HAVE BEEN 
                    THE GOVERNOR

1368
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,500
OF THIS PRISON                  
FOR 12 YEARS.                   

1369
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,800
          NO PRISONER           
    HAS EVER ESCAPED BEFORE.    

1370
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,700
THAT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE RECORD.

1371
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,700
                WHATEVER        
                YOU DO, ANTONY  

1372
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,200
   DON'T TELL HIM I'M A DOG.    

1373
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,700
                    WHY NOT?    

1374
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,000
SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO!    

1375
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,200
            BECAUSE             
            THE QUEEN HAS GOT   

1376
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,600
      SOME TERRIBLE PLAN.       

1377
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,500
        MY WHOLE KINGDOM        
      MAY BE IN JEOPARDY.       

1378
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,100
                NO ONE MUST KNOW
                I'M HELPLESS.   

1379
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,600
ALL RIGHT.                      

1380
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,200
WHERE IS THE QUEEN?             

1381
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,200
       I WISH I WAS HOME.       

1382
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,400
     I WISH VIRGINIA AND I      

1383
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,000
                WERE BACK IN    
                OUR APARTMENT   

1384
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,500
                IN NEW YORK NOW.

1385
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,300
WELL...                         

1386
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,000
      IT SEEMS YOU'RE NOT.      

1387
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,500
          ( coughing )          

1388
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,000
                    ( gagging ) 

1389
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,600
          ( gagging )           

1390
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,300
        OH, NO, ANTONY!         

1391
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,900
  YOU DIDN'T SWALLOW A DRAGON   

1392
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,200
                    DUNG BEAN,  
                    YOU MORON!  

1393
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,800
I GUESS THAT MEANS I'VE HAD ALL 

1394
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,800
MY WISHES, HUH?                 

1395
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,400
   HOW DID THE QUEEN ESCAPE?    

1396
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,600
I'M TELLING YOU, I HAVE NO IDEA!

1397
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,500
    THEN WHY WERE YOU FOUND     
   LOCKED IN HER EMPTY CELL?    

1398
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,800
    I AM AN INNOCENT VICTIM.    

1399
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,500
  I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE  
WITH THE POLICE MY ENTIRE LIFE. 

1400
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,100
            THEN WHY ARE YOU    
            WEARING HANDCUFFS?  

1401
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,200
WELL, BECAUSE I'M WANTED        
FOR ARMED ROBBERY               

1402
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
WHICH I DIDN'T                  

1403
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,700
HAVE ANYTHING                   
TO DO WITH EITHER.              

1404
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,700
     OH, CARRY ON, ANTONY.      

1405
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,000
          YOU'RE DOING          
       SPECTACULARLY WELL       

1406
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,400
                        SO FAR. 

1407
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,900
            I'M FROM            
     A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.     

1408
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
          I CAME HERE           
   FROM A DIFFERENT DIMENSION   

1409
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,300
        LED BY THAT DOG,        
WHO IS ACTUALLY PRINCE WENDELL. 

1410
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,600
OH, I TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY THAT. 

1411
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,900
        PRINCE WENDELL?         

1412
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,200
      LOOK, I CAN MAKE YOU      
          BREAK ROCKS           

1413
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,200
        WITH YOUR TEETH         

1414
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,800
         FOR 100 YEARS.         

1415
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,300
          ( clinking )          

1416
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,300
        I'M TELLING YOU,        
        IT'S THE TRUTH.         

1417
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
THAT IS                         
THE QUEEN'S DOG.                

1418
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,500
SHE HAS                         
BEEN PERMITTED                  

1419
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,500
    TO KEEP HIM IN HER CELL     
        FOR THREE YEARS.        

1420
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,800
          DON'T INSULT          

1421
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,100
MY INTELLIGENCE.                

1422
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,500
    I'M NOT. IT'S THE TRU...    

1423
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,600
   ALL RIGHT, I'LL PROVE IT.    

1424
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,100
           BARK ONCE            
   IF I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.    

1425
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,600
      I HAVE NO INTENTION       
      OF BARKING, ANTONY.       

1426
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,700
   HE IS BEING JUST STUBBORN.   

1427
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,100
                    YOU HAVE TO 
                    LET ME GO   
                    IMMEDIATELY.

1428
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,000
            I THINK MY          
            DAUGHTER WAS        
            ABDUCTED BY TROLLS. 

1429
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,400
         THAT'S ENOUGH!         

1430
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,500
I'LL GET THE TRUTH              
OUT OF YOU                      

1431
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,000
          SOON ENOUGH.          

1432
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 WARDER, REMOVE HIS HANDCUFFS.  

1433
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,200
ISSUE HIM                       
WITH PRISON UNIFORM             

1434
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,500
AND PUT HIM IN                  

1435
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,700
           UH... YES!           

1436
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,700
         PUT HIM IN 103         
      WITH ACORN THE DWARF      

1437
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,200
         AND CLAY FACE          

1438
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
THE GOBLIN.                     

1439
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,400
     CLAY FACE THE GOBLIN?      

1440
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,100
     I DON'T WANT TO BE PUT     
 IN ANY ROOM WITH CLAY FACE...  

1441
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,200
              NO!               

1442
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,400
WHERE'S                         
MY DAUGHTER?                    

1443
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
           WHAT ABOUT           
     THE QUEEN'S DOG, SIR?      

1444
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,900

                GOING.          

1445
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
                I'LL SLIP       
                SOME RAT POISON 

1446

1448
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,200
        Prince Wendell:         
       DID YOU HEAR THAT?       

1449
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,200
   ANTONY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?   

1450
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,700
    YOU HAVE TO GET ME OUT.     

1451
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,400
        IT'S YOUR DUTY.         

1452
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,700
      GET HER IN THE BOAT.      

1453
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,800
       GET HER IN THERE.        

1454
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,100

1457
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,600
       ( trolls yelling )       

1458
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,700
          Blabberwort:          
      SIT DOWN AND STEER!       

1459

        ( all yelling )         

1460
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,600
                    MIDDLE BUNK.

1461
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,200
                    SO, WHAT ARE
                    YOU IN FOR? 

1462
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,200

   COUPLE OF PEOPLE GOT HURT    

1464
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,600

                AGGRAVATED.     

1468

                    I'M ACORN.

     WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?     

1486
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,700
 WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT ENTAIL? 

1487
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,200
           Bluebell:            
              ROW!

   WHEN WE'RE HOME, I'M GOING   
      TO LET YOU HAVE IT!       

1489
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,800
                    KEEP ROWING.

1490
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
I'M ROWING.                     

1491
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,200
       ANY MINUTE NOW...        

1492
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,200
    I'M SURE PRINCE WENDELL     
          WILL ARRIVE           

1493
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
TO RECEIVE THE CORONATION THRONE

1494
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,900
      WHICH OUR CRAFTSMEN       

1495
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,200
     HAVE TIRELESSLY SPENT      
   THE LAST TWO YEARS MAKING.   

1496
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,700
HE'S NOT COMING,                
IS HE?                          

1497
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,900
        OF COURSE HE IS.        

1498
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,900
                HAVE NO WORRY.  

1499
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,700
    I'M SURE HE'S BEEN DELAYED  
    FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.     

1500
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,900
HORRIBLE NEWS.                  

1501
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,100
    THERE'S BEEN A BREAKOUT     
        FROM THE PRISON.        

1502
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,300
                    THE QUEEN   
                    HAS ESCAPED.

1503
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,400
THE QUEEN?                      

1504
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,600
THE QUEEN.                      

1505
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,300
PUT UP THE ROADBLOCKS.          

1506
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,500
       SHE MUST BE CAUGHT

            WHAT IS THIS STUFF? 

1543
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,200
BAKED BEANSTALK.

                    BEANSTALK.  

1546
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,000

            I CAN'T EAT THAT.   

1549
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,200
                IT TASTES LIKE  
                AN OLD MATTRESS!

1550
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,100

       THREE TIMES A DAY.       

1554
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,400
THAT'S BEANSTALK JUICE.         

1555
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
            TAKES A BIT         
            OF GETTING USED TO. 

1556
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,900
                        ( gags )

            AND I WANTED TO GET 
            SOMETHING... MADE.

         FOR INSTANCE--         
   FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT--   

1561
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,700
    A SMALL PIECE OF METAL.     

1562
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,900
  WHO WOULD I HAVE TO TALK TO?  

1563
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,100
I MEAN, WHO'S MR. BIG           
AROUND HERE?                    

1564
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,400
            IF YOU WANT ANYTHING

1565
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,900
        BOUGHT, SOLD, BORROWED  
        OR MADE IN HERE         

1566
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,300
                YOU HAVE TO SEE 
                THE TOOTH FAIRY.

1567
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,200
         UH... THE WHO?         

1568
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,500
      THE PRISON DENTIST.       

1569
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,000
              AH.               

1570
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,500
   UH... AND HOW WOULD I GET    
          TO SEE HIM?           

1571
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,100
                    OH, UM...   
                    THAT'S EASY.

1572
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
           OH, YEAH?            

1573
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,200

1574
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,900
          ( knocking )          

1575
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,700
OH, OH...                       
THAT'S NO GOOD.                 

1576
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,100
THEY'LL ALL HAVE                
TO COME OUT.                    

1577
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,800
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "COME OUT"?  

1578
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
        YOU HAVEN'T EVEN        

1579
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,100
                    LOOKED IN MY
                    MOUTH YET.

1587
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,600
        WHAT? YOU'RE A DENTIST. 

1588
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,800
            YOU SHOULDN'T BE    
            GIVING PEOPLE CANDY.

1589
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,100
            WHY NOT?            

1590
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,700
                WELL, BECAUSE   
                IT ROTS TEETH.
