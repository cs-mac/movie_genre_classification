The day Shane was born,

After he'd shoot a deer,
I would end up in tears,

That I would try

He tried basketball.

But he wasn't much

We used red glitter.

You know,
that just seemed so strange.

I didn't want to go to bed,

And my mom
would tell me to go to bed,

And then I would sneak out.

And I knew
that this guy was gay,

And I knew that he was sick.

And he was dying

And there was like sores
on his face and his body,

And he wasn't as fun

You could tell that something

Something was always

I would sneak into one
of the bedrooms in our house.

I see these flashing lights

It was very stressful.

But it was real to him,
and I knew it was real to him,

And I wanted him to feel

That this is maybe more serious
than she can handle,

00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,829
So she set me up
with a therapist.

00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,631
- When Shane got donewith his session,

152
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,166
He asked me to come in,
and he said,

153
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,935
"your son just needs to admit
to himself that he's gay,

154
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,004
And everything will be fine."

155
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,106
And I said,
"how can you say that?

And doctor Hauser said,"well, you know,

That's something you're gonna
have to come to peace with."

159
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,615
- I always suspected...
I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,018
It took me a couple days
to process,

161
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,486
And the thing
it come down to is,

162
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,887
"I ain't making any more kids...

163
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,889
I better stay in good
with the ones I got."

164
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,827
And I love him unconditionally,
so it just doesn't matter.

165
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,896
- It's kind of funny now that,
here I was a little boy,

166
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,834
On my knees, praying to god
that I wouldn't be gay,

167
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,569
And there was another little boy

168
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,840
1,500 miles away in Indianadoing the same thing.

169
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,175
- Knox, Indiana,is not the easiest place.

170
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,810
For a gay kid to grow up.

171
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:03,148
It's very homogenous...
not much diversity there.

172
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,116
I knew tom.

173
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,886
When both of our brothers
were in boy scouts together.

174
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,154
Everybody loved him.

175
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,156
And he was just the popular kid.

176
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,824
He had a lot of empathy.

177
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,994
I'll never forget,
the day my mom died,

178
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,030
Tom was the first person
to come over to my house.

179
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:23,235
He walked in the door,
and he was crying...

180
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,136
You know, almost like
he's sadder than I am.

181
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,172
Tom's mother and father
each had children.

182
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,807
From previous marriages.

183
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,077
So, Tom was the only child
between the two parents,

184
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,579
And he was the center
of attention in the family.

185
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,281
He was the center of attention
everywhere he was.

186
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,017
Tom would always be playing the
piano at home,

187
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,819
Singing, dancing around.

188
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,254
-d Come on, baby

189
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,655
d you're driving me crazy

190
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,956
d goodness gracious

191
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,758
d great balls of fire!

192
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,527
- He was doing his tricks
on the trampoline,

193
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,995
And he was always performing.

194
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,864
For Tom, there was never
any such thing as too much.

195
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,102
Tom's dad, he was a simple
blue-collar worker,

196
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,937
Came home late, got up really
early the next day,

197
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,739
And, you know, did it again.

198
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,109
Both of his parents sacrificed
a lot for tom's happiness.

199
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:09,180
His mom took a job as a janitor
so that Tom could go to culver.

200
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,982
Not many parents
would do that...

201
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,184
Would start cleaning toilets
so their son could have.

202
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,653
The best education.

203
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:18,089
Tom's dad was in Vietnam,and that's why.

204
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,091
He went to Vietnamwhen he was in high school.

205
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,595
He definitely respected his dad
for fighting for his country.

206
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:28,633
I think, as Tom got older,
as Tom became his own person,

207
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,802
It just became difficult
for them to connect.

208
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,170
Tom was always very adamant.

209
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,072
About saying
what he believed in,

210
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,175
And it didn't work with his dad.

211

[ Rap music plays ]

212
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,814
- And it's sad,
but I really think that,

213
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:47,652
If more people would give me
a chance to be their friend,

214
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,921
I could show them that,

215
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,823
Just 'cause
I'm not exactly like them,

216
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,666
That I'm still
a good person.

217
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,028
Hi. How's it going?

218
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,798
[ laughing ] what?

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,334
I'm just coming
to get the usual.

220
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,970
All right. Thank you.

221
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,371
It's kind of pathetic.

222
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,772
If they know exactly what I get
every time.

223
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,074
In Kalispell, seriously,

224
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,009
There's tons of people
at dairy queen.

225
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,877
It's the cool place to be.

226
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,179
[ laughing ] yeah, let's see.

227
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,313
What?

228
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,815
She just closed the camera.

229
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,316
Oh, there's... there's...

230
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,018
[ laughs ]

231
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,354
Oh, geez.
They closed the windows.

232
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,888
I actually worked here,

233
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,791
But I didn't tell people
that I worked here.

234
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,026
I have to admit.

235
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,628
That I want to be
one of those people.

236
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,029
That people are like,
"ooh!

237
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,164
Whoa! He looks good."

238
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,799
'cause I enjoy running,

239
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,936
But when I run, it's on
a treadmill in our house,

240
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,005
Because I do not want
people seeing me running.

241
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,274
I do not want people to see me,
really, at all.

242
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,077
The one thing that I wanted.

243
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,814
Was just someone that I could
talk to and relate to,

244
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,884
That accepted me for being me.

245
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,988
I developed a crush
for a guy named matt parker.

246
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,891
And we would spend the night
at each other's houses.

247
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:00,959
All the time.

248
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,194
We would play basketball
outside.

249
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,397
We were just best friends.

250
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,266
It was in high school
that I finally got the courage.

251
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,303
To tell matt how I felt,
and I wrote him a love letter.

252
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,838
I was nervous.

253
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,775
I was so nervous
about giving him the letter.

254
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:20,045
But he had to tell me
that he's not gay.

255
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,981
And it broke my heart,
but at the same time,

256
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,718
I was still so happy that
he was willing to be my friend.

257
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,721
- There was a situation with
a couple friends in high school,

258
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,089
And they were questioning
his sexuality.

259
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,223
And kind of were,
you know, mocking him,

260
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,892
Making fun of him,

261
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,794
And a couple of his friends
completely shunning him.

262
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,829
- I got a phone call from one
of his best friend's mother,

263
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,863
And she wanted me to come over.

264
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,765
She was very upset.

265
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,268
- Once my mom told me that she
was going over to matt's house,

266
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,303
I knew immediately
this was not gonna be good.

267
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,273
- It wasn't, you know,
really a love, love letter.

268
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,008
It was just,
you know, he admired matt,

269
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,143
He enjoyed his time,

270
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,447
And it was just, I thought,
like a good friendship letter.

271
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,415
- It was nothing distasteful.

272
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,084
It was nothing sexual.

273
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,854
It was just telling him
how he felt about him.

274
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,123
- I let her say
everything she wanted to say,

275
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,858
And after she was done,
I just told her,

276
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,760
I said, "you'll never have
to worry about this again",

277
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,228
Because Shane will neverbe around matt,

278
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,930
"And I don't to ever hear
from you again."

279
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,498
I don't want to say
what I really told her.

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,900
It wasn't polite,
and I just told her, basically,

281
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,504
Take the flying leap
and to leave my son alone.

282
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,006
- Matt's parents were
very prominent in the community.

283
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,775
His dad was a principal.

284
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,276
His mom was a teacher.

285
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,778
I was told by the principal.

286
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,912
That I wasn't allowed.

287
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,380
To go to any sporting events,

288
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,049
Because matt was on the teams.

289
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,751
- That was the big place to be.

290
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,286
That was where everyone
in town was,

291
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,088
And Shane wasn't welcome.

292
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,424
- Matt was also in the same
church community,

293
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,159
And Shane wasn't able.

294
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,395
To go on a very important trip
with his youth group.

295
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,765
- Matt's parents made it
so he couldn't go,

296
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,767
And he had raised all this money
to go on this trip,

297
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,335
And he was devastated.

298
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,137
He acted
like it was no big deal,

299
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,538
But you could tell he was hurt.

300
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,373
- Once this letter came out,

301
00:12:55,375 --> 00:13:00,078
This boy and his parents went
and shouted it to the world.

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,448
Kids at school were constantly
picking on him.

303
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,183
- He wasn't accepted anymore.

304
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,317
They called him gay.

305
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,052
They called him fag.

306
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,922
The names that they called him
were just horrendous.

307
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,859
- There's a mentality
of the "cowboy way,".

308
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,963
Which does not include
people that are gay.

309
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,899
So it's a tough place.

310
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,301
- Before he was banned,Shane was at a football game,

311
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,137
And all these kids started
spitting in this cup.

312
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,439
And next thing I know,
the one kid.

313
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,176
That used to be a real goodfriend of Shane's had this cup,

314
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,545
And he was just about readyto tip it on Shane's head.

315
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,214
And [snaps fingers] let me
tell you... if you want to talk.

316
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,416
About a mother bear
protecting her cub,

317
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,251
This woman came unglued.

318
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:44,055
I said, "you put that damn cup
down, and leave him alone."

319
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,424
It was just heartbreaking
to see that happen to my son.

320
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,962
- It was after all the drama
with matt and his family.

321
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,499
That I just went
to a really dark place,

322
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,868
And I had a breakdown.

323
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,603
- I got a call from the school
informing me.

324
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,538
My son hasn't been to school
for two weeks.

325
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,942
- Other kids made his life
literally a living hell,

326
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,443
And it never really got better,

327
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,612
And I don't think he ever saw
it would get better,

328
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,547
And that's why
he just stopped going.

329
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,517
- One evening,
all three daughters and I.

330
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,619
Went to the furniture store,

331
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,421
And it was his birthday,

332
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:20,358
And he was by himself,
just hanging out with his mom.

333
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,193
He was very depressed.

334
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,561
He was not Shane.

335
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,431
He was like a shell of himself.

336
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,434
- I was sick of the embarrassment
and the pain.

337
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,903
That I was bringing
to my family.

338
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,607
I felt like the only way that
I can make their lives better.

339
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,077
Is by taking my own.

340
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,579
I was at my dad's house,
I was home alone,

341
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:46,551
And I just walked
over to his gun case.

342
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,254
And I took one of the guns,

343
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,889
And I just went
back in the living room,

344
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,024
And I just sat there,
and I held it.

345
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,425
I mean,
there was so many thoughts,

346
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,227
Like, going through my head
at that moment.

347
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,296
It was like for over an hour,
just really contemplating,

348
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,465
Like, what my next step
should be.

349
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,268
Fortunately,
I also thought through.

350
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,404
In that it wouldn't be fair
to my family.

351
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,139
It wouldn't be fair to my mom.

352
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,908
And I just had to visualize.

353
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,310
What the experience
would be like for them.

354
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,578
If I <i>did</i> take my life.

355
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,615
And it wouldn't be worth it.

356
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,685
Also, on some level,
I must have believed.

357
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,922
That, somehow, someday,

358
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,257
There's gonna be someone
out there.

359
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,126
Who's gonna love me for me.

-[ Vocalizing ]

361

He had this energy.

363
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,439
He was always singing
and laughing.

364
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,308
And enjoying life so much.

365

- d There was a decorated general
with a heart of gold d

366

- He was at the top of his class.

367
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,949
He was a leader
in all aspects of the word,

368
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,952
In sports, and in school.

- Every time you met tom,

371
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,724
It felt like you were meeting
your best friend.

372

And it didn't matter
who you were...

00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,094
He always had your back.

374
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,729
I think Tom went to culver.

375
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,165
Instead of the high school
in his hometown.

376
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,100
Because he saw
it as an opportunity.

377
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,969
To open his horizons,

378
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,439
And, you know, his parents
played a big role in that.

379
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,341
His mom worked at culver.

380
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,210
Primarily so that they could
afford the reduced tuition.

381
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:23,348
So that Tom would have
all those opportunities.

382
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,083
He came out to me
our senior year.

383
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,452
It was at night, and we were
sitting in the grass,

384
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,154
And I remember he got really
serious all of a sudden,

385
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,991
And he said, "I have something
to tell you... "

386
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,292
I'm gay."

387
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,693
Then he put his head in his lap,

388
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,595
And he was crying
and really emotional about it.

389
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,731
I think he was really afraid
of being judged.

390
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,566
It didn't surprise me at all.

391
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,102
This is coming
from my friend who,

392
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,037
Probably three or four
weeks ago,

Was singing "I'm a Barbie girl,".

While jumping on a trampoline
in his backyard.

395
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,079
- He knew everybody,
and everybody knew him.

396
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,715
I felt like
my popularity scale rose.

397
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,385
Just because
I hung out with him.

398
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,788
Tom was friendswith Anne Hathaway in school.

399
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,058
He also was friends
with Tom hanks' daughter.

400
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,094
I never could wrap
my mind around it,

401
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,497
Because here was tom,this sort of Midwestern,

402

Corn-fed,american-pie-eating guy,

403
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,404
Who camefrom this tiny town in Indiana,

404
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,472
Who then went
to military school.

405
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,574
He was able
to get along and succeed.

406
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:27,245
In that entire social circle
and academic circle.

407
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,048
And then went to Vassar,which is this liberal place.

408
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,250
And a completely different vibe.

409
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,585
He just sort of was magic.

410
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:39,657
- Tom, for as beautiful as he was
and, you know [chuckles]

411
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,593
The fact that he knew
how beautiful he was,

412
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,264
He did not care at all
about how other people looked.

413
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,266
And he did not care
where you came from,

What car you drove.

415
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,172
He just accepted anybody
and everybody for who they were,

416
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,140
And I think because he was gay.

417
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,575
And because
he knew what it was like.

418

To be not the mainstream,
normal person.

419

How much he respected me because
I was hearing-impaired.

He wrote
incredibly heartfelt lyrics.

But he was tough,
'cause he could kick your ass.

He could wrestle you down.

The idea of manhood

And presenting yourself
in a certain way.

Was important to him.

435
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:44,322
I think he wanted to have tom
basically play that role.

436

And Tom knew
how to play it very well.

That he was gay.

440

And I know
that was a struggle for him,

441
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,667
Because he still hadn't told
his parents.

442

At a family weddingin Missoula, Montana.

474
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,595
He said, "eventually,I'd like to move to California."

475
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,963
Well, three months later,

476
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,632
We got a phone call from him
that he was here.

477
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,335
- So we kind of tried
to steer him...

478
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,904
Helping him get a job,
a place to live.

479
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,407
And we became
like his adopted parents.

480
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,644
- I think he was barely
18 years old,

481
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,481
This thin kid with curly hair,

482
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,451
Out of Montanainto the big city.

483
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,753
He was very quiet,
very reserved.

484
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,855
- He showed me some head shots
that he took.

485
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,259
- He had wavy, wavy hair,and he looked like Liberace.

486
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,693
- Oh. Right. Right, right.

487
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,562
- And I thought, "oh, my god."
- Right.

488
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,297
- "What am I gonna tell
this kid?"

489
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,033
Shane said
he wanted to be an actor.

490
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,535
But after a very short time,
it became clear.

491
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,971
He just wantedto get to California.

492
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,340
- I got a job working
as a production assistant.

493
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,508
For a TV show.

494
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,545
- Shane and I met
in the tape vault,

495
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,447
And it was pretty much
love at first sight.

496
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,884
He's got that small-town
kind of quality to him.

497
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:31,656
He's just so likeable
and funny and so humble.

498
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:36,761
Shane doesn't necessarily see
sort of what everyone else sees.

499
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,764
- One of my friends
that I worked with,

500
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,433
She invited me to go bowling
with one of her friends.

501
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,302
- We had this idea.

502
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,371
That we had to get Tom and Shaneto meet each other.

503
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:51,676
But we didn't tell them
that it was a setup.

504
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:55,313
- She said that there was gonna
be this guy there named tom.

505
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,581
And that he's active
in the industry,

506
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,584
So she thought that maybe
it would be a good person.

507
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,852
To be connected with.

508
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,920
- We get there.

509
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,022
He is ridiculously attractive...

510
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,492
Gorgeous, if you will...
so charismatic.

511
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,528
He was an actor.

512
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,030
I think he had been
in a few things.

513
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,932
And almost immediately,

514
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,734
[chuckling]Shane became skeptical.

515
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,936
He was like, "who is this guy?"

516
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:22,606
And I'm like, "why is hebothering you so much, Shane?"

517
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,408
- He was four years
older than me.

518
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,843
Like, he had traveled the world,

519
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,978
You know,
spoke a different language.

520
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
He played
a bunch of instruments.

521
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,049
He was just so cocky
and confident,

522
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,719
And, well, of course, he, like,
was bowling really well.

523
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:38,823
And then here I am, like,
can't even knock five pins down.

524
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,925
So, it wasn't too long
after we went bowling.

525
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,961
That we all got together againat my friend Lizzy's apartment.

526
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,429
It was that night.

527
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,131
That we finally exchanged
phone numbers.

528
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,666
We ended up hanging out,

529
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,101
You know,
a few times here and there.

530
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,437
And he was always singing.
He was always happy.

531
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,906
-d Life is a highway

532
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,877
d I want to ride it
all night long d

533
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,079
- Tom and I, we would spend
all day together,

534
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,615
And then he would go home,

535
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,684
Which would lead to,
later in the evening,

536
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,619
Talking on the phone
for a few hours.

537
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,020
It did not take long.

538
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,423
For me to really feel
comfortable with tom,

539
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:15,159
That I could tell him anything.

540
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,162
Like,
I trusted him with my life.

541
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,564
- Tom was a very confident
person.

542
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,733
[ Chuckles ]he went after Shane.

543
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,702
At first, Shane was like, "aah,"

544
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,804
'cause he had never been
in a relationship before.

545
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:30,074
This was his,
you know, first love.

546
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,009
- We went to hear Tom one time,

547
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,713
And Shane would look aroundthe room while he was playing.

548
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:40,818
Because he wanted to make sure
everybody was paying attention.

549
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,053
And seeing what he saw.

550
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:46,624
And there is a jewish wordcalled kvell.

551
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,994
And that's what he looked like
when Tom performed...

552
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,195
He was kvelling.

553
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,730
He was glowing.

554
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,899
- It was incredible
to finally experience.

555
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:58,836
That feeling of love...
you know, like the butterflies.

556
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,972
It's what I always imagined
that all my friends felt.

557
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:06,210
It didn't take long for me
to move into his apartment.

558
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,045
- They got very close
very quickly.

559
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,214
I think their freedom
wasn't moving to I.A.

560
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:13,851
I think Tom was definitelythe door for Shane.

561
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,086
To come to terms with himself.

562
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,789
- Tom was a safe place.

563
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,725
When Tom met Shane,he was a little, lost sheep.

564
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,995
And tomreally looked out for Shane.

565
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:28,499
- He loved making dinner
even when he was really tired.

566
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,733
He loved tying my ties...

567
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,569
Even properly
tucking my shirt in,

568
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,971
Because at culver, they teach
you how to do all that.

569
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,674
- Tom truly was pursuing
his dreams,

570
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,777
And Shane knewthat bills had to be paid.

571
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,613
Shane was the level-headed one.

572
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:46,584
- What one couldn't think of,
the other one could.

573
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,986
They found
an awful lot in common.

574
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,788
They were both romantics.

575
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,857
They're both from small towns.

576
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:58,562
Both wanted to make
an impression on the world.

577
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:02,566
- They were always smiling
and always having a good time.

578
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,868
I mean,
they're the kind of couple.

579
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,002
That makes you believe in love.

580
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,805
- I just loved their bickering,

581
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,640
Which was really flirting.

582
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,082
That was probably my favorite
part of their relationship.

583
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,645
- I did this once
in military school...

584
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,046
The kid had to shave his head.

585
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,816
[ Both laugh ]
- Why are you telling me that?

586
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,051
Seriously, don't pull so hard.

587
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,954
- They were like
an old married couple...

588
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,991
They were young, gay,
but they never wanted to go out.

589
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,792
I'm like, "let's go to the bar.
Let's go to the club."

590
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,561
They didn't go out a lot,

591
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,563
'cause they were always working,
trying to build something.

592
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:36,767
- I know that, for tom,
it wasn't just about fidelity,

593
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,537
Which, of course,
was like number one.

594
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,971
It was also about being.

595
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,674
Completely
emotionally available,

596
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,044
Mentally available,spiritually available to Shane.

597
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,280
- When you get to my age,

598
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,081
You start being
a little agnostic.

599
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,917
That anything like that
can occur.

600
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,986
But over time,
it became pretty apparent.

601
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,889
That this was something
that was probably going.

602
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,792
To last
for a very, very long time.

603
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,663
There was an aura about them
that just was something special.

604
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,097
- Everyone in this room,

605
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,899
Or anyone watching
this documentary could wish.

606
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,001
That they hadthe love that Tom and Shane had.

607
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,571
That's what you dream about
at night.

608
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,738
And they had it.

609
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:23,047
- Shane and Tom started doing
online promotion for musicians.

610
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,317
And they had the little,
tiny shack of a studio,

611
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,285
But it was just so much fun,

612
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,955
And we would just spend
hours and hours.

613
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:34,892
Just trying to think of ways
to take over the world.

614
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,360
- All of a sudden,

615
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:39,096
There was this factory of videos
that started coming out.

616
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,131
They had all these ideas.

617
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,367
For what could be a tv show
or a travel show.

618
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,104
- Hey, everybody, I'm tom,
in the beautiful, extremely hot.

619
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,673
And humid city
of rio de janeiro, brazil.

620
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,642
- Welcome to tomandShane.Com.
- Welcome to tomandShane.Com.

621
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,243
- I'm tom.
- And I'm Shane.

622
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,045
- And we're in oahu.
- And we're in oahu.

623
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,280
- Why do you always
do that voice?

624
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,148
[ Nasally ]
I know. I'm the pilot.

625
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,717
- [ Nasally ]
this is better than a pilot.

626
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,985
- [ Normal voice ]
you know you do that voice.

627
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,686
- Oh, I know.
- Okay.

628
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:06,757
- They became adventurers,
filmmakers, documentarians.

629
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,160
I think they just really liked
the idea.

630
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:14,698
Of taking the excitement
that they had and sharing it.

631
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,734
- The more
Tom and I fell in love,

632
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,103
The more we wanted
to tell our parents about it.

633
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,271
But each of us had
the philosophy.

634
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,173
That there was no need
to tell your family.

635
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,875
Until you found that person.

636
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,111
That you were gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

637
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,213
So, my mom and my aunt
were visiting,

638
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,881
And it was very late at night,

639
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,217
But I told my mom
that I had to talk to her.

640
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:38,055
With Tom by my side, I said,
"mom."

641
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:41,825
- I said, "honey, if you're gonna
tell me you're gay, that's fine."

642
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,962
I know it,
and I'm okay with it."

643
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,897
And I said,
"and is Tom your partner?"

644
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,366
And Tom goes,
"yep. I'm his partner."

645
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,769
Tom was sitting there waiting
for a big blowup or something,

646
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,071
And I just said, "well, great."

647
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:57,141
You know, I don't have to worry
about Shane like I did."

648
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:00,678
Tom was my godsend.

649
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,813
Shane didn't have
his anxieties anymore.

650
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,882
He was more confident.

651
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,216
He was happy.

652
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,752
He was just more of a man.

653
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,354
- I never imagined.

654
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,990
That I could love my mom
even more than I did.

655
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,726
She had been there through
all my struggles of being gay.

656
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,295
And we never said out loud
what the real deal was,

657
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,164
But now we had.

658
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:24,001
It was the greatest feeling
ever.

659
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:30,441
- d Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire d

660
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,176
- Tom and I knew.

661
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,445
It would be a challenge
to come out to his parents.

662
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:37,748
So, he was in indiana
for christmas.

663
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,383
It was just him and his mom.

664
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,152
And there was something
that came on tv.

665
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,987
About a lesbian couple,

666
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:47,725
And tom's mom made a comment
about how that was disgusting.

667
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,394
And tom, at that moment,
just realized,

668
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,296
"like, I need to tell her."

669
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,898
- He told his mom, "mom, I'm gay."

670
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,367
When you say things like that,
you're talking about me."

671
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,369
- He was, I think,
sort of building.

672
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,039
On what had happened
when Shane came out.

673
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,241
Shane had come out
to his mother,

674
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,443
And she basically
filled in the blanks...

675
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,112
"oh, you're gay.
I knew that already.

676
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,480
I always knew that."

677
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:12,883
- I was sure that his mom
knew that he was gay.

678
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:17,955
But she immediately called
his dad to come home from work.

679
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,390
Because of this breaking news.

680
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:25,863
And she went on and on
about how it was a sin.

681
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,431
And that tom
should have told them sooner.

682
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,233
So he could
have gotten medical help.

683
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,869
- His dad said a lot
of hateful things towards him.

684
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,339
And blamed Shane
for making him gay.

685
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,441
- "It's Shane's fault.
- Shane turned you gay.

686
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,244
Being in I.A. Turned you gay."

687
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:43,313
- "all of your accomplishments
so far mean nothing now."

688
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,949
- They said, "change your mind.
- You have to change your mind."

689
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,985
And Tom said
that he just kept saying no...

690
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,920
Like, you know,
"I can't change my mind.

691
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,221
It's not a mind-change thing."

692
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,890
- Tom called me.

693
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:56,093
He told me that his dad pulled
a shotgun on him.

694
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,830
And at that point,
I was really scared.

695
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,166
So, while Tom and I were
on the phone,

696
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:05,536
His dad, norman, literally
ripped the door off the hinges.

697
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:09,439
And his mom got on the phone,
and she said to me,

698
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,309
"listen here, fucker... "

699
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,179
I don't know
what you did to our son,

700
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:18,415
"But we're gonna come to I.A.,
and we're gonna find you."

701
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,484
- I think the phrase
his dad used was,

702
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,453
He was gonna come
out to california and gut him.

703
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,089
- I used to always have
this fantasy.

704
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:31,495
Of Tom and I going
to indiana for christmas.

705
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,864
And just, you know, going to bed.

706
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,366
And waking up
on christmas morning,

707
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,869
All of us going out
to the living room...

708
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,204
You know, there's the tree,

709
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,940
And Tom and I just sitting there
with his family,

710
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,142
Opening presents together,

711
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,212
And me just saying something
that I think's funny,

712
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:52,182
And I look over,
and tom's parents are laughing.

713
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,086
It's stupid, but it's just...

714
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,188
It would be like
an incredible thing.

715
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,058
If something like that happened.

716
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,559
- When the police showed up
at the house,

717
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,862
Tom's dad just kind of
pooh-poohed it off, and he said,

718
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,897
"ah, you know how
these california kids are."

719
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,966
Those phone calls
for those next two days,

720
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,968
Until Tom got out of there,
were just...

721
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,503
My heart just broke
for both of those boys.

722
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,405
It was just so scary and so sad.

723
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,007
- So, that next morning,

724
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,176
Tom's parents
were in the kitchen.

725
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,478
With a bible on the table.

726
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,313
Out loud, they were saying
the verses,

727
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,115
Almost, in a way,
just to justify.

728
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,650
That, the day before,

729
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,652
They beat up their son
because he was gay.

730
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,188
He's like,
"I can't believe this.

731
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,357
"I just got attacked
and told

732
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,292
"that I should have taken
the fact that I'm gay.

733
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,961
To the grave."

734
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:42,132
-d merry christmas

735
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,134
- It was just an awful situation,

736
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:48,005
And tom, you know, got out
of there as soon as he could.

737
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,007
And flew back to california.

738
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:54,611
-d To you

739
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:58,048
- So, eventually, martha made
her way out to california,

740
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,651
And I was
really, really nervous.

741
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,453
This was like the first time
that I was going to see martha.

742
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,290
Since that,
you know, horrible experience.

743
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,292
- I think martha came here.

744
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,194
Because she did not want
to lose her son.

745
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,931
So she had to embrace Shane.

746
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,067
And act like she accepted
the relationship.

747
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,069
- It was a little awkward
for awhile.

748
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,039
But, eventually, you know,
we warmed up to each other.

749
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,974
We would go to dinner.

750
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,977
Tom and her would laugh,
like, hysterically.

751
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,211
When they get together,

752
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,947
It's like two little,
old ladies.

753
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,115
And although she didn't say,
like, you know,

754
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,084
"Shane, I'm sorry,"
or, "tom, I'm sorry.

755
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,485
For how we handled everything,".

756
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,221
To us,
it was like this is her way.

757
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,057
Of showing
that she's accepting us.

758
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,961
- It wasn't that she loved
her son... she <i>loved</i> her son.

759
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:48,565
And whatever it took
to be near him, she did.

760
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,168
If she had to push a plow,

761
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,071
She would,
just to be near her son.

762
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:57,074
- She has this picture where
they went to grauman theatre.

763
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,343
And saw elvis' handprints.

764
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,411
She said that was
the happiest day of her life.

765
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,482
I think she truly enjoyed
coming out to california.

766
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,317
- And then she would get back
to indiana,

767
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,555
And, basically, wouldn't
acknowledge tom's life here.

768
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,756
And, you know, again,

769
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,391
It was kind of like
just baby steps.

770
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,293
Truly, after like a few times,

771
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,662
We felt like she was okay
with us.

772
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,731
And she was happy for us.

773
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,433
She even insisted
on Tom and me taking the bedroom.

774
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,303
While she stayed on the sofa
with our dog.

775
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:30,540
- Justin. I can't believe you.

776
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,409
Look at me.

777
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:35,445
How could you...

778
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,714
Leave all alone?

779
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:41,385
Okay, I miss you, and you just
want to stay with her.

780
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,287
You're such a traitor.

781
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,792
Yeah. You put that head down.

782
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:52,562
- Tom was obsessed with his dog.

783
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:56,166
Tom was always,
always taking pictures of him.

784
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,402
It was like someone
with, like, a newborn baby.

785
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:02,072
He was actually found abandoned
under a car in hollywood.

786
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:05,809
- Hi, napoleon. How are you?

787
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,377
- He had a santa claus outfit,

788
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,446
And he had
some other crazy outfit.

789
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:10,680
And I thought, "oh, my god."

790
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,282
"this is not
gonna be two gay boys.

791
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,784
With their gay, little dog,
is it?"

792
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,420
And sure enough...
pretty quick, on facebook,

793
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,155
Tom was taking pictures of
justin bobby.

794
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:20,057
In his little rain gear.

795
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,591
And I thought, "oh, my god.
You guys, come on."

796
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,127
You got to quit that."
[ chuckles ]

797
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,496
So...

798
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,799
[ "you belong to me" plays ]

799
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,271
- Another dream
that Tom and I had,

800
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,074
Aside from wanting to be married
and have a family,

801
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,077
Was we wanted
to travel the world together.

802
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,113
And our goal was to hit
all the wonders of the world.

803
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:47,184
And we managed to make it
to four before Tom died.

804
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:52,689
- d See the pyramids
along the nile d

805
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:57,360
d Watch the sunrise
on a tropic isle d

806
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,162
- They enjoyed living.

807
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,731
When they traveled together,
that's what would just amaze me,

808
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:05,702
Where they went to egypt and
to peru and london and paris.

809
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,306
- The way Tom and Shane were able
to afford these trips.

810
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,374
Is they're, first of all,
very frugal,

811
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:16,213
And not only did Shane work
the job that he did for us,

812
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,281
Tom would work, you know,
get extra jobs.

813
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,517
Doing commercials or whatever.

814
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,652
So they could travel
to all these places.

815
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,287
And they didn't go first class.

816
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,456
They would travel
like they were students.

817
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,325
- The first trip
I remember them taking.

818
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,394
Was to egypt, down the nile.

819
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,797
But [chuckles] it wasn't
the kind of trip.

820
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,398
That <i>I</i> would have gone on.

821
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,833
They slept on the deck.

822
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,869
With canvas dividers,
covered in blankets,

823
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:40,270
And Tom caught pneumonia,

824
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,539
But they had
one heck of a good time.

825
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:49,246
- d Just remember
till you're home again d

826
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,449
d You belong to me

827
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:56,653
[ song ends ]

828
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,321
- Tom and I reached a point.

829
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,390
Where we were ready
for him to come to montana.

830
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,360
You know, I kept talking
about how beautiful montana is.

831
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,829
But for me, it was more about...
you know, I was just excited.

832
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,631
For him to finally meet
my entire family.

833
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,901
- My dad, all his life,
was a logger.

834
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,769
I mean, he told gay jokes...

835
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,839
Not the type of person that
you could sit down and be like,

836
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,176
"hey, your son's gay,"
and he would take it easily.

837
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,212
- The first time I ever met tom,

838
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,613
I had just been to town,

839
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,616
And I had seen my daughter's car
in the driveway.

840
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:30,654
- So Shane and Tom [chuckles]
jumped in the closet to hide,

841
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,557
And then my dad walks in,

842
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,926
And they both jump out
of the closet like, "surprise!"

843
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:38,662
- And here's my boy,
and here's his partner.

844
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,730
And it worked...
they surprised me.

845
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,265
- And we just thought.

846
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,434
It was funnier than hell
that they did that,

847
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,837
Because it's like they came out
of the closet at my dad's house.

848
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,740
- Tom, he knew
I was a macho-type guy,

849
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,509
And maybe that I was gonna have.

850
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,879
The macho-type conservatism
that wouldn't accept him,

851
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,615
And you could just see
he tried all the time around me.

852
00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,916
And I appreciated that...

853
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,952
Him trying,
him trying to be likeable.

854
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,454
It was easy to like tom.
He was a great guy.

855
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,822
- Tom was a pistol.

856
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,325
He was so much fun to be around.

857
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,827
I saw that he made Shane laugh.

858
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,796
It's the type of happiness
you have.

859
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,431
When you meet your soul mate.

860
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,834
And that made
all my worries just disappear.

861
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,704
- So, Tom and I went to arizona
to visit my grandparents.

862
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,872
- Shane was so happy.

863
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,375
It was the happiest
that I'd ever seen him,

864
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,644
Since he was a little kid on up.

865
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,946
- And my great-grandma pat
was there.

866
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,582
And no one told grandma pat
that Tom and I were a couple.

867
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,351
She was like,
"oh, nice to meet you."

868
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,820
And then, later,
I heard her in the other room.

869
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:39,589
Ask my grandma judy like,
"so, who was that guy?"

870
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,558
- Well, I never knew
Shane was gay,

871
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,294
But I met his partner,
and he was a very nice guy,

872
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,931
And we all liked him
and went along fine with it.

873
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,967
- Tom was fascinated with
grandma pat for a few reasons.

874
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,802
You know, every year,
she keeps track.

875
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,037
Of how many snakes she kills.

876
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,373
- Well,
I'm always after a snake...

877
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,874
I don't want them around.

878
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,844
- I mean, you killed
up to how many in a spring...

879
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,045
Every spring?

880
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,281
- Oh,
I killed up to 40 or better.

881
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,651
- After Tom and I went for a walk
with both of my grandmas,

882
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,586
When we were coming back
into the house,

883
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,521
Grandma pat like put her arm
around tom.

884
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,490
She was like,
"welcome to the family."

885
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:14,958
She's 90 years old,

886
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,728
And, you know, she's accepting
our relationship.

887
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,363
- People that talk about them,

888
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,332
They don't understand
a lot of it.

889
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:26,469
- And they think that, if they go
to church and everything,

890
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,004
That god will take care of it...

891
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,540
They can be just like
all the rest of the guys.

892
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,509
And so you can't get through
to them.

893
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:35,445
To tell you the truth,
I'm tired of hearing about it...

894
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,647
So they're not romeo and juliet.

895
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,583
- That's right...
they're romeo and romeo.

896
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,419
Get over it.

897
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:46,856
- I did not like to show any
public display of affection...

898
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,093
Whether it would be us
on a plane flying somewhere,

899
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,562
And we wanted
to be affectionate,

900
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,098
We would actually take
a coat or a blanket.

901
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,436
And cover our arms and like
hold hands under the blanket.

902
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,874
- I think that Shane
was very conscious.

903
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,377
Of where they were.

904
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,380
And not making other people
uncomfortable.

905
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:11,881
- I never really wanted.

906
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:15,018
To say, "I love you"
in front of friends or anyone.

907
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,120
So we developed
this little code...

908
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,022
Whether we're at like
a dinner or a party,

909
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:22,392
One of us would find a way just
to tap the table three times.

910
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,960
Just to say, "I love you."

911
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:28,932
So, that became a very special
sound for both of us.

912
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:34,604
- Tom was just so passionate,
and he was so affectionate.

913
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,474
That it sort of brought Shane
out of his shell a little bit,

914
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,410
As far as, you know,
being out in public.

915
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,679
And not being ashamed
or embarrassed.

916
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,015
That, you know, "yeah, this
is my partner, and we're gay."

917
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,817
So what?

918
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,152
- Once, we were in paris,

919
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:50,553
And we were in front
of the eiffel tower,

920
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,689
I just decided like,
"screw it...

921
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,892
I'm just gonna sneak in a kiss,"
and I did.

922
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,728
Tom's face... he was just like,
"like, what just happened?"

923
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,463
He was so excited.

924
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,965
But then the first thing
we did after the kiss,

925
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,634
We like looked around,
like, "did anyone see us?"

926
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:10,607
But I'm so happy that I did that
'cause he was just thrilled.

927
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,111
- Tom wanted to marry Shane,
but he wanted it to be legal.

928
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:18,748
He wasn't gonna settle
for a technicality,

929
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,950
Or an, "oh, it happens
to be legal right this minute",

930
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,752
But tomorrow it could not be."

931
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,555
He was the kind of man
that just stood up for things,

932
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:26,990
And I think part of it.

933
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,426
Was like he wanted to show
everyone back home that,

934
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,960
"I'm serious. This is me."

935
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,763
- He bought me a ring
for christmas,

936
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,867
And we had agreed to not spend
any money on each other.

937
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,169
- He would tell me, he'd be like,
"but Shane's gonna get mad,"

938
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:40,670
Because we have a budget,

939
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,071
"but I just want
to get it for him so bad."

940
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,706
- And I opened it,
and it was a ring.

941
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,176
With a note in it that said,

942
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,112
"2011 will change our lives
forever.

943
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,182
Love, tom."

944
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,050
- I had the image of their
wedding played out in my head.

945
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,652
I knew
it was gonna happen someday.

946
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,687
There was no question
that they wanted to spend.

947
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,856
The rest of their lives together
and have a family.

948
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,858
- That was something he wanted
so bad.

949
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,660
He used to say,

950
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,829
"you know, I'd love to have
a little thomas running around."

951
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,597
- And I guess
one of the saddest parts,

952
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,199
When I really think
about Shane and tom,

953
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,600
Is the fact that, essentially,

954
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,235
They were living
the american dream,

955
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,838
With the exception of being able
to get married to each other.

956
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,506
Well, everyone, like, brings up
domestic partnership,

957
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,476
And it angers me in a way,

958
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:21,110
Because no little girl
is sitting in her room.

959
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,745
And saying that,

960
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,013
"I can't wait to have
a domestic partnership.

961
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,849
"I can't wait to wear
a white dress.

962
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,484
During my domestic partnership."

963
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:30,119
That's not something
that people dream about.

964
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,956
They dream
about getting married.

965
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,557
And they weren't allowed
to do that.

966
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,825
And if it is ever legal,

967
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,961
They'll never be able
to experience it,

968
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,696
Because he's not here anymore.

969
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,703
- I was lucky to see tom
the Wednesday before he died.

970
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,105
d Getting closer to the edge

971
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:53,209
d if I fall,
will someone catch me? d

972
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,879
And we talked about,
you know, Shane,

973
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:59,182
And he said,
"I learned what love really is."

974
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,519
I used to have this idea
in my head when I was young,

975
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:05,722
And being with Shane,
I've learned.

976
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,057
What it really looks like
on a daily basis,

977
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:11,594
And it's so much more
than I ever thought possible.

978
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:15,231
That's what the song's called...
"if I fall."

979
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,134
-d even if I fall

980
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,836
- [ chuckles ]
thank you for that.

981
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,804
- Thank you for that.
- You're very welcome.

982
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,873
- All right. So, there you go.

983
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,675
"If I fall"... are we agreeing.

984
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:26,976
That's what we're gonna call
the song?

985
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,311
All right.

986
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:38,254
- The thing that haunts me now
is we had a fight that morning.

987
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:41,224
Originally, we were supposed
to hang out with our friend alex.

988
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,026
And go take photographs
together.

989
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,961
And after our little argument,

990
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,930
I decided
that I would just stay home.

991
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,198
- Tom and I decided to meet
at the studio.

992
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,334
And we kept
going back and forth.

993
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:53,736
And he was like,
"let's go to your place.

994
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,306
"I just remember
the sunlight in the kitchen.

995
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,574
I need
some of that sunlight now."

996
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,676
And I was like, "okay."

997
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,244
He was like, "no, " I want to do
something good for you.

998
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,880
Let's do a photo shoot.
It'll turn this day around."

999
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,782
So, I had just started dating
this man,

1000
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,151
And it was his birthday,
and I wasn't with him,

1001
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,787
So Tom was like,
"I want to make him jealous,

1002
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,989
So let's put pictures of you
on facebook."

1003
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,724
And he was the one
that was like, "let's do it."

1004
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,758
Let's do it."
[ chuckles ]

1005
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,759
"Hey, can I do your hair?"

1006
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,328
I was like, "um, okay."

1007
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,732
And I have, you know,
my brassiere filled with socks,

1008
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,701
'cause, you know,
there's just not much there.

1009
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,870
- So, Tom and I were texting
throughout the day.

1010
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,973
And we eventually made up.

1011
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,175
- It wasn't even a discussion.

1012
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,642
Whether or not
to go to the roof,

1013
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,077
Because we always went
to the roof.

1014
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,045
- And we told each other
that we love each other.

1015
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:41,985
And I'm so thankful that we did
'cause I have that forever now.

1016
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:45,088
- And so, by the time
we get up to the roof,

1017
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,656
Tom has his camera.

1018
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:47,957
He's all ready.

1019
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,993
- We'd all been up there
like 50 times,

1020
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,728
And every time,
I'm just paranoid.

1021
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,663
'Cause it's not like
a tall wall.

1022
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:54,998
It's a short wall.

1023
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,368
- He was just playing around
with the camera,

1024
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,070
And, meanwhile, I know that he
had just been texting to Shane.

1025
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:03,673
I told him
to stay away from the edge,

1026
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,209
'cause we all know
that he's a klutz.

1027
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,944
And he even wrote back.

1028
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,413
He was like, "ha-ha! I will... "
like, I was joking.

1029
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,182
And I said, "tom, I'm serious."

1030
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,817
Like, stay away from the edge."

1031
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,121
- So, he takes
a bunch of pictures.

1032
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:21,024
I'm trying to be as slutty...

1033
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:24,293
You know, not sexy,
'cause it wasn't sexy.

1034
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:27,864
I'm in one corner,
and then we suddenly switch.

1035
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,667
And he's like, "[gasps]
I've got it! I've got it!"

1036
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,836
So, he takes
like three or four steps back.

1037
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,305
[ Camera shutter clicks,
camera whirring ]

1038
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,015
I don't think it registered
that he was gonna fall.

1039
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,051
He was like, "ha-ha!"
and I was like, "ohh."

1040
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,419
You know, and I looked at him,

1041
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,154
And it was like we both thought,
"oh, no.

1042
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:52,855
Shane's gonna be so mad."

1043
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,958
You know, just like if he knew
that we were that close.

1044
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,762
And then, after that,
it was a nightmare.

1045
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:02,999
I didn't even go look
over the edge.

1046
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,902
I just, like, threw my shoes on,
ran downstairs.

1047
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:07,737
I had my phone
in my back pocket,

1048
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,739
And I dialed 911,
but I couldn't hear.

1049
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:12,041
So I just gave it to somebody
out in the hallway,

1050
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,910
'cause people heard him.

1051
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:18,915
- I received a text from alex
to tell me that Tom had fallen.

1052
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,719
And I thought it was a joke...
"there's no way this is real."

1053
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,355
So I texted her back,
and I said, "that's not funny."

1054
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:29,325
And then I didn't hear back
from her.

1055
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,828
And so then I called
tom's phone,

1056
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,996
And no one picked up.

1057
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:37,400
So at that moment is when
my heart just started racing.

1058
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:41,771
By the time I got there,
he's on, you know, his stomach.

1059
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,506
And I'm rubbing his back.

1060
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,408
And I'm saying, "it's okay,
tommy. It's okay, tommy."

1061
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,310
Meanwhile,
I look like a total hooker.

1062
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,011
[ Chuckles ]

1063
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:52,949
But it takes forever for
the ambulance to get there...

1064
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,118
I want to say 25 minutes later.

1065
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,419
They were like,
"do you have his I.D.?

1066
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,087
Do you have his I.D.?"

1067
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,789
And I was like,
"what the fuck does it matter?!

1068
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,257
Just get him on the ambulance!"

1069
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,859
- So, I got to the e.R.,

1070
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:04,794
And they took me into a room
where alex was,

1071
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,796
And she was hysterical.

1072
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:13,503
- And when I first saw Shane,
I said, "I wish it were me."

[ sniffles ]

1074
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:20,476

is so strong,

[ sniffles ]

1078
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:31,921

"well, what's happening?

1079
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,122
Are they working on him?"
I didn't know anything.

1080
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,824
And she didn't know anything.

1081
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:39,262
- We hugged, you know,
and we said we loved each other.

1082
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:44,066
And I was still hanging
on to hope that he was okay.

1083
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,301
- I tried calling Shane,

1084
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,435
And I couldn't get through
to him.

And, finally, he calls me back.

He said, "mom,
Tom was doing a photo shoot",

And he fell off the roof."

get the prayers going here."

"michaela, please pray...
tom's hurt."

00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:08,524
And I immediately got down
and started praying.

1094

- So, a little bit later,
he calls me,

1095

And he says, "mom, they won't
let me in to see him."

1096
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,598
And I said, "well, how come?"

1097
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,301
And they said,
"because I'm not family."

1098
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,136
And I just...
"oh, my god, Shane."

she says was,

"well, how much
was he drinking, Shane?"

1103
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:34,250
And then his dad,
in the background, was saying,

1104
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:38,054
"well, what the hell
was he doing on the roof?"

1105

From that point forward,
I made sure.

- Alex was crying, and she was
continually doing this...

I think because
she was just so traumatized.

By his bed, holding his hand.

And he said no.

So I kept trying
to argue with this nurse.

And the lady was like,
"I understand, honey... I do.

"But it's against

I said, "but he <i>is</i> his family.

And she was holding

You know, it's not a gay thing.

00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,690
And Tom was gone.

1237
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,760
So, I picked martha
up from the airport,

1238
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,763
And we went to our house.

1239
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,798
She wanted to talk
about bank accounts...

1240
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,769
All these things that I did
not want to talk about.

1241
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:38,007
- I remember her looking
around the rooms a lot.

1242
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:41,010
And I didn't really want
to think that way.

1243
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:42,544
I had the feeling.

1244
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,880
That she just wanted
to go through his stuff.

1245
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,483
- She wanted to go through
all of Shane and tom's clothes.

1246
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,485
He let her go through
all the drawers.

1247
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:52,921
She tried to take the computers
that were Shane and tom's.

1248
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,690
It was just like
Shane didn't exist anymore.

1249
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,425
- Shane was more than willing
to work with her,

1250
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:58,927
Give her anything she wanted
of tom's,

1251
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:02,931
But it started
to invade his privacy,

1252
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,967
And he wouldn't say anything.

1253
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,769
Martha would make a comment
about something,

1254
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,837
And Shane would just stuff
the emotions away,

1255
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,939
Like back
when kids would call him names.

1256
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:13,575
- I couldn't
say anything, anyway.

1257
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,011
I had no legal right
to stop her.

1258
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,515
So, tom's mom was waiting,
along with us,

1259
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,684
For the coroner to release
his body.

1260
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,786
Due to the circumstances
of the accident,

1261
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:26,322
They had to do an autopsy.

1262
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:28,324
- We started talking
about the funeral.

1263
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:30,459
And she said that,
no, we're all invited.

1264
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:31,827
We could stay at their house.

1265
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,629
You know, "come as a family."

1266
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,831
We'll just do all this
together."

1267
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:40,736
- She was very, you know,
"I'm taking my baby home.

1268
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,871
You guys are all coming with.
I want you to be there."

1269
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:44,540
- And then, as the days go on,

1270
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,975
She pretty much
quit talking about the funeral.

1271
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:48,811
And about us all going.

1272
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:52,581
And sharing tom
with everybody back east.

1273
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,351
- Tom's mom was in the other room
or even sometimes.

1274
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,820
Right next to me
making the funeral arrangements.

1275
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:02,024
And planning it all out,
and I was not a part of it.

1276
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:05,594
It was like I wasn't there.
It was like I was a ghost.

1277
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,696
- She was a mother
who'd just lost her son...

1278
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,665
Her 20-something-year-old son...

1279
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,635
So there were no expectations
other than grief.

1280
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:17,673
But I didn't think
that she was gonna hurt Shane.

1281
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:20,109
I thought that she loved Shane.

1282
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:24,113
- The feeling <i>I</i> got was something
was awry,

1283
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,949
But nobody could put their
[chuckles] finger on it.

1284
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,083
- And then,
that Thursday morning,

1285
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,651
Martha was like, "I got to go."

1286
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:31,053
And Shane's like,
"I'll drive you to the airport."

1287
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,755
She's like,
"no, I'll get a taxi."

1288
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,023
- I told her, "I'm not gonna
let you take a taxi."

1289
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,658
I kind of had a feeling.

1290
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,528
That she knew something
that I didn't know,

1291
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,465
That she knew that his body was
gonna be released any moment.

1292
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,834
- She was packing.

1293
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:48,837
All tom's clothes up that
she was gonna bury him in,

1294
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,140
And the jacket
that she wanted to put him in.

1295
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:52,841
Was not fitting in the suitcase.

1296
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,877
And Shane's like,
"it's okay, martha.

1297
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:57,112
I'll just bring it."
and she was like, "no.

1298
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,113
Absolutely not."

1299
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:01,183
So, maybe looking back now,

1300
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:05,721
It could have been foreshadowing
what could have happened,

1301
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,456
That she knew then.

1302
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,857
That she wasn't gonna let Shane
come to the funeral.

1303
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:12,728
- And I dropped her off,
and we hugged.

1304
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,064
And I asked her
to please keep me updated.

1305
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,599
So I know what's happening,

1306
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,535
And she promised me
that she would.

1307
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:22,504
But I never
heard from her again.

1308
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,674
- She was so grateful
and so loving towards us.

1309
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:27,509
For everything that we did
for her son.

1310
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,446
She just was crying and
hugging us and holding on to us.

1311
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,748
And, "I want to be a part
of your life."

1312
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,650
I want to come visit."

1313
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:37,920
It was like
we were bonded with her.

1314
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:40,122
And then,
the next day, she was gone.

1315
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,692
- I talked to tom's mom
the day after he died.

1316
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:45,461
And she said, "I'll let you know."

1317
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:46,995
As soon as I know
when the funeral is gonna be.

1318
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,230
"So that you can be there."

1319
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:50,632
Then, it was pretty much
radio silence.

1320
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,000
They never called me back
to tell me when it was,

1321
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,202
And I was very hurt.

1322
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,504
I see the notice
in the newspaper...

1323
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,840
Wake is this day.
Funeral is the next day.

1324
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:01,944
I called tom's house to verify,

1325
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:05,047
And, you know, the relative
who answered just said,

1326
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,482
"if that's what the paper says,

1327
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,950
Then I would probably
go by that."

1328
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,686
- And I personally called back.

1329
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:13,655
To different mortuaries
in his hometown.

1330
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,023
To try to get information,

1331
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,259
And nobody would give us
any information.

1332
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:20,162
- So, although I never heard
from martha,

1333
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:24,233
My mom and alex and I,
we all booked our plane tickets.

1334
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:25,968
During our layover,

1335
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,236
I received a phone call
from one of tom's relatives.

1336
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:30,672
And she wanted to let me know.

1337
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,141
That I wasn't welcome
to attend his funeral,

1338
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,877
Because, if I do show up,

1339
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,146
His uncle and his father
had planned an attack.

1340
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,282
And she wanted me to know.

1341
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:44,152
That it's for my own safety
that I don't go.

1342
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,021
- All I could think of...
"are they gonna shoot him?

1343
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,923
Are they gonna kill my son?"

1344
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:51,093
When we got into indiana,

1345
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,195
One of tom's best friends
picked us up.

1346
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,197
And alex was hysterical.

1347
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,800
And the closer we got to knox,
the more hysterical she got.

1348
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,870
And she was saying, "I lost tom.
I don't want to lose you, also."

1349
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,572
- I was terrified.

1350
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:06,742
That they were gonna come
and pull out a gun on Shane.

1351
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,845
- I remember him saying
more than once,

1352
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,747
"you know,
they're in a lot of pain.

1353
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,815
It's not just me
that's going through this,".

1354
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,319
And almost arguing for them,
which was maddening.

1355
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,787
I mean, I'd be angry...

1356
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,789
"you're not gonna do this
to me."

1357
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,926
Nope.
He didn't respond that way.

1358
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:27,563
- We had a secret location
to come up with a plan about,

1359
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:30,032
You know, just kind of staying
out of their way.

1360
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:33,068
And even though I couldn't
be in the church,

1361
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,805
Like, I still wanted to be
as close as I could to tom.

1362
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:43,145
You know, just being near
was somehow comforting.

1363
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:44,913
- Once I realized.

1364
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,915
That Shane had been banned
from attending the funeral,

1365
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,283
I realized that's why.

1366
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,118
They weren't telling anybody
when things were.

1367
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,155
They basically were keeping
all the information close-hold.

1368
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:54,923
So that Shane
couldn't get there.

1369
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,260
-d In the blink of an eye

1370
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:02,698
d everything has changed

1371
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,668
- There were probably
800 people there.

1372
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,370
Half of them were there
to support tom,

1373
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,772
And the other half
were there to support martha.

1374
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,875
- d If I could have
one more day d

1375
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:18,647
d I'd spend it all with you

1376
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,248
- The casket was in the middle.

1377
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,217
And it was draped
with a culver blanket.

1378
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,186
And all of his culver
accomplishments,

1379
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,989
And his mom was wearing
his culver ring.

1380
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,726
I think it was very reflective
of the family.

1381
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:35,697
And how they viewed tom,
and not the Tom that I knew.

1382
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,633
When I got up to martha,

1383
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,201
All I could think
in my head was,

1384
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,136
"I have to kiss the casket
for Shane."

1385
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:45,974
And I made my way over
