00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:05,097
[projector whirring]

2
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:11,963
- The poster
that came out in Europe,

3
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,180
at least in England,
I believe,

4
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:18,837
before the movie was released
in Europe said,

5
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:23,004
"The wave of terror
that swept across America."

6
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:26,176
And Kubrick controlled
the posters very carefully.

7
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:29,338
Now,
it made you do a double take.

8
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,753
I remember seeing it in Europe.

9
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:32,300
I was the Rome Bureau Chief
at the time for ABC News.

10
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,671
And I remember looking at it.

11
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,173
It said, "The wave of terror
that swept across America."

12
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,170
What's he talking about?

13
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:41,921
And you'd sort of think
that he was talking about

14
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,013
the impact
of the book The <i>Shining.</i>

15
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:45,254
Maybe.

16
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,971
The impact of the movie
that had just opened over there?

17
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:48,962
Maybe.

18
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,503
It didn't quite fit.

19
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,300
The wave of terror
that swept across America

20
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,546
from Portland, Maine,
to Portland, Oregon,

21
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,341
was the genocidal armies
and the white men with their ax

22
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:01,419
clearing it all and bringing in
extractive industries,

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,919
among many other good things
as well.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,171
But that was the wave of terror
that swept across America,

25
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,842
terrifying, of course,
the American Indians.

26
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:34,879
- I went in to see this movie in
Leicester Square Movie Theater,

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,214
right near
Leicester Square in London.

28
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,048
And I remember it
quite clearly from...

29
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,088
I can even remember the seats
we were sitting in.

30
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,461
If I went back to that theater,
I could point them to you,

31
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:48,084
sort of near the back
and over to the left.

32
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,961
From the moment of the opening
astonishing helicopter shot,

33
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,834
I was terrified.

34
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,458
I had no idea what was coming.

35
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,301
I remember sort of sitting
on the front edge

36
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,833
of my theater seat there
to keep from falling off.

37
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,710
And I remember gripping my
belt buckle with my left hand,

38
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,000
I think it was...

39
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,001
yes, my left hand,
sort of to keep from falling off

40
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:14,999
the edge of the seat
and to try to control my terror

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,294
as I watched this movie.

42
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,666
I had no idea what was coming.

43
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,879
I hadn't read the book.

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,295
I had barely seen
any of the posters.

45
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:26,416
And I remember that I was
stunned when the movie was over.

46
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:29,165
We left the theater, went in...

47
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,008
down into
our underground car park

48
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,539
to get into the car to leave.

49
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,337
And as we were driving up
out of the car park,

50
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,998
I was sitting
in the back left seat.

51
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:42,082
I was thinking, "What was that?
What was that?

52
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,082
"What was it?
What was it?

53
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,123
What was it?"

54
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,956
And I think
my visual imagination

55
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,629
looked at that
Calumet baking powder can,

56
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,170
the one right behind
Hallorann's head

57
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:53,414
when he was talking to Danny.

58
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,710
I knew what "calumet" meant.

59
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,206
It meant "peace pipe."

60
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:01,664
And I thought to myself,
"peace pipe, Indians.

61
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,956
"Oh, my goodness,

62
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:05,003
they're all over the place
in that movie."

63
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,582
[ball thudding]

64
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:14,422
- The loser
has to keep America clean.

65
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,121
- And I suddenly
said to my friends,

66
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:23,585
"That movie
was about the genocide

67
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,043
of the American Indians."

68
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,208
And they said,
"What are you talking about?"

69
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,543
And I started explaining it,

70
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,288
because I'd noticed
the Calumet baking soda can.

71
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,334
In the first... the first time
we seen one,

72
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:36,579
it's a single
baking powder can straight on.

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,454
And you can see the whole word,
"Calumet,"

74
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,663
so there's no duplicity,

75
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,380
like the little girls
represent later.

76
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,287
This is an honest truth,

77
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,371
an honest peace pipe
between them.

78
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,088
The other time we see
the Calumet baking powder cans

79
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,331
is when they're
very carefully placed

80
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,126
behind Jack Nicholson's head
when he's talking to Grady.

81
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:01,079
- No need to rub it in,
Mr. Grady.

82
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:06,498
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

83
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,245
- There's about six
or seven of them stacked up,

84
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,833
and they're
all turned different ways,

85
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,997
and you can't read
any one of them completely.

86
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:16,087
It's... I've always interpreted
those as being broken,

87
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:18,494
dishonest peace pipe treaties.

88
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,496
They're not... these two guys,
Grady and Jack,

89
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:24,577
are not being honest
with each other.

90
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:27,327
Grady is trying to get Jack
to go kill his family

91
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,666
and commit genocide,

92
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,162
in the larger sense
of the movie.

93
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,452
You know, I mean,
Kubrick often,

94
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:35,786
in many of his movies,

95
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,455
he will end them
with a puzzle

96
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,169
so that he forces you to go out
of the theater saying,

97
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,035
"What was that about?"

98
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,117
And he would put things
in the scenes

99
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,664
that he knows will be,
among other things,

100
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:49,706
like confirmers when people
start to try to figure out

101
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,493
what the movie is about.

102
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:54,284
And we know he took
this kind of care.

103
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:56,283
There's a photograph
in one of the books

104
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,909
that actually shows Kubrick

105
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,751
carefully arranging
objects on the shelves

106
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,242
in that dry goods room.

107
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,867
I thought afterwards,

108
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:06,994
"How come I saw this and
a lot of other people didn't?"

109
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:08,783
And I've thought about it.

110
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,122
It's a combination of factors.

111
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:12,959
First, I grew up in Chicago
and, therefore,

112
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,324
just north
of the Calumet Harbor

113
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:19,784
and spent summers up
in the sand dunes of Michigan,

114
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,500
around on the other side
of Lake Michigan.

115
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,661
My father
took me and my sister out

116
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,242
to collect little bits
of Indian pottery.

117
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:27,664
I'd already...
I'd already covered,

118
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:29,199
at that point in 1980,

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,158
five years
of the Lebanese civil war.

120
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,533
I was, at that point,
covering John Paul ll.

121
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,032
I was the Rome Bureau Chief.

122
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,952
And listening
to what he was saying about...

123
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:41,575
because he had experienced
the Holocaust at its epicenter

124
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:43,698
and also other horrors.

125
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,741
And so all of those factors

126
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,865
were very much alive in my mind

127
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,657
when we went
to see The Shining,

128
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:53,034
which I just thought was going
to be some kind of horror movie

129
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:54,031
by this great moviemaker.

130
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:58,949
And all of those coming together
along with the little key,

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,822
the Calumet baking soda can,

132
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:04,490
is why I just happened
to tune to it

133
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:09,281
as we were driving up out of
that underground parking garage

134
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,497
just off Leicester Square.

135
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,037
- I first saw the movie in 1980
when it first came out

136
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,905
and saw it probably two times.

137
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,075
I can say that I remembered
the skier poster.

138
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,494
That is one thing
that really stuck with me.

139
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,321
And the window.

140
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,660
The window in the office,

141
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,827
that's another thing
that really stuck with me.

142
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:34,867
I remember, you know,
in the newspapers afterwards,

143
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,033
people being disappointed.

144
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,780
And I remember people
that I knew,

145
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,372
yes, in dialogue afterwards,

146
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:43,196
being disappointed that it was
not more a horror film.

147
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:47,529
Well, no Kubrick film's
really just a regular movie.

148
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,363
I understood that from,

149
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:52,159
well, when I was 10 years old
and I first saw 2001.

150
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,154
I walked away.

151
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,698
I thought, "This is a film

152
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,742
that's supposed
to make me think."

153
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,487
- I had my first
religious experience

154
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:08,028
seeing the film
<i>2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968.</i>

155
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:14,487
I was a smart kid
and liked art,

156
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,819
but I really
did not like movies

157
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,486
and thought that they
were really a substandard art.

158
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,988
And, you know, films like

159
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:25,027
<i>My Fair Lady
and Doctor Dolittle were out.</i>

160
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:30,153
And it was a rather pathetic
time in the '60s for films.

161
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:32,652
And my girlfriend,
she pulled up

162
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:36,319
and told me that she'd
seen a movie the night before

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,318
and she wanted to see it again.

164
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,161
So she took me to the theater,
the Cinerama Dome,

165
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:42,693
and I watched it.

166
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:47,027
And I had never in my life
envisioned that a movie

167
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,485
could do what this movie
was doing.

168
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:52,327
And it was showing me things
that I had never seen,

169
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,985
and it was
intellectually challenging.

170
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:59,817
And it was an artistic
masterpiece in every way,

171
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:04,317
from the soundtrack to
the visuals to the story line.

172
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:07,240
And when the movie ended,
I couldn't get out of my seat.

173
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,651
I was frozen in the seat,

174
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:13,275
completely paralyzed
by what I'd just witnessed.

175
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:16,900
And the usher actually
had to come and get me out.

176
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,609
And I was the last person,
me and her.

177
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,025
And I staggered
out of the theater

178
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,733
completely changed
as a human being

179
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,985
and decided at that moment

180
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,983
that the only thing
that I wanted to do

181
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,650
for the rest of my life

182
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:33,150
was to make films
in one fashion or another.

183
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,275
And so I have done that.

184
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:40,191
So I owe Stanley Kubrick and
his film 2001: <i>A</i> Space Odyssey

185
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:44,857
everything for everything that
I have become in my life, so...

186
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,858
<i>[Also sprach Zarathustra plays]</i>

187
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:55,859
♪ ♪

188
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,990
- I saw a number
of Kubrick films

189
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,106
before I had
an academic interest in him.

190
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,648
And then I went to see
<i>The Shining in 1980.</i>

191
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,486
And frankly,
I didn't think that much of it.

192
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,983
I thought the other
Kubrick films that I'd seen

193
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,981
were far superior.

194
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:24,689
But as I thought
about the film afterwards...

195
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,859
and even when
I wasn't thinking about it...

196
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,107
there were things
that bothered me about it.

197
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:32,314
It seemed
as if I had missed something.

198
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,480
And so I went back
to see it again.

199
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:39,147
And I began to see
patterns and details

200
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:42,146
that I hadn't noticed before.

201
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:46,480
And so I kept watching the film
again and again and again.

202
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,438
And since
I'm trained as an historian

203
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:51,897
and my special expertise

204
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:56,771
is in the history of Germany
and Nazi Germany in particular,

205
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,364
I became
more and more convinced

206
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,145
that there is,
in this film,

207
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:06,114
a deeply laid subtext
that takes on The Holocaust.

208
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:12,895
I think
it probably was the typewriter,

209
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:16,978
which was a German brand,
which might seem arbitrary,

210
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,436
but by that time,
I knew enough about Kubrick

211
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:26,144
that most anything in his films
can't be regarded as arbitrary,

212
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,189
that anything...
especially objects and colors

213
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,063
and music and anything else,
probably have some intentional

214
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:36,144
as well as
unintentional meaning to them.

215
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,361
And so that struck me.

216
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,102
Why a German typewriter?

217
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,186
And in connection with that,

218
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:47,061
I began to see the number 42
appear in the film.

219
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:50,852
And for a German historian,
if you put the number 42

220
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,103
and a German typewriter
together,

221
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,477
you get the Holocaust,

222
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:59,893
because it was in 1942
that the Nazis made the decision

223
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:03,518
to go ahead and exterminate
all the Jews they could.

224
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,268
And they did so in
a highly mechanical, industrial,

225
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,726
and bureaucratic way.

226
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:13,643
And so the juxtaposition
of the number 42

227
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:16,565
and the typewriter was really
where it started for me

228
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:19,975
in terms of the historical
content of the film.

229
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,476
Of course "adler"
in German means "eagle."

230
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:24,977
And eagle, of course,
is a symbol of Nazi Germany.

231
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,270
It's also a symbol
of the United States.

232
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,485
And Kubrick
generally has recourse to eagles

233
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,272
to symbolize state power.

234
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:40,183
Kubrick read Raul Hilberg's

235
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,522
<i>The Destruction
of the European Jews.</i>

236
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:44,858
And Hilberg's
major theme in there

237
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:49,516
is that he focuses
on the apparatus of killing.

238
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:52,108
And he emphasizes
how bureaucratic it was

239
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:56,140
and how it was a matter
of lists and typewriters.

240
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,766
Spielberg picked that up in
<i>Schindler's List, of course.</i>

241
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:02,515
I mean, the film begins
with typewriters and lists

242
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,641
and ends with a list,
of course.

243
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,057
And so that informs...

244
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:09,770
and I had a chance
to talk to Raul Hilberg.

245
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,104
He visited Albion College.

246
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,474
And he said that he and Kubrick
corresponded about this.

247
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,600
And the fact that he read it
then, in the 1970s,

248
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:18,975
when there was a big wave
of interest in Hitler

249
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:22,264
and the Holocaust and the Nazis,
I think...

250
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,306
I think just tells us
that that typewriter,

251
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:26,932
that German typewriter...

252
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:30,058
which by the way, changes color
in the course of the film,

253
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,645
which typewriters
don't generally do...

254
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,767
is terribly,
terribly important

255
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:37,606
as a referent to that
particular historical event.

256
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:50,472
[projector whirring]

257
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:54,014
- I worked in a film archive
for a decade,

258
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,804
kind of like
fast-forwarding

259
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:01,137
through World War II
ten times a day.

260
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,888
But, you know, like,
when you see things

261
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,554
over and over and again,

262
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:06,430
their meanings change for you.

263
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:14,720
Like, when you see these... see,
like, World War ll newsreels,

264
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,471
like, after a while,
you come to realize

265
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:20,261
that it's all faked on film.

266
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:25,054
You are not seeing troops
storming Normandy.

267
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:30,137
You're seeing troops
storming a beach in Hollywood.

268
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:34,969
You know, like, you're not
seeing a plane flying to Japan.

269
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,971
You're seeing a plane flying
over, you know, New Mexico.

270
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:45,934
What you're really being shown
is, like, staged heroism.

271
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:50,510
You know, like, you're seeing
men moving with machines,

272
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:53,885
but you're not seeing what
they're talking about.

273
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:57,604
And I think that that's
something that Kubrick plays on.

274
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:02,719
Like, he plays on your
acceptance of visual infor...

275
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,135
and also your ignorance
of visual information.

276
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:10,552
Like he'll often, like,
put little special clues

277
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:13,644
that you see,
like, in the corner.

278
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:21,301
Every scene,
there's an impossibility,

279
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:24,635
like the TV doesn't have a cord

280
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:27,182
or even something as simple as,
like, them...

281
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:30,635
they, like...
they bring too much luggage up.

282
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:34,342
They, like... Jack, you know,
glances over at a pile

283
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,810
of their luggage
that they brought,

284
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,050
and ifs about the size
of a car.

285
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,050
You know, a lot of it is jokes.

286
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,967
Like, they're taking the tour.

287
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:47,383
They're crossing the street
from the maze

288
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,222
to go check out the garage.

289
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,300
Like, a car
is just about to hit them.

290
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,300
And then it cuts right before.

291
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,301
[chuckles]

292
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:08,591
- I had anticipated the film

293
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,299
and had read
the Stephen King novel

294
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,799
before the film came out and
found it a very appealing story.

295
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,132
And I had spent
a lot of time

296
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:22,965
at the Stanley Hotel
in Estes Park, Colorado,

297
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:26,887
which is where he was inspired
to write the book The Shining.

298
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:31,131
And so I, you know... I knew
a little bit of the background.

299
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:32,969
And when
Kubrick's film came out,

300
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,307
I was first in line to see it,
of course.

301
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:38,589
And I was just
really disappointed

302
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,714
and walked out of the theater

303
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:43,386
wondering what the hell
I had just witnessed.

304
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:50,380
And, I... actually,
my reverence for Stanley Kubrick

305
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:52,381
diminished after that.

306
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:58,297
I was disappointed, but I still
watched it every few years.

307
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:01,799
I couldn't understand why I was
so attracted to watching a film

308
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,796
that I actually didn't like.

309
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:07,713
And now
in all these years later,

310
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:11,296
I know why it is a great film.

311
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,755
It is a masterpiece,

312
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:15,347
but not for the reasons
that most people think.

313
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,795
We are dealing with a guy
who has a 200 IQ.

314
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:27,504
I believe
that when Stanley Kubrick

315
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:33,004
<i>finished with Barry Lyndon,
he was bored.</i>

316
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:36,503
He had conquered
the filmmaking landscape.

317
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:41,170
He had succeeded in making
masterpiece after masterpiece,

318
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:44,003
and he was bored.

319
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:46,712
<i>Barry Lyndon
is</i> a <i>boring movie.</i>

320
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,257
It is wonderfully shot.

321
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,253
It is beautifully costumed.

322
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:54,377
But it is a film
made by a guy who is bored.

323
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:57,086
And I could see that.

324
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:01,461
And so I think Stanley
retreated after Barry Lyndon.

325
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:06,586
And he began working on
a new kind of film,

326
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:10,835
a film that
had never been made before,

327
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:14,126
a film that was made
by a bored genius

328
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:20,710
who had thoroughly
emptied the jug of everything

329
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:22,928
that could be done
in filmmaking.

330
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,752
And he was looking
for the next thing.

331
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:31,126
And what he did was he began
reading Subliminal Seduction

332
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,548
and a number of other books
which were about how advertisers

333
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,460
were injecting...

334
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:40,417
injecting images,
subliminal images,

335
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:44,168
into advertising
to sell products more.

336
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,875
<i>- Suggestible trends.</i>

337
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,798
- You know, there'll be
an ad for Gilbey's Gin,

338
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,791
and inside, the ice cubes
will be various sex organs

339
00:18:54,792 --> 00:19:00,384
and things to add
a subliminal appeal to the ad.

340
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,499
Kubrick went
to these advertisers,

341
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,625
and he asked them
what their methods were.

342
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,666
And then he took those methods

343
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:14,708
and he applied them
to The Shining.

344
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:19,124
<i>Inside The Shining are
hundreds of subliminal images</i>

345
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,957
and shot line-ups.

346
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,373
And what
these images are telling

347
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:31,915
is an extremely disturbing
story about sexuality.

348
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:36,082
And the subtext of the story,

349
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,581
besides the other subtexts
of the story,

350
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:46,081
is a story of haunted
phantoms and demons

351
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:51,623
who are sexually attracted
to humans

352
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,123
and are feeding off of them.

353
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:59,997
You'd have to be able to be
a complete fanatic like I am

354
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,623
in order to find all this,

355
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,090
but, you know,
I'll give you my favorite.

356
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:08,289
I'm only gonna give you one,
but I'll give you my favorite.

357
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,163
When Jack meets
Stewart Ullman in the office

358
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,291
at the very beginning
of the movie

359
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,958
and he reaches over to shake
Jack Nicholson's hand...

360
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:21,048
and so step through
that scene frame by frame.

361
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:23,038
And the minute,
the moment,

362
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,288
the frame that he
and Jack Nicholson touch hands

363
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,954
and right after the line
that Barry Nelson says,

364
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:34,121
which is, "Nice to see you,"

365
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:40,495
you can see
that there's a paper...

366
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:44,162
a paper tray on the desk.

367
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:48,412
And as soon as they touch hands,
the paper tray

368
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,995
turns into a very large
straight-on hard-on

369
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:55,291
coming out of Barry nelson.

370
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,494
Yeah, it's hilarious.

371
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,453
It's a joke... a very serious
joke... but a joke by Stanley.

372
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:06,161
And there's
many of these in the film.

373
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:10,578
And very disturbing,
some of them.

374
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,623
And this will all be in my film,
Kubrick the Magician.

375
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:14,916
I'll give you one more.

376
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,119
This one's harder to find, okay?

377
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,789
And you have to know what
Stanley Kubrick looked like

378
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,999
<i>during the making</i> of
<i>The Shining to know this one.</i>

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,246
But if you go
to the opening credits

380
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:27,077
and you pan the frame...

381
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,660
you... you go through the frames,

382
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:33,577
right after it says
"Directed by Stanley Kubrick,"

383
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:38,285
as soon as his name
passes off the frame,

384
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:43,910
stop and you will see that the
clouds have Stanley Kubrick

385
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:48,784
airbrushed into them,
his face...

386
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:52,123
with the beard and the wild hair
and the whole thing.

387
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,162
I know this one's
a little harder to find.

388
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:55,454
And I will have to...

389
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:58,703
I will have to Photoshop
this one to show people it,

390
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:02,577
but there is definitely the
photograph of Stanley Kubrick

391
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:07,372
in one frame
airbrushed into the clouds.

392
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:12,411
- In most films,
a dissolve is used

393
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:16,200
to indicate a long passage
of time between two scenes.

394
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,620
<i>But in The Shining,
the dissolves go on for so long</i>

395
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,993
that they create
a superimposition,

396
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:26,616
where different scenes seem to
be interacting with each other.

397
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:30,616
For example,
you have the exterior image...

398
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:34,741
a tracking shot of the lobby

399
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:39,157
of the camera
moving along the western wall

400
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,282
south towards the entrance.

401
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:49,115
And you see
a janitor mopping the floor,

402
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,698
but it looks like he's...

403
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:53,791
it looks like
a he's a giant, mopping,

404
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:57,490
like, clearing the forest

405
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,823
because he's mopping, like,
a vacant area in the forest.

406
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:06,989
And then the...

407
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,405
then the ladder lines up...

408
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:16,072
lines up with the pyramid form
of the exterior of the hotel,

409
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:21,447
which, in the exterior set,
disappears.

410
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:22,660
Like, we don't see...

411
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,497
we only see that
in the Timberline exteriors.

412
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:29,113
But the England movie set
exteriors of the hotel,

413
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,197
like, the pyramid is missing,

414
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:36,945
and it seems as if the hotel

415
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:43,737
then takes both sides
of the Timberline Hotel

416
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:46,956
and then kind of, like,
makes a composite of it.

417
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:50,070
So it's... you know,
it's a perceptual shift

418
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:54,279
of making people
look like giants,

419
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,196
also making the hotel look
larger or smaller than it is.

420
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:02,538
I mean, these things
kind of litter the movie.

421
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,987
But then the shot goes on.

422
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,029
We see a...

423
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,201
we see a janitor pushing
a folded-up bed on wheels.

424
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:20,445
And then he's followed
by another...

425
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:24,527
he's followed by another guy,
who's carrying, like, one...

426
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,986
like, one coffee table?

427
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:30,281
And then another... like, another
guy is carrying one chair.

428
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:34,450
Like, where are these guys going
with, like, these light loads,

429
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:35,443
you know?

430
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,527
[chuckles]

431
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:41,818
Then we see Jack sitting
on a chair, eating lunch.

432
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,360
And the manager
and his assistant crosses paths

433
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,027
with two women who...

434
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,653
and just as he's
in the corner of the screen...

435
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,446
you just see it for a second.

436
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,613
You see one of the women
is wearing, like, a 13,

437
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:54,861
a number 13 jersey?

438
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:57,318
[child yelling in distance]

439
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,318
Can you hear that?

440
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,109
My boy, yelling?

441
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,109
Hold on one second.

442
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,279
I'm gonna see if I can...

443
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,118
I can see
if I can calm him down.

444
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:11,276
[door creaking]

445
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,941
You know,
so, like, he's like,

446
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:15,941
leaning back
and eating a sandwich.

447
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:18,567
And he's got, you know,
a magazine in his lap.

448
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:21,691
And as he stands up
to greet them,

449
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:23,113
he, like, throws it down.

450
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:25,275
And if you look at"
look at...

451
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,566
look at it, you know,
close up,

452
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:32,150
it's an actual
Playgirl magazine.

453
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:35,526
Yeah, a <i>Playgirl magazine
in the lobby of a hotel</i>

454
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,275
right in front of his boss,
like on his first day at work.

455
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,607
[laughs]

456
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,149
Yeah.

457
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,947
Like, the cover is like, people
getting ready for New Year's.

458
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:48,441
There's an article about incest.

459
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:51,986
At the beginning of the film,
Danny's been physically abused.

460
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,233
But there's a suggestion

461
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:55,779
that he's been
sexually abused as well.

462
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:02,064
You know, so like,
just in that one...

463
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:08,690
one shot, there's all these,
like, you know, complex things

464
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:09,984
going on in the background,

465
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,275
like things
that are choreographed

466
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:13,615
to match up exactly.

467
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:15,356
Like, we see a guy...

468
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:19,272
we see a guy, carrying a...

469
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:24,938
entering the room,
carrying a rug.

470
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,609
And by the time
the scene is just ending,

471
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,699
we see him
walking up the stairs.

472
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,147
Like, he's crossed
the entire place,

473
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:35,147
you know, timed exactly.

474
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:36,147
I don't even...

475
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:37,864
[chuckles]

476
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:40,689
Yeah.

477
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,730
- When Ullman
is leading the Torrances

478
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:54,813
out of the elevator
and into the Colorado Lounge

479
00:26:54,814 --> 00:27:00,104
for the first time,
there's a pile of suitcases.

480
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:03,021
And in the dissolve
into that scene,

481
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:07,478
the scene before,
a group of tourists

482
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,817
are standing in the lobby.

483
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:12,063
And those tourists
dissolve into the suitcases.

484
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,233
Now, as an historian
of the Holocaust,

485
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,895
I find that
very, very striking

486
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,272
and certainly not accidental

487
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:21,729
'cause he's using those
sort of cross-dissolves.

488
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,147
Now, that could be,
along with the ladder,

489
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,862
where he's trying to make
substantive connections

490
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,570
as well as formal ones.

491
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:36,937
- Oh, the window
in Ullman's office,

492
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:38,982
it is absolutely beautiful.

493
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,736
The casual viewer
isn't going to see

494
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:45,394
so many things
in Kubrick's films,

495
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:48,396
although I think they may
register unconsciously.

496
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:50,313
You know, but they're not
going to, you know,

497
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:51,774
perceive
perhaps these things

498
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,940
because as I've said,

499
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,976
he presents them
as being real.

500
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:57,271
You know, it's realism.

501
00:27:57,272 --> 00:27:59,018
And it's not
your typical horror...

502
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,270
you don't have a horror film

503
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:02,314
except for this one section
at the end,

504
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:06,643
right where Wendy walks in
and the lobby is blue

505
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,313
and you've got the cobwebs
all around.

506
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:09,479
And it's almost like

507
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,395
a Saturday morning
kind of horror film

508
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,939
suddenly there for a second.

509
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,393
And you kind of go.

510
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:17,731
"Ooh, what is this with
the skeletons and the cobwebs?"

511
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:19,270
And it's kind of cheesy.

512
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:21,812
But then, after that,
following that,

513
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,103
you've got her going down
the red hallway,

514
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,647
which...
on the big screen,

515
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,267
that's petrifying.

516
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,484
So I think the kind of
cheesiness before it

517
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:31,601
helps set up
that red hallway.

518
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,099
So anyway, what was I saying?

519
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,271
Right, the windows.

520
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,433
So you got... Jack has entered.

521
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,355
And you can see...
you are...

522
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:42,766
Kubrick shows you.

523
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,859
But he shows you this lobby,
and you get to see...

524
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,057
as Jack moves across the lobby,
you see the elevator beyond.

525
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:52,102
And you see beyond that,
a hallway.

526
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:55,312
You don't see yet how far back
it goes, you know,

527
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:58,310
the other things back there,
but you have an impression

528
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,771
that this place is towards
the middle of the hotel.

529
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,937
You just have that
impression that it's towards

530
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:05,599
the middle of the hotel.

531
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,146
And you go from the lobby into
the general manager's office

532
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:14,347
and then into Ullman's office,
and there's this window.

533
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,268
And the window's
a powerful window.

534
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,642
I mean, the light coming
through there is glaring.

535
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:21,015
It's like a character in itself.

536
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:23,140
It takes over.

537
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:26,603
And you've got these tendril-y,
sinister kind of trees

538
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:27,974
that are outside the window.

539
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,598
And you've got...

540
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,268
it's just such
a forceful presence,

541
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,981
this light
that comes over everything.

542
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:34,972
And, you know...

543
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,930
And there's
something wrong with it.

544
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:39,101
There's something wrong with it,

545
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,722
and I think it registers
as something wrong.

546
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:43,395
This is an impossible window.

547
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,680
It's not... it is impossible.

548
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,099
It is physically impossible.

549
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,096
It cannot be there.

550
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,597
It should not be there.

551
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:53,597
There's no place in the hotel
for this window to exist.

552
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:54,597
It's only toward...

553
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:56,064
finally,
towards the end of the film,

554
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:59,429
that you have the realization
that there are several hallways

555
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,096
in succession behind the office.

556
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:05,846
You see it when Wendy,

557
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:09,018
when she's later down there and
she sees Dick Hallorann's body

558
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,804
after he's been killed.

559
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:15,055
You have her behind... in that
hallway behind the office.

560
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:21,182
So really, now, what
can I tell you about the maps?

561
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:23,179
No, I did not sit down
with graph paper.

562
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,930
I did not even begin to attempt
to do them to scale.

563
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,137
Let me see.

564
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,979
I can't say which room
I started off with.

565
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,721
I don't remember.

566
00:30:30,722 --> 00:30:33,096
I just went through
and decided I was going to do...

567
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,097
try to do as much as I could,
feeling that...

568
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:37,889
I felt, eventually,
that there were places

569
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,932
that I could plot out, such
as where the girls were killed.

570
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:43,802
I was not absolutely sure
at that point,

571
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:45,266
when I started out
doing the maps,

572
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:46,513
where the girls were killed.

573
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,978
But I felt that it was
somewhere back around

574
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:52,552
the area where they lived.

575
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,094
Suite number, what?

576
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:55,891
They lived at
suite number 3.

577
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:03,385
- When Jack is sitting,
typing at his typewriter,

578
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,932
and Wendy comes in
and interrupts him

579
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,427
while he's working...

580
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:09,016
and in one shot of Jack...

581
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,348
- You get a lot written today?

582
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,093
- Sitting at the typewriter,
a one shot,

583
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,218
you look back behind him.

584
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,935
And of course,
you can see very clearly

585
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:19,467
'cause Kubrick was the master
of depth of field.

586
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:22,717
He kept everything in focus
so he would have lots of space

587
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:25,935
in which to puts things
that he wanted you to notice.

588
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:30,176
And in the first shot, behind
Jack sitting at his typewriter,

589
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:34,223
back against a wall, behind him
probably 10 or 12 or 15 feet

590
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,264
is a chair.

591
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:39,639
And then there's a switch
to a one-shot of Wendy

592
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,842
saying something.

593
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:44,469
- Hey, the weather forecast
said it's gonna snow tonight.

594
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,717
- And then the camera
switches back to Jack,

595
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:49,924
and the chair is gone.

596
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:51,597
- What do you want me
to do about it?

597
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:57,263
- And my students and I
always have fun with that,

598
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,091
saying,
"Well, continuity error?"

599
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,591
Could be.

600
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:05,382
Or it's not,
and the answer, if it's not...

601
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,258
or if it was originally

602
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,725
and then Kubrick saw it
and decided to keep it,

603
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:13,966
is that he's
parodying honor films

604
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:20,007
in order to remind you that
this isn't just a horror film.

605
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:22,303
And there's another one
in <i>The Shining that's, I think,</i>

606
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:23,923
less well-noticed.

607
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:28,922
And I think it's even more
clearly substantive.

608
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:34,464
When Danny has his first vision
of the elevator gushing blood

609
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:37,756
and the camera
is tracking toward him,

610
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,839
past the open door
of his bedroom

611
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,385
and toward the hall
and the bathroom,

612
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,678
the open bathroom door
across the hall...

613
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,089
and his bedroom door, as you
would expect a kid's door,

614
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,006
has lots
of cartoon characters on it

615
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:56,172
And, the one
who is most apparent,

616
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,011
because it's right
at the edge of the door

617
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:00,223
and it's the largest one
that you can see

618
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:04,589
and it's the last one you can
see as the camera moves past it,

619
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,754
is one of the Seven Dwarves.

620
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:10,097
And it happens to be Dopey,
okay?

621
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:15,087
Subsequently,
after Danny has passed out,

622
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:18,090
Wendy and the pediatrician
leave Danny's room.

623
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,426
And as they do, they,
of course, go out his door.

624
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:22,009
And you again see the door,

625
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,927
the open door with all
the cartoon characters on it,

626
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:27,670
and Dopey isn't there.

627
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:30,588
Now, again continuity error?

628
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:32,086
I don't think so.

629
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:34,804
I think what Kubrick
is saying is that before,

630
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:39,752
Danny had no idea about
the world, and now he knows.

631
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,717
He is no longer a dope
about things.

632
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,213
He has been enlightened.

633
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,420
- Anything you say, Lloyd.

634
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,888
Anything you say.

635
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,918
- The the advocaat is spilled.

636
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,918
There's the accident.

637
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,088
Kubrick is setting it up

638
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,379
as where they come around
in a circle,

639
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,590
'cause I feel like
that's what the camera does.

640
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:16,428
I feel like the camera
brings us around in a circle

641
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,334
so that we're coming back.

642
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:23,460
The bathroom seems to be
overlaying the Gold Room and...

643
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,835
so that
the advocaat situation

644
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:27,461
in the bathroom
is occurring about

645
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,802
in the same area
that it did in the Gold Room.

646
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:37,127
- They use the camera

647
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:41,209
to create an emotional
architecture in your mind

648
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,880
but at the same time,
showing you that it's false.

649
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,500
The set is complete...
so completely plastic

650
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,422
that its contradictions pile up
in your subconscious.

651
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:57,041
Hallorann is showing...

652
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:00,709
showing Wendy, you know,
the place where she will,

653
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,875
you know, basically,
entrap Jack...

654
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:09,249
entrap him both physically,

655
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:15,374
but also, like, that will be
the last straw for him,

656
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:19,416
last straw for
the management of the hotel.

657
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,416
It's in the store room
that he finally is like,

658
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:25,748
"Okay.
Now I'm gonna do it."

659
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,170
And, you know,
the opening of that door

660
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:33,748
is the famous, like,
only thing that's supernatural

661
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:36,749
happens in the movie that can't
be explained any other way.

662
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,748
[door unlocks]

663
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:38,748
Yeah.

664
00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:40,456
[chuckles]

665
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,669
But except that it can be
explained another way,

666
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,416
in that Danny lets him out.

667
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:51,419
[chuckles]

668
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,544
I do have this idea that Danny

669
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:56,961
is a lot more consciously
murdering his father

670
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,923
than the narrative lets on.

671
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:09,580
I don't know.
It's weird.

672
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,752
Like, you notice how, like,
Wendy's walking backwards

673
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:16,080
when she's having
that confrontation with Jack

674
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,247
in the lounge, you know.

675
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:26,246
And she's being drawn up
to the hexagonal hallway room.

676
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:30,037
And you see Danny shining
at the beginning of that.

677
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,580
He's in his room,
and there's, like,

678
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,127
lights flickering in his eyes.

679
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,585
Like, is Danny drawing...
you know,

680
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:43,079
drawing his mother up the stairs
so that she can, you know,

681
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,671
sacrifice Jack on top of that,
you know, weird pyramid?

682
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:58,667
- When I had a chance...
when I was doing a story

683
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:00,458
out in Denver,
we went up to Estes Park.

684
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,244
It was in the off-season.

685
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:05,122
Went into the Stanley Hotel,
and I asked to see the manager.

686
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,458
And he came out, and we were
just having lunch with him.

687
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,953
And I said, "Can we talk to you?
I write about <i>The Shining."</i>

688
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,170
He said, "Really?"

689
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:12,910
This fellow told me

690
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,703
that he got a phone call
from Stanley Kubrick, who said,

691
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:20,045
"I think I want to make
a movie about The Shining."

692
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:23,494
And then he would keep
this fellow on the phone

693
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:25,201
for a long time.

694
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,621
He said, "We had many
long, long conversations

695
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,164
in which he picked my brain
about everything."

696
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,368
And at that point, he said,

697
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,165
"Kubrick was talking about
maybe coming here

698
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,749
to make the movie here,"
which I expect, at that point,

699
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,492
that fellow liked the idea of,

700
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:39,993
so it would
make his hotel famous.

701
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,666
And Kubrick said, "I'd like
to send out a research team."

702
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,659
And so he then sent out...

703
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,752
the man said it was something
like two or three people

704
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:48,243
who came out here
and stayed here

705
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:52,659
for two or three months,
taking photographs everywhere.

706
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,581
And they spent a lot of time
also down in Denver

707
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:56,452
in the Colorado state archives,

708
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:58,992
finding out,
as I would now expect,

709
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:02,784
the full history of Colorado,

710
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,375
which... the flag of which
plays a part.

711
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:08,367
And the gold rush,
the Colorado Gold Rush

712
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,783
was also a very big event.

713
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:11,204
And there's all...
there's still a lot

714
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:14,122
of American Indian/white people
tension in Colorado

715
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:17,408
with Navajos and Arapahos
just to the south.

716
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:19,497
This research team found out
absolutely everything

717
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,743
about Colorado,
about Estes Park,

718
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:24,241
about the Stanley Hotel,
about its entire history,

719
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:26,824
took photographs
all over the place.

720
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:28,745
Three months was
the impression that I have

721
00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:31,332
of what he said about
how this research team

722
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,907
gathered absolutely everything.

723
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:37,249
Kubrick unearthed an enormous
amount about the real history

724
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,782
of Colorado,
where this takes place,

725
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:44,157
because what he has done
is found a way to dig

726
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,908
into all of the patterns
of our civilization,

727
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,239
our times
and our cultures,

728
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,741
and the things that
we don't want to look at.

729
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:55,073
And this movie is very much
also about denial

730
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,868
of the genocides
that we committed...

731
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,616
we white folk from Europe...

732
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:01,447
committed here and not that...

733
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:03,665
not that white folks are the
only people who do genocide.

734
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,576
All humans do, as Kubrick
makes clear in this movie.

735
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,536
He would research everything
and the full history and nature

736
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:12,748
of everything you're gonna see
in the movie on the screen

737
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:17,572
and then
boil it down and boil it down

738
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:19,665
until he got the universal
human and global patterns

739
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,655
that make it so real.

740
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:25,989
- White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

741
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,739
White man's burden.

742
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:36,113
I like you, Lloyd.

743
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:37,988
I always liked you.

744
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,572
You were always the best of 'em.

745
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:43,029
The best goddamned bartender

746
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,405
from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine,

747
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:48,905
or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

748
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,617
- Thank you for saying so.

749
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:51,863
- What does it mean?

750
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,284
Jack saying, "You always
were the best of 'em."

751
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:54,530
Starting in Timbuktu?

752
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:56,529
Jack the schoolteacher
was never in Timbuktu,

753
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,987
but Jack
the universal weak male

754
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,238
hired by armies
to go commit atrocities

755
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,863
has always been there.

756
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,329
Now, of course,
the word "Portland"

757
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,161
is neat because
it means where we landed

758
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:10,444
or where the British
or the Europeans landed.

759
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:13,032
And Portland, Maine... Oregon is
where they may have taken off

760
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,324
from to go further west.

761
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:18,486
Kubrick is thinking about
the implications

762
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,486
of everything that exists.

763
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,236
You know, the power of the genie
is in its confinement,

764
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:27,112
as the great American poet
Richard Wilbur said.

765
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:30,153
Boiling it down, you know,
10,000 years in a little lamp,

766
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:31,447
you got to get
your act together.

767
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:32,614
But that's the essence
of great art.

768
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:33,985
It's like a dream.

769
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:36,405
It's boiled everything down
to an emblematic symbol

770
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:38,244
that's got all of life in it.

771
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:42,740
Now, if you'll allow me to make
a little bit of a link here.

772
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,655
As I've thinking of this more
in recent years,

773
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:48,573
what we now understand to be
the nature of what dreams are,

774
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:53,234
I mean, it seems to be,
the general theory is,

775
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,611
that it's a way
for the brain to boil down

776
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,235
all of the
previous experiences

777
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:59,653
and then add in
that day's experiences

778
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:02,619
as well to see what kind
of overall universal patterns

779
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,734
there are to be found,

780
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:07,528
so that you can be aware of what
the patterns are out there,

781
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:09,902
so that your subconscious
will be all the more ready

782
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:12,400
to react suddenly when you see
something dangerous happen

783
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,027
or something important
happen that may lead you

784
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:19,150
to a mate or to some food
or away from danger.

785
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:25,732
And therefore, the way Kubrick
made movies was not unlike

786
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,610
the way, according
to these current theories,

787
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:33,315
our brains create memories
and, for that matter, dreams.

788
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:37,482
That's the ultimate shining
that Kubrick does.

789
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:39,482
He is like a mega brain
for the planet

790
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:42,825
who is boiling down with
all of this extensive research,

791
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:45,731
all of these
patterns of our world

792
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:48,152
and then giving them back to us
in a dream of a movie...

793
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:49,901
because movies
are like a dream...

794
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:52,190
and that's related
to why I think

795
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:53,907
there's a lot of evidence
that what Kubrick

796
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:59,149
<i>also</i> gave <i>us in The Shining
is</i> a <i>movie about the past.</i>

797
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,565
Not just any past.

798
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:02,274
The past.

799
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:04,565
I mean past-ness.

800
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:09,398
It's a movie
about how the past impinges.

801
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:11,398
That's what ghosts are.

802
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:14,240
That's what those skitter-y
voices in the opening shot

803
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,730
that are following are about.

804
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,946
There's two phrases from T.S.
Eliot that I often think of

805
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:20,064
when I'm thinking about
The Shining.

806
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:21,647
One of them is "The night"...

807
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:22,898
I think they're both
from T.S. Eliot...

808
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,147
"The nightmare of history...

809
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:26,899
how can we awake from
the nightmare of history?"

810
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,980
- [screaming]

811
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:32,232
- And the other is his phrase...
T.S. Eliot's phrase...

812
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:35,108
"History has
many cunning passages."

813
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:40,647
And I think both of those
phrases are directly apt

814
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:42,484
<i>for The Shining,
in which we see</i>

815
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:45,568
many cunning passages in the
maze and in the hotel itself

816
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:48,314
and in which the past
becomes a nightmare,

817
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,151
and in which Kubrick
shows us how you escape

818
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,688
from the nightmare of the past
by retracing your steps,

819
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:55,902
as Danny does
in that last line,

820
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:57,396
which means
acknowledging what happened

821
00:42:57,397 --> 00:43:01,104
and learning about the past
and then getting out,

822
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:03,817
only if you are
going to be able to shine

823
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,020
and see what the patterns are

824
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:06,237
so you know
to get away from them

825
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:09,025
and avoid them
and go for the good things.

826
00:43:09,026 --> 00:43:13,645
<i>I mean, The Shining is his movie
about how families break down,</i>

827
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:15,066
whether they are
an individual family

828
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,270
or the larger societal family

829
00:43:18,271 --> 00:43:20,478
that tries to break up
individual families.

830
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,477
And his hat movie,
<i>Eyes Wide Shut is the opposite.</i>

831
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:26,395
It's about
a family sorely tried,

832
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,564
Bill Hartford
and his wife and child,

833
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,561
that survives
all the horrible temptations

834
00:43:30,562 --> 00:43:32,188
that are in our DNA.

835
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:43,977
- This is our famous hedge maze.

836
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:45,519
It's a lot of fun.

837
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,815
But I wouldn't
want to go in there

838
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:49,028
unless I had an hour to spare
to find my way out.

839
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:50,352
[chuckles]

840
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:52,771
- I did not look at it again
for a number of years

841
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:54,565
until it came out in rental.

842
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:57,518
And then I picked it up
a couple of times.

843
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,476
And, what, you had three days
in order to watch a rental?

844
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:01,693
And so, I can remember watching

845
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:03,899
it over and over again
during those three days

846
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,768
and really taking
a good look at it then.

847
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:09,063
And I was able to think "Oh,
yes, this is what I remember.

848
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,398
This is what I thought I saw,"

849
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:11,645
and then catching more things.

850
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:13,894
But it wasn't, of course,
until DVD came out

851
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:15,730
that I was really able
to sit down

852
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:19,568
and take a good look at it as
far as just running through it

853
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:23,517
over and over and over again.

854
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:27,850
Kubrick presents these things
where it's, you know, real...

855
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:29,392
you know, it's realistic.

856
00:44:29,393 --> 00:44:31,439
You're not supposed to see
what's actually going on.

857
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,558
You've got Danny.

858
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,185
He's in the game room.
He turns around.

859
00:44:34,186 --> 00:44:37,435
We're supposed to be focused
on the two girls there.

860
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,477
And than you... I saw...
over on the left,

861
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:40,769
I see this skiing poster.

862
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,186
And the thing is that
you already have Jack.

863
00:44:43,187 --> 00:44:45,057
He's already asked about skiing.

864
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,774
But why isn't... you know,
"What about skiing?

865
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:48,811
Isn't the skiing good here
in the hotel?"

866
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,645
And he's already given the story
of why it isn't good,

867
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:52,974
why they can't do that.

868
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:53,974
But you got the skiing poster.

869
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,146
And my eye is drawn to it.

870
00:44:55,147 --> 00:44:57,890
And I realize
that's not a skier.

871
00:44:57,891 --> 00:44:59,357
That's a... that's a minotaur.

872
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,141
It just leaped out at me.

873
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:02,141
And so that was something

874
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:04,354
that I was able
to look at later on VHS

875
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:07,312
and say, "Yes, I had actually
seen a minotaur there,"

876
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:10,057
where the upper body, you've got
this really, you know,

877
00:45:10,058 --> 00:45:12,681
overblown physique,
very physical physique.

878
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:14,228
And then you've got
the suggestion...

879
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:17,430
you have a suggestion
of a skiing pole there,

880
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,145
but it's not really there.

881
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:20,607
It's just
a suggestion of one.

882
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,931
And the lower body
is positioned,

883
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:24,307
the way the legs are,

884
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,889
it's like a minotaur,
the build is.

885
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,435
And you've actually got
the tail there.

886
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,265
And so it is a minotaur.

887
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:32,641
And this is in...
on the opposite side of the door

888
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:36,223
you have a cowboy
on a bucking bronco, so...

889
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:38,269
and so you got
a kind of echo there,

890
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,638
where you got the

891
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,728
minotaur on one side,
the bull man,

892
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:44,313
and on the other side,
you got the cowboy,

893
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:46,721
the man on the bucking bronco.

894
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:49,846
And this is just following
the scene where they...

895
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,721
Ullman has been
taking Jack and Wendy

896
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,097
through the Colorado Lounge,

897
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:55,938
showing off the Colorado Lounge.

898
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:57,720
And they go
into the hall

899
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,518
behind the Colorado Lounge.

900
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,097
And what's there,
but on the wall,

901
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:04,722
there is a painting
of an American Indian

902
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:07,221
with a buffalo headdress on.

903
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,891
And at that point,
Ullman is discussing with Wendy

904
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,887
who has stayed there
at the hotel.

905
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:15,105
Royalty, the best people,
stars have stayed there.

906
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,178
- Royalty?

907
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,930
- All the best people.

908
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:25,559
- You have "monarch" on
the bottom, which, you know,

909
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,470
keys in with royalty.

910
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:30,220
And you also have this
whole idea of the stars.

911
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:34,137
<i>And the minotaur's name is,
what, Asterius?</i>

912
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:37,177
His name is Asterius,
which means "starry."

913
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:38,891
So you know, you got
several things there

914
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:40,761
to do with mythology
that fit in.

915
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:42,010
It's very exciting to me.

916
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:43,261
That was the... you know,
that's the kind of

917
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,478
leap-up-end-down moment
where you go,

918
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,678
"Oh, wow, look at what
Kubrick has there."

919
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,472
Yeah, I mean the minotaur lives
at the heart of the labyrinth.

920
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:51,635
He's a part of the labyrinth.

921
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:52,805
The labyrinth,
at least in the myth...

922
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:54,019
you know,
in this particular myth...

923
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,385
was built for the minotaur.

924
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:58,807
The hotel is... you know,
it is the labyrinth.

925
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:01,218
And Jack is the minotaur.

926
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,468
You have scenes with him
where he...

927
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:06,426
such as in...
what is it?

928
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:07,843
The Thursday scene.

929
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:09,717
The snowfall has started.

930
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:13,260
You have Wendy and Danny
outside playing.

931
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:15,055
And Jack
is inside the Colorado Lounge,

932
00:47:15,056 --> 00:47:16,514
and he's looking out at them.

933
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:19,848
His head is tilted down,
and his eyes are somewhat...

934
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:21,219
his eyes are elevated.

935
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,217
They're pointing up.

936
00:47:22,218 --> 00:47:23,968
And his eyebrows are drawn up.

937
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:25,843
But he has this
expression on his face

938
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,469
that he gets progressively
throughout the film

939
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,930
that is very bull-like.

940
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,217
It has a very
minotaur-like expression.

941
00:47:32,218 --> 00:47:34,014
It's the same kind
of expression that Kubrick

942
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:35,222
pulls out in other films,

943
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:37,217
such as it was on
Private Pyle's face

944
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:39,883
in the berserker scene
in the bathroom

945
00:47:39,884 --> 00:47:41,591
in <i>Full Metal Jacket.</i>

946
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,217
So it's, you know,
not specific to this film.

947
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:47,684
There's more minotaur imagery
and labyrinth imagery.

948
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:50,174
There's the Gold Room.

949
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:51,175
In front of the Gold Room,

950
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:54,049
you have
the "Unwinding Hours" sign.

951
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,891
And that plays in
with the labyrinth,

952
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:57,550
where you have...

953
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:59,262
Theseus
enters into the labyrinth,

954
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:00,509
and he has
the thread with him

955
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,721
that he ties
at the beginning that,

956
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:05,054
you know, assists him
in going through the labyrinth,

957
00:48:05,055 --> 00:48:06,762
where he can
find his way back out.

958
00:48:06,763 --> 00:48:09,429
And so I see
the "Unwinding Hours" sign

959
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,215
as having to do
with that thread.

960
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:14,885
For a while there,
I was into baseball.

961
00:48:14,886 --> 00:48:17,507
And I get very excited with
baseball when I'm into baseball.

962
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:18,631
You know, I can be by myself,

963
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:20,382
and I will be
leaping up and down.

964
00:48:20,383 --> 00:48:22,220
And Kubrick
is like that for me,

965
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:25,885
where all I have to do is see
the minotaur poster there,

966
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:28,758
and I go, "Oh, my goodness.
Look at this!"

967
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:32,178
Because you're not
supposed to see the minotaur.

968
00:48:36,257 --> 00:48:38,383
- Danny is shown
riding his big wheel

969
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:41,256
through the hotel three times.

970
00:48:41,257 --> 00:48:46,047
The first ride, I think,
is about realism.

971
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,755
That's Danny is a...

972
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:53,755
Danny is doing a loop
around the lounge set.

973
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:56,089
You know, he goes through
the service hallway

974
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,510
and then he goes
through the lounge

975
00:48:57,511 --> 00:49:00,222
and then he goes back
into the service hallway.

976
00:49:00,223 --> 00:49:03,338
And, you know,
when you first see the movie,

977
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:05,431
you're like,
"He's just wandering around.

978
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:07,171
It's crazy, it's just"...

979
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,388
But it... no, it's very...

980
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:10,712
it's just a very simple loop.

981
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,504
He does it once.

982
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:16,255
But that gives you
an idea of where...

983
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:18,420
of what that place is.

984
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:19,967
I mean, you know,
all right, you understand

985
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:22,462
that that set is real.

986
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,631
You know, like,
it's a continuous shot.

987
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:25,925
There are no tricks.

988
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:30,586
In the second ride,
in the hexagonal hallway,

989
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:31,586
there are a lot of...

990
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:33,054
there are more tricks.

991
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:35,003
Like, he doesn't do a loop.

992
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:39,711
He does kind of like
a key-shaped...

993
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:45,711
you know, or a p-shaped loop
around this hallway.

994
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:52,008
And you see the realism of the
connection to the lounge set.

995
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:07,591
And... but you also see the fakery
of the fake elevators.

996
00:50:09,336 --> 00:50:10,835
And you see...
for just one second,

997
00:50:10,836 --> 00:50:14,554
you see the big stained glass
windows out of the corner,

998
00:50:14,555 --> 00:50:17,543
in the corner of the frame

999
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:21,793
right before he takes a turn
around the elevator.

1000
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:23,886
Like, that's incredible because,

1001
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:28,042
like, that connects
that whole hallway

1002
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:32,209
to the giant
Colorado Lounge set.

1003
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,552
I mean,
that's just for one second.

1004
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:35,464
They didn't have to do that,
you know?

1005
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,176
[laughs]

1006
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,421
But it's also... you know,
it's a metaphor

1007
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:43,212
because he's also elevated.

1008
00:50:43,213 --> 00:50:46,051
He's one level up
from where he was before.

1009
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:51,126
Like, he starts in the same
place, just one floor up,

1010
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:53,838
you know, in the northeast
corner of the set.

1011
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,381
So now he's in the northeast
corner and one level up.

1012
00:50:57,382 --> 00:51:00,374
And if you take it
as a metaphor of, like,

1013
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:06,291
going from a mundane reality
to up into your head

1014
00:51:06,292 --> 00:51:08,749
to more
of a fantastical reality...

1015
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,458
The third one is even stranger,

1016
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:14,584
'cause he starts off
in the service unit.

1017
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:15,833
He starts off in the same,

1018
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:18,999
you know, northeast corner
of the lobby hall,

1019
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,665
of the lobby service hallway.

1020
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:26,373
And then he takes a turn,
and suddenly he's upstairs

1021
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:32,001
in the area
outside their apartment

1022
00:51:33,582 --> 00:51:36,169
So, like,
it's a kind of a combination

1023
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,665
of the first two,
where like he's down low

1024
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,331
and then he's up high.

1025
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,832
And then he takes a turn,
and he's suddenly...

1026
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:47,414
he's in that that yellow,
yellow and blue wallpaper.

1027
00:51:47,415 --> 00:51:50,581
Let's say that's
in the service hallway area.

1028
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:53,047
He's, you know, right outside
his parents' bedroom,

1029
00:51:53,048 --> 00:51:57,039
so there's this
connection between him

1030
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,539
going on these big wheel rides
and dreaming.

1031
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,789
Like, he's near his bedroom.

1032
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:06,540
He's near... like, you see his
parents are working downstairs,

1033
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,122
but he's upstairs.

1034
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:13,205
You know, like, you see his mom
on the telephone,

1035
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:16,163
and then he's flying.

1036
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:19,955
He goes above her
to the bedroom,

1037
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:21,752
which is above
where she's working,

1038
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:25,162
just as
the hexagonal hallway

1039
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:28,246
is above
where his dad is working.

1040
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:31,713
So these big wheel rides
become like a visionary way

1041
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:35,787
of Danny to explore
his parents' headspace.

1042
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:36,789
[laughs]

1043
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,329
You know, like,
room 237 is his, like...

1044
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:45,370
that's his father's
fantasy chamber

1045
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,495
where, like, he gets it on
with the witches.

1046
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:49,496
[laughs]

1047
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:59,286
And the twins are like
his mother's fantasy...

1048
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:04,911
fantasy headspace where, like,
they're these double blue women

1049
00:53:04,912 --> 00:53:07,958
who want to play with Danny
forever and ever.

1050
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:10,910
- We're all gonna have
a real good time.

1051
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:11,911
- [chuckles]

1052
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:15,704
[machinery whining, hissing]

1053
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,500
- My interpretation
of The Shining

1054
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:24,409
is that there's many levels
to this film.

1055
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,535
This is like
three-dimensional chess.

1056
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:32,409
And he's trying
to tell us several stories

1057
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,201
that appear to be separate
but actually are not.

1058
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:42,617
And he's doing this both through
the overt script that he wrote.

1059
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:46,368
He's telling it through tricks
of the trade,

1060
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:49,665
the subliminal imagery
and these constant retakes,

1061
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,742
giving him odd angles
and things.

1062
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:55,866
And he's also telling you

1063
00:53:55,867 --> 00:54:01,533
through the changes that he made
to the Stephen King novel.

1064
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:03,410
So if you watch
those three things,

1065
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:06,867
you begin to understand
this deeper story.

1066
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:11,699
And this deeper story
has its birth, I guess,

1067
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,533
in the idea
that Stanley Kubrick

1068
00:54:15,534 --> 00:54:19,407
was involved with faking
the Apollo moon landings.

1069
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:22,121
In fact, I contend that
<i>2001: A Space Odyssey,</i>

1070
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:25,330
in part, was a research
and development project

1071
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:27,869
for the Apollo footage
that was shot.

1072
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,992
I'm not saying
we didn't go to the moon.

1073
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:32,241
I'm just saying
that what we saw was faked

1074
00:54:32,242 --> 00:54:35,035
and that it was faked
by Stanley Kubrick.

1075
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,577
And I've had Hollywood
special effects people

1076
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:41,493
from the '60s and '70s who were
front-screen projection experts

1077
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:45,287
tell me that I absolutely
have nailed the Apollo footage

1078
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:49,198
as being the result of
front-screen projection.

1079
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:51,700
Just go to any Apollo site
and look,

1080
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:56,365
and you'll see that they have to
hide the bottom of the screen.

1081
00:54:56,366 --> 00:55:00,489
And you can always see
the set/screen separation line

1082
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,447
in every Apollo footage,
every Apollo image,

1083
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:08,447
and the video footage
that has a background.

1084
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:11,280
And Richard Hoagland,
the researcher,

1085
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:13,247
has looked
into the Apollo imagery.

1086
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:16,614
And he has found
all sorts of problems with it

1087
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:18,865
because in the sky
around the astronauts,

1088
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:24,197
he's found reflecting lights
and refracting things and...

1089
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:27,238
kind of a junk
and geometry of things

1090
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,363
that are in the sky.

1091
00:55:28,364 --> 00:55:31,155
And he concluded, wrongly,

1092
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:35,530
that there are gigantic
alien cities made out of glass.

1093
00:55:35,531 --> 00:55:39,695
What he's really seeing
is the reflections of light

1094
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:43,904
of the tiny beads
on the scotch light screen

1095
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:47,451
which is being used in the
front-screen projection process.

1096
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:52,070
And so, once I nailed the
front-screen projection process

1097
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:55,112
inside the Apollo footage,

1098
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:59,820
then I became interested in
seeing if Kubrick left any clues

1099
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,448
in the rest of his career
to his possible involvement

1100
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:06,112
in faking
the Apollo moon footage.

1101
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:11,611
And I was overjoyed
about two years ago

1102
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:15,736
when I received my
Blu-Ray copy of <i>The Shining.</i>

1103
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:18,074
And I put it
in my Blu-Ray machine

1104
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,446
and sat down one night
to watch it.

1105
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:26,443
And I realized that all of the
things that one could imagine

1106
00:56:26,444 --> 00:56:29,116
that Stanley Kubrick
would have had to go through

1107
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:32,485
to fake
the Apollo moon footage...

1108
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,953
and there in the movie,

1109
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:38,318
every time that Stanley deviated
from the Stephen King novel,

1110
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,735
he deviated
into those exact questions.

1111
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:43,986
You know, what was it like
to make a deal

1112
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,406
with the U.S. Government?

1113
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:50,442
What was it like to accidentally
tell someone what you were doing

1114
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:54,567
and to watch them possibly
have to suffer the consequences

1115
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:56,526
of your lack of integrity?

1116
00:56:56,527 --> 00:57:00,526
What was it like
to lie to your wife

1117
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:02,695
and tell her
that you were doing one thing

1118
00:57:02,696 --> 00:57:04,237
when you were doing another?

1119
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:06,698
What was it like
when your wife found out

1120
00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:08,442
what you were really doing?

1121
00:57:08,443 --> 00:57:11,361
These are the questions
that I had long before

1122
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:12,610
I had seen The Shining again

1123
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:15,735
after a maybe an eight...
or nine-year absence.

1124
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:20,192
And I didn't... wasn't sure
I was right for the first hour.

1125
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:22,443
I wasn't sure
that I had actually...

1126
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:24,908
you know, I wasn't sure
if I was blurring the line

1127
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:29,191
between what I wanted to see
and what I was seeing.

1128
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:31,861
And then at about
58 minutes in the film

1129
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:35,107
is the famous scene where
Danny's playing with his trucks,

1130
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:37,108
and he stands up

1131
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:38,859
and he's wearing
the Apollo 11 sweater

1132
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,774
with the rocket taking off.

1133
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:43,690
Then I knew I'd nabbed it.

1134
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:47,607
And then I started watching
the film with an intensity

1135
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:50,199
that I don't think I'd
ever watched a movie before,

1136
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,024
and every line
began ringing true.

1137
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:59,148
You know, "Wendy, that is
just so typical of you.

1138
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:00,491
"Don't you... don't you know

1139
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:03,023
"I have obligations
to my employers?

1140
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:06,148
"Do you have any idea
what a contract is?

1141
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,194
Do you know
what an agreement is?"

1142
00:58:08,195 --> 00:58:12,481
jack Nicholson's whole tirade
against his wife...

1143
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:14,814
that's Stanley.

1144
00:58:14,815 --> 00:58:18,735
That's Stanley telling his wife
that after she discovered

1145
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:21,698
what he was doing,
which was the Apollo footage.

1146
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,401
No, that's actually not true.

1147
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:45,853
If you call
the Mount Hood Resort

1148
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:47,896
and you ask for room 217

1149
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:50,239
you will find
there is no such room.

1150
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,021
So that's just not true.

1151
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:54,062
That statement's not true.

1152
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:57,938
And so what...

1153
00:58:57,939 --> 00:58:59,520
Stanley was lying.

1154
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:01,692
Its not the reason
that he changed the room number

1155
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:04,729
from 217 to 237.

1156
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,520
The reason that
he changed it from 217 to 237

1157
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:14,228
was because the room,
room 237 in the film is...

1158
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:17,947
represents the moon landing
stage where he worked.

1159
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:27,560
And the moon, the standard
science textbook said...

1160
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:29,061
and they still say...

1161
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:32,187
but now with lasers, we've
gotten a little better reading.

1162
00:59:32,188 --> 00:59:36,811
But... is that
the mean distance of the moon

1163
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:41,060
from the earth
is exactly 237,000 miles.

1164
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,232
So he changed that
so that you would understand

1165
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:46,477
that this was the moon room.

1166
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:48,185
So Danny stands up.

1167
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:50,601
He's got
the Apollo 11 sweater on.

1168
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:53,601
He begins
walking down the hallway

1169
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:55,768
towards room 237.

1170
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:58,684
And there's a key in the lock.

1171
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:00,559
And on the key are...

1172
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,975
is the words "room"
and then the word "n-o,"

1173
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,476
which is an old acronym
for "number."

1174
01:00:08,477 --> 01:00:10,184
So "room number 237,"

1175
01:00:10,185 --> 01:00:13,106
except that the only
capital letters on the key

1176
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:17,558
are r-o-o-m and then the "n"
from the acronym n-o.

1177
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:20,897
And if there's only two words
that you can come up with

1178
01:00:20,898 --> 01:00:22,936
that have those letters in 'em.

1179
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:24,685
And that's "moon" and "room."

1180
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:29,933
And so on the key, the tag,
it says "moon room."

1181
01:00:29,934 --> 01:00:31,353
And that is the moon room.

1182
01:00:31,354 --> 01:00:32,726
This is where
everything happens,

1183
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:34,266
and none of it's real.

1184
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:36,516
And it all has to be lied about.

1185
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:39,268
And he can't let anyone know
what's really going on

1186
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,891
in room 237.

1187
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:45,891
And there's many, many other
deviations from the book

1188
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,016
to the movie.

1189
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:48,682
- It isn't real.

1190
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:51,729
- The deviations drove
Stephen King out of his mind.

1191
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,432
He just ranted
and ranted for years

1192
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,515
how much he hated The Shining.

1193
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:58,392
And he hated it
because he'd given Kubrick

1194
01:00:58,393 --> 01:00:59,890
all this great source material

1195
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:02,515
and Kubrick threw it out.

1196
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:07,640
And the whole idea of this
is best exemplified

1197
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:10,264
by the scene
where Dick Hallorann

1198
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:11,935
is driving up the highway,

1199
01:01:11,936 --> 01:01:14,933
trying to get to the Overlook
during a winter storm

1200
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,181
and he passes a wreck.

1201
01:01:17,182 --> 01:01:20,348
And in the wreck,
a semi has crashed

1202
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:24,139
and crushed a red Volkswagen.

1203
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,013
And this is a direct message
from Kubrick to King,

1204
01:01:28,014 --> 01:01:30,180
because in the novel,

1205
01:01:30,181 --> 01:01:33,639
Jack Torrance's car
is a red Volkswagen.

1206
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,058
But in the movie,
it's a yellow Volkswagen.

1207
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,523
And what Kubrick
is saying in that scene

1208
01:01:38,524 --> 01:01:41,638
is a big "F you"
to Stephen King.

1209
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,805
He's saying,
'This is my vehicle.

1210
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:46,847
"I have wrecked your vehicle.

1211
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:49,805
And everybody in the world
can see it.'

1212
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,522
And this drove King crazy.

1213
01:01:51,523 --> 01:01:53,180
And it should have.

1214
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:54,681
But what was really going on

1215
01:01:54,682 --> 01:02:00,845
and what is just much more
deliciously fascinating

1216
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:04,137
about all of this
is that, in fact,

1217
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:08,428
Kubrick was faking the making
of the Stephen King novel

1218
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:12,346
in order to reveal the idea
of what he went through

1219
01:02:12,347 --> 01:02:14,813
to do the Apollo moon footage.

1220
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:26,347
- My argument,
as far as Kubrick goes,

1221
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,687
is that he was a
preternaturally observant child.

1222
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:31,845
He read omnivorously.

1223
01:02:31,846 --> 01:02:34,011
He went to movies all the time.

1224
01:02:34,012 --> 01:02:37,933
And I think if you're going to
movies and reading in the 1930s

1225
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:42,052
and the 1940s, a lot of what
you're seeing and reading

1226
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:46,052
is Hitler and the Nazis
and the war.

1227
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:52,343
So as a sensitive kid, he must
have been alive to these things.

1228
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:55,437
And I don't think he ever forgot
anything, and this is...

1229
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,974
which is why his films
are so rich.

1230
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:01,676
- Little pigs, little pigs,

1231
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,643
let me come in.

1232
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:08,431
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1233
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:14,343
Then I'll huff and I'll puff...

1234
01:03:14,344 --> 01:03:15,884
- And I'll blow your house in!

1235
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:17,101
- Well,
<i>The Three Little Pigs,</i>

1236
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:18,719
I mean, I don't remember...

1237
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,265
That might have been one of
the things

1238
01:03:21,266 --> 01:03:23,842
that Jack Nicholson

1239
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,884
might've ad-libbed initially.

1240
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,681
Kubrick was a great believer
in that.

1241
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:31,092
But even if it was,
I think the selection

1242
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:35,092
of that particular little rhyme

1243
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:38,549
certainly fits in
with the time periodization

1244
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,142
I've just been talking about,

1245
01:03:40,143 --> 01:03:44,049
because Kubrick
would've run across that

1246
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:46,301
when he saw
<i>The Three Little Pigs</i>

1247
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:50,174
as an Academy Award winning
cartoon in 1933.

1248
01:03:50,175 --> 01:03:53,508
And so it comes
out of that period.

1249
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:58,466
And so the whole idea of a wolf,
which, during the 1930s,

1250
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:05,007
gradually transformed itself
in popular mythology

1251
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,840
and popular culture
from being a symbol

1252
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:12,924
of want and of hunger
in the Great Depression

1253
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:16,465
into a symbol of enemies;

1254
01:04:16,466 --> 01:04:19,340
Enemy nations,
enemy peoples,

1255
01:04:19,341 --> 01:04:20,635
military aggression.

1256
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:23,551
And of course, this reflects
the rise of fascism

1257
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:24,844
and Nazis in Europe.

1258
01:04:24,845 --> 01:04:28,173
But initially,
the wolf at the door

1259
01:04:28,174 --> 01:04:32,672
was an anti-Semitic
stereotype and caricature

1260
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:36,631
that... initially the wolf
wears a disguise.

1261
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:37,848
And the background music

1262
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:41,380
is clearly Eastern European
sort of klezmer

1263
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,005
or Yiddish music.

1264
01:04:43,006 --> 01:04:45,797
And it's a classic example

1265
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:50,130
of early 1930s
Walt Disney anti-Semitism.

1266
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:53,172
So I think there
are layers of meaning

1267
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:55,009
<i>in The Three Little Pigs. "</i>

1268
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,005
And since Kubrick
was a Freudian

1269
01:04:57,006 --> 01:05:01,296
and we know
that he used Freudian work

1270
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,218
in doing the screenplay
for The Shining...

1271
01:05:04,219 --> 01:05:07,463
Bruno Bettelheim's
<i>The Uses of Enchantment...</i>

1272
01:05:07,464 --> 01:05:11,133
and it's a Freudian analysis
of the meaning of fairy tales.

1273
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:13,843
<i>And in The Shining,
we can see the fruits of that</i>

1274
01:05:13,844 --> 01:05:17,004
when they're constantly making
references to Hansel and Gretel.

1275
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:18,550
- I feel like I'll have
to leave a trail of bread crumbs

1276
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:20,384
every time we come in here.

1277
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:22,504
- The witch in the oven
and children being burned

1278
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:23,968
and so forth,
which of course,

1279
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:27,883
is also perhaps, suggestive
when it comes to the Holocaust.

1280
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:34,424
- The blood
is one of the main ghosts

1281
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:36,464
and perhaps
the overarching ghost,

1282
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,175
in a certain sense,
in this movie.

1283
01:05:38,176 --> 01:05:41,753
We first see it when Danny,
at the beginning of the movie,

1284
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:43,220
is at the sink
in the little apartment

1285
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:47,503
down in Denver or Boulder
or wherever it is.

1286
01:05:47,504 --> 01:05:48,879
And he's talking to Danny,

1287
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,504
"Why don't
you want to go there?"

1288
01:05:53,045 --> 01:05:56,671
And then suddenly
Danny shows him blood.

1289
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:00,376
And as we learn
a little bit later,

1290
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:03,299
the Overlook was built
on the Indian burial ground

1291
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,960
between 1907 and 1909.

1292
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,460
- Construction started in 1907.

1293
01:06:07,461 --> 01:06:09,627
It was finished in 1909.

1294
01:06:09,628 --> 01:06:10,970
The site
is supposed to be located

1295
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:12,335
on an Indian burial ground,

1296
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:13,754
and I believe they actually had

1297
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:16,299
to repel a few Indian attacks
as they were building it.

1298
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:21,212
- So presumably,
we can imagine the elevator

1299
01:06:21,213 --> 01:06:24,553
shaft sinks down into
the very bodies of the Indians,

1300
01:06:24,554 --> 01:06:25,751
so to speak.

1301
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:27,751
And that's where
the blood is coming from;

1302
01:06:27,752 --> 01:06:29,718
Literal blood of the Indians.

1303
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:48,881
And this movie is a movie about,
among other things,

1304
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:51,791
the blood on which
nations are built;

1305
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:52,961
Certainly the United States,

1306
01:06:52,962 --> 01:06:55,675
with the genocide
of the American Indians.

1307
01:06:55,676 --> 01:06:57,500
But it's not only that.

1308
01:06:57,501 --> 01:07:00,842
This is a complete metaphor
for what Kubrick is on about,

1309
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:05,124
because the elevator's doors
remain closed.

1310
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:07,294
In other words,
it's as if it's like a symbol

1311
01:07:07,295 --> 01:07:08,505
of the repression.

1312
01:07:08,506 --> 01:07:09,963
We don't want to admit to it.

1313
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:13,420
But in spite of our attempting
to stay repressed about it,

1314
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:15,166
blood will out,
murder will out,

1315
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,132
as Chaucer says
in one of his tales.

1316
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:22,832
And so the blood comes
squeezing out from the side

1317
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,498
and overwhelms us.

1318
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:28,217
And it keeps recurring
over and over through the movie.

1319
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:29,832
And it's...

1320
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,920
And finally Wendy, when,
at the very end of the movie,

1321
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:34,417
she starts seeing ghosts.

1322
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:35,666
She sees the blood.

1323
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:39,664
It's the symbol
of what we all have in common.

1324
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:40,881
And there's
lots of symbols in here

1325
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,419
of what all humans
have in common.

1326
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,956
- 42 shows up in other places.

1327
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:53,414
Wendy and Danny
watch The <i>Summer</i> of '42

1328
01:07:53,415 --> 01:07:54,914
on a hotel television.

1329
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:57,497
And there are
a number of other

1330
01:07:57,498 --> 01:07:59,624
little references
to that number.

1331
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:01,749
And it's within a larger context

1332
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:05,330
that Kubrick uses involving
numbers in The Shining.

1333
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,502
And they're all
multiples of seven.

1334
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:10,829
The hotel was built in 1907.

1335
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:14,127
The party in which Jack
is pictured at the end of film

1336
01:08:14,128 --> 01:08:17,954
occurred in 1921 in July,

1337
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:20,497
the seventh month of the year.

1338
01:08:20,498 --> 01:08:26,245
These multiples of seven,
I think,

1339
01:08:26,246 --> 01:08:27,417
also reflect the fact

1340
01:08:27,418 --> 01:08:30,621
that Kubrick was aware
of the importance

1341
01:08:30,622 --> 01:08:34,496
of Thomas Mann's novel of 1924,
<i>The Magic Mountain,</i>

1342
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:37,495
which similarly concerns
a sanitarium...

1343
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:41,037
though not a hotel...
high up in the mountains.

1344
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:48,078
And Mann uses the number 7
there as a matter,

1345
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,204
a symbol of
the sort of dangerous fate

1346
01:08:53,205 --> 01:08:56,670
that seems to have been
stalking Europe lately.

1347
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:10,078
And in the novel <i>Lolita,
Nabokov uses the number 42</i>

1348
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,534
as a symbol of fate
and Humbert's paranoia,

1349
01:09:13,535 --> 01:09:16,160
the idea that
he is constantly being tracked

1350
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:17,958
and that his life is doomed.

1351
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:21,285
And even though Kubrick,
in his film of Lolita,

1352
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,701
only uses the number once,

1353
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:26,496
interestingly enough
on a hotel room door,

1354
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,120
I think at some level
of consciousness,

1355
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:32,867
Kubrick was always
also drawing from Nabokov's use

1356
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,701
of that particular number

1357
01:09:34,702 --> 01:09:40,998
as a symbol of danger
and malevolence and disaster.

1358
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:49,623
- The opening sound
is from the great funeral mass,

1359
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:52,492
<i>Dies Irae,
which is the day of judgment,</i>

1360
01:09:52,493 --> 01:09:54,537
which announces,
"This is going to be a funeral.

1361
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:56,876
"This is going to be about
a judgment on the human race."

1362
01:09:56,877 --> 01:09:58,533
It's about the past.

1363
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:02,075
But I think I remembered

1364
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:05,574
that my impression
from the opening scene

1365
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:07,869
in which that astonishing
helicopter shot

1366
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,993
gives you
a totally creepy feeling.

1367
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:13,324
You're looking at great,
beautiful nature,

1368
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:15,701
but you know
you're following something.

1369
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:16,951
You're, like, flying along

1370
01:10:16,952 --> 01:10:20,657
on top of this little,
tiny, insignificant car.

1371
01:10:20,658 --> 01:10:22,871
It's the ultimate
point of view shot

1372
01:10:22,872 --> 01:10:25,324
without telling you
who the point of view is.

1373
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:26,666
If you want
to stop and think about it,

1374
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:28,746
you think,
'This is a helicopter shot"

1375
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:29,954
But for the general audience,

1376
01:10:29,955 --> 01:10:32,074
all you know is that
you are like a ghost.

1377
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:33,493
You are like an angel.

1378
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:34,615
You are like something

1379
01:10:34,616 --> 01:10:37,365
that flies
with supernatural abilities

1380
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,656
across the landscape
of the planet.

1381
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:44,655
And the soundtrack had
that skittering [vocalizes]...

1382
01:10:44,656 --> 01:10:45,906
I can't imitate it...

1383
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,531
but that skittering music
that sounded to me...

1384
01:10:48,532 --> 01:10:50,827
and I was conscious of this
the first time I saw the movie...

1385
01:10:50,828 --> 01:10:54,406
like the thousands
of voices from the past.

1386
01:10:54,407 --> 01:10:57,655
"The cloud of witness,"
as the phrase is in...

1387
01:10:57,656 --> 01:11:00,114
Dorothy Sayers uses it
as the title for some story.

1388
01:11:00,115 --> 01:11:02,161
The cloud of witness,
all the ghosts from the past;

1389
01:11:02,162 --> 01:11:03,328
And I didn't know.

1390
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:06,822
Were these the voices
of the many crowds

1391
01:11:06,823 --> 01:11:09,614
of aliens or of ghosts or...

1392
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:10,660
I didn't know what.

1393
01:11:10,661 --> 01:11:13,863
But already that
skittering, high music

1394
01:11:13,864 --> 01:11:15,991
with that follow shot
across the lake

1395
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:20,654
and then across the car itself,

1396
01:11:20,655 --> 01:11:22,363
it was the ultimate in spooky

1397
01:11:22,364 --> 01:11:24,488
because you had the feeling
this car is being followed

1398
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,364
and it doesn't know it,
and we're following it.

1399
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,363
I mean, I could go on
for a long time

1400
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:31,987
about the symbolism of that

1401
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:34,910
with regard to what The Shining
<i>really</i> is.

1402
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:38,237
<i>And The Shining,
as we come to understand it,</i>

1403
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:40,783
is seeing through
all the layers of history

1404
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:42,367
and the horrors of history,

1405
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:44,612
even autobiographically
in that scene

1406
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:51,653
where Grady and Jack talk
in the blood-red men's room

1407
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:53,904
and Grady says, "Your son
has a very great talent.

1408
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:55,405
"I don't think
you realize how great it is.

1409
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:56,652
He's a very willful boy."

1410
01:11:56,653 --> 01:11:57,653
And Jack says, "Yes, he is..."

1411
01:11:57,654 --> 01:11:59,779
- A very willful boy.

1412
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,360
- Did you know, Mr. Torrance,

1413
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:07,403
that your son is attempting
to bring an outside party

1414
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:09,069
into this situation?

1415
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,277
- That's Kubrick.

1416
01:12:11,278 --> 01:12:13,153
What he's trying to do
is bring the audience

1417
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:15,527
and humanity
into this situation.

1418
01:12:15,528 --> 01:12:20,360
In this movie, he is trying
to get through to us all...

1419
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:22,860
the human race in the movie
theaters watching this...

1420
01:12:22,861 --> 01:12:26,319
that we are doing these things
but don't see it,

1421
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,027
that we are committing
these horrendous things

1422
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:30,401
over and over again
and then forgetting them...

1423
01:12:30,402 --> 01:12:31,744
which is... of course,
he represents

1424
01:12:31,745 --> 01:12:33,782
many, many times in the movie...

1425
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:37,109
by having characters
seem to know something

1426
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,907
and then not know it
and forget it.

1427
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:46,027
- You, uh, chopped your wife and
daughter up into little bits.

1428
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,527
- I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

1429
01:12:48,528 --> 01:12:49,864
- That's like the human race.

1430
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,077
We commit atrocities
and then forget it.

1431
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:03,487
- Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

1432
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:04,484
- How do you do?

1433
01:13:04,485 --> 01:13:05,484
- Bill, how do you do?

1434
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:06,483
- It's nice to meet you.

1435
01:13:06,484 --> 01:13:07,483
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

1436
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:09,525
- Some people think that,

1437
01:13:09,526 --> 01:13:11,868
like, not all
of the interview is real.

1438
01:13:11,869 --> 01:13:15,067
Some of it is Jack's
imagination or fantasy

1439
01:13:15,068 --> 01:13:20,107
of what the interview
would be like.

1440
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:25,025
Like, also, Bill Watson's
clothes change.

1441
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,690
Like,
his pants change patterns.

1442
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:29,066
And what's also weird is,

1443
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:32,488
he plays Pontius Pilate
in <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

1444
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:33,815
- ♪ Crucify him ♪

1445
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:34,857
♪ Crucify him ♪

1446
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:37,733
♪ Crucify, crucify, crucify ♪

1447
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:39,028
- Really playing against type

1448
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:41,857
and just being
this sort of cipher.

1449
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:47,440
I mean, in a way he's,
he's kind of Jack's double

1450
01:13:47,441 --> 01:13:50,908
kind of in the same way that
Bill Hartford has a double

1451
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:54,023
in <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

1452
01:13:54,024 --> 01:13:57,112
You know, he goes
to that blonde woman's house

1453
01:13:57,113 --> 01:13:58,448
whose father just died

1454
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:01,981
and her fiancé looks
exactly like Tom Cruise,

1455
01:14:01,982 --> 01:14:02,982
has the same haircut.

1456
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:08,276
- I've always thought that Bill
Watson, the little assistant...

1457
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,819
and by little, I mean that he's
sort of a shrunken figure...

1458
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:15,439
to Ullman, who's brought in
and sits there

1459
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,980
looking sort of dour
and resentful and quiet

1460
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:23,230
and whose skin color
is sort of a half...

1461
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:24,229
it's not white.

1462
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:26,646
It's sort of toward brown.

1463
01:14:26,647 --> 01:14:30,648
I've always thought that he
sort of represents a subdued...

1464
01:14:30,649 --> 01:14:32,485
somebody from a subdued race.

1465
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:35,482
He seems a little bit diffident
when Ullman says,

1466
01:14:35,483 --> 01:14:37,400
"Will you go
collect their luggage?"

1467
01:14:37,401 --> 01:14:38,396
He says, "Fine."

1468
01:14:38,397 --> 01:14:39,687
- Fine.

1469
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,781
- And as they're given the tour
around all the hotel,

1470
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:43,937
Bill Watson
is always trailing behind,

1471
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,483
like somebody who's going
to be a little factotum

1472
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:46,854
to go get things.

1473
01:14:46,855 --> 01:14:48,729
I've always thought
he sort of maybe represented,

1474
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,104
you know, the condition in
the dominant arrogant culture

1475
01:14:53,105 --> 01:14:55,401
that the Indians
had at that time.

1476
01:14:58,896 --> 01:15:05,020
- He is the silent guardian

1477
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:06,978
for the government.

1478
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:11,145
Stewart Ullman represents
the face of the U.S. government.

1479
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:12,987
And that's why Kubrick
gave him the toupee

1480
01:15:12,988 --> 01:15:15,977
that makes him look like
John F. Kennedy.

1481
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:19,686
And I think that he is the guy

1482
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:23,519
who's silently watching
everything and, you know...

1483
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,186
CIA, I guess.

1484
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,144
Kind of NSA guy.

1485
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:30,310
And he probably represents

1486
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:34,519
the real managers of the house,

1487
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,310
of the Overlook,
and Barry Nelson is the...

1488
01:15:38,311 --> 01:15:40,437
just the person
that's out in front.

1489
01:15:40,438 --> 01:15:42,477
- He doesn't say a thing.

1490
01:15:42,478 --> 01:15:43,815
He's the summer caretaker.

1491
01:15:43,816 --> 01:15:45,023
And he seems to me

1492
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:47,146
to have certain
correspondences with Wendy.

1493
01:15:47,146 --> 01:15:49,395
Jack really doesn't
work around the hotel.

1494
01:15:49,395 --> 01:15:51,687
Wendy gets in there,
and she does all the work.

1495
01:15:51,688 --> 01:15:54,604
- You do get the feeling
that he's going...

1496
01:15:54,605 --> 01:15:56,523
that Jack's going
to be doing his work,

1497
01:15:56,524 --> 01:16:00,101
because he seems a little,
like, leery of Jack.

1498
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,476
Like, I've been
in job interviews,

1499
01:16:01,477 --> 01:16:03,476
and I've always found
that that second person

1500
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:04,853
they call in is,
like, the person

1501
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:07,558
you're actually
interviewing for.

1502
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:09,901
He's making the decision,
like, that silent person,

1503
01:16:09,902 --> 01:16:14,308
that, like...
kind of, like, glare...

1504
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:16,516
like, squints at you.

1505
01:16:16,517 --> 01:16:22,641
Yeah, and he sighs when he's
asked to move Jack's luggage.

1506
01:16:22,642 --> 01:16:24,142
- Bill, would you have
the Torrances' things

1507
01:16:24,143 --> 01:16:25,189
brought to their apartment?

1508
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,401
- Fine.

1509
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:33,687
- There's a dissolve
which fades from a wide shot

1510
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:36,729
of the, you know,
final black-and-white photo

1511
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,058
to a close-up of Jack's face.

1512
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:42,891
And just for a second there,

1513
01:16:42,892 --> 01:16:46,734
his hairline fades in
to form a Hitler moustache.

1514
01:16:55,183 --> 01:16:57,730
- I think a lot of things
happened right here

1515
01:16:57,731 --> 01:17:01,765
in this particular hotel
over the years

1516
01:17:01,766 --> 01:17:04,233
and not all of 'em was good.

1517
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,514
- He once said,

1518
01:17:07,515 --> 01:17:08,809
"How do you get all of that"...

1519
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:09,898
meaning the Holocaust...

1520
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:11,723
"into a two-hour movie?"

1521
01:17:11,724 --> 01:17:18,347
I think he found the Holocaust
of such evil magnitude

1522
01:17:18,348 --> 01:17:20,689
that he just couldn't
bring himself

1523
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,805
to treat it directly,

1524
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:27,680
which is why he used
the form of a horror film

1525
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:30,056
to treat it indirectly.

1526
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:33,722
- I believe Kubrick,
possibly consciously,

1527
01:17:33,723 --> 01:17:38,971
has solved a kind of problem
that history has,

1528
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:42,138
which is that
it's very hard for many people

1529
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:45,060
to connect emotionally
to a gigantic big killing

1530
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:46,846
we hear about in the past.

1531
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:49,472
People who don't have
direct family experience

1532
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:51,596
of it themselves
may hear the statistic.

1533
01:17:51,597 --> 01:17:53,018
You know, Hitler,
among other things,

1534
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:55,058
killed 6 million Jews
in his Holocaust.

1535
01:17:55,059 --> 01:17:56,556
6 million's a number too big.

1536
01:17:56,557 --> 01:17:58,930
I mean Stalin is reputed
to have said, you know,

1537
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:01,098
"You kill one person,
it's a murder and a tragedy.

1538
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:03,721
"You kill a million people,
it's a statistic."

1539
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:07,512
He was talking about
a psychological fact.

1540
01:18:07,513 --> 01:18:10,762
And, you know, Stalin himself
was... what is it...

1541
01:18:10,763 --> 01:18:12,184
starved about 3 million people

1542
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:15,726
in the western Ukraine
in the '30s on purpose.

1543
01:18:16,846 --> 01:18:21,137
My point is
it may be that Kubrick

1544
01:18:21,138 --> 01:18:23,806
was conscious of having
offered a kind of way to bridge

1545
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:28,016
that inability to feel for those
gigantic statistics in that,

1546
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:30,556
<i>if you go and</i> see <i>The Shining
innocent the first time</i>

1547
01:18:30,557 --> 01:18:33,053
and are terrified...
you're just terrified

1548
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:35,930
and you'll always remember
being terrified...

1549
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:39,844
and then go back
aware of what the symbolism

1550
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:43,558
and the general larger pattern
meanings of the movie are,

1551
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:46,599
then you can begin to make
something of a connection,

1552
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,927
saying, "Oh, my God."

1553
01:18:48,928 --> 01:18:50,143
I remember being terrified

1554
01:18:50,144 --> 01:18:53,761
for the individual
little Danny and Wendy here.

1555
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:57,177
And that feeling is actually
being...

1556
01:18:57,178 --> 01:18:59,553
is for people who are symbols
of victims

1557
01:18:59,554 --> 01:19:02,393
of all kinds
of horrendous genocides.

1558
01:19:04,302 --> 01:19:09,509
And of course, his wife
has subsequently talked about,

1559
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,806
you know, how close he came
to making his Holocaust movie,

1560
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:14,426
<i>The Aryan Papers,
but that he got mom and mom</i>

1561
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:16,139
and more depressed
and was relieved

1562
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,976
when he had an excuse
not to do it.

1563
01:19:17,977 --> 01:19:20,509
<i>He used Schindler's List
as saying,</i>

1564
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,930
"Ah, it's already been done."

1565
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:25,134
I mean,
that struck a bell with me.

1566
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,227
And I've done a lot
of stories as a journalist

1567
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:30,675
about people who study...

1568
01:19:30,676 --> 01:19:32,972
either talked to people
who are victims of horrors

1569
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:34,383
or study it.

1570
01:19:34,384 --> 01:19:36,971
And there's... Freud talked
about it as the contagion.

1571
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,467
The depression seeps into you.

1572
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:42,841
It's... you know what...
Kubrick had a wonderful comment

1573
01:19:42,842 --> 01:19:45,093
about this
when somebody asked him.

1574
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:48,183
"Isn't it true that
your movies are showing us

1575
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:51,340
"just the horrendous side
of humanity.

1576
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:53,058
You know, that's awful bleak."

1577
01:19:53,059 --> 01:19:54,257
And Kubrick said,

1578
01:19:54,258 --> 01:19:57,972
"Ah, but there's something
very positive about it as well.

1579
01:19:57,973 --> 01:20:00,465
"And that is,
it shows at the very least

1580
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:03,511
that we can get our minds
around what that horror is."

1581
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:05,177
And Danny,
from the beginning,

1582
01:20:05,178 --> 01:20:06,638
has his mind
all over the problem.

1583
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:07,845
He's looking at it.

1584
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:10,804
In a way, Danny's
big wheeling back and forth,

1585
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:11,968
up and down the hallways...

1586
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:13,797
Danny is learning that hotel.

1587
01:20:13,798 --> 01:20:14,798
He's learning all the horrors.

1588
01:20:14,799 --> 01:20:15,798
He's seeing them.

1589
01:20:15,799 --> 01:20:17,090
But they're just in the past,

1590
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:18,465
and Hallorann
gave him the secret.

1591
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:20,178
He said, "Remember, Danny."

1592
01:20:20,179 --> 01:20:22,006
Remember what Tony tells him.

1593
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:23,256
Remember
what Mr. Hallorann said:

1594
01:20:23,257 --> 01:20:24,803
"They're just like
pictures in a book.

1595
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,756
They're not real."

1596
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:30,630
Now, that's
a really important lesson.

1597
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,005
People who shine,
who see through history,

1598
01:20:33,006 --> 01:20:37,505
understand that the past
simply does not exist

1599
01:20:37,506 --> 01:20:38,756
except in one place.

1600
01:20:38,757 --> 01:20:40,678
And that's the present tense
instant of the mind,

1601
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:41,714
remembering.

1602
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:45,466
That is, exactly... that is
a place you can go to somehow

1603
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:47,380
and yet it doesn't exist.

1604
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:50,589
And so Hallorann tells Danny,

1605
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:51,841
"You're gonna see
some horrible things."

1606
01:20:51,842 --> 01:20:52,838
Apparently, he told him.

1607
01:20:52,839 --> 01:20:54,088
"You're gonna see
some horrible things,

1608
01:20:54,089 --> 01:20:55,258
"but remember,
they're not real.

1609
01:20:55,259 --> 01:20:56,471
"They're like
pictures in a book.

1610
01:20:56,472 --> 01:20:58,589
They no longer exist."

1611
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:01,715
That's a key to not
getting depressed about it.

1612
01:21:01,716 --> 01:21:06,962
And that's...

1613
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:11,005
You see, this is a movie
about what the past...

1614
01:21:11,006 --> 01:21:14,545
how the past impinges,
any past,

1615
01:21:14,546 --> 01:21:16,546
and about
how to get over that

1616
01:21:16,547 --> 01:21:18,512
and how not to be
a victim of history.

1617
01:21:20,713 --> 01:21:22,964
You know, if you doubt
what I've written about it,

1618
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,463
just go see the movie.

1619
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:26,338
I've figured all this out
from just seeing the movie.

1620
01:21:26,339 --> 01:21:27,628
It's there.

1621
01:21:27,629 --> 01:21:29,468
It's obvious, and most people
who went and saw the movie said,

1622
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:30,679
"Oh, my goodness.
It <i>is there."</i>

1623
01:21:37,046 --> 01:21:39,502
- Okay.

1624
01:21:39,503 --> 01:21:42,794
Yeah, I was, I mean, obsessed
with <i>The Shining</i>

1625
01:21:42,795 --> 01:21:48,461
and reading all
the online analyses of it

1626
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:51,085
and was particularly
a big fan

1627
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:55,758
of the MSTRMND's lengthy
analysis of it.

1628
01:21:57,003 --> 01:22:00,835
And he had one phrase
that kind of stuck in my mind,

1629
01:22:00,836 --> 01:22:03,918
that <i>The Shining was a film</i>

1630
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:07,295
meant to be seen
forwards and backwards.

1631
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:12,293
And, I mean,
he didn't mean at the same time.

1632
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:18,418
He meant that in,
with the mirror form metaphor

1633
01:22:18,419 --> 01:22:22,959
that's central to the film

1634
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,376
that things, you know...

1635
01:22:26,377 --> 01:22:28,296
that things
forwards and backwards

1636
01:22:28,297 --> 01:22:29,760
happen throughout the film.

1637
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:34,751
That... people walk backwards
in the film, you know,

1638
01:22:34,752 --> 01:22:35,797
people talk backwards.

1639
01:22:35,798 --> 01:22:38,625
- Redrum.
Redrum.

1640
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:41,250
- You know,
if you reverse the film,

1641
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:45,375
it has a format similar to 2001.

1642
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,342
All these kind of things happen.

1643
01:22:47,343 --> 01:22:49,291
At the end of The Shining,

1644
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,130
he's reduced to a screaming ape,

1645
01:22:51,131 --> 01:22:52,713
just like in the beginning
of <i>2001,</i>

1646
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:53,800
there are screaming apes.

1647
01:22:58,876 --> 01:23:03,541
But I was talking to my pals
at the Spectacle Theater,

1648
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:08,042
riffing about experimental ways
of showing films.

1649
01:23:08,043 --> 01:23:09,758
And they were like,
"Well, do you think

1650
01:23:09,759 --> 01:23:12,458
"you could
come up with something,

1651
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:13,959
you know, to show here?"

1652
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,627
I was like, "Sure, what we
should do is we should show

1653
01:23:17,628 --> 01:23:20,294
<i>The Shining forwards
and backwards at the same time.</i>

1654
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:22,791
"You know not...
let's not be creative.

1655
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:25,457
"Let's just actually
reverse the film

1656
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:29,549
and show it exactly mirrored,
superimposed."

1657
01:23:34,248 --> 01:23:37,624
The first image
is of the reflective lake.

1658
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:44,164
And the last image
is of the inscription

1659
01:23:44,165 --> 01:23:45,377
on the photograph,

1660
01:23:45,378 --> 01:23:47,964
in which Jack is frozen
for all time...

1661
01:23:47,965 --> 01:23:51,706
The "Overlook Hotel,
July 4th Ball, 1921."

1662
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:54,788
So those superimposed make it...

1663
01:23:54,789 --> 01:23:57,790
kind of make it seem like
a postcard, like an invitation.

1664
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:58,788
Like...

1665
01:23:58,789 --> 01:23:59,912
[laughs]

1666
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:03,913
"Come to the July 4th Ball
here in Crater Lake."

1667
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:07,996
There's a really cool part
where, like, you know,

1668
01:24:07,997 --> 01:24:11,705
the helicopters
are following his car

1669
01:24:11,706 --> 01:24:16,121
and his name scrolls up
in the credits

1670
01:24:16,122 --> 01:24:20,287
and, like, meets the car,
right...

1671
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,787
right in the same position
where the grid of photographs,

1672
01:24:24,788 --> 01:24:27,625
right in that photograph
that he's trapped in.

1673
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:30,292
So his car,
his name and his photograph

1674
01:24:30,293 --> 01:24:32,911
all line up for one second.

1675
01:24:32,912 --> 01:24:33,911
Pretty cool.

1676
01:24:33,912 --> 01:24:35,620
[laughs]

1677
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:38,953
The interview has a, like...
it's great.

1678
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:40,623
While they're talking about...

1679
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:43,245
you know, very dryly about
all the murders that happened,

1680
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,207
like, you know,
in the superimposition,

1681
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:48,045
Jack's running around with an
axe going bananas, you know.

1682
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,379
[chuckles]

1683
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:55,870
There's a lot of just great,
great, great superimpositions

1684
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,744
of people's faces lining up,
like Jack's...

1685
01:24:59,745 --> 01:25:03,453
Jack's, like,
got the death look,

1686
01:25:03,454 --> 01:25:04,999
and he's staring
through Danny's face

1687
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,791
as Danny's eating a sandwich.

1688
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:12,326
Then there's a lot of things...
there's a lot of, like...

1689
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:14,076
there's a... you know,
there's some fun jokes,

1690
01:25:14,077 --> 01:25:15,794
but then there's
serious stuff where,

1691
01:25:15,795 --> 01:25:17,659
like, you...

1692
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,910
where the hallucination...
the visions that Danny has,

1693
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:23,535
where you'll see them,

1694
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,786
like, overlaid
on top of other situations.

1695
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:28,786
Like the twin girls
are overlaid on top of Wendy,

1696
01:25:28,787 --> 01:25:30,909
which, if you study the film,

1697
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,956
you see that the twins
are associated with Wendy.

1698
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:37,617
They're like her,
like, visionary counterpart.

1699
01:25:37,618 --> 01:25:40,951
All the symbols
in the movie start...

1700
01:25:40,952 --> 01:25:43,533
overlap
in the superimposition,

1701
01:25:43,534 --> 01:25:46,160
backwards/forwards
superimposition.

1702
01:25:47,784 --> 01:25:51,867
The murdered twins
are overlaid across Jack's face,

1703
01:25:51,868 --> 01:25:53,992
and he looks like a clown.

1704
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:55,867
It makes like a clown mask,

1705
01:25:55,868 --> 01:25:57,368
and there's blood everywhere

1706
01:25:57,369 --> 01:25:59,116
and, like, blood on his lips.

1707
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,324
[laughs]

1708
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:03,116
And blood
coming out of his eyes.

1709
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:07,366
And, like, you know,
Danny takes it...

1710
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:08,913
you know, like, Danny
has his hands over his face,

1711
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,824
and it's... Jack is looking out
from his head,

1712
01:26:12,825 --> 01:26:17,699
and then he open... he, like,
peeks out and he sees Grady.

1713
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:22,116
And then Grady and Jack
continue their conversation

1714
01:26:22,117 --> 01:26:23,332
into the next scene,

1715
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:27,033
which is where
he's watching television.

1716
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:29,125
And it's like they have this...

1717
01:26:29,126 --> 01:26:31,615
their lips
are, like, in the TV.

1718
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:34,082
Jack and Grady's lips
are in the TV.

1719
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:38,323
And these masks
are formed by the windows.

1720
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:41,614
And ifs like
Danny's envisioning this.

1721
01:26:41,615 --> 01:26:45,281
Danny's envisioning...

1722
01:26:45,282 --> 01:26:49,614
you know, envisioning the pact
between Grady and jack.

1723
01:26:49,615 --> 01:26:56,156
Like, he goes into...
he sneaks into the bedroom,

1724
01:26:56,157 --> 01:26:57,702
like, right through
Jack's head,

1725
01:26:57,703 --> 01:27:00,406
right in between them.

1726
01:27:00,407 --> 01:27:05,447
And just like that scene is...

1727
01:27:05,448 --> 01:27:08,821
that's the scene
where Danny is testing

1728
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:11,664
his father, like,
"Do you really, you know!"...

1729
01:27:11,665 --> 01:27:13,655
"Do you like this place?

1730
01:27:13,656 --> 01:27:15,076
You're not gonna hurt us,
are you?"

1731
01:27:15,077 --> 01:27:18,289
Like, Danny kind of knows
that his dad has lost it.

1732
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,488
The last shot is 1921,

1733
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:32,071
and the first shot
is of the road.

1734
01:27:32,072 --> 01:27:34,742
Ullman mentions
that it was finished in 1921.

1735
01:27:34,743 --> 01:27:38,988
So it's, again, it's a way
of returning the narrative

1736
01:27:38,989 --> 01:27:40,579
back to the beginning.

1737
01:27:54,821 --> 01:27:58,038
- Mr. Hallorann,
what is in room 237?

1738
01:27:59,987 --> 01:28:01,528
- Nothing.

1739
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:05,153
There ain't nothing in room 237.

1740
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:08,495
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway,

1741
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,237
so stay out.

1742
01:28:11,237 --> 01:28:12,985
- In the sex room, 237,

1743
01:28:12,986 --> 01:28:15,863
where we see this beautiful,
sexual temptress,

1744
01:28:15,864 --> 01:28:19,776
who then becomes
a rotting body...

1745
01:28:19,777 --> 01:28:21,994
realistically depicted
as a rotting body...

1746
01:28:21,995 --> 01:28:26,152
the design on the rug shows
basically the most...

1747
01:28:26,153 --> 01:28:28,620
in geometric form
with round curves...

1748
01:28:28,621 --> 01:28:31,360
the act of intercourse itself,

1749
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:32,827
one after another
after another after another,

1750
01:28:32,828 --> 01:28:33,943
sort of like a picture

1751
01:28:33,944 --> 01:28:37,818
of down through the generations
of what produces life.

1752
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:41,445
You go back out in the hallway,
in the larger society,

1753
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,570
and the round curves
of that very same design

1754
01:28:43,571 --> 01:28:45,859
have become hexagons,

1755
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,077
not so nice and round,
and a little bit more

1756
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:50,109
like the beehive hexagon

1757
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:52,403
but down the whole corridors
of history.

1758
01:28:52,404 --> 01:28:54,118
I think he's got
an image of it there,

1759
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:57,192
so he's talking about
the family of man,

1760
01:28:57,193 --> 01:28:59,113
both in
an individual nuclear family

1761
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:02,485
and in the whole course
of our genetic history.

1762
01:29:05,609 --> 01:29:10,941
- Once Denny enters room 237,
like, that's...

1763
01:29:10,942 --> 01:29:12,488
that kind of is, like,
the activation

1764
01:29:12,489 --> 01:29:15,899
of the rest of the movie.

1765
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:22,233
Like, that's what causes Jack
to go insane finally.

1766
01:29:22,234 --> 01:29:27,200
That's what brings Hallorann
to the hotel.

1767
01:29:29,941 --> 01:29:35,113
Like, the room 237 is, like,
is sort of this...

1768
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,982
I mean, I compare it
to the mysterious hotel room

1769
01:29:40,983 --> 01:29:43,148
at the end of 2001,

1770
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:44,445
where there's...

1771
01:29:45,774 --> 01:29:49,107
It's this strange,
strange place

1772
01:29:49,108 --> 01:29:53,279
that somehow, like, transforms
the rest of the narrative.

1773
01:30:12,231 --> 01:30:14,903
<i>The Shining takes place
on the top of</i> a <i>mountain</i>

1774
01:30:14,904 --> 01:30:17,397
in kind of like a, you know,

1775
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:21,147
magical shape-shifting
environment.

1776
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:24,730
And, like, travel is...

1777
01:30:24,731 --> 01:30:25,902
traveling out of it is...

1778
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:27,272
[laughs]

1779
01:30:27,273 --> 01:30:30,773
<i>You</i> know, <i>instead</i> of <i>2001, where
you're traveling to something,</i>

1780
01:30:30,774 --> 01:30:35,443
<i>the point of The Shining
is to escape, is to travel out.</i>

1781
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,146
And room 237 is, like...

1782
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:45,646
it's kind of like
the escape pod of...

1783
01:30:45,647 --> 01:30:47,897
of the hotel.

1784
01:30:56,354 --> 01:31:01,311
- If you multiply the numbers 2,
3 and 7, you get 42.

1785
01:31:01,312 --> 01:31:04,404
Now, I admit, perhaps
I'm grasping at straws there,

1786
01:31:04,405 --> 01:31:08,103
but it is consistent
with the pattern of reference

1787
01:31:08,104 --> 01:31:09,602
in the film.

1788
01:31:09,603 --> 01:31:12,024
- Another thing which
my film <i>Kubrick's Odyssey</i>

1789
01:31:12,025 --> 01:31:14,519
really reveals

1790
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,482
is the carpeting on the floor

1791
01:31:16,483 --> 01:31:18,103
during the famous Danny scene,

1792
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:22,269
where he stands up
with his Apollo 11 shirt.

1793
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:29,352
The patterns in the carpeting
exactly match launch pad 39-A.

1794
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:32,024
You know, even the driveway
and everything.

1795
01:31:32,025 --> 01:31:37,768
And if you notice in that shot,
the pattern on the rug changes

1796
01:31:37,769 --> 01:31:39,860
when Danny stands up.

1797
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:43,852
- The carpet's reversed,

1798
01:31:43,853 --> 01:31:46,146
and there's
no pathway there anymore.

1799
01:31:46,147 --> 01:31:49,771
The pathway that the ball took
rolling down towards Danny

1800
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:51,601
is gone now.

1801
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:53,439
It's no longer there
'cause it's reversed.

1802
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,562
And you get
a sense of a closure.

1803
01:31:55,563 --> 01:31:57,311
Now the hexagon is closed.

1804
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,605
It's almost like
he's been closed in.

1805
01:32:13,976 --> 01:32:15,693
- Seven years after
The Shining had <i>come</i> out,

1806
01:32:15,694 --> 01:32:17,811
to my surprise,
nobody had written,

1807
01:32:17,812 --> 01:32:19,271
as far as I could tell,

1808
01:32:19,272 --> 01:32:21,609
about what the major themes
of the movie were,

1809
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:25,599
beyond the delightfully scary
immediate story

1810
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,766
of the family
and the hotel itself.

1811
01:32:28,767 --> 01:32:33,016
And I was actually doing a story
somewhere over in Europe,

1812
01:32:33,017 --> 01:32:36,019
and I was told over the phone
that the posters were out

1813
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,313
<i>for Full Metal Jacket.</i>

1814
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:40,099
I asked about the description,

1815
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,601
and I was told it had a peace
sign right next to the words

1816
01:32:43,602 --> 01:32:44,598
"Born to kill."

1817
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:45,849
And I said,
"Oh, my goodness.

1818
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,269
His next movie's gonna be
about some of the same themes."

1819
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,858
Anyway,
I thought, "My goodness."

1820
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:53,932
I had presumed that
it would have become obvious,

1821
01:32:53,933 --> 01:32:55,024
so I thought,
"What the heck?

1822
01:32:55,025 --> 01:32:58,931
"I'll just see if I can write
an article about it

1823
01:32:58,932 --> 01:33:01,432
to give people more fun
when they see Full Metal Jacket,

1824
01:33:01,433 --> 01:33:02,684
to know what
his last movie was about,

1825
01:33:02,685 --> 01:33:03,978
in larger senses.

1826
01:33:08,974 --> 01:33:13,597
- I've gotten a lot of flak
from people who work for NASA.

1827
01:33:13,598 --> 01:33:16,392
And, you know, I want to tell
them, that I, you know,

1828
01:33:16,393 --> 01:33:18,806
I'm not saying
that we didn't go to the moon.

1829
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:20,431
And I'm not saying
that their technology

1830
01:33:20,432 --> 01:33:21,770
that they helped build

1831
01:33:21,771 --> 01:33:24,389
isn't great and awesome
and everything.

1832
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,264
I'm just saying
that what we saw was faked.

1833
01:33:26,265 --> 01:33:28,514
And I know I have it proved

1834
01:33:28,515 --> 01:33:31,430
with the front-screen
projection process.

1835
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:34,389
As far as what
the government has done,

1836
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:37,558
I fully expect my taxes
to be audited next year,

1837
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:38,852
to be honest with you.

1838
01:33:38,853 --> 01:33:44,054
And, you know,
I've had visitations, you know.

1839
01:33:44,055 --> 01:33:46,893
And they're definitely
watching me for sure,

1840
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:49,595
and they're not too happy
with what's going on here.

1841
01:33:49,596 --> 01:33:50,892
And I think
they're probably very worried

1842
01:33:50,893 --> 01:33:52,929
about the next film.

1843
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,305
And that one will be
the really explosive film.

1844
01:34:01,846 --> 01:34:04,188
- We were walking
along the beach on vacation

1845
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:07,345
with some people
in Costa Rica.

1846
01:34:07,346 --> 01:34:08,553
[laughs]

1847
01:34:08,554 --> 01:34:09,645
I had
this delightful experience.

1848
01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:11,432
We were walking along
with a young couple

1849
01:34:11,433 --> 01:34:13,146
who were from San Francisco.

1850
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,761
And it was a long walk.

1851
01:34:14,762 --> 01:34:17,763
We'd gone through
this big, beautiful jungle.

1852
01:34:17,764 --> 01:34:19,350
And were coming
back on the beach

1853
01:34:19,351 --> 01:34:21,014
to walk back
to where the tent camp was.

1854
01:34:21,015 --> 01:34:22,094
And the guy started...

1855
01:34:22,095 --> 01:34:23,219
we started chatting
about Kubrick.

1856
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,311
I said, "Oh, Kubrick's great,"

1857
01:34:24,312 --> 01:34:25,594
And the guy said, "You know,

about the American Indians. "</i>

1859
01:34:27,393 --> 01:34:28,433
I said, "Really?"

1860
01:34:28,434 --> 01:34:31,928
And he went on talking,
and I said, "Really?"

1861
01:34:31,929 --> 01:34:34,765
And I just couldn't resist
just playing dumb for while

1862
01:34:34,766 --> 01:34:36,682
while he told me
the whole thing.

1864

♪ Dies irae, dies illa ♪

01:34:47,927 --> 01:34:49,769
- Kubrick just sets up
synchronous space.

1867
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:52,052
His movies are...

1868
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,801
they create synchronous
situations in themselves.

1869
01:34:54,802 --> 01:34:56,098
There's this man who says,
you know,

1870
01:34:56,099 --> 01:34:57,719
"Quite a party, isn't it?"

1871
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,639
Why did Kubrick put him there,

1872
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,556
with the split down his head?

1873
01:35:01,557 --> 01:35:03,301
Why did he put him there?

1874
01:35:03,302 --> 01:35:05,268
And I was contemplating that.

1875
01:35:05,269 --> 01:35:08,718
And in comes my son.

1876
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,057
And he was nine years old
at the time.

1877
01:35:11,058 --> 01:35:12,763
And he didn't know
what I was working on.

1878
01:35:12,764 --> 01:35:15,761
And he came in,
and he began to tell me a story.

1879
01:35:15,762 --> 01:35:18,055
And he said,
"I've just thought this up."

1880
01:35:18,056 --> 01:35:22,300
And his characters head was
split open with a chaos bolt.

1881
01:35:22,301 --> 01:35:26,176
And the character says, "Talk
about a splitting headache."

1882
01:35:26,177 --> 01:35:28,392
And out of the contents
of his head

1883
01:35:28,393 --> 01:35:31,967
leaps a small person
who is his real self.

1884
01:35:31,968 --> 01:35:34,434
And it goes running off,
saying in a high, squeaky voice,

1885
01:35:34,435 --> 01:35:36,675
"Forget this.
I'm going home."

1886
01:35:36,676 --> 01:35:40,220
And, yeah, I thought that was
really stunning synchronicity,

1887
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:42,764
I mean, 'cause you've got
all the elements there.

1888
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:44,008
You've got the ax.

1889
01:35:44,009 --> 01:35:45,680
You've got the whole idea
of the lightning bolt,

1890
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:47,637
the chaos bolt,
striking the person's head,

1891
01:35:47,638 --> 01:35:49,008
the splitting headache.

1892

You've got Tony...

1893
01:35:50,592 --> 01:35:52,091
Tony's squeaky voice, yeah.

1894
01:35:53,633 --> 01:35:55,721
I thought that was
quite a synchronicity.

1895
01:35:55,722 --> 01:35:57,389
- One can always argue
that Kubrick

1896
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:01,298
had only some or even none
of these in mind.

1897
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:04,266
But we all know
from postmodern film criticism

1898
01:36:04,267 --> 01:36:07,798
that author intent
is only part of the story

1899
01:36:07,799 --> 01:36:09,716
of any work of art.

1900
01:36:09,717 --> 01:36:13,631
And those meanings
are there regardless

1901
01:36:13,632 --> 01:36:17,215
of whether the creator
of the work

1902
01:36:17,216 --> 01:36:18,756
was conscious of them.

1903
01:36:18,757 --> 01:36:20,756
- I think... if you want
to know what I think,

1904
01:36:20,757 --> 01:36:23,176
I think the hotel
is so whacked out

1905
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,423
that I don't have any clue
what's going on

1906
01:36:25,424 --> 01:36:26,922
from the beginning.

1907
01:36:26,923 --> 01:36:29,174
When you really sit
and think about it, I mean...

1908
01:36:29,175 --> 01:36:31,264
because the whole thing
is so whacked out,

1909
01:36:31,265 --> 01:36:33,422
and it's so not put together...

1910
01:36:33,423 --> 01:36:36,756
it's so... everything
is so wildly out of place

1911
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:39,550
that when you...
the more... the closer you get

1912
01:36:39,551 --> 01:36:42,717
into looking at things,
the more you look at them.

1913
01:36:42,718 --> 01:36:46,306
It's kind of like, you know,
the scene in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>

1914
01:36:46,307 --> 01:36:49,754
where Bill goes... you know,
he returns.

1915
01:36:49,755 --> 01:36:51,587
He retraces his footsteps,

1916
01:36:51,588 --> 01:36:55,505
and he goes back
to the mansion where he was.

1917
01:36:55,506 --> 01:36:58,130
And he's told, you know,
to stop your inquiries.

1918
01:36:58,131 --> 01:36:59,718
They will serve you no purpose.

1919
01:36:59,719 --> 01:37:02,590
It's almost like it gets to that
with The Shining.

1920
01:37:02,591 --> 01:37:05,464
The more you magnify things,
the more you look at them,

1921
01:37:05,465 --> 01:37:09,257
the less purpose it serves
'cause it's so out of whack.

1922
01:37:09,258 --> 01:37:11,920
None of it makes sense
from the beginning.

1923
01:37:11,921 --> 01:37:13,388
- There must be
a lot of stuff in there

1924
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:15,795
that nobody has yet seen,

1925
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:18,092
so people
ought to keep watching it.

1926
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:27,545
- But why would he make
the movie so complicated?

1927
01:37:27,546 --> 01:37:33,545
- Yeah, I mean, but why did
Joyce write <i>Finnegan's Wake?</i>

01:37:33,546 --> 01:37:35,253
[laughs]

1929
01:37:35,254 --> 01:37:38,086
It's a way of, like,
opening doors

1930
01:37:38,087 --> 01:37:40,258
from, like, a hermetically
sealed reality

1931
01:37:40,259 --> 01:37:44,460
into possibilities.

1932
01:37:44,461 --> 01:37:47,178
And it's also a way of trapping
someone like me.

1933
01:37:47,179 --> 01:37:49,335
[laughs]

1934
01:37:49,336 --> 01:37:54,211

and, like, keeps finding them.

you're like, "Man, I've been...

into it, into this maze,
into this trap.

1948
01:38:28,127 --> 01:38:30,298
I mean,
there are ways out of it.

1949
01:38:30,299 --> 01:38:33,417
And Danny finds a way out of it,

1950
01:38:33,418 --> 01:38:35,792
you know,
by retracing his steps,

1951
01:38:35,793 --> 01:38:37,668
by going backwards and forwards.

1952
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:42,627
And once you start, you know,
studying, you know,

synchronicity and symbolism,

1954
01:38:45,668 --> 01:38:46,754
then, like, suddenly, like,
