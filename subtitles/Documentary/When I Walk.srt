1
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,399
-Is he here yet?
-No.

2
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,695
-You scared him.
-I gotta take a massive piss.

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,448
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

4
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,716
Anyone got any beer?

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,929
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

6
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:40,017
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

7
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,646
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

8
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,524
-Thanks a lot, Eric.
-Anytime, anywhere.

9
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,653
-This is gonna be sweet.
-I'm glad I thought of it.

10
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,406
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

11
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,452
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,873
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

13
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,586
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

14
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,965
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

15
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,385
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

16
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,471
You know I don't dance.

17
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,350
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

18
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,854
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

19
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,440
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

20
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,026
Like yourself.

21
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,486
He's here!

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,280
All right, here he comes.

23
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,451
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,038
I can't wait to see you fly!

25
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,588
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

26
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,885
You're late.

27
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,764
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know....

28
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,853
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

29
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,816
If there is a next time!

30
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,488
Dean! Is he always like that?

31
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,659
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

32
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,370
Wait up, baby!

33
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:30,711
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

34
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,235
Okay, here's the deal.

35
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,031
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

36
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,825
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

37
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,244
-You ready?
-Yeah.

38
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,206
All right. All right.

39
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's do this, okay?

40
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,468
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

41
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,639
-How deep is this?
-I don't really know.

42
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,390
Let's go find out.

43
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,312
Let's do it.

44
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,926
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

45
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,556
Come on, let's go!

46
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,224
Jump!

47
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,771
-You done this?
-We've all done it.

48
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,110
-I hope you had your Wheaties!
-You guys gonna do this tonight?

49
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,195
On three.

50
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,447
One.

51
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,324
Two.

52
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,784
Three!

53
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,306
Landon, he's hurt!

55
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,808
-Is he okay?
-Landon, get down here!

56
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,311
-What the hell?
-Dean, what the hell?

57
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,855
-You guys, he's hurt!
-Come on, man!

58
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,526
-I told you it was a bad idea!
-Get him out of the water!

59
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,865
-Hurry up!
-Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

60
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,492
Help me!

61
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:13,916
-Get him over here!
-There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

62
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,211
Get him out of the water!

63
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,130
Watch his head! Watch his head!

64
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,717
Hey, who's down there?

65
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,178
Tracie, come on!

66
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,058
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

67
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,268
Come on, Landon.

68
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,021
Come on!

69
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,273
You guys, just take him!

70
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,484
Give me his arms!

71
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,569
I got him.

72
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,367
We gotta get out of here.

73
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,288
-Go! Get out of here!
-Landon, come on!

74
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,168
I told you not to do this!

75
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,878
Calm down.

76
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,176
Belinda, let's go!

77
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,764
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

78
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,288
Damn it!

79
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,645
Shit!

80
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,175
Put your hands on the wheel.

81
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,792
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,670
I don't think I can go anyplace.

83
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,925
-Maybe I should call your father.
-No.

84
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,386
I'm not talking to him.

85
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:18,308
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

86
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,898
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

87
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,444
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

88
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,490
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

89
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,009
-So how's the leg, man?
-It's good.

90
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,428
I can't believe you were in jail.

91
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,182
-What'd you tell them?
-It was a nice night for a drive.

92
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,811
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

93
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,146
Tried to help him, got spooked.

94
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,817
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

95
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,363
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

96
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,825
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

97
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,327
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

98
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,122
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

99
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,333
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

100
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,045
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

101
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,006
Nice sweater.

102
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,091
Thank you.

103
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,225
Thank you.

104
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,159
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

105
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,037
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

106
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,209
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

107
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,253
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

108
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,464
What, are you gonna expel me?

109
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,424
Not yet.

110
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:43,889
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

111
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,559
-For pay?
-For the inner satisfaction it brings.

112
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,231
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

113
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,692
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

114
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,195
The spring play?

115
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,282
It's time you experienced
other things.

116
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,370
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

117
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,705
Don't blow it, Landon.

118
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:19,925
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

119
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,929
-Does anyone know what it is?
-It's a star frame.

120
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,934
This is a star frame.

121
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,437
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

122
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:38,569
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

123
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,281
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

124
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,325
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

125
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:50,205
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

126
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,709
Well, if there is a higher power...

127
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,503
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

128
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,381
He's too busy looking for your brain.

129
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,719
Laugh, it's a joke.

130
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,638
-Let's get out of here.
-I gotta stay.

131
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,100
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

132
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,394
Come on. Come on.

133
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:16,231
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

134
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,484
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

135
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,034
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

136
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,415
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

137
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,835
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

138
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,381
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

139
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,676
I know. I just thought....

140
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,428
It's over.

141
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,516
Yeah. Whatever.

142
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,736
Okay.

143
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,868
Good morning, Landon.

144
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,621
Landon, wake up!

145
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,666
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

146
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,377
Up!

147
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,504
It's Saturday, no school.

148
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,549
Tutoring.

149
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,278
Let's try this again.

150
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,782
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

151
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,993
What do you think?

152
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,079
Man, I think this is bullshit!

153
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,585
Makes two of us.

154
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,611
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

155
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,865
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

156
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,825
No.

157
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,581
So I saw you in there with Luis.

158
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,375
And I know it can be difficult...

159
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,171
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

160
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,929
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

161
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,392
That would be a no.

162
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,189
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

163
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,275
Is this your idea of small talk?

164
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,238
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

165
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,241
-It's called peer pressure.
-How do you know?

166
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,701
You read it in your precious book?

167
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,793
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

168
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,921
But I do. I do.

169
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,424
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

170
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,470
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

171
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,433
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

172
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:43,230
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

173
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,983
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

174
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,861
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

175
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,654
How's that sound?

176
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,618
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

177
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:01,039
-You don't care what people think?
-No.

178
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:33,780
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

179
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,618
This is bullshit. Thanks.

180
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:42,039
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

181
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:46,001
-Be back in an hour.
-Tell them to do West Side Story.

182
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,341
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

183
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,679
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

184
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:03,185
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

185
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,982
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

186
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,651
Eddie, perhaps--

187
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,404
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

188
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,365
Sure.

189
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,744
Now then, let's see....

190
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:26,667
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

191
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,921
-Sally will be playing Caroline.
-Congratulations.

192
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,299
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

193
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:40,264
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

194
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,975
When did you know, Tommy?

195
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,602
lKnow what?

196
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,188
That we were in love.

197
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,692
Love?

198
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,906
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

199
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,784
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

200
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:05,581
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

201
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:13,046
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

202
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,424
...pour me another glass.

203
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,385
Are you trying to be bad at this?

204
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,763
No, just comes naturally.

205
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,019
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

206
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,276
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

207
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:38,405
-Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right. See you.

208
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,202
Bye.

209
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:55,214
-So would it kill you to try?
-Yep, and I'm too young to die.

210
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,592
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

211
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,554
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

212
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:08,101
-That's thoroughly predictable.
-Your act only works on an audience.

213
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,802
Feeling Christian?

214
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,680
Seat belt?

215
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,162
-I forfeit.
-Thank you.

216
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,622
Forty-two.

217
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:12,958
What do you mean, forty-two?

218
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,336
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

219
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,592
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

220
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,802
Like getting a new personality?

221
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,014
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

222
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,182
Ambitious.

223
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,102
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

224
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,856
What's number one?

225
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:41,653
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

226
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,669
I've come...

227
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,213
...to see if you're ready.

228
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:03,383
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

229
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,386
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

230
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:10,724
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

231
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,727
When you walked into....

232
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:20,692
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

233
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,986
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

234
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:26,824
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

235
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,369
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

236
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,247
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

237
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,417
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

238
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:42,130
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

239
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,924
I didn't write it, okay?

240
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:48,720
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

241
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,350
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

242
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,563
I'm just busting on you.

243
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:02,901
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

244
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,445
With tomatoes.

245
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,656
Thanks, man.

246
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:11,577
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

247
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,787
-Yeah.
-No problem.

248
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,131
Jamie.

249
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,217
What do you want?

250
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:32,139
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

251
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,851
I need help with my lines.

252
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:41,565
-Landon Carter's asking me for help?
-Yeah.

253
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,568
Okay, I'll pray for you.

254
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,778
Jamie, look--

255
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:51,283
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

256
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,455
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

257
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:00,125
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

258
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,130
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

259
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:10,093
-Please?
-Okay. One condition, though.

260
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,970
What's that?

261
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,557
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

262
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:24,274
-That's not a problem.
-Okay. I'll see you today after school.

263
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,572
Landon Carter is coming here?

264
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,992
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

265
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,162
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

266
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,874
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

267
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,127
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

268
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,548
It's him I don't trust, not you.

269
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,813
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

270
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,982
Come on in.

271
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:14,366
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

272
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,577
Oh, yeah.

273
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,996
It's not likely.

274
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,850
That is one scary-looking--

275
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,853
-Jesus!
-No, Jamie's father.

276
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:47,858
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

277
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,776
Congratulations.

278
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,946
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

279
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,240
I didn't let you.

280
00:26:56,074 --> 00:27:01,246
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

281
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:07,127
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

282
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,339
But I see you.

283
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,261
I'll be in my office, just here.

284
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,429
Ready?

285
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,391
Yeah, let's go.

286
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:30,442
-Landon! Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

287
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,445
-Hey, come here.
-What's up?

288
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:36,949
-Are we cool?
-Yeah, sure.

289
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,011
What the hell?

290
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,405
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same.

291
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,325
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

292
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,952
Maybe.

293
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,663
Where you going?

294
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,708
Come and see.

295
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,675
Okay. What is that?

296
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:41,597
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

297
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,683
Take a look.

298
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,441
Saturn. Very cool.

299
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:57,905
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

300
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,992
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

301
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,954
Nature's miracles. I get it.

302
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:10,000
-Get what?
-That you're into all this stuff.

303
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,711
This stuff?

304
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,299
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

305
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:21,053
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

306
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,722
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

307
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,600
Tell that to those who suffer.

308
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:33,607
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

309
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,319
-She's trashy.
-Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

310
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,364
Here comes your leading lady.

311
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:44,576
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

312
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,621
ln your dreams.

313
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:01,635
Hi. Where's your sweater?

314
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,769
Let's get out of here.

315
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,814
What's up, dude?

316
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:45,512
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

317
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,474
What do you want?

318
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:53,437
-You're not in a good mood.
-You don't miss a thing.

319
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,649
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

320
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,986
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

321
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:05,866
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

322
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,826
We could be secret friends.

323
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:11,830
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

324
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,459
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

325
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,841
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

326
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,263
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

327
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,974
But I was very wrong.

328
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,191
Damn it!

329
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,615
Sorry. Sorry.

330
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,445
You know the answer?

331
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,283
Come on, man, I know you know.

332
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,252
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

333
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,046
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

334
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,841
Take a step towards the basket.

335
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,972
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

336
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:53,974
-Yeah.
-Are you?

337
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:57,811
-Yeah.
-So, what did we just make?

338
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:05,360
-A similar triangle?
-Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

339
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,616
You got it, two sides the same.

340
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,577
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

341
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,919
I came to say I'm sorry.

342
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:33,425
Well, you did. Feel better?

343
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,844
No. I feel like shit.

344
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:41,016
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

345
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:48,232
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

346
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,070
I made that jump once.

347
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,114
I thought I was a badass.

348
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:02,538
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

349
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:06,708
Did it hurt?

350
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,338
Like hell.

351
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,091
Good.

352
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,102
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

353
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:32,943
-Pour me a drink, Joey.
-You promised me, Tommy.

354
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,321
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

355
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,907
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

356
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:42,870
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

357
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,039
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

358
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:49,084
That's it! We are through!

359
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:52,254
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

360
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,174
And I hope you drown in it!

361
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:59,011
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

362
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:01,972
The singer?

363
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:06,977
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

364
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:10,606
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

365
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,361
Look, I ain't blaming you.

366
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,323
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

367
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,659
I just did what I had to.

368
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:32,920
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

369
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,757
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

370
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,134
Nothing's coincidence.

371
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:43,847
Your face.... You look so familiar.

372
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:48,727
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

373
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,480
Tell me about this dream girl.

374
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,322
Well, I don't remember.

375
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,453
All I know...

376
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,835
...is you're beautiful.

377
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,720
The song, the song.

378
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,139
The dream.

379
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,185
Help me to remember.

380
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,522
Will you sing for me?

381
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,519
That was great.

382
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,317
Hi, kids.

383
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:51,864
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

384
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:53,699
Thanks, but please stop.

385
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,368
-Don't be home too late.
-Okay. Thanks.

386
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,829
Okay, okay.

387
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:03,375
-lnteresting rewrite you did there.
-I did my best.

388
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,961
Your acting didn't suck either.

389
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,756
-Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
-Okay.

390
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:13,218
-Landon, you were marvelous!
-Thank you.

391
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:20,100
Landon? Fine performance, son.

392
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:24,188
-What are you doing here?
-I thought we'd get a bite.

393
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,565
-I'm not hungry.
-Don't walk away.

394
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,567
You taught me how.

395
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,536
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:42,039
Look who's here.

397
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,462
Don't look at him.

398
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,256
You don't want to stare too much.

399
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,345
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

400
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:13,654
-People can see.
-That would ruin your reputation how?

401
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,364
What's that?

402
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:21,829
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

403
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:26,542
-And how many books are there?
-A hundred.

404
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,588
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

405
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:36,093
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

406
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:46,812
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

407
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,689
Maybe....

408
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:53,986
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

409
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:58,991
-Maybe you inspire me.
-Sounds like bull.

410
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,909
-Which part?
-All of it.

411
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,996
-It's not.
-Prove it.

412
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,797
Jamie!

413
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,719
-You've no idea how to be a friend.
-I don't just want that.

414
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:23,056
-You don't know what you want.
-You're scared someone wants you.

415
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:27,561
-Why would that scare me?
-You couldn't hide behind books...

416
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:31,565
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

417
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:35,027
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

418
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:38,030
It's because you want
to be with me too.

419
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,637
We gonna get this party jumping!

420
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:05,807
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

421
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:09,394
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

422
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:14,233
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

423
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:17,110
What we got here?

424
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:22,533
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

425
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,369
Jamie lent it to me.

426
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,163
You're listening
to her people's music.

427
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,957
-Her people?
-Yeah...

428
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:34,628
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

429
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,631
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

430
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,758
-She's not like that.
-Well...

431
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:43,720
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

432
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,765
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

433
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:58,110
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

434
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,447
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

435
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:06,285
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

436
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,706
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

437
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:14,626
-Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
-No.

438
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,587
I did.

439
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,850
You.

440
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,352
Me.

441
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,567
What is it?

442
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:40,986
I got you something.

443
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,617
Thank you.

444
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,831
Well, I'll see you at school.

445
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,125
Okay.

446
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:07,763
-Mr. Carter.
-Later, Reverend.

447
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,162
Boys like that...

448
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,124
...they have....

449
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,549
They have expectations.

450
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,344
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

451
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,513
Fine.

452
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,478
You might not care
what I say or think...

453
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:59,648
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

454
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:03,443
I think he wants me to be happy.

455
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:10,117
Dad, it's just a sweater.

456
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,203
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

457
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:27,134
I talked to your dad today.

458
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:32,181
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

459
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:36,727
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

460
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:43,567
-Landon, there are a lot of reasons--
-He left us.

461
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:47,362
You need to forgive him too.

462
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:57,122
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

463
00:49:57,331 --> 00:50:01,043
She was looking all right
in that play.

464
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,586
She doesn't look hot.

465
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:08,050
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

466
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,135
I have the best idea.

467
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,556
Can you do something, like, move it?

468
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:17,893
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

469
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,103
Take one.

470
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:26,610
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

471
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:31,615
Hey, look at this.

472
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:33,700
Here.

473
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:37,037
Take one. Look.

474
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:45,087
-Jamie. Hi.
-Hi.

475
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:49,633
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

476
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:53,011
Landon and I are way over.

477
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,515
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,437
You'd be so beautiful...

479
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:05,482
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

480
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:10,445
-Come on, eat lunch with me.
-Okay.

481
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:12,614
-Want a Tic Tac?
-No, thanks.

482
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,324
Okay.

483
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:27,713
Wow.

484
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,382
Is that you?

485
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:38,182
Nice bod.

486
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:11,006
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

487
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:13,217
Stay here.

488
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,307
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

489
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:23,769
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

490
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:28,524
-Dean, stop!
-You stay out of this!

491
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:40,452
-We're through. We're through.
-That's great.

492
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,788
-We're through forever!
-You okay?

493
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:45,541
-You made a mistake, Landon!
-You sure?

494
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,543
Let's get out of here.

495
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:50,212
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

496
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,509
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:58,929
They're animals, all right?

498
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,515
You want me to take you home?

499
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,394
Let's get out of here.

500
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:11,316
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

501
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:16,572
-Thank you for everything.
-You're welcome.

502
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:26,748
-I want to ask you something.
-Okay.

503
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:35,507
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

504
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:41,388
I'm sorry. I can't go.

505
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:48,562
-You have something else going on?
-No.

506
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,025
-It's not that.
-Then what is it?

507
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:01,408
I'm not allowed to date.

508
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:10,709
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

509
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:17,591
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

510
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:22,554
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap--"

511
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,599
-Can I help you?
-Yes, sir.

512
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:29,520
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

513
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:31,939
That's not possible.

514
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:39,822
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

515
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,451
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

516
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:50,249
You can exit the way you entered.

517
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:58,549
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

518
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:01,426
She deserves more than that.

519
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:04,972
I'm asking you for the same thing...

520
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,392
...you teach us every day in church.

521
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,062
And that's faith.

522
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:21,280
I can't believe you asked permission.

523
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:24,491
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

524
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,535
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

525
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:30,497
-Thank you very much.
-Would you like something to drink?

526
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,958
-Sweet tea, please.
-Make that two.

527
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,877
Right away.

528
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:40,549
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

529
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,552
-Don't even worry about it, okay?
-Okay.

530
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,054
Choose whatever you want.

531
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,391
So, what'll it be?

532
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,603
Is everything okay?

533
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,899
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah, me too. Thanks.

534
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:05,991
Would you like to dance?

535
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:10,913
Sorry, I don't dance.

536
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,917
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

537
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:20,923
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

538
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,884
Everybody can dance.

539
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:26,887
Come on, you can't be that bad.

540
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,932
Please?

541
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,267
For me?

542
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,270
Come on.

543
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:54,331
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

544
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,794
-ln all fairness, you warned me, right?
-That's right.

545
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:06,468
So, what's number one on your list?

546
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,056
Okay.

547
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:15,769
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

548
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,940
Getting out won't be your problem.

549
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:24,695
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

550
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,822
What do you mean?

551
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,660
I mean, you can do anything.

552
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:52,848
-Where are we going?
-Just hold on, you'll see.

553
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,646
Come on, come on. Let's go!

554
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,649
-What are we doing?
-Run!

555
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:06,111
-Okay, okay. Stand there.
-All right.

556
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,240
-One foot there, and one foot here.
-Okay.

557
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:15,329
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

558
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:18,790
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

559
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,211
Okay.

560
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:27,549
You're in two places at once.

561
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,107
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

562
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,318
You choose.

563
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:51,031
-Butterfly.
-Okay.

564
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,163
Where do you want it?

565
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,418
Right here.

566
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,928
Okay.

567
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:23,582
How can you see places like this...

568
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:28,629
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

569
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:33,133
You're lucky to be so sure.

570
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:39,890
It's like the wind.

571
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:45,187
I can't see it, but I feel it.

572
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:47,481
What do you feel?

573
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,863
I feel wonder and beauty...

574
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,867
...joy, love.

575
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:04,039
I mean, it's the center of everything.

576
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:09,878
I might kiss you.

577
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:14,508
I might be bad at it.

578
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:20,389
That's not possible.

579
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,874
I love you.

580
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:04,266
Now would be the time
to say something.

581
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:10,355
I told you not to fall in love with me.

582
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:21,844
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

583
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:26,598
Landon, go home. The night's over.

584
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:28,517
-Good night.
-Good night.

585
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:30,602
Good night, sir.

586
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,526
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

587
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:43,407
-You act with that boy like you're--
-ln love?

588
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,911
-Jamie, you are a child.
-Dad, look at me...

589
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,707
-...I'm not a child.
-Then stop acting childish.

590
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:57,296
I love him.

591
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:04,469
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

592
01:04:25,908 --> 01:04:28,368
-Hey.
-Hey.

593
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,540
-Will you help me?
-Yeah.

594
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:36,668
So, what did you tell your father?

595
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:40,839
The truth. I just left you out of it.

596
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,092
So, what do you want to see?

597
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,553
Pluto.

598
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:50,265
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

599
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:52,309
Right...

600
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:57,564
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

601
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,444
...and a blanket.

602
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:06,490
-You planned this.
-Oh, I hoped for it.

603
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:10,869
Are you trying to seduce me?

604
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:14,289
Why? Are you seducible?

605
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,461
That's what I thought...

606
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,297
...ergo, a second blanket.

607
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:26,510
-One for me, and one for you.
-Thank you.

608
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:43,569
-Can you find this star right here?
-Sure.

609
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:57,040
So why am I looking for this star?

610
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:00,752
Because I had it named for you.

611
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:04,590
See?

612
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,259
It's official.

613
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:12,306
It's from the lnternational
Star Registry.

614
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,103
This is wonderful!

615
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:25,068
I love you.

616
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:41,960
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

617
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:54,556
So, what's your number one?

618
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:02,356
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

619
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,400
That's where my parents were married.

620
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:38,433
-Did you just get in?
-Yeah.

621
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:42,062
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

622
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:43,939
Sorry.

623
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:49,111
Landon, were you with Jamie?

624
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,656
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

625
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,325
-Mom--
-Please!

626
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,619
It's different with her.

627
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:01,290
-It's different with her.
-Yes.

628
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,336
It better be different with her.

629
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:13,468
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

630
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:24,188
"Examine a moon rock.

631
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:27,733
Go to college.

632
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,653
Get into medical school."

633
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:41,663
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

634
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:48,378
-But you'll have to work really hard.
-I can do that.

635
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,217
Yeah, you can.

636
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,932
Mama...

637
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:03,769
...Jamie has faith in me.

638
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:06,897
You know?

639
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:11,819
She makes me want to be different.

640
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,696
Better.

641
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:19,785
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

642
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:28,794
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

643
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:34,842
Are you worried
about your college applications?

644
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,510
No.

645
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:39,221
I'm not applying.

646
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:43,225
-I thought you said--
-No, you assumed.

647
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:47,855
-Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
-No.

648
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,067
What are you gonna do?

649
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,406
I'm sick.

650
01:09:57,614 --> 01:10:01,326
-I'll take you home, you'll be--
-No, Landon!

651
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:03,620
I'm sick.

652
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,085
I have leukemia.

653
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,092
No.

654
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:20,762
-You're 18, you're perfect.
-No.

655
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:25,601
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

656
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:32,774
So why didn't you tell me?

657
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:37,279
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

658
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:40,866
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

659
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:44,328
-lncluding me?
-Especially you!

660
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:52,336
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

661
01:10:56,673 --> 01:11:01,011
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

662
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:12,082
Dad, open the door!

663
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:23,927
Landon?

664
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:28,390
-I need your help.
-What's wrong? You okay?

665
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:32,060
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's....

666
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:39,151
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

667
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:41,069
Okay, calm down.

668
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:44,823
-Can you help me or not?
-I don't know her case.

669
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:49,119
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't--

670
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:53,874
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

671
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:57,419
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

672
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:37,978
Your mom called me.

673
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:41,398
Talk to me, man.

674
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:43,817
About what?

675
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:47,988
About you...

676
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,282
...about Jamie.

677
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,163
What's there to talk about?

678
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:01,126
She's the best person I've ever known.

679
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,050
I didn't understand.

680
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:15,557
It's okay, man.

681
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,936
It's okay.

682
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:45,963
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

683
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,260
I'm not going anywhere.

684
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:54,096
Please tell Jamie that.

685
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:28,630
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

686
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:30,924
I made you do too many things--

687
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:34,344
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

688
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,898
Are you scared?

689
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:48,442
To death.

690
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:53,780
Lighten up.

691
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,241
It's not funny.

692
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:20,516
I'm scared of not being with you.

693
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:27,272
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

694
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:38,242
I'll be here.

695
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,704
Mom.

696
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,334
Can you do me a favor?

697
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,095
So I talked to Eric.

698
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:31,396
Need some help with this stuff?

699
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,440
Sure.

700
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:13,730
What's that boy doing in the yard?

701
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:19,778
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

702
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:30,265
Landon. Run along, son.

703
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:32,768
I'm not tired.

704
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:37,189
I need just a minute with her.

705
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:48,992
-I'll be back, okay?
-Okay.

706
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,810
Daddy...

707
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:18,355
...so serious.

708
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:34,413
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

709
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:37,875
...and you said you hated gravity...

710
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,503
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

711
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:48,427
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

712
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:54,016
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

713
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:56,852
Dad....

714
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:05,444
You know, when I lost your mother...

715
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:14,745
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

716
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:26,256
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

717
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,680
But then....

718
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:41,438
I love you so much.

719
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:11,552
I wanted to give you these.

720
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,721
The pictures from the play.

721
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:24,356
-I'm sorry about the flyers.
-It doesn't matter.

722
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:31,321
I guess you're with who you should be.

723
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:34,867
It's like she chose you.

724
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:39,496
Yeah, I don't even know why.

725
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:44,209
I do.

726
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:26,001
How you feeling?

727
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:29,796
-I'm okay. How are you?
-Pretty good.

728
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:33,008
-I have something for you.
-You do?

729
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:41,558
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

730
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:47,356
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

731
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:52,236
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

732
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:58,450
-Come on.
-Okay, let's check it out.

733
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:08,210
"What is a friend?

734
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:13,924
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

735
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,719
-Right here.
-Okay.

736
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:20,848
"Find out who you are...

737
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:23,934
...and do it on purpose."

738
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,895
That's Dolly Parton.

739
01:26:28,397 --> 01:26:31,066
I always thought she was smart.

740
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:46,957
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

741
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:51,420
Love is never boastful or conceited.

742
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:55,382
It is never rude or selfish.

743
01:26:55,591 --> 01:27:00,721
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

744
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:12,858
-You know what I figured out today?
-What?

745
01:27:16,778 --> 01:27:19,448
Maybe God...

746
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:24,995
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

747
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:31,043
Like, this journey never ends.

748
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:37,174
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

749
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,180
To help me through all this.

750
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,819
You're my angel.

751
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:15,879
What's going on?

752
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:20,968
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

753
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:25,055
-What does she mean?
-He's been trying to reach you.

754
01:28:25,264 --> 01:28:28,892
He's going to pay
for private home care.

755
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:00,340
Thank you.

756
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:22,321
Sorry.

757
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:27,284
It's all right, son.

758
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:08,867
-I gotta finish this tonight.
-Here, something hot.

759
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:14,248
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

760
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:17,084
-Yeah, they're in here.
-Good.

761
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:21,255
-What about side bearings?
-An old phonographic turntable.

762
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:25,175
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

763
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:30,472
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

764
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:32,850
It's beautiful.

765
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:35,936
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

766
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:17,728
There it is.

767
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:24,026
Come here. Come look.

768
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:29,031
Come here. Come look, quick.

769
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:40,542
That is cool.

770
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:51,887
Do you love me?

771
01:31:59,353 --> 01:32:04,107
-Will you do something for me then?
-Anything.

772
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,655
Will you marry me?

773
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:40,204
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

774
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:45,667
-I love you.
-"Love is never boastful nor conceited.

775
01:33:45,834 --> 01:33:48,378
It is never rude or selfish.

776
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:53,425
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

777
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:58,013
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

778
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:02,142
...but delights in the truth.

779
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:07,689
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

780
01:34:07,898 --> 01:34:10,484
...and to endure...

781
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,946
...whatever comes."

782
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:19,117
-I, Landon Rollins Carter...
-I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

783
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,703
...do solemnly swear...

784
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:25,999
-...to take Jamie Sullivan...
-...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

785
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:28,377
-...as my wife.
-...as my husband.

786
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:34,550
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

787
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,031
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

788
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:02,995
...with more love than lots of people
know in a lifetime.

789
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:07,708
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

790
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:32,858
It's been four years...

791
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:37,654
...but the vision of Jamie
walking towards me...

792
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:41,909
...will stay with me forever.

Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

794
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:56,465
-Have a seat, please.
-Thank you.

795
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:05,098
Landon.

796
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:11,814
-You look good.
-Thank you. You too.

797
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:14,191
I'm getting by.

798
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:30,290
-What's new, Landon?
-Well, I got into medical school.

799
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:32,626
Your mother told me that.

800
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:38,465
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

801
01:36:41,176 --> 01:36:43,178
Listen.

802
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:53,480
I want you to have this.

803
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:56,233
Oh, Landon.

804
01:37:02,281 --> 01:37:04,283
Oh, my.

805
01:37:07,202 --> 01:37:08,245
Thank you.

806
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:16,128
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

807
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:22,718
She did.

808
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:26,930
It was you.

809
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:38,901
Jamie saved my life.

810
01:37:39,568 --> 01:37:42,404
She taught me everything.

811
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:46,158
About life, hope...

812
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:49,077
...and the long journey ahead.

813
01:37:50,496 --> 01:37:52,915
I'll always miss her.

814
01:37:54,249 --> 01:37:58,462
But our love is like the wind.

815
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:02,674
I can't see it...

816
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:05,344
...but I can feel it.
