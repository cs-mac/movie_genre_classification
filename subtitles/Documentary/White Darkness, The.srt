1
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,000
My name is Ash,
and I am a slave.

2
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,879
- Aah !

3
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,599
Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 A.D.,

4
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,118
and I'm being
dragged to my death.

5
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,839
It wasn't always
like this.

6
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,598
I had
a real life once.

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,919
A job.

8
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,678
Ash to price check four.

9
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,158
Um, hardware, aisle 12.

10
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,238
Shop smart.
Shop S-mart.

11
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,918
I had a wonderful
girlfriend, Linda.

12
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,798
Together, we drove to
a small cabin in the mountains.

13
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,078
It seems an archaeologist
had come to this remote place...

14
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:18,958
to translate and study
his latest find,

15
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:22,157
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"

16
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,118
"The Book of the Dead."

17
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,638
Bound in human flesh
and inked in blood,

18
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:33,998
this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,

19
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:39,038
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.

20
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,037
It was never meant
for the world of the living.

21
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:47,157
The book awoke
something dark in the woods.

22
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:54,316
It took Linda.

23
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:57,237
- And then it came for me.

24
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,277
It got into my hand
and it went bad.

25
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:02,797
So I lopped it off
at the wrist.

26
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,316
But that didn't stop it.
It came back.

27
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:14,957
- Big time.

28
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,517
Ah !

29
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:21,116
Aah !

30
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:33,036
My God !

31
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,995
How do you stop it ?

32
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,395
- Surround the stranger !

33
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:36,995
All right,
you men, fall in !

34
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,595
All o' ya, keep a pace !

35
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:46,715
Where in the hell--

36
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,314
Stand fast, hellhound !

37
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:58,674
No, no.
Easy now, chief.

38
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:00,554
Uh, I don't know
how I got here,

39
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:04,873
- and, uh, uh, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

40
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:11,074
What a piece of armor this is !

41
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,633
- Wise man !
- Fall back ! Come on, all you men.

42
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:17,073
Back on your horses.
Come on !

43
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:21,313
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

44
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,714
He who's prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

45
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,594
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

46
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:28,313
What, that buffoon ?

47
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,753
Likely...

48
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,713
he's one
of Henry's men !

49
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:36,673
- Kneel, rapscallions !

50
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,432
I say
to the pit with him !

51
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:43,433
You shall soon
learn the horrors of the pit.

52
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,833
- To the pit !
- You miserable bast--

53
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:51,873
- Get him !
- Get off of me !

54
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:55,152
- Let me go !
- Chain him !

55
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,592
Ah, you're gonna have
a little bit of wee fun, mate.

56
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:05,313
To the castle !

57
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:09,312
Pick up your feet !
Stop draggin' your feet !

58
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:11,552
Come on !
Move along !

59
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,632
Come on, now.

60
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,552
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this !

61
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:26,352
You men got something
to look forward to...

62
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,912
when you get back to the castle.

63
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,832
Lord Arthur approaches !

64
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,792
Raise the portcullis !

65
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:40,872
Lord Arthur !
Lord Arthur approaches !

66
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:46,471
That's lovely, isn't it ?
Move it in.

67
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:50,272
Move it,
you worthless--

68
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,831
- Get on !

69
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,190
Move it up, boys.
God save the king !

70
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,030
God save the king.
We love him !

71
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,032
Arthur !
He's back !

72
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,702
Lord Arthur, where is my brother ?
Did he not ride with you ?

73
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,782
Aye,
and fought valiantly.

74
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,222
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

75
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,382
I'm sorry, Sheila.

76
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,182
Come on.

77
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:44,502
You cretin !
Ah, stop it, you bastard !

78
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,502
You barbarian !

79
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,422
- Oh, no ! Stop it ! Stop it !

80
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,703
Get outta here,
you little brat !

81
00:06:57,382 --> 00:07:01,262
Foul thing !
A pox on you, brute !

82
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,262
Thou art a murderer !
A black murderer !

83
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,102
My brother's death
shall be avenged !

84
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:28,741
Company, halt !

85
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:34,262
Get that yoke off 'im !

86
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,461
Kill them !

87
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,461
Put them into the pit !

88
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:50,060
You, sir,
are not one of my vassals.

89
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,381
Who are you ?

90
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,221
Who wants to know ?

91
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,301
I am Henry the Red,

92
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:01,661
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

93
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:05,621
Well, hello,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

94
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,540
I got news for you, pal. You ain't
leadin' but two things right now--

95
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,460
Jack and shit,
and Jack left town.

96
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:12,740
Shut your bleedin' hole !

97
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,260
Shut your bleedin' hole !

98
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,900
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur !

99
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,340
There is an evil
awakened in this land,

100
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,939
and while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

101
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,819
you, Henry the Red,
wage war on us !

102
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,859
Charlatan !
Aah !

103
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,659
It was you who first turned
your swords on us !

104
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,619
And this evil has befouled
my people as well !

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,499
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

106
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,540
that lies in the bowels of that pit.

107
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,380
Right, you're no better.

108
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,819
May God
have mercy upon your souls.

109
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,499
God's name !
What hell-spawned thing lurks there ?

110
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,739
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of 'hores !

111
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,979
No ! No !

112
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,899
No, no ! Aah !

113
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:56,497
Oh ! Heavenly God !

114
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,298
He's escaping !

115
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:04,018
- Hold to !
- Hold him !

116
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,936
- Who's next ?
- It's him. Aye, he trembles !

117
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,337
They don't look
so clever now, do they ?

118
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,696
He's frightened !
He's frightened white !

119
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,977
Whoa ! Whoa !

120
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,817
Wait a minute. Hold it.

121
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:52,216
W-Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

122
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,776
I never even saw
these assholes before.

123
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,856
- Get him in there !
- He trembles !

124
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,896
He's begging !

125
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,456
- What are you waitin' for ?
- Henry !

126
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:03,416
You gotta tell him
you don't know me.

127
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:07,656
We never met.
Tell him.

128
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:12,216
I do not think
he'll listen, lad.

129
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,495
Look.

130
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:18,256
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

131
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:30,415
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

132
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:34,055
Uh, wh-whoa.

133
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:36,494
- Aah !

134
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:27,494
How do you like the pit ?
Isn't the pit wonderful ?

135
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,094
- Hai-ya !

136
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,054
- Why, you--

137
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:48,693
Ha !

138
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,653
Spikes.

139
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,133
Hey ! He says, "Spikes."
Give him spikes !

140
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:11,212
Make way !
Strange one !

141
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:23,413
- Strange one !

142
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,572
Yaaah !

143
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:32,493
Yes !

144
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:47,772
Damn you.
Damn you !

145
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:12,770
You know,
your shoelace is untied.

146
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,329
All right.

147
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,129
Who wants some ?

148
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,649
Who's next, huh ?

149
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,649
How 'bout it ?

150
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,129
Who wants some, huh ?

151
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,050
Who wants
to have a little ?

152
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:47,008
You.
You want some more ?

153
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:50,367
Huh ?

154
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,968
You want a little ?

155
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,127
Do ya ? Do ya ?
Do ya want some more?

156
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:01,328
Huh ? Huh ?

157
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:17,568
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

158
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,607
Let 'em go !

159
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:47,405
- Halt !

160
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:50,725
Thank you, generous hosts !

161
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,204
Sword boy !

162
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:05,124
For that arrogance,
I shall see you dead.

163
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,844
Yeah.

164
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:19,723
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

165
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:22,004
See this ?

166
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:26,683
- This is my boom stick !

167
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:29,123
It's a 12-gauge,
double-barreled Remington.

168
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,124
S-mart's
top of the line.

169
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:34,124
You can find this in
the sporting goods department.

170
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:37,482
That's right. This sweet baby
was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

171
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,843
Retails for about $109.95.

172
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:45,562
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.

173
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,923
That's right, shop smart.

174
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,043
Shop S-mart.
You got that ?

175
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,963
- Yes, sir. Right.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,082
Now I swear,

177
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,242
the next one
of you primates...

178
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:02,962
even touches me--

179
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:33,442
Now, let's talk about
how I get back home.

180
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,038
I prithee to forgive me,
m'lord.

181
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,799
I believed thee
one of Henry's men.

182
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,839
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

183
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,319
Blow.

184
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,679
So what's the deal ?
Can you send me back or not ?

185
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,318
Only the Necronomicon
has the power.

186
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,558
An unholy book
which we also require.

187
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,199
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

188
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,038
Only you, The Promised One,
can quest for it.

189
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,358
I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit.

190
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,558
Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto, today, chop--

191
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:53,077
- You shall die !

192
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:02,598
You shall never obtain
the Necronomicon !

193
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,917
We shall feast
upon your souls !

194
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,597
Oh !

195
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:31,036
- It's a trick. Get an axe.

196
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:38,917
- Guards, stop it !

197
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,477
- Catch the witch !
- Death to the witch !

198
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:43,517
Have some porridge !

199
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,756
Ah, my eyes ! I'm blind !
Oh, God, I'm blind !

200
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:50,636
No, don't !

201
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,677
Yo, she-bitch.

202
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:00,516
- Let's go.

203
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,236
Ya-hoo !

204
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:04,517
Hee-ya !

205
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:07,995
- Hee-ya !

206
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,316
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites,

207
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,075
all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

208
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:29,835
Now will thou
quest for the book ?

209
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:45,236
That one.

210
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,875
Hee-ya !

211
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:12,355
Groovy.

212
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:26,314
What's the matter ?
You raised in a barn ? Shut the door.

213
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:31,514
Probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives.

214
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:42,834
The wise men say that
thou art The Promised One.

215
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:48,234
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us,

216
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,593
and that thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

217
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:55,914
The only reason I'm going
to get the book is to get home.

218
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:02,273
I believe that thou wilt be
leaving in the morning.

219
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,433
Don't touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect...

220
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,434
wouldn't understand
alloys and compositions...

221
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:11,272
and things with
molecular structures in the--

222
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,793
What are you
doin' here anyway ?

223
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,393
I wanted to say
that all of my--

224
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,833
all of my hopes and
prayers go with you,

225
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,753
and I made this
for thee.

226
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:26,232
Good, I could use
a horse blanket.

227
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:50,031
Gimme some sugar, baby.

228
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:55,138
Hyah ! Come on, boy !

229
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:58,738
Hyah !

230
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:07,737
Hyah !

231
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,978
- Steady now. Whoa.

232
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:23,018
What ? What is it ?

233
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:25,698
This path will lead you
to an unholy place.

234
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:30,977
A cemetery. There,
the Necronomicon awaits.

235
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:36,777
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words,

236
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:39,657
"Klaatu barada nikto."

237
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:43,298
Klaatu barada nikto.
Okay.

238
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:45,416
Well, repeat them.

239
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:48,736
- Klaatu barada nikto.
- Again !

240
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:52,137
I got it, I got it !
I know your damn words, all right ?

241
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:54,736
Now you get this straight,
the both of you.

242
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:57,697
If I get that book,
you send me back.

243
00:25:57,897 --> 00:26:00,097
After that,
I'm history. Hyah !

244
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:00,955
What is it, boy ?

245
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:16,395
Hyah ! Come on !

246
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:26,554
Hyah ! Come on !

247
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:34,154
Aah ! Come on !

248
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:37,354
Come on, you !

249
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:03,447
Hey, let's scare
this guy good ! Come on.

250
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:06,806
Ramming speed !

251
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:14,367
Ooh !

252
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,247
Ready, aim, fire !

253
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:20,007
- Ooh !
- Get away !

254
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,047
Whoa !

255
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,127
- Oh, God ! Oh, no !
- Oh--

256
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:41,792
- Oh !
- You lousy little--

257
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:43,992
Oh, no !

258
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:45,712
Ooh, no ! Oh, my !

259
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:48,113
Uh, ooh, aah !

260
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:51,871
- Lift up !
- Oh, ooh-hoo-ha !

261
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:55,951
- Ooh, aah !

262
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:01,191
Aah-ha-ha !

263
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:10,031
Heh heh heh-heh--
Whoa !

264
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,909
## London Bridge
is falling down #

265
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:35,869
# Falling down #

266
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,749
# Falling down #

267
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,549
- # My fair lady ## Ha !

268
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:51,708
Ooh !

269
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,348
Is he up ?
How is he ?

270
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:57,948
Hey,
he's gettin' up.

271
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,548
Hmm,
what a horrible nightmare.

272
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:10,868
Wait a minute.
Oh, God !

273
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:12,869
I can't move !

274
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:18,468
Aah !

275
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,707
- And go !
- Open wide.

276
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:33,782
Geronimo !

277
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:35,902
- Hooray !
- Hooray !

278
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,784
- Ah !

279
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:03,063
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate, huh ?

280
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,983
How'd you like
the taste of that, huh ?

281
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,022
How'd you like the ta--

282
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:24,223
Aah, uh, ugh, oh !

283
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,982
Ah ! Oh !

284
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:31,982
Let me out !

285
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:37,622
Oh, dear God,
it's growing bigger !

286
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:14,444
Ooh, ooh, I'm blind.
I'm blind. Bleh.

287
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:21,124
Yip, yip, yah !

288
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:26,564
Oh, hey ! Where are you takin' me ?
Uh, oh, ooh !

289
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:46,751
What are you ?

290
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:49,151
Are you me ?

291
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:03,180
I'm bad Ash,
and you're good Ash.

292
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,139
You're goody
little two-shoes.

293
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:09,180
## You're goody little two-shoes
goody little two-shoes #

294
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,860
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

295
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:16,540
# Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes
Little goody two-shoes #

296
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:20,100
- Ow !

297
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,540
# Little goody two-shoes ##

298
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,819
Aah !

299
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,019
Good, bad.
I'm the guy with the gun.

300
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:56,123
That'll teach you.
Yeah, that'll teach you.

301
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:59,204
You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon !

302
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,363
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it !

303
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:07,003
- What's that you got on your face ?
- Huh ?

304
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:10,762
I'll come back for you !

305
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:20,442
- Hyah !

306
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:23,962
Come on, boy !

307
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:34,523
Hyah !

308
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,896
Three books ?

309
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,896
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

310
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:13,416
Nobody said anything
about three books.

311
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:15,336
L-Like what
am I supposed to do ?

312
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:31,406
Take one book,
or all books, or, or what ?

313
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,966
Well.

314
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,119
Whoa. Wrong book.

315
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:16,911
Ow !

316
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,950
Aah ! Ooh !

317
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,710
Ooh ! Ooh, you !

318
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:39,470
I'll get back to you.

319
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:40,630
Well...

320
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:41,870
Well...

321
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:45,350
seems fairly obvious.

322
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:53,229
Ooh, wait a minute. The words.
All right, all right, all right.

323
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,710
Say the words.

324
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,870
Klaatu... barada...

325
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,469
Iu--

326
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,550
necktie.

327
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,670
Nectar, n-- nickel.

328
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,350
Noodle.
It's an "N" word.

329
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,469
It's definitely
an "N" word.

330
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:25,869
It's definitely
an "N" word.

331
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,229
Klaatu barada n--

332
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:58,308
Okay, then.
That's it.

333
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,988
Hey. Wait a minute.

334
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:14,148
Everything's cool.
I said the words. I did !

335
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:19,748
- Oh ! Oh ! No, wait ! Oh !

336
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:35,022
You people, seek cover !
To the parapet !

337
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:37,061
Seek your children !

338
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:40,582
- Steady the horses !

339
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,222
Something's wrong.
Something's amiss.

340
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:18,661
Where'd you go ?
Where'd you g--

341
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:43,260
Oh, oh, aah !

342
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:47,260
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

343
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,259
Ow ! I'll crush ya !
I'll mash ya into paste, you bony cre--

344
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:17,738
- Hyah !

345
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,327
I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.

346
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:37,008
Now I want back,
like in the deal. Hyah !

347
00:47:48,758 --> 00:47:51,997
I... live...

348
00:47:53,778 --> 00:47:55,680
again.

349
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,163
There ! The Promised One !
The Promised One's returned !

350
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:13,900
Raise the portcullis !

351
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:20,944
Welcome home !
We're saved !

352
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:26,154
- The Necronomicon !
- Truly he is The Promised One !

353
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,840
- He's brought the Necronomicon !
- How are ya ?

354
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,029
- He's brought the book !
- Yeah, great, great.

355
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:34,127
- Good boy !
- Get the fuck outta my face !

356
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:45,580
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon ?

357
00:48:45,707 --> 00:48:49,693
- Yeah, it's, it's just that--
- Just what ?

358
00:48:49,735 --> 00:48:53,469
Nothin'.
Here.

359
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:01,441
Now send me back.
Like in the deal.

360
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:06,519
When you removed the Necronomicon from
the cradle, did you speak the words ?

361
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:09,414
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words ?

362
00:49:09,623 --> 00:49:12,224
Look, maybe I didn't say every
single, little tiny syllable,

363
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:15,371
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
- Dung-eating fool !

364
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:19,231
Thou hast doomed us all !
When thou misspoke the words,

365
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:21,371
the army
of the dead awoke !

366
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,804
Now, whoa, whoa,
right there, spinach chin.

367
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:27,119
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

368
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:30,812
You said there was a passage that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.

369
00:49:31,021 --> 00:49:33,412
It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back,

370
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:35,427
but to us
it is useless !

371
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:38,113
The evil has a terrible hunger
for the Necronomicon,

372
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:41,133
and it will come here
to get it.

373
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:43,902
We had a deal.

374
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:46,839
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for ya.

375
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,021
I did my part,
now you send me back.

376
00:49:49,232 --> 00:49:51,791
Very well.
As we are men of our word,

377
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,860
we shall honor
our bargain.

378
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:59,972
The wise men shall return you
to your own time.

379
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:01,945
Yeah ?

380
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:04,336
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.

381
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,434
'Cause that
was the deal.

382
00:50:06,644 --> 00:50:08,993
So when do you think
we can...

383
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:12,014
start with all
the thing and the--

384
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:14,071
He's nothin'
but a traitor, he is !

385
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,084
When do you
think we can start...

386
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:19,733
with all the, uh,
ceremony and, uh--

387
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:23,708
Agh ! Wretched excuse
for a man !

388
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:28,701
The wise men were fools
to trust in you.

389
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:30,715
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

390
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:33,611
We put our trust in him.

391
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,590
I still believe
that thou wilt help us.

392
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:42,254
Oh, Sheila,
don't you get it ? It's over.

393
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:46,240
I didn't have
what it took.

394
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:50,100
So long.

395
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:54,127
But what of the things
that we've shared ?

396
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:04,449
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private ?

397
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,134
Aw, well--

398
00:51:07,345 --> 00:51:11,372
Well, that's just what we call
"pillow talk," baby. That's all.

399
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:15,022
It was more than that.

400
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,876
I still have faith
in thee.

401
00:51:18,086 --> 00:51:23,204
I still believe that thou
wilt stay and save us. I--

402
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:30,756
Coward !

403
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:33,694
- Look there ! A demon !

404
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,330
Ash ! Help me !

405
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,058
Sheila !

406
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,275
Yaaah !

407
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:11,457
- Shoot the bloody thing !
- Hold your arms ! You'll hit the girl !

408
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:18,594
Uh, me sword !

409
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,407
Yaaah !

410
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:23,210
Damn you !

411
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:45,585
Dig, damn you !
Dig faster !

412
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,739
I shall command every
worm-infested son-of-a-bitch...

413
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:50,704
- that ever died in battle !
- Thank you, sir !

414
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,917
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.

415
00:52:53,122 --> 00:52:55,498
We shall storm their castle
and get my book !

416
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:59,879
Hoist,
you damnable varlets !

417
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:06,146
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

418
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,872
Now pick up a shovel
and get digging !

419
00:53:10,078 --> 00:53:15,074
- Bring on the wench !

420
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:29,982
- Gimme some sugar, baby.

421
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,481
Well.

422
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:36,985
Now, ain't you
a sweet little thing ?

423
00:53:37,191 --> 00:53:39,565
Don't touch me,
you foul thing !

424
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:48,614
Come on.

425
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:52,464
That's it.

426
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,542
We got plans for you, girly-girl.
Move !

427
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:09,843
Have you lost your bones,
you decomposed gobs ? Get thee hence !

428
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:22,088
A scout approaches !

429
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:29,953
- Whoa !
- Hey, get his horse.

430
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:31,919
Arise.

431
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:33,925
My lord, an army of the dead
gather in the wilderness.

432
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:36,341
- They approach the castle.
- How far from here?

433
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:37,857
But two days' ride.

434
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:39,905
These winged ones
are only the first of them.

435
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,913
Perhaps we should leave
as soon as possible.

436
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:43,877
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.

437
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:46,417
- We must flee !
- It is written. It has been foretold.

438
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:48,751
- They'll take our souls.
They'll swallow our souls.
- I'm afraid !

439
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:52,028
- I don't want to die !

440
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:56,493
That's it.
Go ahead and run.

441
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:59,441
Run home
and cry to mama !

442
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:04,847
Me ?
I'm through runnin' !

443
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:08,615
I say we stay here
and fight it out.

444
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:13,162
Are all men from
the future loudmouthed braggarts ?

445
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:18,118
Nope. Just me, baby.
Just me.

446
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:22,582
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls ?

447
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:25,407
How will you fight that ?
More words ?

448
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,373
Most of our people
have already fled.

449
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:30,117
We are but 60 men.

450
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:35,155
Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.

451
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:42,118
Now... who's with me ?

452
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:57,460
I'll stand by ya.

453
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,122
You can count on my steel.

454
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:02,129
I'll offer up my courage.

455
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:05,815
- Me sword's by his side.
- I'm with you !

456
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,436
- I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.
- And mine !

457
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:12,818
We'll stay !

458
00:56:13,024 --> 00:56:15,973
Hail ! Hail !
Hail ! Hail !

459
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:22,852
Hail ! Hail ! Hail !

460
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,191
Well, my dear,

461
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:36,409
say hello to the boys.

462
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:44,765
- There's a sight for sore bones.

463
00:56:47,428 --> 00:56:49,761
I may be bad,

464
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:53,202
but I feel... good.

465
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:55,987
- Who rules ?
- To you, my lord.

466
00:56:56,191 --> 00:56:57,993
You, sir. To the castle.

467
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:01,639
The castle !

468
00:57:02,376 --> 00:57:04,219
Hurry up now.

469
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:06,758
The castle ! Let's push.

470
00:57:06,964 --> 00:57:11,263
Heave-ho.
Good. Yeah.

471
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,118
Ha ! Hoo !

472
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,083
Hai-ya !

473
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,442
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

474
00:58:15,648 --> 00:58:19,005
Yeah !

475
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:10,526
They're coming !
The Deadites approach !

476
00:59:43,395 --> 00:59:46,875
There's so damn
many of 'em.

477
00:59:48,432 --> 00:59:50,356
-

478
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:55,477
-

479
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,431
-

480
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,053
-

481
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:43,463
Battle stations ! All right, get those
rocks up, mister, on the double !

482
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:49,811
Ready the catapults !
By God, let's give 'em what for.

483
01:00:57,143 --> 01:00:58,904
And halt !

484
01:00:59,108 --> 01:01:04,065
- Company, halt !
- Company, halt !

485
01:01:09,717 --> 01:01:12,461
I'll rip his balls off.

486
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:48,748
-

487
01:01:49,035 --> 01:01:50,959
-

488
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:35,105
My lord, we are positioned
on both fronts.

489
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:38,587
Fine, fine, fine.
Where are they keeping my book ?

490
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,535
There, my lord,
beyond the wall.

491
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:44,895
The parapet. That would be
the most likely place.

492
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:57,073
Right. Bring me forth
into that castle !

493
01:02:57,277 --> 01:03:00,021
- Forward !
- Forward !

494
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:04,936
Cry havoc and let loose
the dogs of war !

495
01:03:05,141 --> 01:03:07,680
To the castle !

496
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:11,283
Fly, mate ! Fly !

497
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:15,707
Death to the mortals !

498
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:19,959
Arrows.

499
01:03:38,386 --> 01:03:41,948
Torch boy !

500
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:17,991
Steady.

501
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:26,796
Fire !

502
01:04:27,862 --> 01:04:32,858
- Advance, you beasts, advance !

503
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:44,039
Oh ! Oh !

504
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:49,569
Yeah, baby !

505
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:06,448
- All right !

506
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:30,012
Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.

507
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:34,599
Ram the gate !

508
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:38,736
Catapults.

509
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,029
Catapults out !

510
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:51,350
Yeah !

511
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:05,955
Fire !

512
01:06:09,477 --> 01:06:12,220
Look there !

513
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:18,938
Yeah !

514
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:22,419
- Seek cover !
- Watch out !

515
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:26,104
- Make way !

516
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:36,590
Oh !

517
01:06:36,795 --> 01:06:39,374
Oh, you miserable
bags of bones !

518
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:42,365
Pick yourselves up
and sally fo...

519
01:06:44,536 --> 01:06:46,460
Sally for--

520
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:50,065
Sally forth.

521
01:06:52,277 --> 01:06:54,733
Come on,
you miserable wretches.

522
01:06:54,939 --> 01:06:57,396
Lower.

523
01:06:57,601 --> 01:07:01,697
Heave !

524
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:08,864
Forward !

525
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:13,246
Buttress the door, now !

526
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:26,066
Hold fast !

527
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:30,489
- Back !
- Stone these creatures !

528
01:07:30,694 --> 01:07:34,380
Damn you !

529
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,247
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

530
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:39,828
Go, you creatures !
Arrows !

531
01:07:40,032 --> 01:07:43,390
Load !
Fire !

532
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:49,206
- Heave ! Put your...

533
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:52,483
backbones into it.

534
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:24,629
We've broken through !
The castle is ours !

535
01:08:29,954 --> 01:08:34,459
Kill the mortals !

536
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:40,110
- Get it achieved and fast !

537
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:57,311
Their ranks are broken !
Have at them !

538
01:08:57,599 --> 01:09:02,514
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !
Ha ! Hoo ! Hai-ya !

539
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:25,050
Pull back !
Man the parapet !

540
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:27,015
Protect the book.

541
01:09:27,221 --> 01:09:30,906
God save us all.

542
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:46,885
Say hello
to the 21st century. Yeah !

543
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:02,612
Come on !
I got plenty for everybody !

544
01:10:02,818 --> 01:10:04,906
Look out !

545
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:07,854
- Whoo !

546
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:14,408
- Bye-bye.

547
01:10:14,982 --> 01:10:18,586
It's the one in the cart we want !
Get him !

548
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:23,131
- Yaaah !

549
01:10:28,785 --> 01:10:30,505
Yaaaaah !

550
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:54,915
Sheila ?

551
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:39,668
- We've secured the courtyard, my lord.

552
01:11:39,874 --> 01:11:43,231
Excellent.

553
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:57,772
Ooh ! Hey ! Look out !

554
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,938
- Hey, you're mine, sweetie.

555
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:37,501
Get off of her !

556
01:12:40,124 --> 01:12:41,884
Gotcha !

557
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:45,407
Damn you !

558
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:54,708
- My lord.
- Stay with the book.

559
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:59,090
The book's where we are.

560
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:17,217
Oops !

561
01:13:17,422 --> 01:13:18,721
Hello !

562
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:31,370
The book is mine.

563
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:44,995
I'll cut your gizzard out.

564
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,599
- Hey, where'd he go ?

565
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:58,395
Come to papa.

566
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,040
Get him !

567
01:14:30,163 --> 01:14:32,030
Oh, you crazy bitch,
get off of me !

568
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:40,388
Ha !

569
01:14:43,052 --> 01:14:46,410
Right.

570
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:53,699
You found me beautiful once.

571
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:57,059
Honey, you got real ugly.

572
01:15:13,728 --> 01:15:17,085
There we are.

573
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,097
So you wanna
play rough, eh ?

574
01:15:26,303 --> 01:15:30,274
Okay.

575
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:35,598
Oh.

576
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:40,513
All right, all right.

577
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:45,550
Prepare to die !

578
01:16:02,856 --> 01:16:05,394
You're going down !

579
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,450
- I'm goin' up.
- I'm comin' for ya.

580
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:29,712
Come on !

581
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,433
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Come on.

582
01:16:43,637 --> 01:16:46,504
All right !

583
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:51,788
You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch !

584
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:12,879
I'll spoil
those good looks.

585
01:17:12,922 --> 01:17:16,647
Back-stabber !

586
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:29,096
Hold still !

587
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:41,341
Tallyho !

588
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:51,092
- We can't hold the battlements!

589
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:54,164
We will hold !
We must protect the book !

590
01:18:21,755 --> 01:18:23,557
I got a bone
to pick with you.

591
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:27,693
Come on.

592
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:35,762
Slice that gizzard open.

593
01:18:50,424 --> 01:18:54,191
Now you're mine.

594
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:58,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:45,939
At last, the book.

596
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:51,838
I possess the Necronomicon.

597
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:55,483
I've crushed your pathetic army.
Now I'll have my vengeance.

598
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:39,530
Buckle up, bonehead,
'cause you're goin' for a ride.

599
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:43,379
Huh ?

600
01:20:54,191 --> 01:20:58,820
Victory's ours !

601
01:20:57,434 --> 01:21:02,840
- Retreat ! Retreat !
- Let's get the hell out of here !

602
01:21:19,537 --> 01:21:21,298
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.

603
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:23,674
If it's a fight you want--

604
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:28,712
Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrust worthy lot.

605
01:22:17,028 --> 01:22:18,829
Move yourself, lad !

606
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:20,999
- Your hand, man. Godspeed !
- Hey, Henry. Yeah, nice goin'.

607
01:22:21,205 --> 01:22:22,965
- My lady.
- Arthur.

608
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:26,201
- Well won, my friend.
- We've won the day.

609
01:22:26,406 --> 01:22:29,887
- Yeah !
- Yeah !

610
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,406
We're brothers
and a new kingdom shall be born !

611
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,870
The book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep for a century

612
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:47,129
swallow six drops

613
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:51,552
though will awake in your own time.

614
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:29,889
Hyah !

615
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:34,745
Six drops.

616
01:26:50,387 --> 01:26:52,844
I slept too long.
