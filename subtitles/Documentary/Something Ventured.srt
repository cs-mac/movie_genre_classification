1
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:19,503
I was in my laboratory...

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,840
probably talking to students.

3
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,681
Here's a call, comes out of the blue.

4
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:29,749
This young guy...

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,750
wanted to know ifthe technology
was ready to be commercialized.

6
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,090
Then he said the magic word.
He says'

7
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,091
"I have access to some money
that would allow us to get started."

8
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,295
And I said, "Okay."

9
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:48,532
I said,
"Where does the money originate?"
And he said,

10
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:52,536
"I'm a junior member
at a venture capital firm."

11
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,779
I went to look up what
"venture capital" meant.

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,548
I had never heard ofit before.

13
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,622
The risks were just enormous.

14
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:11,390
They came to me
with no business plan.

15
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:13,793
Willing to risk everything
You have to be a street fighter.

16
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:16,128
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
We didn't know what
we were doing.

17
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,997
Silicon Valley.
Technical breakthrough.

18
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:19,298
$100000.
A million dollars.

19
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,866
$10billion.
Intel.

20
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,168
Apple.
Genentech.

21
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,235
Cisco.
Good markets.

22
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:24,637
Create companies.
Growing companies.

23
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:27,638
The sky's the limit.
The rest is history.

24
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:31,675
I don't know to write a business plan.
I can only tell you how weread them.

25
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,680
And we start at the back.

26
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,681
And ifthe numbers are big,
we look at the front to see
what kind ofbusiness it is.

27
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:46,356
You have to look at the way
conventional wisdom works
and abandon it.

28
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,698
No one
has ever accused me
ofunderestimating...

29
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,001
myself.

30
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,375
Jobs and Wozniak came up to see me.

31
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:09,713
Steve Jobs is a national treasure.

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,050
He is so visionary and so bright.

33
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:17,154
Uh, I had to fire him though.

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,830
These men didn't always wield
such influence and power.

35
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,335
In the beginning, they barely
knew what they were doing.

36
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,172
Fifty years ago, they were just
young guys from modest means...

37
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:39,243
who thought they could
help build innovative companies.

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,681
This is the story ofa handful ofmen...

39
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,682
who stirred up a revolution
in finance and technology,

40
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:49,353
because they saw opportunity
where others only saw risk.

41
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,882
Venture capital.

42
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:19,883
I don't think I thought ofit first.

43
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,090
But I don't know
anyone...

44
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,091
who used the term before I did.

45
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,835
Back in the spring of1957,

46
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:39,836
Arthur Rock was just
a junior banker on Wall Street.

47
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:43,507
But then one day, an unsolicited letter
arrived at the office.

48
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,145
The letter was unusual,
and no one else at his brokerage firm
knew what to do with it.

49
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,184
It was a cry for help.

50
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,185
And it would forever change
the trajectory ofArthur Rock's life.

51
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:59,592
You gotta be lucky.

52
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:02,593
Everybody's gonna be lucky
at some time or another.

53
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:05,596
Thing I'd say is,
I was lucky to be lucky early.

54
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,869
The letter on Arthur Rock's desk...

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,839
had come from eight engineers
in California.

56
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:17,476
A group ofbrilliant young men...

57
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:20,477
who would soon become known
as "the Traitorous Eight."

58
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:25,784
We were young guys.

59
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:28,785
A bunch ofyoung engineers
and scientists mostly...

60
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,291
working together
at Shockley Semiconductor.

61
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,496
They were having a hard time with
Shockley, and they were gonna leave.

62
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,501
Things had deteriorated
at Shockley Lab.

63
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:48,005
He was a very difficult person
to work with.

64
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:51,408
And a group ofus started considering
the possibility at least ofleaving.

65
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,015
So anyhow, we did write-

66
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:59,016
"'This prospectus is to introduce
a group ofsenior scientists
and engineers...

67
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:05,422
who have been working
together at the Shockley
Semiconductor Laboratory."

68
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,262
Shockley had just won a Nobel Prize.

69
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,263
It was probably a little presumptuous
ofus to think we could push him aside.

70
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,668
"A group feeling arose
to the effect...

71
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:20,739
that rather than leave one by one,

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,740
we believe that we are much more
valuable to an employer as a group."

73
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,651
These were, by their résumés,
very superior people,

74
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,724
and I thought, "Gee, maybe
there's something here."

75
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:41,725
Something more valuable
than just to be an employee.

76
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,065
That "something" that Arthur saw...

77
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:49,066
inspired him to step out ofhis
ordinary role as a Wall Street banker.

78
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:54,237
And that's when we met
Arthur Rock.

79
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,008
Arthur came out to meet
with the group ofus.

80
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:01,812
And Arthur said, "You ought to
start your own company,
and we'll find financing for you."

81
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:07,486
They hadn't thought
ofthis idea themselves.

82
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,487
Nobody thought ofstarting
their own company in those days.

83
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:12,658
It was a new idea,
but it was a good one.

84
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,659
At that time, there was
no venture capital,

85
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,030
so starting companies was new.

86
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,032
It was innovative.

87
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,033
Arthur Rock had to
get creative about finding capital
for the Traitorous Eight.

88
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:27,804
His bank had contacts with
rich families like the Rockefellers
and the Whitneys,

89
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,509
but they weren't interested
in backing a start-up
all the way out in California.

90
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,981
So we, uh, made a list
ofcompanies.

91
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,888
In fact we sat down with
the Wall Street Journal-

92
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,889
Looking for companies to ask
to invest in these eight fellas
in forming a new company.

93
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,630
I think we had 35 companies.

94
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,167
All of them said no. "No!"

95
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:06,078
The attempt
to start a new company...

96
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,713
might have ended
then and there,

97
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:10,182
with the Traitorous Eight
returning to their job search...

98
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:13,118
and Arthur Rock admitting defeat.

99
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:16,119
But then Arthur received
one last lead.

100
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:19,856
We were pretty much at wits, end.

101
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:23,126
And somebody suggested
that I see Sherman Fairchild.

102
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,565
Sherman Fairchild was
an entrepreneur himself...

103
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:31,935
and also a very wealthy man.

104
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:35,572
He right away saw the possibilities,

105
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:39,476
and decided that Fairchild
Camera and Instrument...

106
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,580
would invest the million and a half
dollars we were looking for.

107
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,351
I call myself
"the accidental entrepreneur."

108
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,158
With the 1.5 million Arthur raised,

109
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,159
the Traitorous Eight started
Fairchild Semiconductor
in Mountain View, California,

110
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:01,097
a sleepy rural town
35 miles south ofSan Francisco.

111
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:07,437
Fairchild was the first company
to manufacture...

112
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:10,474
the sophisticated silicon chips
that would power computers,

113
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,877
rockets and spacecraft,

114
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:17,113
paving the way
for the high-tech age.

115
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:21,987
In time, the fruit orchards
surrounding Fairchild...

116
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,790
would give way
to electronics companies,

117
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,791
and the area would become famous
as the Silicon Valley.

118
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:33,163
Ifthey hadn't
stayed together and formed
Fairchild Semiconductor,

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
probably there'd be
no silicon in Silicon Valley.

120

121
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,445
Arthur Rock
had gotten a taste ofsomething
exciting and significant.

122
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,583
But as it tu ns out,
he wasn't the only one...

123
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:54,584
trying to figgure out
how to fund young companies.

124
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,556
Just up the road from Fairchild,
a handful ofbusinessmen...

125
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,557
were experimenting with their own
version ofventure capital...

126
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,060
together, around a lunch table
in San Francisco.

130
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,440
In the '50s and '60s,

131
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,410
there were a group ofus
in San Francisco
that used to get interested...

132
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,411
in small, high-tech companies
down the peninsula.

133
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:24,683
There were, I think, five ofus
in our group.

134
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:27,684
We all had jobs, but we had
other time on our hands too,

135
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:31,888
and we decided we just would put
a little investment club together.

136
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,293
We were just a bunch of
young men in San Francisco...

137
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,194
who knew each other
and respected each other.

138
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:39,195
What it was like was
a very close fraternity.

139
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,800
I guess I can use
that word carefully.

140
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,636
We'd have a table
ofsix or eight for lunch.

141
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,637
None ofus had enough money
to do an investment by ourselves,
so we had to have help.

142
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:53,946
Ifone ofus ran across
an entrepreneur...

143
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:56,947
who was trying to start a company,
we would invite him up for lunch.

144
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,050
And after lunch, we would
ask him to step out onto
the street corner for a while.

145
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,990
Give us 10 minutes,
and we would make up our mind
as to whether we wanted...

146
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,492
to invest in his company or not.

147
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,027
I don't remember that.

148
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,596
We didn't do that.

149
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,331
We were too classy to do that.

150
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,132
That's a little bit quick, I think.

151
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:17,133
Ifthe guy's a real nut'
why, you'd say good-bye to him...

152
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:20,337
without asking him
to go get a cup ofcoffee.

153
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:24,276
Two members of the group
wanted to do even more...

154
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:27,277
than gather around
a lunch table every six weeks.

155
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,580
In 1962,
Pitch Johnson and Bill Draper...

156
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,952
put up all their personal savings,
quit their day jobs...

157
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:36,953
to form a partnership,
and hit the streets.

158
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,023
Pitch and I each got a Pontiac leased,

159
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:43,193
and went around
and knocked on doors.

160
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:47,063
And ifit sounded
like ABC Electronics,

161
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,635
then we'd go in, ask the president
to sit down and tell us,
"What do you do?"

162
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,905
You know.
"Well, what do you do?"

163
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,841
"Well, venture capital."
"What's that?"

164
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,843
My kids would go to school.
"What does your dad do?"

165
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:00,512
"My dad's a policeman."
"My dad's a fireman."
"My dad's a banker."

166
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:03,513
"And what does your dad do?"
"Oh, he's a venture capitalist."

167
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:07,183
"Dad, what do you do actually?"
You know?

168
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,221
We were just stumbling around,
trying to figure out what to do.

169
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:14,658
But we just knew that ifwe got
involved with good people
and good markets,

170
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,162
we could probably
build a company.

171
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,597
Growing companies.

172
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:21,266
Create companies.

173
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,267
You're helping to create something
where nothing existed before.

174
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:28,571
And quite a large community
gets sustenance...

175
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:32,175
that wouldn't have existed
unless you had gotten together
with this entrepreneur...

176
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,413
and his team
and helped him along the way.

177
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,121
The Lunch Group had established
a good formula.

178
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:46,122
Everyone was sharing
in the profits and success
at these fledgling companies.

179
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:51,695
But over at Fairchild
it was a different story.

180
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,632
Fairchild was an imperfect vehicle.

181
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:02,105
I joined Fairchild
at the end of the '50s.

182
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,810
I was not part of the Traitorous Eight.

183
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:12,415
Fairchild was owned
by a corporation.

184
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:16,421
An eastern corporation,

185
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:19,422
and the sense of
division ofequity...

186
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,592
was both unknown to them
and repugnant to them.

187
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,731
All of the East Coast companies
had this hierarchy.

188
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:32,170
And they didn't understand...

189
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,171
about giving options
to all the employees...

190
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:39,576
the way West Coast start-ups
saw fit to do.

191
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,180
So none of the people
in Fairchild, including me,

192
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:49,452
had any kind ofsignificant
ownership position.

193
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:55,427
So, in the early '60s,

194
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:58,428
people began leaving Fairchild
to set up start-ups...

195
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:02,599
and to begin to participate
in what people correctly realized...

196
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:07,103
was going to be
something special.

197
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:15,411
Meanwhile,
back at his desk in New York-

198
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:18,715
Well, I had wanted to do more
of these venture capital type deals,

199
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:23,822
but the money was all in the east.

200
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,823
And the scientists who had moved
from the east to the west...

201
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,594
had all the ideas.

202
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,595
So I saw a great opportunity
in bringing the East Coast money out...

203
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:37,801
backing these people
on the West Coast.

204
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:40,272
"Go West, young man."

205
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:43,273
In 1961,
Arthur Rock raised five million dollars
from East Coast investors...

206
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:49,445
and moved to San Francisco
to start his own
venture capital firm.

207
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,684
He found a partner in Tommy Davis,

208
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,685
who had been managing investments
for a California oil company.

209
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:01,257
Davis and Rock quickly became
the biggest venture players in town,

210
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:05,762
funding a series ofhugely
successful technology companies.

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
And in the close-knit
Silicon Valley community
of the 1960s,

212
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,839
it was only a matter oftime
before Arthur Rock...

213
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,840
would once again cross paths
with the Traitorous Eight.

214
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:29,152
Throughout the 1960s,
Fairchild was bleeding talent.

215
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:32,791
The lure ofstock options
and independence...

216
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,393
inspired many of
the brilliant young engineers...

217
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:38,394
to peel off
and start their own companies.

218
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,931
But Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce,
its two most important founders,

219
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,803
remained loyal to their company-

220
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,105
until May of1968,

221
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:50,106
when Fairchild's East Coast
management made a fatal mistake.

222
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,311
Noyce was the logical internal
candidate to be the next C.E.O.

223
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:00,984
But they decided they were gonna
look on the outside.

224
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:04,687
That changed the whole ball game.

225
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:08,258
Noyce said, "I'm gonna leave.
Are you interested?"

226
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
So I said, "Okay. Let's do it."

227
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,574
They needed financing,
and they called me...

228
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:25,575
to see whether I'd be interested.

229
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,812
They came to me
with no business plan,

230
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,813
other than what they verbally
said they wanted to do.

231
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:34,951
Arthur said he needed something
to talk to potential investors with.

232
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:38,821
Just to give people something.

233
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,961
We wrote a business plan,
and it was one page-

234
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,896
Double-spaced,
and that was it.

235
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
It just says we were going
to make things out ofsilicon,

236
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:53,836
and some interesting
electronic devices.

237
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Oh, I said in general terms
we were going to make memories.

238
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,610
It has lots oftypos in it.
I think Bob typed it himself.

239
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:06,482
It's not a very profound document,
but it's really kind ofcute.

240
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:13,892
I said, "How much money
do you need?"

241
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:16,628
And they said,
"Two and a halfmillion dollars."

242
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:19,629
And I said, "Okay."

243
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,567
"What percentage
of the company do you think
you'd be happy giving up...

244
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,568
for two and a half
million dollars?"

245
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,639
And they thought and said,
"Well, how about half?"

246
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,209
And I said, "That's fine."

247
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,214
And within a day and a half,

248
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:39,215
I had raised two and a half
million dollars.

249
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,459
Intel opened its doors in July of'68,

250
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:52,795
and Arthur Rock's partnership
with its founders
was only just beginning.

251
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,166
Arthur was our chairman
of the board in those days.

252
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:00,937
I spent a lot oftime there.

253
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:05,174
Venture capitalists
do write the check,

254
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,413
but that isn't all we do.

255
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:11,414
Writing a check is easy.

256
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:14,851
Yeah, it doesn't take much ink.

257
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:21,126
I attended staffmeetings.

258
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,861
Arthur asked good questions.

259
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,896
I was on the phone to them a lot.

260
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:26,965
Was an excellent board member.
Offer advice.

261
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,000
Planning.
Setting up an audit committee.

262
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:31,269
Customer relations.
Interviewed a lot ofpeople.

263
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,805
Built all the pieces
ofan enterprise.

264
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:36,806
I just brought what I consider
common sense to the table.

265
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,910
He even met his wife there.

266
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,049
He gave us guidance
on when not to go public
as well as when to go public.

267
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,156
I was very involved in that.

268
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:54,157
This was all new to Intel,
but wasn't new to me.

269
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:58,094
We went public the same day
that Playboy Enterprises went public.

270
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,668
At the same price.

271
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,669
And a few years later
one of the analysts says,

272
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,673
"The market has spoken.
It's memories over mammaries,
10-to-1."

281
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,299
Shortly after Arthur Rock
went out on his own,

282
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,835
Forbes profiled him
in an article that caught the eye...

283
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:13,771
ofa young investment manager
in Boston.

284
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,307
When they said,
"Well, now that you and Mr. Davis...

285
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,076
are doing separate things,
what are you going to do?"

286
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:21,012
He said, "Well, I'm gonna
find a younger partner
and do it all over again."

287
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:24,013
And I said, "You know, gee."

288
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,617
I had never even-
I mean, it was a light bulb.

289
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:32,423
And I sat down and I wrote him
a longhand letter.

290
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:35,424
And I never had ever done
anything like this before.

291
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:38,663
The following Monday
I got a telephone call.

292
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:41,299
"Mr. Rock's on the line."
I said, "Really?"

293
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Dick's letter was very intriguing.

294
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:47,737
He's just generally knowledgeable
and on the same, uh, piano as I was.

295
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:54,076
And then I found out later
that there were over a thousand
responses to the article.

296
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,549
And that Arthur had
a handwriting expert
that analyzed my letter.

297
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,555
Isn't that funny?

298
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:06,556
So that's how I got
in the venture business.

299
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,933
Well, you know,
there are no firm rules...

300
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:16,968
in the venture capital business,

301
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,037
except that there are no firm rules.

302
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,038
Did you have any problems
in convincing your colleagues?

303
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,308
Oh, yeah, they thought I was
out ofmy mind on this one.

304
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:29,278
By the early '70s, inspired
by the success ofArthur Rock,

305
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:33,251
more members of the Lunch Group
began to quit their day jobs...

306
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:35,753
and setup
their own venture funds.

307
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:38,754
Reid Dennis gave notice
to his boss at American Express.

308
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,658
He said, "Reid, are you sure
this is what you want to do?"

309
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:45,728
I said, "Bill, I've never been
so sure ofanything in all my life."

310
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,866
He said, "Well, wereally
don't want you to go,

311
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,867
but ifyou're determined to go'
you ought to take
some ofour money with you."

312
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,474
And that's what gave
us the impetus...

313
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:59,475
to start Institutional
Venture Associates.

314
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:03,913
A career
in venture capital now
seemed so alluring,

315
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,050
and potentially so profitable,

316
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:09,051
it was attracting people
outside offinance.

317
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,322
Two Silicon Valley engineers,

318
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:14,323
Eugene Kleiner and Tom Perkins,

319
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,828
formed what would become
one of the most successful...

320
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,829
venture firms ofall time.

321
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:24,467
Well, I sort ofgot into venture
capital by the back door.

322
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:29,071
I was working for the
Hewlett-Packard company...

323
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,775
when I had an idea
for a radically improved
kind oflaser.

324
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,048
And then I started a company...

325
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,217
to manufacture the lasers.

326
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,852
When it was all over I realized,

327
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:43,288
gee, I had been
a venture capitalist.

328
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,289
I put up the money.
I put up the management.

329
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,660
So then when I met Gene Kleiner,
who had left Fairchild,

330
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:55,097
we were both planning
to go into the venture
capital business.

331
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:59,869
And werealized
we complemented each other.

332
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:03,541
I mean I'm pretty intense
and high-strung'

333
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,044
and Gene was
sort ofcalm and portly...

334
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:09,045
and had a soothing
Viennese accent.

335
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:13,115
Eugene was just brilliant.
He was fun to be with.

336
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,820
I remember once we met
an entrepreneur,

337
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:20,758
and after he left I said, "Gene,

338
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,759
you know, do you trust him?"

339
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:27,163
And Gene said,
"I would trust him with my life,
but not my money."

340
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,740
And that's how it started.

341
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:38,276
We hung out our shingle'

342
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:40,311
and nothing happened.

343
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:43,312
The phone didn't ring.
We had a part-time secretary-

344
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:46,284
We called out,
nobody called in.

345
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:49,285
We saw some deals,
and we did some deals.

346
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:54,256
We lost money
in our original deals.

347
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:57,962
And I'll mention them,
even though they were
very embarrassing.

348
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:00,963
The most notorious,
and maybe the funniest'

349
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,867
was a company called Snow Job-

350
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:07,203
Which was a scheme to convert
motorcycles into snowmobiles...

351
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,108
and back and forth.

352
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:12,877
Which actually worked,
and it was a lot offun,

353
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:15,878
But one of the fuel crises
landed at about the time we were
ready to go into production,

354
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,484
and we couldn't get distributors,
and, uh, so it failed.

355
00:23:26,825 --> 00:23:29,825
So Eugene and I thought'
you know, "This is not working.

356
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:33,129
We've got to do
something differently."

357
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:42,004
Tandem was a huge risk
for Kleiner Perkins.

358
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:45,007
IfTandem had failed,
there would have never been
a second Kleiner Perkins fund.

359
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,418
I think I was 33.

360
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,419
I was young, in terms ofpeople
starting companies,

361
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,791
but there weren't a lot
ofpeople starting companies, so-

362
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:04,226
Well, Jimmy Treybig-
very smart guy.
Very impressive.

363
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:09,632
He had this idea,
which he'd carried-

364
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:12,902
not the technical part ofit,
but the need...

365
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:15,973
for a truly fault-tolerant
computer.

366
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:18,974
A computer
that would never fail.

367
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:23,512
At that time, for instance,
the New York Stock Exchange...

368
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,749
would fail about every day,
or every other day.

369
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:30,986
And something
would go wrong in it,
and it would destroy data.

370
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:39,897
People knew the problem,
but they didn't have a solution.

371
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:42,898
So just think ofit.
I mean, credit checking,
airline reservations, banking.

372
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:45,136
All financial things.

373
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,605
- Hospitals.
- All communications.

374
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,507
Just all kinds ofthings...

375
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:52,508
where it's just not acceptable
to have the computer go down.

376
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,015
We knew-Tom and I knew-

377
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:01,016
that ifwe could figure out
a different kind
ofcomputer architecture...

378
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:04,687
to solve this problem,
that we could create a big company.

379
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:12,228
The problem was IBM had won
the mainframe battle in '74.

380
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:16,465
And there was an article
that said there would never
be a new computer company.

381
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,605
Never. That was '74.

382
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:23,606
And the cover was a picture
ofa shark,

383
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:27,943
and IBM was eating up
every company.

384
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:32,882
When you think about
what decisions are being made,

385
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:36,485
you got IBM wiping out GE,
Siemens.

386
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:41,824
So it would be easy not to
want to go after that, right?

387
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:46,195
So you have to be brave.
I mean, you have to see it,
and you have to be brave.

388
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:50,466
And being brave is one thing
you got to say about Tom.

389
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:57,506
You gotta look to get money
from strong people.

390
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,110
Because weak people
don't invest in tough times.

391
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:05,915
But that's when most of
the big winners are created.

392
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:15,758
Well, first ofall, we didn't want
to be the only backers ofTandem.

393
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:20,129
We tried to raise venture capital.
I made a trip back east.

394
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:23,899
I remember the first time
we gave the pitch.

395
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:26,936
Jimmy was straight out ofTexas,
a real character,

396
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:31,842
and I didn't think he'd go over
very well on Wall Street.

397
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:34,843
He had to take me to buy a suit.
He probably shared that.

398
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:39,281
I literally took him to Brooks Brothers.
And shoes, socks, the works.

399
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:43,154
He always said, uh-
I forget what he said,

400
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:46,155
but, "He could buy the suit,
and that still didn't help."

401
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,625
And took him back to Wall Street,
and ofcourse the first thing he said is,

402
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:52,830
"Well, how do I look?
Tom dressed me!"

403
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:54,365
You know-

404
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:57,366
Tom was, uh, a little more
sophisticated than me.

405
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,203
But we didn't get the money.

406
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:06,175
Untried management.
An unlikely idea.

407
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:11,146
Most people
would not have thought this
was gonna be a big winner.

408
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,485
But I felt strongly enough
about Tandem that, uh,

409
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:19,955
even ifwe had to put up
all the money, we would do it.

410
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:23,993
And then finally, at the last minute,
Pitch Johnson put in
a small investment.

411
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,599
I like to think that
Tom felt my presence...

412
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,735
would be helpful
in raising money elsewhere.

413
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,703
It ratified our concept.

414
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:34,872
I was credible in those days.

415
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:37,873
Hi. I'm standing here next to
a beautiful Tandem computer.

416
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:40,876
I think everyone recognizes
this fine computer.

417
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:44,146
It took us a long time
to get that first order.

418
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:47,182
The very first customer
was Citibank.

419
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,388
But when we got the first order,

420
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:53,389
and the computers performed
as expected, even better,

421
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:57,328
the growth took off
and became explosive.

422
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,696
We went seven,

423
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:00,831
25, 50, 100 million,

424
00:28:00,832 --> 00:28:03,000
200 million, on up to a billion,

425
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,001
and we were a Fortune 500
company in '82.

426
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:16,912
You use a Tandem computer today...

427
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:20,449
pretty much any time you use
your credit card for anything.

428
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,736
When I started
in the venture business,

429
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:41,737
it never occurred to me
that we would have multiple funds...

430
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:47,176
that would easily exceed
a billion dollars.

431
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:52,114
I got into the business
somewhat fortuitously.

432
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:56,885
When I made the decision,

433
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:59,888
I had already put in 13 years
working in real companies.

434
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,196
In 1972, Don Valentine decided...

435
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:08,197
to trade on his connections
in the semiconductor industry...

436
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:11,433
and went in search of capital
to start a venture fund.

437
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,605
We went to see a guy
at Salomon Brothers,

438
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:19,977
and he said "You know'
I've listened to the pitch,

439
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:22,978
but, you know, you didn't go
to Harvard Business School."

440
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:27,983
I said, "Great observation.
True. Guilty as charged."

441
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:31,822
He says, "Why didn't you
go to business school?"

442
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:34,823
I said, "I went to Fairchild
Semiconductor Business School.
Great business school.

443
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:39,495
Start-up company.
Pioneer in a technology.

444
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:43,098
Phenomenal leadership
and recognition."

445
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:47,569
I said, "I don't need
to go to a business school
for what I'm gonna do."

446
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,310
Rebuffed by Wall Street,

447
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:55,279
Don Valentine found a mentor...

448
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,782
in a Southern California
mutual fund manager...

449
00:29:57,783 --> 00:30:00,783
who staked th emoney for Don's
first venturefund.

450
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,720
I'm not interested in entrepreneurs
who will do it our way.

451
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,125
I'm not interested
in entrepreneurs
who think there's a dress code.

452
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,930
I'm interested in entrepreneurs
who have a vision...

453
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:18,734
of doing something consequential,
preferably that becomes big.

454
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:28,679
For most people,
there's something intimidating...

455
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,649
about the idea of interacting
with a computer,

456
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,318
but that is
what's happening here.

457
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,288
Atari had one of Silicon Valley's...

458
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:40,257
absolutely larger-than-life
personalities leading it,

459
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:43,258
Nolan K. Bushnell.

460
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,197
Bushnell was a young engineer...

461
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:48,966
working for game manufacturer
Nutting Associates...

462
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,967
when he decided to strike out
on his own in 1972.

463
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:56,638
The real thing that
allowed me to start Atari...

464
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,976
was I worked for Nutting,

465
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:01,977
and these guys couldn't find
their butts with both hands.

466
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:04,815
I said, "You know,
I can run a company,

467
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:07,816
and I won't make any of these same
mistakes these idiots are doing."

468
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:13,657
The first game
Atari designed was Pong.

469
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:18,527
Nolan took a prototype of the game,
strapped it to his back...

470
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:21,563
and placed it in a bar
in Sunnyvale, California.

471
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:25,334
By the next morning,
customers were lined up outside...

472
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:28,337
clamoring for a chance to play.

473
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,908
We put it on location.
It earned a lot ofmoney.

474
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:33,909
Production soared, and there seemed
to be an insatiable appetite...

475
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:37,681
for the coin-operated game.

476
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,985
From the outside, Atari looked
like a wildly successful company,

477
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:47,089
producing an endless stream
of popular games.

478
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,160
But there was one key problem.

479
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:55,097
The company was started
with 250 dollars.

480
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,333
And so we never had any money.

481
00:32:00,205 --> 00:32:03,205
If you're
a hardware company, you need
a lot of capital for inventories.

482
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:08,112
The more successful,
the moreyou have to raise.

483
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:10,214
Because the more inventory
you have,

484
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:13,215
the more customers
you're waiting to pay you.

485
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:16,485
It takes a lot of capital
for a hardware start-up.

486
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:20,022
In 1974 Atari was
flirting with bankruptcy...

487
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,026
and desperately needed
financial help.

488
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:27,062
But Nolan found
the traditional channels off-limits.

489
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Banks-
in the traditional sense of banks-
lend on assets.

490
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:36,173
So, "Do you have a house?
I'll give you a mortgage.

491
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:39,174
Doyou have a car?
I'll giveyou a loan on your car."

492
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:44,046
Nolan had no basis
for a bank to be comfortable.

493
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,886
I went through the factory,

494
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:54,656
and the smell of marijuana
nearly knocked me to my knees.

495
00:32:57,329 --> 00:32:59,997
And I was gasping and coughing.

496
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:02,066
Nolan says, "What's the matter?"

497
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:05,067
And I said, "I don't know
what those people are smoking,
but it's not my brand."

498
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:09,373
Don might have passed on Atari...

499
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:12,374
had Nolan not shown him
a surprising new product
in development-

500
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:17,881
Home Pong

501
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:20,882
Atari's engineers
had discovered they could
get the entire Pong game...

502
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:24,753
down to the size of a shoe box.

503
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:28,256
At the time, playing
video games at home
was a revolutionary concept.

504
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:34,496
We showed Don our plans
for the home games.

505
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,036
He finally decided
there was a business there.

506
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:42,037
Fabulous product.
Giant market.

507
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:46,176
He used to say, you know,
"The coin-op business-
you think it's big?"

508
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:48,245
He says, "You ain't seen nothin'."

509
00:33:48,246 --> 00:33:49,847
Huge.

510
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,084
Once we decided
to finance Atari,

511
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:57,085
it was a matter of trying
to figure out who else
would invest in it.

512
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,458
Funds in those days were tiny,

513
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:06,561
and in order for us
to start a company,

514
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:09,865
we had to very collegially
work together.

515
00:34:13,638 --> 00:34:16,638
I brought him other investors.

516
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:20,342
However, it takes a while
to get used to Nolan.

517
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,083
And there's a story there
about one of our meetings,

518
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:29,084
where the man from Fidelity
was sitting in a chair
with his blue suit on,

519
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:32,656
and the rest of us
were in the hot tub.

520
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:35,657
Nolan was unrelentingly
picking on him...

521
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:38,827
about his prudish behavior
and why he wouldn't get
in the hot tub.

522
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,767
With a controversial
entrepreneur...

523
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:46,336
and no existing market
for home video games,

524
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:49,337
months went by
while the other investors remained
on the fence about Atari.

525
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:54,743
So Nolan himself
took his Home Pong prototype
on the road in search of customers.

526
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:59,817
Of course, we were young
and felt we could solve...

527
00:34:59,818 --> 00:35:02,818
any problems that came along,
and, you know,

528
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:05,854
selling them to Toys R Us,
that can't be that hard.

529
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,226
It was, actually.

530
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:11,028
I like to tell the story about...

531
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:14,029
taking the Pong game
to the toy fair in New York
and selling none.

532
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:20,435
So we thought,
"Let's try the television shops."

533
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:23,939
And they didn't want it.

534
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:29,144
These are very fragile companies
with a lot of things missing.

535
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:33,584
And the approach
we've always taken is,

536
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:36,585
if we make this investment,
is our Rolodex...

537
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:39,688
strong enough
to help these people?

538
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,361
So much luck
goes into these things...

539
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:50,565
that without it, I think
very few of us would have
very many successes.

540
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:58,073
One of our investors was
a very big shareholder of Sears.

541
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:03,347
And they facilitated
the introduction...

542
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:06,348
to the buyer at Sears
who would buy a product like this.

543
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:11,019
I think he was charmed by Nolan...

544
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:14,256

My father was the sole proprietor
of this little candy store.

555
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:09,844
My father was a very petty
union member.

556
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:13,483
My dad was a wonderful guy,

557
00:37:13,484 --> 00:37:16,484
and, um, he really encouraged
self-reliance.

558
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:21,156
Well, we sold a little groceries,
a little magazines,

559
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:24,259
a little candy,
a little ice cream, cigarettes.

560
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:28,997
At a very early age,
I worked there.

561
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,402
I clerked.

562
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:35,403
I was six years-
seven years old.

563
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:39,975
It's easier to explain
he drove a truck...

564
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:42,212
than it is to explain
what he did in the union,

565
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,248
'cause I didn't understand
what he did in the union...

566
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:47,249
other than fight
with the head of the union.

567
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:52,487
And we used to have
a lot of, uh, arguments...

568
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:55,692
once I understood
what a union was,

569
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,693
and he couldn't understand
why I was so adamantly
opposed to the unions.

570
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,368
It probably has to do with my...

571
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:10,572
deep-seated
sense of disobedience.

572
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:13,210
When I was 12 or 13,

573
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:16,211
I was trying to figure out
how to earn some money
in the summertime.

574
00:38:16,714 --> 00:38:19,714
So I said, "You know, Dad,
maybe I could sell light bulbs."

575
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:26,490
So I went down
to the local general manager...

576
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:29,393
of the Sylvania operation.

577
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,728
He said the smallest amount
that he could sell me...

578
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,729
would be a half a freight car
full of light bulbs.

579
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:38,933
And so I asked my mother
if I could populate our basement
with all these light bulbs.

580
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:43,573
And so I got this wagon-
this big wagon-

581
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,574
and I went around
and I sold light bulbs
for a whole summertime.

582
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:49,246
I called it the Bright Boy
Light Bulb Company.

583
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:52,247
It's a little bit over the top,
but that's what it was.

584
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:55,152
I was a nerd.

585
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,987
A highly motivated, impatient,

586
00:38:56,988 --> 00:38:59,988
driven
workaholic nerd.

587
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,991
Um-
Who accidentally
became an athlete,

588
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:07,996
and got some sort
of social polish...

589
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
at a school for nerds- MIT.

590
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:17,305
I scrambled to get into
a degree where I thought
I could earn a living,

591
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,011
which was electronic engineering.

592
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:24,012
I did that for a while, and I thought,
"God, this is pretty boring."

593
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:27,949
And I thought, "Well, you know,
I've heard about business school.

594
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,921
Maybe I should
take a crack at that."

595
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:37,125
And this is where I got inspired
by Georges Doriot.

596
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,667
Professor Georges Doriot...

597
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:46,269
was a father figgure
to a generation of young men...

598
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,305
at Harvard Business School.

599
00:39:48,306 --> 00:39:51,306
This French expatriate
had the distinction of starting..

600
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:54,309
the first corporation dedicated
exclusively to venture investing,

601
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:58,613
American Research
and Development,
founded in 1946.

602
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,387
Ironically, Doriot's lasting impact...

603
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:05,255
would not be through A.R.D.,

604
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:08,256
which in its entire 25-year history
made only one notable investment.

605
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,330
Instead, Doriot's
most important influence...

606
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:16,331
came through the spell he cast
over his Harvard classroom.

607
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:20,470
Doriot
was very controversial...

608
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:23,306
even at the time at Harvard.

609
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:26,276
He taught a course
called Manufacturing,

610
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:28,912
which really had nothing to do
with manufacturing.

611
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:31,348
And it was an extremely
popular course,

612
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,349
and it was
all about starting companies,
and technology.

613
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:39,289
He talked about entrepreneurs.
He had some of them as guests-

614
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,857
what it was like
to start a company.

615
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:43,858
His lectures were how to dress,

616
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:47,197
how many drinks you should have
at a cocktail party.

617
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:50,198
It was sort of a Georges Doriot
philosophy of life.

618
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,601
Every year, he'd take
one whole session...

619
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,540
on how to read
the New York Times.

620
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,541
He'd hold up the paper and say-

621
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,710
"You should be able to read
this paper in four minutes.

622
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:06,116
What is the first section I read?"

623
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:09,117
He said, "Now the first thing
you want to do is go
to the obituary page.

624
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:13,054
There you will learn
the lives that are important,

625
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:16,825
and the kind of life
that you can build for yourself."

626
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,029
He would talk about working
with entrepreneurs.

627
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:24,332
And when times got tough,
as they always will-

628
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,837
and he made that point-

629
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:29,838
that he would invite
the entrepreneur over to his home.

630
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,510
They'd have dinner, and then he'd
just sit him down in his library...

631
00:41:33,511 --> 00:41:36,511
and play phonograph records
of French marching music.

632
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,850
You know, just to deal with
the psychological wounds, you know.

633
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,356
When he was talking about
venture capital, starting companies,

634
00:41:46,357 --> 00:41:49,025
he was as good as there was,
because he was the only guy
who understood it.

635
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:52,026

At the time we started Genentech,

644
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
there was no such thing
as genetic engineering.

645
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,410
And to take the idea
of commercializing gene splicing,

646
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:46,816
the risks were just enormous.

647
00:42:50,254 --> 00:42:52,289
And I said, "Well, you know,

648
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,290
what if God or Darwin
won't let us
make a new life form?"

649
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,471
It was a bet on technology,

650
00:43:08,472 --> 00:43:11,472
and you looked
at the value of the
pharmaceutical industry,

651
00:43:11,576 --> 00:43:14,576
and if you had a better
way to develop drugs,

652
00:43:15,246 --> 00:43:18,246
the power was enormous.

653
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:21,416
Nobody had a clue
whether they could pull that off,

654
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:24,786
but you did know...
that if they could, it was big.

655
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:37,231
It came out of the blue for me.

656
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,202
I had not been thinking
about starting a company.

657
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,541
I thought I was going to,
uh, die at the lab bench
with a pipette in my mouth.

658
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:51,412
But, uh, Bob called,

659
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:54,949
and he wanted to know
if the technology was
ready to be commercialized.

660
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:01,556
Bob Swanson,
I think, was the most prescient
individual I've ever met.

661
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:05,895
Once he understood...

662
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,896
what the potential technology was
in genetic engineering,

663
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,900
he got the whole picture,
way ahead ofanybody else.

664
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:19,907
Eugene and I were looking around
for someone to add to the partnership,

665
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:23,346
and Bobjoined us.

666
00:44:23,347 --> 00:44:26,347
But there just wasn't enough
going on in those days, amazingly,

667
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:30,418
to really have him
full-time working on our ventures.

668
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:33,390
We didn't have that many.

669
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:36,391
But we were interested
in doing something
in genetic engineering.

670
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:40,628
We sort of said,
"Go there, find something.

671
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,299
And if you can, we'll finance it.

672
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,300
If you can't, well-"
You know.

673
00:44:46,337 --> 00:44:49,337
So he was motivated
to find something.

674
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:53,574
And he calls Professor Boyer
at the University of California.

675
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,180
Boyer said,
"I'll give you five minutes."

676
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,181
It turned into,
you know, many hours.

677
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:04,085
In those days, funding
for research was, uh, difficult.

678
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:09,157
And so, you know,
I had some, you know,
ulterior reasons...

679
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:15,029
for paying attention
when he said he had money.

680
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:19,367
Over the next couple of weeks,
Swanson persuaded Boyer...

681
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:23,337
to take the idea of gene splicing
into some sort
of a commercial operation.

682
00:45:26,377 --> 00:45:29,377
And Bob brought Boyer to me.

683
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:37,552
So we go into one of
the, uh, Embarcadero Towers,

684
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,790
and we go up to the top floor.

685
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:46,327
And you can
look out over the world.

686
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:52,633
It was something like
out of a movie,
and holy smoke.

687
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:58,439
So we go in, and these
stern-looking guys are sitting
there in a suit, you know.

688
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:04,414
Perkins says,
"Okay, Well, what are you going to do?"

689
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:07,283
What do you do?
What equipment do you need?

690
00:46:07,284 --> 00:46:09,719
How do you know
that you've done it?
How do you test?

691
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,421
It's scary.

692
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:14,422
What are the risks? Contamination?
Everything I could think-

693
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:17,759
Here was this rich guy, you know,
talking to us about science,
and funding science.

694
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,264
I paid attention, you know.

695
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:24,100
And I didn't know anything
about raising money.

696
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:27,101
Of course, I knew nothing
whatsoever about the technology.
I mean, nobody did.

697
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:29,506
I had to rely on him.

698
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:31,141
Because there was so much
to be done.

699
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:32,909
He was a very hands-on guy.

700
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,910
They wanted to raise, um'
about three million dollars
to build the factory,

701
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:41,249
hire the people,
and then see if it would work.

702
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,287
But underlying it all...

703
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:47,288
was the-the tremendous
risk factor of, you know,
would it be possible?

704
00:46:53,764 --> 00:46:56,764
It was pure research, you know,

705
00:46:57,101 --> 00:47:00,101
and everybody knows that
venture capitalists shouldn't
openly fund pure research.

706
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:06,707
So my idea in everything
has always been to try to
put the risk up front...

707
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:11,512
and get rid of the risk
as fast as you possibly can.

708
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:17,185
Bob and I were very naive...

709
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:20,657
about how we were going
to do what we did.

710
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:23,658
We changed the business plan.

711
00:47:24,962 --> 00:47:27,962
I persuaded them to do it
a different way.

712
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:31,899
To subcontract the experiment
to two different institutions.

713
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:40,107
By subcontracting,
Tom Perkins eliminated the need...

714
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:43,544
to buy equipment, build a lab
and hire staff.

715
00:47:45,015 --> 00:47:47,984
The estimated three million dollar
start-up costs...

716
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:50,985
were reduced to just 250,000.

717
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:55,022
Kleiner Perkins put up the money,
and Genentech was in business.

718
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,560
It was Bob Swanson
and a checkbook
sitting in our office here.

719
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:04,131
That was Genentech.

720
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:07,835
Boyer and Swanson set out
to create human insulin.

721
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:11,739
But, to test their concept,
they began
with a less complex hormone.

722
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,511
City of Hope Medical Center
in Los Angeles...

723
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:18,512
would try to engineer a gene
for that hormone.

724
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:22,149
Then, UC San Francisco
would splice that gene
into bacteria...

725
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:26,487
to produce the hormone
in significant amounts.

726
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:31,926
after a very long time, City of Hope
succeeded in making the gene,

727
00:48:34,265 --> 00:48:37,066
and then we transported
the gene-

728
00:48:37,067 --> 00:48:40,067
Bob had it in his pocket-
up to University of California.

729
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,839
And Herb Boyer
inserted it into the bacterial host.

730
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:50,745
Then it worked.

731
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,583
So we had our breakthrough.

732
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:01,724
That was the first time
in history...

733
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:04,725
that, uh, mankind
had ever made an artificial, um-

734
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:08,765
Well, let's just say
an artificial bacteria.

735
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:11,200
Most doctors aggree that
genetic engineering..

736
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,736
will be the source of most drugs
in the next decade.

737
00:49:13,737 --> 00:49:16,737
As scientists look ahead, they see
a myriad of products. New vaccines-

738
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:19,776
We haven't
scratched the surface yet,

739
00:49:19,777 --> 00:49:22,777
in terms of, uh,
new hormones and molecules...

740
00:49:22,913 --> 00:49:25,882
that the body produces itself
to keep itself healthy.

741
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:28,883
The next step, of course-

742
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:32,987
You know, it wasn't my goal
to start an industry.

743
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,590
My goal was to, um,
make sure the science
got translated...

744
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:41,495
into an endeavor
that would be useful to people.

745
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:45,902
In all the things I've done,
I think I'm most proud
of Genentech,

746
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,903
because it, uh, Well, saved hundreds
of thousands of people's lives.

747
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:03,152
Well, isn't it great if you can
make money...

748
00:50:03,153 --> 00:50:06,153
and change the world for the better
at the same time?

749
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:25,539
We are now entering our
fourth generation of computers.

750
00:50:25,709 --> 00:50:28,709
Difficult problems which once
required 30 hours of work
by a computer as large as a house...

751
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,981
can now be solved
in 12 seconds by a computer
no bigger than a bathtub.

752
00:50:36,854 --> 00:50:39,854
In 1976, the computer was
about to get personal,

753
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,958
expanding beyond the government,
institutions and businesses
to enter the home.

754
00:50:45,863 --> 00:50:48,863
For venture capitalists,
this represented
the opportunity of a lifetime.

755
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,940
We turned down Apple Computer.

756
00:50:57,941 --> 00:51:00,476
We didn't-
We didn't even turn it down.

757
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:03,477
We didn't agree to meet
with Jobs and Wozniak.

758
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:10,451
Oh, that would have been a fabulous
investment if we had made it,

759
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:13,456
but we didn't.

760
00:51:13,457 --> 00:51:16,457
We said,
"Oh, no, we're not really
in that business."

761
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,527
I thought, "How can you use
a computer at home?
You're gonna put recipes on it?"

762
00:51:20,898 --> 00:51:23,332
I sent my partner down
to look at Apple.

763
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,333
He came back and he said,
"Guy kept me waiting for an hour,
and he's very arrogant."

764
00:51:28,572 --> 00:51:31,572
And, of course, that's Steve Jobs!

765
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:34,775
I said, "Well, let's let it go."
That was a big mistake.

766
00:51:38,649 --> 00:51:41,649
In 1976, the only people who
believed in the personal computer...

767
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:45,853
were the geeks and nerds
who gathered at Homebrew
Computer Clubs.

768
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:50,224
At one such club, 21-year-old
Steve Jobs had partnered
with Steve Wozniak...

769
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:55,296
to create a circuit board kit
they called...

770
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:58,901
The Apple I.

771
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:01,604
Steve Jobs was
working at Atari at the time,

772
00:52:01,605 --> 00:52:04,605
so the most obvious person
to ask for start-up money
was his boss, Nolan Bushnell.

773
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:08,845
They needed an investment,

774
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:11,846
and, uh, they offered me a third
of Apple Computer for $50,000...

775
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:15,816
and I said,
"Gee, I don't think so."

776
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,520
I could have owned a third
of Apple Computer for $50'000.

777
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,892
A big mistake.

778
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,664
But I said, "Call Don Valentine."

779
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:31,665
'Cause Don had a high probability
of seeing the opportunity.

780
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,371
So we had our meeting.
I went to Steve's house.

781
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:41,677
And we talked,

782
00:52:41,678 --> 00:52:44,678
and I was convinced
it was a big market...

783
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:50,584
just embryonically beginning.

784
00:52:52,156 --> 00:52:55,156
Steve was in his Fu Manchu look,
and his question for me-

785
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,429
"Tell me what I have to do
to have you finance me."

786
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,502
I said, "We have to have someone
in the company...

787
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:09,503
who has some sense of
management and marketing
and channels ofdistribution."

788
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:15,176
He said, "Fine.
Send me three people."

789
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:18,381
I sent him three candidates.

790
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:21,382
One he didn't like.
One didn't like him.

791
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,287
And the third one
was Mike Markkula.

792
00:53:26,757 --> 00:53:29,757
Mike Markkula
worked for me at Fairchild
before he went to Intel.

793
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:34,128
He called me up and said,
"There's two guys over
in Los Altos that, uh,

794
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:38,766
could really use your help,
and you ought to
go see'em."

795
00:53:39,436 --> 00:53:42,436
I said, "Okay."
'Cause that's what I did
on Mondays.

796
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:47,677
I was retired.

797
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:50,678
I think I was 32
when I retired from Intel.

798
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,250
But one day a week,
I would help people start companies
and write business plans.

799
00:53:57,955 --> 00:54:00,955
I did it for free,
just for the interaction
with bright, uh, people...

800
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:06,262
that had a lot of
fire in their belly.

801
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:09,263
So I went
over and talked to the boys.

802
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:13,067
The two of them did not make
a good impression on people.

803
00:54:13,971 --> 00:54:16,971
They were bearded.
They didn't smell good.

804
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,007
They dressed funny.
Young, naive.

805
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:25,546
But Woz had designed
a really wonderful, wonderful
computer.

806
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:30,618
Technology that was
really advanced.

807
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:35,556
The problem was,
you could walk down the street
in 1976...

808
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:40,930
and talk to a hundred people
and say, "Would you like
a personal computer?"

809
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:43,931
And they'd go, "What's that?"

810
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,270
And so I told them.
I said I'd help them
write a business plan.

811
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,775
So I got to working on it,

812
00:54:52,776 --> 00:54:55,776
and I'd say, "Gosh", you know'
"the opportunity here
is just too great."

813
00:54:59,783 --> 00:55:02,783
The business plan said that, uh'
with $142'000 we could be
cash-flow positive in nine months.

814
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:10,958
And I came to the conclusion that
we could build a Fortune 500 company
in less than five years.

815
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:18,165
I said I'd put up the money
that was needed.

816
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:22,772
Not only did he write the check,

817
00:55:22,773 --> 00:55:24,407
Mike Markkula
came out of retirement,

818
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,408
becoming the president
and C.E.O. of Apple.

819
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:30,644
His first order of business,
build a board of directors.

820
00:55:31,448 --> 00:55:34,448
And the first call he made
was to Arthur Rock.

821
00:55:35,118 --> 00:55:38,118
Arthur would have missed Apple
if it weren't for Mike Markkula.

822
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:41,522
Jobs and Wozniak
came up to see me,

823
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,626
and they were very unappealing.

824
00:55:43,627 --> 00:55:46,627
Goatee, long hair-

825
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:51,334
Markkula said,
"Well, before you make up
your mind,

826
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:54,335
there's a computer show.

827
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:57,573
You ought to come down
and see what's going on."

828
00:55:57,574 --> 00:56:00,574
And he did. He thought
somethin' was happenin'.
He wasn't quite sure what.

829
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:04,513
There was this huge auditorium,

830
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:07,514
and there was this booth
with everybody around it.

831
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:09,719
I couldn't even get next to it.

832
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,054
And it was the Apple booth.

833
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:15,055
And it turned out
that I sure made an investment.

834
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,494
Then I got a call
from Don Valentine.

835
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:20,162
"I want to put
some money in that compa-"

836
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:23,163
I said, "Okay, you gotta
come on the board then."

837
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,667
Don's background is
sales and distribution
and customer satisfaction.

838
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,439
Arthur's expertise
comes from the way
financial markets work,

839
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,513
and, uh,
how to choose people.

840
00:56:37,514 --> 00:56:39,248
I don't think
there's a company today...

841
00:56:39,249 --> 00:56:42,249
that could say that
they had a better
board than that.

842
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:46,587
I mean, we couldn't-
We couldn't lose.

843
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:53,896
Taking his place alongside
the venture capital luminaries...

844
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:55,798
was the young Steve Jobs,

845
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:58,799
who had never even seen
the inside of a board room.

846
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,238
There was one board meeting
that he took his shoes off...

847
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,239
and put his bare feet up
on the- on the table.

848
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,509
And I said, "You're excused
until you can come back here...

849
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:12,746
and act like a board member."

850
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:17,384
He put his shoe back on
and everything was fine.

851
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:20,556
He just needed some training
and some direction...

852
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:23,557
and some, um, manners.

853
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:46,213
You know,
in the venture capital business,
if you look at 200 deals,

854
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:50,386
and you-you might do
10 of'em,

855
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:53,387
and you will think
they're all great,
and if one of'em is great,

856
00:57:54,658 --> 00:57:57,658
then you're in the hall of fame.

857
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:14,977
If you make 10 deals,
you know, if you do it well,

858
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:17,346
some of them are gonna succeed,
some are going to fail.

859
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:19,648
There's usually one
in there we call
the living dead.

860
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:22,649
Living dead, living dead, living dead.

861
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:28,889
They don't succeed,
they don't fail. They just sit there
and lap up your time.

862
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:30,860
You're doomed.

863
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:35,197
They fail for
all kinds of reasons.

864
00:58:35,198 --> 00:58:38,198
If it's struggling,
you probably should just get out.

865
00:58:39,536 --> 00:58:42,536
Well, we hated to give up,
you know,
and hated to admit defeat.

866
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:45,074
It was always traumatic.

867
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:47,309
You get personally involved
in these companies.

868
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,278
Everybody's heartbroken.

869
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,413
It's tough to lose money.

870
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:54,414
Losing money
is not a good thing!

871
00:59:04,027 --> 00:59:06,595
Proggrams are instructions
to the computer...

872
00:59:06,596 --> 00:59:09,596
that can berecorded
on floppy disks or cassettes.

873
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:14,303
In the early '80s,
a new kind of company...

874
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:17,206
began to attract
attention in Silicon Valley.

875
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:20,207
These proggrams
are called software.

876
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:24,611
A Data Quest report says there
are now 27,000 software programs
on the market,

877
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:29,316
with a new product
being introduced
every 11 minutes.

878
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Dick Kramlich
had been listening to endless pitches
from software entrepreneurs...

879
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:36,325
in his office at
New Enterprise Associates,

880
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:39,326
a venture firm he'dco-founded
after leaving Arthur Rock.

881
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,630
One day, an entrepreneur
named Rob Campbell marched in.

882
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:47,970
I was out always
looking for money.

883
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:50,971
And I was flying
from Boston
to California,

884
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:54,109
and I was sitting
in the back of the plane
in the cheap seats,

885
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,078
where entrepreneurs
are supposed to sit.

886
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,079
And I noticed
half the people on the plane
had their briefcases open,

887
01:00:01,818 --> 01:00:04,818
and they had overhead
transparencies.

888
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:07,556
And they were
thumbing through 'em'
and theywere marking'em up.

889
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:12,693
That really was kind of the genesis
of "Why PowerPoint?"

890
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,332
I liked the way Rob was doing this,

891
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:19,333
and I was really impressed
with PowerPoint.

892
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:23,937
You see'
you sort of automate
a very cumbersome process,

893
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,008
and when you see it,
you know it!

894
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:29,009
It's just
that this goes right
through your bones.

895
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:32,081
So, we started funding it.

896
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:35,082
Dick Kramlich's firm
provided Rob Campbell's company,
named Forethought,

897
01:00:35,919 --> 01:00:38,919
with an initial round of funding
to develop this new software.

898
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:42,424
But while the Forethought team
was working on PowerPoint,

899
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:45,425
the company was giving its
venture capitalists cause to worry.

900
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:49,830
Any new business
seldom does what's written
in the business plan.

901
01:00:51,368 --> 01:00:54,368
And we had
a multitude of problems.

902
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:56,772
Limitations of
the operating system.

903
01:00:56,773 --> 01:00:59,041
Months invested in trying-
Couldn't develop it.

904
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:02,042
Engineering was delayed.
Theywere all "R" and not much "D."

905
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:05,681
Decision on acquiring FileMaker-

906
01:01:05,682 --> 01:01:08,682
Our largest distributor
went into Chapter 7.

907
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:11,685
So the bankruptcy judge
is now selling
our products off.

908
01:01:15,692 --> 01:01:18,692
Campbell's company was burning
through its investment money fast.

909
01:01:19,162 --> 01:01:22,162
He approached Kramlich
and his partners,
looking for another infusion of cash.

910
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:26,835
Rob came in
and did a presentation'
talked about FileMaker,

911
01:01:26,836 --> 01:01:29,672
talked about what
the presentation product
was going to be.

912
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:32,673
N.E.A. had hired
a-a new, um, partner,
and he didn't like us.

913
01:01:35,912 --> 01:01:38,912
He didn't like our company.
I don't think he liked me.

914
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:41,982
And then my other partner got up
and said, you know,

915
01:01:42,218 --> 01:01:45,218
"Basically, you have one product
where you pay too much in royalties,

916
01:01:45,555 --> 01:01:48,555
and the other one
which is not gonna work,
so this isn't worth it.

917
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:50,859
Dick, we're saying no."

918
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,860
And I said, "No more money?"
He said, "No more money."

919
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:59,234
Despite his partner's doubts,

920
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:02,235
Dick Kramlich wasn't ready
to let PowerPoint go so easily.

921
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:06,206
My mother used to say,
"Don't ever underestimate Dick.

922
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,579
'Cause if
he takes on a challenge,
he's going to get it done."

923
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,580
I said, "You know,
this presentation product
is really a pretty good product."

924
01:02:15,385 --> 01:02:18,385
So I said, "Would you all mind
if I did it myself?"

925
01:02:19,956 --> 01:02:22,391
And they said,
"Well, you can do
what you want to do.

926
01:02:22,392 --> 01:02:25,392
It's not gonna be a conflict,
just so long as we don't have to
put any more money in."

927
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:29,463
So I called my wife,
and I said, "Pam, um,
stop work on the house."

928
01:02:32,936 --> 01:02:35,936
I said, "I'm gonna fund
this company myself."

929
01:02:36,806 --> 01:02:39,806
We would never do
what Dick did. Never.

930
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:43,912
There's so many potential
problems with a venture,

931
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:46,913
that if you have a serious partner,
a good partner, who says,
"I just don't see this"-

932
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:51,987
How can you proceed?

933
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:54,988
As a matter of policy, we wouldn't
permit that in our place.

934
01:02:56,192 --> 01:02:57,693
Well, he asked permission.

935
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,694
Well, we would say no.

936
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:04,099
Then there wouldn't be PowerPoint!

937
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,100
Good.

938
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:12,439
I remember telling Dick.
I said, "Dick, you did not make
a mistake."

939
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:19,613
I thought it would be
a million-dollar product
right out of the chute.

940
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:24,651
And, instead of a million dollars
out of the chute, I thin kwe had
two and a half to three.

941
01:03:27,657 --> 01:03:30,459
It was much better
than what I had hoped for.

942
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,460
And so, I was thinking
this was enough
to validate a public offering.

943
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:37,697
I think Dick would have liked us
not to be acquired.

944
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:41,701
He said, "You know, wereally
don't have the structure in this
company to be a public company."

945
01:03:44,107 --> 01:03:47,107
You know, I was nervous
about access to capital.

946
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:50,577
He said, "Actually, we've been
approached by Microsoft.

947
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:54,247
And they have a presentation product,
but it's not nearly as good
as PowerPoint.

948
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:58,218
And they would like to acquire us
and kill their own project."

949
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:02,956
I said, "If that's
the way you want to go,
it's okay with me."

950
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,630
Another one of my greatest mistakes,
of which I have many,

951
01:04:12,235 --> 01:04:15,235
is when Microsoft
did the acquisition,
they wanted to do it all in stock.

952
01:04:18,374 --> 01:04:21,374
So I was, like, "Oh, you know,
Microsoft stock
has way too much risk.

953
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:25,447
They could dump their stock
on us at their peak!"

954
01:04:25,448 --> 01:04:28,448
So we did an all-cash transaction.

955
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:31,451
And don't ask me to calculate
what that cost all ofus.
It's too- It's too hurtful.

01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,731
The facts are, in Silicon Valley,

965
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:18,732
probably 40 % of the companies
that are financed...

966
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:21,236
change presidents in 18 months.

967
01:05:21,237 --> 01:05:24,072
I mean, I always tell
the young C.E.O.'s,
you're gonna work hard,

968
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:26,408
and you're gonna, you know,
if you're lucky,

969
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:28,610
you're gonna be successful,
and your company's
gonna get big.

970
01:05:28,611 --> 01:05:31,611
And then you're gonna get fired.

971
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:36,551
Firing people is always
the hardest for me.

972
01:05:36,552 --> 01:05:38,220
That's a gut-wrenching
thing to do.

973
01:05:38,221 --> 01:05:39,888
If they gotta go, they gotta go.

974
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:42,889
I'd rather find the right people
and back them,

975
01:05:44,594 --> 01:05:47,594
uh, than find the right idea
and have to change the people.

976
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:52,032
Well, nobody plans to do that,
but those are the facts.

977
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:58,071
So, I operate from the principle
that-

978
01:05:58,942 --> 01:06:01,942
Give him his shot.
Help him as much as we can.
Hope that he makes it.

979
01:06:03,913 --> 01:06:06,913
If he doesn't make it,

980
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,050
off with his head
and on to the next guy.

981
01:06:19,462 --> 01:06:22,462
In 1984 Cisco Systems
was a two-person company-

982
01:06:23,866 --> 01:06:26,866
The husband-and-wife team
of Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner.

983
01:06:27,971 --> 01:06:29,938
Cisco was a typical start-up.

984
01:06:29,939 --> 01:06:31,907
It was certainly
run out of our house.

985
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:34,908
A number of very
illustrious companies
I think have that distinction.

986
01:06:37,547 --> 01:06:40,547
through Cisco, Sandy and Len
were early evangelists...

987
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,185
for what would one day
be called the Internet,

988
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:46,186
but which, in 1984,
was really just a jury-rigged
network of computers,

989
01:06:47,724 --> 01:06:50,724
used at universities
and in the military.

990
01:06:51,294 --> 01:06:53,528
Cisco's product
was called a router.

991
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:56,164
And it solved a very big problem.

992
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:59,165
It allowed all kinds of computer
systems to talk to each other easily
for the very first time.

993
01:07:03,706 --> 01:07:06,706
This opened the door
to the development
of an online world.

994
01:07:08,978 --> 01:07:11,978
It was a desperately-needed
product.

995
01:07:12,482 --> 01:07:15,482
But... no one would finance Cisco.

996
01:07:20,923 --> 01:07:23,923
We tried from the very beginning
to-to get funding.

997
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,862
Uh, we just
weren't successful.

998
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:29,331
We were not the first people
to see it,

999
01:07:29,332 --> 01:07:32,134
as armies of people
have told me-

1000
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,903
That they saw it before we did,
and they turned it down.

1001
01:07:34,904 --> 01:07:37,904
They took the position
that this wasn't
a tenable business model.

1002
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:41,241
I-I don't think, in their position,
I would have disagreed
with that.

1003
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,079
But I wasn't in their position,
and I did disagree with it.

1004
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:49,349
These things are not so clear.

1005
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:52,452
Different people
see them differently.

1006
01:07:52,588 --> 01:07:55,588
The person who got us involved
with Cisco said,

1007
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:59,292
"You are probably the only person
in North America...

1008
01:07:59,562 --> 01:08:02,562
who would be willing to deal
with these people."

1009
01:08:02,899 --> 01:08:05,467
The people at Cisco-

1010
01:08:05,468 --> 01:08:08,468
If you were designing
hard-to-get-along-with
people,

1011
01:08:09,372 --> 01:08:11,740
they got the model
right down.

1012
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:14,741
Difficult to do business with...
on any basis.

1013
01:08:16,946 --> 01:08:19,946
Totally intolerant of
a mistake made by anybody.

1014
01:08:21,317 --> 01:08:24,317
But very instrumental
in starting that company.

1015
01:08:24,954 --> 01:08:27,954
I think that we were difficult
to workwith.

1016
01:08:28,558 --> 01:08:31,558
We were all very independent.
We were used to
having our own way.

1017
01:08:32,328 --> 01:08:35,328
You know,
certainly there's the mind-set
that has to go along...

1018
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:38,531
with years and years and years
of people saying that, you know,

1019
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:41,002
"You can't do what
you say you're going to do,"

1020
01:08:41,003 --> 01:08:44,003
"You can't make money'
even if you could do it,"

1021
01:08:44,173 --> 01:08:47,173
um, and that "You're
the wrong person to do it."

1022
01:08:50,913 --> 01:08:53,913
We bought a third of the company
for $2.8 million.

1023
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,750
And we had an agreement
that basically said,

1024
01:08:58,488 --> 01:09:01,189
"You get a third of the company'
and we get a third of the company'

1025
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:04,190
and we will find the people
to run this company."

1026
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:12,100
None ofus had ever
built a company.

1027
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:15,101
We understood that
there was an enormous need for-
for more structure,

1028
01:09:17,773 --> 01:09:20,773
and to bring in people that
we had no way to reach.

1029
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,180
Sandy and Len aggreed to
step down into new roles.

1030
01:09:29,385 --> 01:09:32,287
And Don Valentine
recruited John Morgridge,

1031
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:35,288
a veteran of several high-tech
start-ups, to run Cisco.

1032
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:40,693
Morgridge's first task was to address
what he and Don Valentine saw...

1033
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:44,866
as a troubled corporate culture.

1034
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:47,867
The quarter that I arrived,
we hired a shrink.

1035
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,839
He eliminated fighting
in the open hallways.

1036
01:09:53,776 --> 01:09:56,776
Physical fighting, I mean.

1037
01:09:57,647 --> 01:10:00,282
I actually had the, uh...

1038
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:03,283
vice president of engineering deck
the sales vice president in my office!

1039
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:12,625
We really did have
a trench mentality.

1040
01:10:13,763 --> 01:10:16,763
This is not a good
big-company mentality.
Quelle surprise!

1041
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:20,001
But, on the other hand,

1042
01:10:20,002 --> 01:10:23,002
I think that
there was no one there
in that original group...

1043
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:26,139
who didn't ardently
love that company.

1044
01:10:28,678 --> 01:10:31,678
As Cisco grew,
a culture clash developed...

1045
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:35,048
between the original employees
and the new hires.

1046
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:39,018
And ultimately, this clash
centered on Sandy Lerner.

1047
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:43,590
She was definitely
a strong personality,

1048
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:46,726
and she definitely was the reason
the company existed.

1049
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:51,264
Sandy was an incredible piece
in the puzzle...

1050
01:10:53,502 --> 01:10:56,502
of getting things done right
for the customer.

1051
01:10:56,772 --> 01:10:59,772
Silicon Valley has not always
been the place where
the customer's thought of first.

1052
01:11:02,912 --> 01:11:05,912
They may, in some places,
be thought of second or third.

1053
01:11:06,115 --> 01:11:09,115
But Sandywas ensuring
that the customer
was thought of first.

1054
01:11:12,588 --> 01:11:15,588
Unfortunately, at the expense
of some of the other
major managers.

1055
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:23,363
I had very much alienated
the other people in the company,

1056
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:28,534
because, you know, other than Len,
they hadn't been there very long,

1057
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:33,072
and, you know, I saw them,
rightly or wrongly,

1058
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:37,210
as the people I was trying
to protect the customers from.

1059
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:41,214
By her own admission,
she would detonate.

1060
01:11:42,752 --> 01:11:45,752
Usually in my office.

1061
01:11:46,856 --> 01:11:49,856
At Cisco, you know,
being the only woman
and a technical woman,

1062
01:11:51,227 --> 01:11:53,328
I think I was just very,
very frightening.

1063
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:56,329
And there just
wasn't a box for me.

1064
01:11:56,332 --> 01:11:59,332
And I think that I didn't make it...

1065
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:02,869
particularly easy
for them to ignore me.

1066
01:12:03,005 --> 01:12:06,005
And I didn't make it
particularly easy for them
to find a suitable box.

1067
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,578
Um, in that, you know,

1068
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:13,579
the boxes that existed for women
at the time didn't seem to fit
what I thought I-I was doing.

1069
01:12:20,456 --> 01:12:23,456
Finally one day,

1070
01:12:24,393 --> 01:12:27,393
my assistant said
the conference room is filled...

1071
01:12:30,132 --> 01:12:33,132
with eight Cisco employees
demanding to see you.

1072
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:40,039
All of the vice presidents
of the company
were in the conference room.

1073
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,110
They walked up Sand Hill Road
and said, "Either she goes, or we go."

1074
01:12:46,315 --> 01:12:49,315
"Terminate her,
or we're quitting.

1075
01:12:49,952 --> 01:12:52,087
All of us."

1076
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:55,088
And he called me and said, uh,
"Do you want me to handle this?"

1077
01:12:56,058 --> 01:12:58,526
And I said, "No, I'll handle it."

1078
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:01,527
And Sandy was retired.

1079
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:07,367
First of all, I mean,
let's just get it out.
I was fired.

1080
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:13,573
John called me into his office.

1081
01:13:15,378 --> 01:13:18,378
He said, "You know,

1082
01:13:19,215 --> 01:13:20,815
you're now worth
so much money,

1083
01:13:20,816 --> 01:13:23,816
it really doesn't make any sense
foryou to work this hard.

1084
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,620
You know,
I think it's just a good idea...

1085
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:31,290
if you just, you know,
retire at this point."

1086
01:13:32,762 --> 01:13:35,196
I said, "But, John,
I have a lot to do here.

1087
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:38,197
I-You know, I think I have
a, you know, a place in-
in the company,

1088
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:43,338
and I-I-I don't really
want to retire right now."

1089
01:13:43,339 --> 01:13:45,473
I was... 35 years old.

1090
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:48,474
Um, and he said, "Well,

1091
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:51,911
I think today's your last day."

1092
01:13:53,382 --> 01:13:56,382
I walked to Len's office'
where Len informed me that
I must surely be mistaken.

1093
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:03,556
And I sat in Len's office
while Len went up
and talked to John.

1094
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:07,059
And, uh, came back and
walked out the door with me.

1095
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:13,933
And we never walked back in.

1096
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:21,207
You know, this idea that 45 %
of founders will be gone
in 18 months?

1097
01:14:23,412 --> 01:14:26,314
In retrospect,
that was clearly the mind-set.

1098
01:14:26,315 --> 01:14:29,315
Len and I clearly did not understand
that that was the game
that we were playing.

1099
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:33,186
You know,
the first rule of any game is
to know that you're in one.

1100
01:14:35,157 --> 01:14:38,157
It's an unpleasant thing to do,
to fire anybody.

1101
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:42,195
But it's clearly the facts of life.

1102
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:50,236
I think
each of them went away
with 170 million.

1103
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,640
I don't know
how people think of
what comes next...

1104
01:14:54,877 --> 01:14:56,845
after the first 170 million,

1105
01:14:56,846 --> 01:14:59,846
but, uh, I don't think they've
ever forgiven either of us.

1106
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:09,088
I was once asked,
did I start Cisco to make
a whole bunch of money?

1107
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:13,359
And I said, "No.
If I measured myself that way'

1108
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:16,996
I probably couldn't look at myself
in the mirror in the morning."

1109
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:20,066
Um, I don't.
I think I've been a pretty good
tool-user, and money is a tool.

1110
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:15,089
You know, technology
keeps evolving,

1111
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:18,090
and ever since
Leonardo da Vinci,
it's been evolving,

1112
01:16:20,195 --> 01:16:23,195
and it will continue to evolve
through good times and bad times.

1113
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:26,666
It will evolve.

1114
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:30,903
Venture capital
is here to stay though.

1115
01:16:41,483 --> 01:16:44,483
Well, I get my greatest
satisfaction out of thinking back
on the companies...

1116
01:16:47,022 --> 01:16:50,022
that I helped start
and helped grow.

1117
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,701
It's... nice to sit in the glow
of your adulation,

1118
01:17:03,372 --> 01:17:06,372
but... without the entrepreneurs,
you're nothing!

1119
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:11,344
You have to have these
real people with the ideas...

1120
01:17:11,914 --> 01:17:14,515
and their willingness
to commit their life.

1121
01:17:14,516 --> 01:17:16,884
I don't think,
and I would not say...

1122
01:17:16,885 --> 01:17:19,885
that Silicon Valley is the result
of good venture capitalists.

1123
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:23,191
Not at all.

1124
01:17:23,192 --> 01:17:24,759
Entrepreneurship
is the main show.

1125
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,528
Venture capital is an aid,
and sometimes people got lost-

1126
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:29,230
"We must have venture capital."

1127
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:32,231
No use having venture capital
unless you have entrepreneurs.

1128
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:35,434
If it hadn't been for
the Treybigs and Swansons,

1129
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:38,604
where would Kleiner and I
have been?

1130
01:17:42,978 --> 01:17:45,978
Without venture capital,
the future wouldn't happen
nearly as quickly.

1131
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:51,951
New companies are much better
at exploiting new technology.

1132
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:55,289
They can extend
and exploit a new idea.

1133
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:58,290
We would all have a lower
standard of living, worldwide.

1134
01:17:59,094 --> 01:18:02,030
It clearly got
the first man to the moon.

1135
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:04,899
It clearly got, you know,

1136
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,900
everything from
we're country code 1
in the telephone system to,

1137
01:18:09,004 --> 01:18:10,638
you know, the Internet.

1138
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:13,639
I think you can't ignore
the role ofventure capital.

1139
01:18:16,445 --> 01:18:19,445
You know, can you imagine,
a guy going in and talking to a banker,

1140
01:18:19,448 --> 01:18:22,448
and he says, you know,
"Look, I want to start
delivering mail by jets."

1141
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:26,919
We go into Kleiner Perkins,
we say we want to make
insulin in bacteria,

1142
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,956
and he goes, "Okay!"

1143
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:31,957
Great things don't really
come out of the status quo.

1144
01:18:33,162 --> 01:18:36,162
They come out of people
with vision and drive
to prove the difference.

1145
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:39,932
This underlying technology
was there,

1146
01:18:40,636 --> 01:18:43,636
and there was nowhere
for it to go, until, you know,

1147
01:18:45,574 --> 01:18:48,209
the venture capital
is up here, saying,

1148
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,210
"We've got some money.
Let's take a chance."

1149
01:18:56,885 --> 01:18:59,885
We need guys with new ideas
about how to do things.

1150
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:02,490
All these ideas-
You gotta get to the frontier.

1151
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,125
Do something. Build a company.

1152
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:06,661
The entrepreneurial spirit.
The entrepreneurial spirit.

1153
01:19:06,662 --> 01:19:08,896
Entrepreneurship.
Making the world go round.

1154
01:19:08,897 --> 01:19:10,732
Hard-working, visionary.

1155
01:19:10,733 --> 01:19:13,601
Change the way people work,
educate their kids.

1156
01:19:13,602 --> 01:19:16,602
And you can do it.
