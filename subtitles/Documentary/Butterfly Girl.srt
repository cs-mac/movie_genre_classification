Episode 21 The Challenger is Back

5
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,986
What?

6
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:34,706
Before your leg is recovered

7
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:35,626
Forget Yuanwudao

8
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:36,786
Forget the competition.

9
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:40,506
Even you miss this City Youth Competiton.
There'll be another.

10
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Even you have to quit Yuanwudao

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,386
At lease you have healthy legs

12
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:46,866
After graduation

13
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,480
No matter you're interpreter, 

14
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:49,506
Journalist, officer
Or any other jobs

15
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,626
At least you can walk, ran and jump.

16
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,426
It's more important.

17
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,573
But professor

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,733
I really want to fight that competition.

19
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,720
If you practice behind my back.

20
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't call me professor again.

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,746
I won't teach you Yuanwudao anymore.

22
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,480
I will leave Songbai Yuanwudao

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Okay, you need to go back and rest.

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,186
Professor.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,706
You can try and see if I really mean it.

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,973
[Fighting, Baicao
Love you, Tinghao]

27
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:10,853
Shixiong

28
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,320
Don't use me as your assistant again.

29
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,160
You are always helping Baicao at Songbai

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,226
One call, I had to drop you files.

31
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,986
When can you share some love to me?

32
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,400
Why you're like a woman?

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,373
All this whining

34
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,173
I will buy you dinner, okay?

35
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:25,920
Okay

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,906
These are the files I asked?

37
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:28,520
But, Shixiong.

38
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:32,320
Baicao can't participate the competition this year right?

39
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,040
This is for Tingyi.

40
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,040
Now she won't let me see her practicing.

41
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,453
I should do something for her.

42
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:39,146
Right.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,946
What's this?

44
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,306
Don't you know what day is it today?

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,560
I... I don't know.

46
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,693
Baicao has check out from hospital for a whole month

47
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,640
It's a little present to commemorate that

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,333
As the temperate boyfriend, you're the best!

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,066
Who is a temperate boyfriend?

50
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,013
If you dare to say that to Baicao
You'll be screwed, hear me?

51
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:04,906
Shixiong

52
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,133
Didn't you two agree be together for three months?

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
It's getting close.

54
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,026
Is she touched by you?

55
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:13,226
Are you coming official?

56
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,773
Congrats, shixiong

57
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,080
It's not that easy.

58
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,453
But since we did a month.

59
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:24,080
We'll have another month.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
And a third month

61
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,853
If that won't work

62
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:29,960
I will keep trying.

63
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,773
Right, Shixiong

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,506
How can you teach me this get real thing?

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,146
I was wrong.

66
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:56,680
I shouldn't promised brother Tinghao

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
to date with him for three months.

68
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,933
But at that time, if you didn't,

69
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,560
What else can you do?

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,013
So I must stop this.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,733
I know if I stop this,

72
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,293
Brother Tinghao will be upset.

73
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:14,493
Perhaps we'll lose him

74
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:15,720
An important friend.

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,626
But if we continue doing this,

76
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:21,013
Brother Tinghao will be hurt badly.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,480
It's unfair to him.

78
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,800
And I'll be guilty forever.

79
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,786
Well, brother Tinghao is

80
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,653
Considerate, passionate,

81
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:33,026
Careful and tender.

82
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,560
He is the best boyfriend in the world.

83
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,160
But you silly girl has a special taste.

84
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:39,813
Xiaoying
Hold on!

85
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,013
Let me choose a side!

86
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,266
I decided.

87
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:55,653
I support you to end

88
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,186
The trial date between you and brother Tinghao.

89
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,053
And I support you

90
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,373
To be with professor Chang'an!

91
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,653
Xiaoying

92
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,533
Stop nonsense.

93
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,160
Hold on. Don't argue.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,173
Don't refuse me.

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,293
Professor Chang'an

96
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,293
The way he feels about you

97
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,706
I've seen it through over these days.

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,093
But you

99
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,106
Heavy-headed girl

100
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:19,600
Your long reflex arc makes you slow

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
Luckily, I'm an acute observer.

102
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:27,933
I find that you have a special feeling for Professor Chang'an.

103
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:01,000
I...

104
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,000
Do I?

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,706
Yes.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,680
Baicao

107
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,440
You missed out on true love once.

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Don't miss out on it this time.

109
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,640
So, make a decision

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,506
I'll support you!

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,066
Slam Dunk!

118

# Whom are you waiting for #

119
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,946
# I can't see it clearly #

120
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,706
# Since my eyes are blurred with tears #

121
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,666
# If I can go to the place #

122

# where you've been #

123
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,266
# Will all my wishes #

124
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:28,666
# become too little to be noticed #

125
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,960
# If I can see the seasons #

126
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,720
Qi Baicao, listen

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,866
Forget about the three months.

128
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,080
Not one day.

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,226
I love you.

130
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:54,533
Qi Baicao

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
I wanna you be my girlfriend.

132
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:00,386
Well, you...

133
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,813
You really hope I stand by your side?

134
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,493
Of course, you must be there.

135
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,120
# Will all my dreams #

136
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:17,533
# Change with the Solar Terms #

137
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:24,746
Xiaoying

138
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:26,320
I decided.

139
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,120
I must get in this year's City Youth Competition!

140
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:39,613
This seems harder.

141
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,026
Xiaoying

142
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,560
What's wrong with you?

143
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,373
Xiaoying

144
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:46,786
What on earth happened?

145
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,693
All right
I'll say it!

146
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:54,226
Professor Chang'an told me to cancel your registration.

147
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:55,626
What?!

148
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:57,200
Lower you voice.

149
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,080
For sake of our friendship,

150
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,866
I didn't cancel it.

151
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,933
[ Receipt of City Youth Competition...Click here for registration confirmation... ]

152
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:11,880
Receipt of City Youth Competition's registration confirmation?

153
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
I think

154
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,986
Professor Chang'an worried for good reason.

155
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,293
I support his decision!

156
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,560
I also think

157
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,026
Even if you quit this year's competition,
You can join it next year!

158
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,000
Health is most important!

159
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,666
But I also feel

160
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,440
You made efforts for this qualification.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,653
And it's brother Ruobai's last wish.

162
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:37,226
So

163
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:39,933
It's for you to decide, Baicao!

164
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:54,160
This year

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
I'm in!

166
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,013
[ Welcome your participation ]

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
You signed up for it, right?

168
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:28,800
Yes.

169
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,226
Good. Qi Baicao.

170
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,066
Since you didn't listen to me at all,

171
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,586
I'll leave Songbai Budokan.

172
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,333
Professor!

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,813
I did listen to you.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,173
Except in rehabilitation time,

175
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,333
I haven't practiced behind your back in other time!

176
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,653
You know what I'm talking about.

177
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,746
But when the competition comes,

178
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:59,213
My leg will be healed!

179
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:00,666
Now

180
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,080
I can do 300 squats every day.

181
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,200
And my right knee...

182
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,200
I can do 1000 bend-and-stretches!

183
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,533
So when that day comes,

184
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,760
My leg will be healed for sure!

185
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,866
I'll be totally okay!

186
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,253
That's impossible!

187
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,786
Knee soft tissue and ligament get hurt,

188
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,240
Even if it's not serious,

189
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,013
It needs at least three months for rehabilitation.

190
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,013
What's your leg?

191
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,146
Is it made of steel?

192
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:23,680
I told you

193
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,013
Forget Yuanwudao.
Forget City Youth Competition.

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,306
You didn't listen to what I said, right?

195
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,293
But professor

196
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,493
Please trust me

197
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,666
My leg is really okay.

198
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:34,053
What if it's not?!

199
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Just because of a game,

200
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
Put your right leg at stake.

201
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,026
Is there

202
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:44,880
Stupider actions than this?

203
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,720
Professor Chang'an

204
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,800
Whatever you said,

205
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:01,973
I must get in City Youth Competition!

206
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,266
Baicao

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,746
You always want to know how my leg goes wasted, right?

208
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,306
Now, listen to my story.

209
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:24,546
My leg

210
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,933
At the very beginning

211
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,920
Was wounded slightly in the game.

212
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,573
It'll be healed after months' rest.

213
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:39,453
But every competition after that one

214
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,720
Was very important to Fengyun.

215
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,880
So I struggled to play as long as I can.

216
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:47,213
Finally, I got the championship of

217
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,573
Yuanwudao Professional League Game.

218
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:50,986
But my leg

219
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,573
Barely support me to stand up.

220
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,560
And then?

221
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,746
Why did you leave Fengyun Yuanwudao?

222
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,386
And then

223
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,373
In Fengyun's competition for the most powerful one

224
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,853
The one I trusted the most

225
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,213
Took advantage of my wound and defeated me.

226
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,253
He replaced me as the most powerful one.

227
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,506
The most powerful one is not you!

228
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:26,466
It's me!

229
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:28,653
And I...

230
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:34,800
Left Fengyun with this steel nailed leg.

231
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,826
The one you trust the most?

232
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,093
So

233
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,000
You wanna end up like me?

234
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,293
You wanna lose your leg totally,

235
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,533
End your Yuanwudao career, and

236
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,360
Be unable to fight any competitions,

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,973
Just for this competition? Do you?

238
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:56,773
Have you regretted?

239
00:14:58,546 --> 00:14:59,386
What?

240
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,600
I'm asking

241
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,466
Have you regretted?

242
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,360
If you can choose again,

243
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:12,080
When your leg was just hurt,

244
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,920
Will you give up competition

245
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:16,986
Give up the championship,

246
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:20,693
To disappoint your budokan, pals

247
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,186
and even yourself?

248
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:28,013
You won't.

249
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:29,680
Right?

250
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:35,200
Now matter how badly your leg was hurt,

251
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,373
You chose to stick it out.

252
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,266
You did your best till you got the championship, right?

253
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,666
Because it embodies your dream and hope.

254
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,080
So you won't give up on it easily.

255
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,666
Isn't it?

256
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,840
So, professor

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,573
Can you understand me?

258
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,453
I've worked hard for so long.

259
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,906
After brother Ruobai left,

260
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:14,506
It's the only dream that has supported me till now.

261
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,093
For sake of this dream

262
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,960
Brother Tinghao

263
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,453
And brother Yifeng

264
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,120
Xiaoying, Yang Rui, Xiuda

265
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,600
Pingping and Yinyin

266
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,253
They all stand by my side.

267
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,253
They all cheer for me.

268
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:33,826
I also got you, Professor Chang'an.

269
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,760
All this time

270
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:42,173
The aim that supports me to try hard

271
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,386
Is right before me.

272
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,426
How could I give up on it easily?

273
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,613
So, Professor Chang'an

274
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,946
What hurts you the most

275
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:55,946
Is not your leg wound

276
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:03,400
But betrayal of the one you trusted the most.

277
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
But I believe

278
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,000
Even if my leg is wasted for good,

279
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,640
My pals will not leave me or abandon me.

280
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,652
Forget the past

281
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,345
Now you got us

282
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:21,426
You got everyone in our Songbai.

283
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,720
We respect you.

284
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,360
We also love you.

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,400
Just like what Xiuda says

286
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,813
Because we're family.

287
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,080
Baicao...

288
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:41,826
So, professor

289
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,866
I... Please allow me

290
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:51,133
To get in the competition.

291
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:52,960
OK?

292
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:59,986
# When the heart stops lingering about the past #

293
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:06,653
# The moment when the light comes through the clouds #

294
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:13,573
# Let the love embrace this world #

295
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:19,413
# When the sun shines on the earth #

296
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,813
Please allow me

297
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,480
To get in the competition.

298
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:26,640
OK?

299
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:36,600
# Let the moment shine #

300
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:44,106
# The light from the leaves #

301
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,760
Sit down.

302
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:39,600
Stand up and try

303
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,986
The basic leg techniques of Yuanwudao.

304
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
Does it hurt?

305
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,920
Your right leg is unable to put forth any strength?

306
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,253
No.

307
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,613
It can put forth strength.

308
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,800
But when it does,

309
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:27,893
It hurts a little.

310
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,746
But just a little...

311
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,026
Remember

312
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,986
In competition, under no circumstances can you use your right leg.
You may lose.

313
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,333
But

314
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't worsen your leg injury.

315
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:49,306
Professor

316
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,053
You agree my participation?

317
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Now, I can answer the question you put forward yesterday.

318
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,213
I haven't regretted for it.

319
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,933
If faced with the same choice,

320
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:07,920
I will do as you said.

321
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,173
Professor

322
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,573
But, just because I've experienced it once.

323
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,813
So I don't wanna you experience that kind of pain.

324
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,066
But you were right.

325
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,613
To give up on it is a harder choice.

326
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,360
From now on

327
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,800
I'll guide your rehabilitation training.

328
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you, professor.

329
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,706
But listen to me

330
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,800
You must do exactly as I say.

331
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:39,946
Don't worsen your injury.

332
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Even if there is a remote possibility for that,

333
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:44,720
You'll quit at once.

334
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,773
Can you do it?

335
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,773
Yes, I'll do it!

336
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:51,746
Sit down.

337
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,480
Fan Xiaoying!

338
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,226
Brother Tinghao

339
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,880
How did you and Chang'an promise me?

340
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,280
Why did I see newspapers say that Baicao is in?

341
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,053
Where are they?

342
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,786
Again

343
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:36,933
Baicao!

344
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,320
Brother Tinghao

345
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,386
What the hell do you want?

346
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:45,200
Do you want her to lose a leg like you did?

347
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,133
Brother Tinghao
I wanted to be ready for City Youth Competition.

348
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,573
So I let Professor Chang'an train me.

349
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm asking you!

350
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:54,000
I've discussed with doctors.

351
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:56,613
After two months' rest and rehabilitation,

352
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:59,106
Basic functions of Baicao's right knee are restored.

353
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,840
We still have over one month.

354
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:04,840
Moderate training will enable her to get in the competition.

355
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:07,026
So I decided
To help her with restorative training.

356
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,413
Did you asked me about it?

357
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,333
Did you?!

358
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:14,626
What if accident happens in the competition?

359
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,306
Can you bear that responsibility?

360
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,120
Who are you to her?

361
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:19,666
Mr professor!

362
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,453
You're right.

363
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,226
Just because I'm her professor.

364
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,173
So I'll be more careful

365
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:26,493
To arrange her restorative training.

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,146
Because I experienced

367
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,293
What she's experiencing.

368
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,240
So

369
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,146
I know how much she wanna go back to the field.

370
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,813
That's more important than anything.

371
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,186
I also understand that feeling.

372
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:44,186
But it's not time for training!

373
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:46,933
I'm her boyfriend.

374
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,586
I won't allow anyone to mistreat her!

375
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,640
Baicao

376
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:55,946
Let me have a look.

377
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,746
Professor Chang'an

378
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:21,106
I want a talk with brother Tinghao.

379
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:53,693
Baicao

380
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,973
What do you want to say?

381
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:03,946
Brother Tinghao

382
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:09,813
Our agreement comes due.

383
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,560
I knew you'll say this to me.

384
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:19,493
We really can't

385
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,586
Continue cheating each other in this way.

386
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,666
You place your affection on me so wrongly.

387
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,306
It's too unfair to you!

388
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,746
And I always take you as a very, very good friend.

389
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,706
One day

390
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:35,280
You meet a girl who can love you back!

391
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,706
Is it because Chang'an?

392
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,093
Of course not.

393
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:47,240
Baicao

394
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,906
He uses his professor identity to captivate you.
He uses victories to keep your blindfolded

395
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,853
So you can't see what he really is.

396
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,853
If you continue with it,

397
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:57,053
You'll become like him.

398
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:59,000
Only think victory at the sight of competition!

399
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:01,000
Brother Tinghao

400
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,493
That's not true.

401
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:09,346
I was guilty of what I did.

402
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:14,066
Now, I don't regret for it at all.

403
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:16,480
What you did?

404
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,373
What did you do?

405
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,440
Feiyu didn't cancel your London Challenge Registration

406
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:26,200
It's me.

407
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:29,053
You?

408
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,906
Right, I did that.

409
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:36,026
If I knew he would change you into what you're,

410
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,600
I shouldn't have allowed any your competitions after that!

411
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,706
Besides

412
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,826
Singapore Trio Game

413
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,360
You all thought

414
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,186
It's a result of the fight between me and Ye Chong.

415
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,560
In fact, it's not.

416
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:50,890
Chang'an used his right leg to exchange for 

417
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,933
The entry qualification!

418
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,133
You also know

419
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,493
Mr Chenzhou only feels assured about the one within his control.

420
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,506
You were the most powerful one in Fengyun.

421
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:02,893
You're a threat.

422
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:03,986
If out of control,

423
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,533
You'll make him sleepless.

424
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,426
So, professor, please suffer a little.

425
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,613
You may not choose it.

426
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:16,253
But if you don't,

427
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,733
Anyang Songbai will disappear for good.

428
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,333
# I persuaded myself to give it up #

429
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:27,453
# Looking at your frown #

430
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,573
# licking wounds#

431
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,693
# I don't wanna put you into a dilemma #

432
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,400
This is not your old wound.

433
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:36,760
What happened?

434
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,530
None of your business!

435
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:41,266
You're hurt so badly.

436
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:42,386
Why didn't you tell us?

437
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,893
I said none of your business!

438
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,026
He used competition to entice you.

439
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:49,226
He wants you to lose yourself in City Youth Competition!

440
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,906
Brother Tinghao

441
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:54,640
Why did you change into such a person?

442
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:57,960
I didn't change.

443
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,533
You did!

444
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,226
Think

445
00:28:01,706 --> 00:28:04,133
Your obsessiveness in Japan Challenge

446
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:06,373
Is really dangerous to you and your rivals! You know?!

447
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,973
But that's not because Professor Chang'an.

448
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:09,960
It's because I...

449
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,733
Because what?

450
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,080
That's because what?

451
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,986
He lets you fight with a wounded leg.

452
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,120
It that good to you?

453
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:16,746
Qi Baicao

454
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,160
Wake up!

455
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,426
I won't allow you to fight in City Youth Competition!
I won't!

456
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:22,786
Brother Tinghao...

457
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
Brother Tinghao!

458
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,746
Let me go!

459
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,906
You can't go on practicing like this!

460
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:31,640
Let me go!

461
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:09,733
# How much I yearn to have you #

462
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:14,200
# How obstinate am I when I stick to it #

463
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,520
# I know I have it coming #

464
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,893
# I won't back off even in front of a loaded gun # 

465
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,080
Singapore Trio Game

466
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,586
You all thought

467
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:30,506
It's a result of the fight between me and Ye Chong.

468
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,920
In fact, it's not.

469
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,133
Chang'an used his right leg to exchange for 

470
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,066
The entry qualification!

471
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,720
This is not your old wound.

472
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
What happened?

473
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,053
None of your business!

474
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:51,120
# I won't be a killer in the name of love #

475
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,066
# Just a friend #

476
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,693
# I miss you in the disguise of greetings #

477
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,426
# Just a friend #

478
00:29:58,426 --> 00:30:00,906
# I turn love into a plot #

479
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:04,506
# I know how it'll end #

480
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:09,080
# But I won't give up loving you #

481
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:12,186
If you can choose again,

482
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,013
When your leg was just hurt,

483
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:18,880
Will you give up competition

484
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:20,786
Give up the championship,

485
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:24,666
To disappoint your budokan, pals

486
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,200
and even yourself?

487
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,920
You won't.

488
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:33,720
Right?

489
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:39,186
Now matter how badly your leg was hurt,

490
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:41,266
You chose to stick it out.

491
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:45,160
You did your best till you got the championship, right?

492
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,680
# Just a friend #

493
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:53,640
# How could I say it when I miss you #

494
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,146
# Just a friend #
# I use a pretext to show my tenderness to you #

495
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,053
# You don't need to feel guilty #

496
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:04,986
# Because we're just friends #

497
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,386
Brother Tinghao

498
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,893
Our agreement comes due.

499
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,880
We really can't

500
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,000
Continue cheating each other in this way.

501
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:49,813
Right leg supports, left leg attacks.

502
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:51,960
It's the only strategy you can use.

503
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:53,760
But for an old habit

504
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,346
In such a short time

505
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,386
No matter how you practice

506
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:56,413
Your left leg will never

507
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,440
Become as fast and powerful as the right one.

508
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,026
So

509
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,506
We have a new strategy.

510
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,000
Focus on defense

511
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:06,040
Wait for a chance to counter attack effectively.

512
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,586
Did you get hurt?

513
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:14,386
Thank you, professor. I'm fine.

514
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,240
You just started restorative training.

515
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,906
Don't be anxious for success.

516
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,640
Training volume can't be excessive.

517
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:33,253
And everyday, after training is over,

518
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:36,720
Remember to do muscle rehabilitation massage.

519
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,546
Remember?

520
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,586
Yes.

521
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:41,946
If the training hinders rehabilitation of leg wound,

522
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,213
It must be stopped at once.

523
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,346
Remember?

524
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,146
Yes.

525
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:52,266
Remember what I said even if you're on the field.

526
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,640
You may lose.

527
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,333
But don't worsen your leg wound.

528
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:57,226
I remembered it.

529
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:00,666
Professor

530
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,613
What do you want to say?

531
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:09,693
I remembered what you said.

532
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,613
Can you listen to my advice?

533
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:17,186
In the future

534
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,373
No matter what happens,

535
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,786
Please let me know

536
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:21,773
Let us know.

537
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,720
OK?

538
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,120
My leg is hurt.

539
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,440
You help me with rehabilitation and treatment.

540
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,253
I hope if you get hurt again,

541
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,066
You'll let us know timely.

542
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,120
No, no

543
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:43,106
I hope you will never get hurt again.

544
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,240
Professor Chang'an

545
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,853
Do you wanna go back to the field?

546
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,720
What's this?

547
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,186
Traditional Chinese medicine.

548
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,186
It helps to cure chronic illness.

549
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:35,586
Chronic illness needs consistent treatment.

550
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:37,425
So it'll be cured.

551
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:42,786
I hope my leg will be okay as soon as possible.

552
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:46,893
I also hope your leg will be fully recovered.

553
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,666
Let's do it together.

554
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,826
OK.

555
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,066
Slow down.

556
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:15,973
I'm okay.

557
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,626
I borrowed a notebook for the lessons missed during your illness.

558
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,146
Great!

559
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:23,920
I'm gonna make up for it before City Youth Competition.

560
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,653
Let me help you.
Baicao, Xiaoying

561
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:27,586
Hi

562
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,360
Baicao

563
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,506
You're back for class.

564
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:30,906
What about your injury?

565
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,493
It's healed. Thank you.

566
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,493
Really?

567
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:35,586
Yes, totally true.

568
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:37,453
An old injury should be healed already!

569
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,933
Great!

570
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,280
In this City Youth Competition,

571
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,626
Our Anyang has more hope!

572
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:42,693
Baicao

573
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:45,093
If you really meet Fang Tingyi in City Youth Competition,

574
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,466
Will you be nervous?

575
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,386
Everyone is looking forward to your ultimate confrontation!

576
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:52,506
Look!

577
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:59,186
[ Fang Tingyi VS Qi Baicao ]
[ A fight for championship! An ultimate confrontation!]

578
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,133
Look! Look!

579
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:05,933
She grabs the headlines!

580
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,240
You don't know where is your sister?!

581
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
What a brother are you!

582
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,373
Grandpa, take it easy.

583
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,186
I told Shenbo to find her.

584
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,320
He will tell me as soon as he finds her.

585
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:19,026
That kid is a real headache!

586
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:22,626
Brother

587
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,200
Any findings?

588
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:25,826
Sister Tingyi arrived in Anyang just now.

589
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,506
But she went to competitions directly.

590
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,600
You didn't tell her to come back?

591
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,640
I told her.

592
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,146
But she said she got a training and she was not free.

593
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,546
Finally, she came back.

594
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,146
How should she not be back home?!

595
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:39,226
Go

596
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:40,533
Get her back!

597
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:43,520
OK.

598
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:55,160
Girl

599
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,306
You're a grown-up now, aren't you?

600
00:36:58,053 --> 00:36:59,546
I'm gonna teach you a good lesson.

601
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:04,280
Tingyi

602
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,613
Why didn't you go back home?
Why didn't you answer the phone?

603
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:15,466
Grandpa is waiting for you.

604
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,906
Fang Tingyi!

605
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:24,626
Now if I fight with Qi Baicao,

606
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,866
Am I more powerful?

607
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,946
No matter how powerful you're,

608
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:29,520
I'm your brother.

609
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,893
How can you beat me?

610
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
You're not my brother.

611
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,080
You're my enemy's friend.

612
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:40,546
On the field

613
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,026
Enemy's friend equals to enemy.

614
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,080
Don't use your cheap affection to impair

615
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,373
My faith to be the most powerful one.

616
00:38:58,093 --> 00:38:59,106
Why did you come here?

617
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:00,520
Go back home.

618
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,280
How did you train my sister?

619
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,520
I warn you

620
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,360
Don't use your Fengyun methods to train her.

621
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,586
You also experienced our Fengyun methods.

622
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:15,986
Our training makes the most powerful one.

623
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:18,146
No one can get in the way of this goal.

624
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:19,853
So

625
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,506
Fang Tingyi won't go back with you.

626
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:25,213
It's a family issue.

627
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,493
Stay out of this.

628
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,346
Fang Tingyi, go back home!

629
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:47,413
Stop!

630
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,453
I will go back with you.

631
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,266
But first, you must answer my question.

632
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:01,013
What's that?

633
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:03,146
In this competition

634
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:05,920
Which one do you hope to be the winner?

635
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:08,773
Me or Qi Baicao?

[ Yuanwudao World City Youth Competition ]

Sayuri's Sakura Rain seems to have been advanced!

644
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:10,840
But our Xiaocaocao is more powerful.

645

646
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,106
Great!

647
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:38,866
Bravo!

648
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:41,586
Xiaocaocao, you're the best!

649
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:42,200
Awesome!

You're the most beautiful!

651
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:44,093
Bravo, Baicao!

652
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:44,640
Awesome!

653
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,040
Baicao scores!

654
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,253
Blue! Red!

00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:28,666
Again, Fang Tingyi KO her rival!

659
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,933
Five seconds?!

660
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,173
She KO her rival just in five seconds!

661
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,426
It's really awesome!

662
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,933
What's that move?

Professor

664
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:49,813
Sister Tingyi's condition seems a little abnormal.

665
00:43:49,946 --> 00:43:51,253
She seems to be obsessed.

666

Firework Kick

667
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,573
Sister Tingyi's unique skill grabs the headlines.

Brother

669
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:10,666
KO her rival in five seconds

670
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:11,773
Create a new record

671
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:12,733
Brother, look

672
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:16,120
She has replaced Baicao to be the new KO King.

673
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,306
In the past, sister Tingyi's leg technique is graceful and accurate.

674
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:28,213
Her kicks always landed on scoring parts.

675
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:29,866
But lacked some strength.

676
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:31,680
So she always got points in the final calculation.

677
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,413
Now, her Firework Kick is different from previous hammer kick.

678
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,693
Her rival is kicked down in air.

679
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,053
Strong kick.

680
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:40,320
More lethal.

681
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,133
Her rival can barely stand up.

682
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,906
Let alone continue the competition.

683
00:44:44,253 --> 00:44:46,000
Based on sister Tingyi's current strength,

684
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,586
No one except sister Enxiu can equal to her.

685
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,160
Fengyun Yuanwudao's special training is really awesome.

686
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,400
Beyond our imagination.

687
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,266
Fengyun Yuanwudao is good at

688
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:59,706
pushing the body to its limits in a short time.

689
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:01,946
If made to break through,

690
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:04,053
People will become grumpy.

691
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:07,693
And this grumpiness will bring unimaginable results.

692
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:12,173
So grandpa worries for good reason.

693
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,026
Congratulations, Baicao!

694
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:23,960
Thank you, everyone!

695
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,800
Great!

696
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,440
Here, more dishes!

697
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:28,386
Aunt

698
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:30,360
How do you think of it?

699
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,320
Yummy...

700
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,453
Auntie, take a break

701
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:33,480
We have enough dishes.

702
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,573
This much, enough?

703
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,280
Baicao

704
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:38,426
You scored well in recent competitions.

705
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:40,306
You won honor for our Anyang.

706
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:42,293
Today, we're celebrating it for Baicao.

707
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,333
It's my duty to cook more dishes!

708
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,173
Thank you, auntie.
Don't mention it.

709
00:45:47,106 --> 00:45:48,226
What are you supposed to call me?

710
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,240
Mom.

711
00:45:51,853 --> 00:45:53,173
That's right!

712
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,493
All right, help yourselves.

713
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:56,240
I got things to do.

714
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,440
Thank you, auntie...

715
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,386
You eat less!

716
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:01,333
Eat everyone!

717
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,080
Help yourself.

718
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,733
Every dish in my restaurant is yummy.

719
00:46:07,106 --> 00:46:08,120
So it is.

720
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,186
Every contestant in City Youth Competition is top notch!

721
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,666
Luckily, Baicao drew lots for Katou Sayuri and Ginyuri!

722
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,440
Familiar ones.

723
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,013
KO them with ease.

724
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:18,880
Yes.

725
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,493
Our Baicao got a good start!

726
00:46:21,693 --> 00:46:22,453
A good omen!
Yes, yes

727
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,146
Don't be happy so soon.

728
00:46:26,586 --> 00:46:29,653
Sister Tingyi drew lots for top-notch ones!

729
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:32,200
Don't know from where she got so many unique skills.

730
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,173
She KO rivals in every competition!

731
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:35,373
Right.

732
00:46:35,613 --> 00:46:36,493
Baicao

733
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:39,440
You're familiar with your rivals.

734
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,640
But don't forget

735
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:44,520
Even faced with an unfamiliar rival,

736
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,240
Sister Tingyi can win overwhelmingly!

737
00:46:46,946 --> 00:46:48,826
Even a giantess like Katou Yuri

738
00:46:48,866 --> 00:46:50,573
Was KO by her by one stroke!

739
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,800
Horrible.

740
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,213
Gosh

741
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:56,213
But is sister Tingyi the graceful moonlight goddess?

742
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,173
How could she become so forthright and tough?

743
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,840
Again, Fang Tingyi KO her rival!

744
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,666
Tingyi is coming out, come

745
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:21,560
Tingyi
Tingyi, could you give us a few minutes

746
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,013
to have an interview 

747
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:25,973
Tingyi, first congratulations on your wins!

748
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,493
This time your style is changed

749
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:30,600
Is that because you have trained in Fengyun Yuanwudao?

750
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,746
Some people say your Firework Kick is too fierce

751
00:47:32,746 --> 00:47:34,906
It has destroyed your graceful image as moonlight goddess.

752
00:47:34,906 --> 00:47:36,053
Do you have any comments?

753
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,600
Right, this time the maiden master Li Enyou didn't participate.

754
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,733
And Changhang Yuanwudao only sent Kim Minjoo

755
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,826
Do you think your odds are good?

756
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,560
Tomorrow your rival is the famous Qi Baicao

757
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,200
She is called KO King.

758
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,080
Do you think you can defeat her?

759
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,080
Qi Baicao

760
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
She has no differences with those players I defeated.

761
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:56,880
I will be the champion.

762
00:47:57,893 --> 00:48:00,373
Everyone, my sister just finished her game.

763
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:01,240
She need to rest.

764
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,986
And questions can wait till tomorrow.

765
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:05,333
Let's go.

766
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,666
Wait, Mr. Fang Tinghao.

767
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,880
Tomorrow, your sister is gonna fight Qi Baicao from Songbai

768
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,573
They're both popular candidates for the champion.
Who do you think will be the champion?

769
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:15,093
We heard you were once Qi Baicao's professor.

770
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:17,960
You took care of Baicao when she broke her leg.

771
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,013
Some people say you two's relationship is special

772
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:21,880
Now she is the rival of your sister.

773
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,760
Do you want her win your sister tomorrow?

774
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:27,773
It's hard to answer?

775
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:34,280
I hope tomorrow's competition won't happen.

776
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:36,373
Let's go.

777
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:43,186
Tomorrow

778
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:45,333
I will let everyone see

779
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:48,040
In front of Fang Tingyi

780
00:48:49,186 --> 00:48:50,680
Qi Baicao is nothing.
