1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,701
And on that point,
members of the jury, ...

2
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,460
..I rest my case.

3
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,057
HeIIo, Wanda.

4
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:33,492
Hi, Ken.

5
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,292
HeIIo, W-W-Wanda.

6
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:36,852
Ken, ...

7
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:38,812
..this is Otto.

8
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,692
HeIIo, Ken.
Wanda's told me a Iot about you.

9
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,411
Hey! Great fish!

10
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,731
A squeeze of Iemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

11
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:49,370
George back yet?

12
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,371
No, he had to g-g-go...

13
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,530
..to the b-b-b...

14
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,530
What?

15
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,451
That's quite a stutter you've got there,
Ken.

16
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,770
It's aII right, it doesn't bother me.

17
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,490
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

18
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,570
A cup of tea, Ken?

19
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,970
Y-y-y...

20
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,929
Yeah, he'd Iike one.

21
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,810
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

22
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,730
Cost him his Iife, dammit.

23
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:21,129
Hi, George.

24
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,129
HeIIo, George.

25
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:25,849
Get you a Scotch?

26
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,128
Yeah.

27
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,808
George, ...

28
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,368
..this is Otto.

29
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,448
So, ...

30
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:35,448
..you're Wanda's brother?

31
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,887
Good to be here, George.

32
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:38,808
England is a fine country.

33
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:41,088
Did she teII you what we need?

34
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,527
Something Iike that?

35
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,567
Something Iike that.

36
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,647
HeIIo, Wendy.

37
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,567
Had a good day?

38
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:06,127
I spend the morning
trying to get a waste disposal man.

39
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,486
At Iunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband...

40
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,405
..then I have to play
three rubbers with Philippa.

41
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:15,725
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

42
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,125
Oh, no!

43
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,205
Would you Iike some tea?

44
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:22,285
Yes.

45
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:24,884
I won the case.

46
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:28,084
This is the first moment
I've had to myseIf aII day.

47
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,524
HeIIo, Portia! How was the show?

48
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,924
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

49
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:38,804
- But you Iiked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

50
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,204
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

51
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,604
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

52
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:46,003
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

53
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,763
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'II do it!

54
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,203
I won the case.

55
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,083
Now this is cracked.

56
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,003
They're worth about 1 00,000 each.

57
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,843
There are 1 35 of them.

58
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,363
That makes 1 3 miIIions, my friends.

59
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,682
DoIIars or pounds?

60
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,122
Pounds, pet.

61
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:09,242
This is the big one. So...

62
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,161
OK.

63
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,161
Yeah.

64
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,561
Otto?

65
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,441
Yes?

66
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:19,601
OK?

67
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,881
What?

68
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,481
The plan.

69
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,520
Yeah. Great. No problem.

70
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,761
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

71
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,600
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah, yeah!

73
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,480
I haven't finished yet.

74
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Because the police wiII watch
aII the airports for 72 hours.

75
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,280
I know.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,640
I know.

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,399
Do you want me to g-g-get...

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,720
..a b-b-big...

79
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,960
..c-c-car?

80
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,759
Getaway?

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,239
A Iimo, OK?

82
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,159
And put diplomatic plates on it.

83
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,838
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

84
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,438
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

85
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,558
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

86
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,119
So, next week, ...

87
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,638
..we won't have to Iook for work.

88
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:09,038
And it won't have to Iook for us.

89
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:11,078
Oscar Wilde.

90
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,437
You really Iike animals, don't you, Ken?

91
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,557
What's the attraction?

92
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,997
Because you can t-t-t...

93
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:24,677
..trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

94
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,797
Shit on you?

95
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,757
Show off aII the time.

96
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:31,597
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

97
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:33,996
He said they were God's second blunder.

98
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,436
Bye, sis!

99
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,596
WeII, you teII him from me that I-I-I...

100
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,796
Bye, George.

101
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,556
If you talk to Mom, teII her I said hi.

102
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,475
- OK.
- (Don't let him touch you.)

103
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,875
One more day, and we're together.

104
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,675
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

105
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,715
I know he's insensitive.

106
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,995
He's had a hard Iife.

107
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,034
Dad used to beat him up.

108
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,554
Good.

109
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:06,475
Aaagh!

110
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,869
Anybody moves and you're dead.

111
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:00,307
Look where you're going!

112
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,107
Chauvinist pig!

113
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,346
ReaIIy, people here
just think they own the pavement.

114
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,585
That was fun.

115
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:35,505
I Iove robbing the English.

116
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,904
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

117
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,344
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

118
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,784
We didn't hit the dog.

119
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:44,424
- $20 miIIion and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

120
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:47,824
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

121
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:48,944
Shut up!

122
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:55,943
Ken.

123
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,823
Bye!

124
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,222
Let's split.

125
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:33,581
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie Iow. No celebrating.

126
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,261
No celebrating?

127
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:38,221
See you in a couple of hours.

128
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:26,097
To $20 miIIion.

129
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:27,537
To a job weII done.

130
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,497
To us.

131
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:31,377
To the best
brother and sister team since...

132
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,816
Romeo and Juliet?

133
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:36,097
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

134
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,137
What morons!

135
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,536
- I want you to know something.
- What?

136
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:42,896
Even if you were my brother,
I'd stiII want to fuck you.

137
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:44,656
Oooh!

138
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,416
Make the caII.

139
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,136
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

140
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,576
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

141
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,815
Hey!

142
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:55,056
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

143
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,776
- E Iinguine primavera...
- No. No.

144
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,895
- Una cotoletta di viteIIo.
- Make the caII, Otto.

145
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,575
Are you really Italian?

146
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:04,015
Absolutamente. Si!

147
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,935
My name is Otto. It means eight.

148
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,854
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

149
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:08,814
Bye, George.

150
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,735
The police, please.

151
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,014
Otto!

152
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,534
Yes, hello.

153
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,414
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may Iike to know...

154
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:22,494
..that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was puIIed off by Mr George Thomason.

155
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:26,573
He Iives at flat three, Kipling Mansions, ...

156
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,614
..Murray Road, London W9.

157
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:32,692
Wanda!

158
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,332
Police! Open up!

159
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,011
Come on, open up!

160
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,611
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

161
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,050
George Francis Thomason?

162
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,050
Passport, ...

163
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,329
..tickets, ...

164
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,729
..money!

165
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,968
Asshole!

166
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,368
We're rich, Wanda.

167
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:53,448
Yep?

168
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,367
I bet these weeks with me...

169
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,248
..have been
the most exciting weeks of your Iife.

170
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,808
You said it.

171
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,247
OK.

172
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:14,806
OK.

173
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,126
Disappointed!

174
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,966
Sonofabitch!

175
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,206
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

176
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:24,605
Shut up.

177
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,046
People are always
taking advantage of me!

178
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,726
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

179
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,285
What are you doing?

180
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:34,885
I'm thinking!

181
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,125
Thinking what I'II do to him.

182
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,525
I'II hang him up with piano wire...

183
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,644
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

184
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,804
Talk to who?

185
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:46,245
Talk to who?!

186
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,884
So, while instaIIing these windows, ...

187
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:52,763
..you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

188
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:53,924
That's right, sir.

189
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:56,203
Your parents can confirm this?

190
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:57,283
Yes, and his aunt, ...

191
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:59,163
..Georgina Thomason.

192
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:00,164
Good, Bartlett.

193
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,083
- Yes?

194
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,003
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

195
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,403
Thomason. A young Iady to see you.

196
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,723
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

197
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,203
No, absolutely not.

198
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,163
George!

199
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,962
Ken's got the fish food. He'II be in Iater.

200
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,482
- Thanks.
- De nada.

201
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,922
What do you think, Mr Leach?

202
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:21,602
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else wiII they come up with?

203
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,041
Oh, George!

204
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,921
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

205
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,320
That's not aIIowed in here, miss.

206
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,280
Are you OK?

207
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,721
It's aII right.

208
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,641
I don't think I can handle this.

209
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,041
I was too afraid to sleep Iast night...

210
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,360
Leave it out, Ieave it out, OK?

211
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,840
Listen, Iisten, Iisten.

212
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,200
Listen.

213
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,239
You stayed at my place.

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
We slept Iate.

215
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,479
You made me breakfast.

216
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,039
What?

217
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,599
What's he doing here?

218
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,519
He wanted to see you.

219
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,398
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

220
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,318
Do you want me to rub him out?

221
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,238
Anything, you name it.

222
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,598
I have friends making enquiries.

223
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,918
Good.

224
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,638
The jewels are very safe.

225
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,598
If I get sent down, it aII gets
handed back to cut my sentence.

226
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:30,198
Now, to cut my sentence even more, ...

227
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,958
..I could teII them who done it with me...

228
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,837
..if I wasn't very happy about everything.

229
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,317
What was the middle thing?

230
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,756
Piss off.

231
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,557
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

232
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,516
George?

233
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,476
You don't think...

234
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:57,835
Do you?

235
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:59,596
No!

236
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,435
No.

237
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,355
No!

238
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:06,796
OK.

239
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,315
- George.
- What?

240
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,954
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

241
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:16,634
Trust me.

242
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:18,994
Thank you very much.

243
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,475
Thanks a Iot. Bye.

244
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,194
Have a good day.

245
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:23,834
So?

246
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,274
He's not sure it was you.

247
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:26,234
What about you?

248
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,673
No, no, he believes me.

249
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,074
That's why he can't figure out about you.

250
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,514
Figure out what?

251
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,234
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

252
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,394
Don't er...

253
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,713
..ever, ever, ever...

254
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,593
..caII me stupid. OK?

255
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:45,272
What?

256
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,312
That's George's Iawyer.

257
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:53,232
The other guy must be the barrister.

258
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,752
So?

259
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,432
Trust me.

260
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,992
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

261
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:04,432
Excuse me.

262
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:06,391
Don't I recognise you?

263
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,911
No. No, I don't think so.

264
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:10,431
Oh.

265
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:13,310
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

266
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:15,351
Erm...

267
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,070
WeII, hardly.

268
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,910
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

269
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,150
Yes, yes, certainly.

270
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,110
Thanks.

271
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,870
I'm studying aspects of your Iegal system.

272
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,950
I'm American.

273
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,910
Oh, really?

274
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,630
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

275
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,150
What er... What brings you here?

276
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:36,109
Oh, it's a Iittle embarrassing.

277
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:37,949
I... have a friend.

278
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,230
Oh!

279
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,429
I see.

280
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:41,869
There you are.

281
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,829
I knew it!

282
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,269
You're Archie Leash.

283
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,588
Leach.

284
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,668
Right.

285
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,108
I saw you in court!

286
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:49,988
Er... two weeks ago.

287
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:51,949
The casino break-in?

288
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:53,388
You were great!

289
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:55,308
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

290
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,228
I Iove the way you er...

291
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,948
..cross-examine.

292
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,908
Oh, I really admire your work.

293
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,987
Thank you.

294
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,787
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

295
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,508
No? Fine, right.

296
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:10,667
WeII, ...

297
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,507
Thank you for this.

298
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,347
I'II treasure it.

299
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,426
Au revoir.

300
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,227
You speak French, too!

301
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:42,825
What's going on?

302
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:46,105
Whatever George decides to do,
he'II teII Leach first.

303
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:47,905
Why?

304
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,545
Because he's his Iawyer.

305
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,505
Yeah, I know that.

306
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,905
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

307
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,904
So George wiII teII him
where the diamonds are?

308
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,704
That's what I'm going to find out.

309
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:12,103
You done weII, my son.

310
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:14,583
Now, where are we going to hide it?

311
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:19,303
Very good!

312
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,222
Don't teII Wanda anything.

313
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,622
Otto might get something out of her.

314
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,582
Now...

315
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,942
George.

316
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:27,942
You are going to g-get off?

317
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:30,302
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

318
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:31,302
We'II fix it.

319
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:32,742
Now, anything on Otto?

320
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,301
No. Not yet.

321
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,261
You watch him.

322
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,141
Ken!

323
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:44,461
OK.

324
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,541
Looks Iike the police have been aII over it.

325
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,580
Let me change clothes,
then I'II help you Iook.

326
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,340
HeIIo, ...

327
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,261
..K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

328
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,460
Hey!

329
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,540
Wake up!

330
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,940
Wake up, Iimey fish!

331
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,739
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this Iawyer?

332
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,019
I don't know. I'II improvise.

333
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,619
Fucking insects!

334
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,059
I thought Englishmen didn't Iike women,
the way they talk.

335
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:15,898
No!

336
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,499
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

337
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,139
Have you got the hots for him?

338
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,538
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

339
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,818
What is this? Hump-a-Iimey week?

340
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:30,778
Otto doesn't approve.

341
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,698
Otto might get jealous.

342
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:34,978
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

343
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,338
Molto pericoloso...

344
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:46,617
Carissima.

345
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:48,617
Oh, speak it, speak it!

346
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,416
Un ossobuco milanese con piseIIi.

347
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:55,257
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

348
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,096
Dov'è Ia farmacia?

349
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,736
Yes, yes, yes!

350
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:01,976
No, no, no.

351
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,895
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

352
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:04,855
No, not here.

353
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,296
Otto, not here.

354
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:07,736
Dov'è Ia Fontana di Trevi?

355
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:08,696
Not here, Otto!

356
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,016
Erm...

357
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,095
MozzareIIa...

358
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,535
Er... Parmigiana...

359
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,655
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

360
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,575
Wanda!

361
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,614
Look what I've got, Wanda.

362
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,774
Treasure!

363
00:22:58,652 --> 00:22:59,892
Ssh!

364
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:15,931
Aaagh!

365
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,171
Ooh!

366
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:18,811
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

367
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:21,211
I thought it was the police again.

368
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,130
Isn't it horrible about George?

369
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,491
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

370
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:27,931
- Shit.

371
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,810
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

372
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,611
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

373
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,290
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

374
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:43,769
Isn't it terrible about George?

375
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,330
When I find the bastard who squealed!

376
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,849
I Iove that man!

377
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:51,249
What are you d-d-doing here?

378
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,369
What am I doing here?

379
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,248
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

380
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,529
Sh...

381
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,968
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

382
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,928
I've got to speak to you.

383
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:07,288
Are you OK, now, sis?

384
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:10,647
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- CaII me if you need me.

385
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,967
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

386
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,887
Something f-f-funny is going on.

387
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,327
Oh dear, oh dear.

388
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,727
You don't know why you're excited.

389
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,167
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

390
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:26,446
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

391
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,926
Isn't it time you faced facts?

392
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,326
Come on!

393
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:33,566
You're a very attractive man.

394
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:34,686
You're smart.

395
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,606
You've got wonderful bones, ...

396
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:39,366
..great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

397
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:40,445
Wh-wh-wh...

398
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,365
We could have a Iot of fun together.

399
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:45,166
I think we'd be really good for each other.

400
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:46,965
What do you say?

401
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,006
You must be j-j-j...

402
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,005
May I kiss you, Ken?

403
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,445
No, you fucking can't!

404
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,364
Just a peck! No tongue!

405
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:55,324
No, no!

406
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,045
Ken! Ken!

407
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,324
Ken!

408
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:04,924
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

409
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,524
OK, no, Iook.

410
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:07,803
I'm sorry.

411
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:09,724
I've handled this badly.

412
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:12,124
Look, the physical side can wait.

413
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,244
You need time.

414
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:18,003
WiII you think about it?

415
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,002
Oh, my God.

416
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,841
Oh, my God!

417
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,481
Ken!

418
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,601
Somebody just caIIed!

419
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,521
They said that the police...

420
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:52,921
No, that the Ioot
is in a garage in Fulham.

421
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,840
You and I have to go get it now.

422
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,240
We have to move it
before the police find it.

423
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,681
No, no, no...

424
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,601
- What?
- It's aII right!

425
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,520
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge...

426
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
George...

427
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,400
M-m-m...

428
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
..moved...

429
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
George moved the Ioot?!

430
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,960
Yes.

431
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,600
Where did he move it, Ken?

432
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,559
Where did he move it?!

433
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,400
C-c-c...

434
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,319
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

435
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:30,879
It's in...

436
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,719
Don't teII me.

437
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,198
It's better that you don't teII me.

438
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,757
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

439
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,637
Otto....

440
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:49,957
..tried to k-k-k...

441
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:51,517
..kiss me.

442
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,237
I thought he might.

443
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,917
No.

444
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,077
Nothing, no marks at aII.

445
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
But it is a safety deposit box key?

446
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,677
Yes, but there are miIIions of them, ...

447
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,796
..hotels, banks, offices.

448
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:08,755
Sorry.

449
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,236
Thank you.

450
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:12,036
(Fuck!)

451
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,394
That's him.

452
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,314
That's him, Inspector.

453
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:34,075
He's the one
who tried to murder my dogs.

454
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:53,033
Davidson!

455
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:56,833
An American Iegal student
wants to see me for a moment.

456
00:27:56,872 --> 00:27:59,273
- What time is Sir John due?
- 1 2.30, sir.

457
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,593
Right.

458
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,231
Come in!

459
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,152
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

460
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,951
Am I interrupting?

461
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,511
Absolutely not.

462
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:18,872
ReaIIy?

463
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,871
ReaIIy. Delighted to see you.

464
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,192
HeIIo.

465
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:25,911
So.

466
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,071
This is the place.

467
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:29,990
- This is it.
- Very nice.

468
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,151
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

469
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,271
ReaIIy, so much to know,

470
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,190
Everybody wears these. Do you?

471
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,470
- Oh, ridiculous!

472
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,429
WeII, erm...

473
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:45,830
..I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

474
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,790
I'm sorry.

475
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,190
But until then,
I'm aII yours, as they say.

476
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,629
I just have a couple of questions.

477
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,469
I'm having a Iittle problem...

478
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:57,509
..understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

479
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,589
What exactly is the committal?

480
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:02,149
Ah. Interesting.

481
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,109
BasicaIIy,
it's a preliminary investigation...

482
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:07,908
..where the prosecution
presents evidence...

483
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,309
..that the accused has a case to answer.

484
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:12,228
That's what it says in the book.

485
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:15,387
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

486
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,907
Right.

487
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:19,907
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

488
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,148
Yes.

489
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:23,067
George Thomason?

490
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,187
Yes. Do you know him?

491
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:28,067
I'm defending him.

492
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,986
What are you talking about?

493
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,266
I'm his barrister, his Iawyer.

494
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,066
That's so great!

495
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:38,626
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

496
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,226
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

497
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:42,946
Thank you.

498
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:45,026
He's sure to get off now.

499
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,066
Wow!

500
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,666
I can watch you work now!

501
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,025
PIease.

502
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:54,465
Amazing.

503
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:55,425
WeII, anyway.

504
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,305
At the committal,
George would then plead...

505
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:00,225
Not guilty.

506
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:01,584
ReaIIy?

507
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:04,304
The evidence is Iargely circumstantial.

508
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,944
But wasn't there an identification?

509
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:08,864
True, but a very elderly Iady.

510
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:11,304
I think they've got the wrong man.

511
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:14,624
You don't think he did it?

512
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:15,584
No.

513
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,983
Let's just say, for argument's sake, ...

514
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,903
..that you did think he did it.

515
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,983
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to Iight.

516
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:24,223
Right, right.

517
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,183
You would then advise him
to plead guilty, ...

518
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,743
..and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

519
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:34,262
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

520
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:37,662
TheoreticaIIy, yes, yes.

521
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:38,622
Oh, of course.

522
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:40,302
Erm. WeII er...

523
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,141
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

524
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,262
Wanda.

525
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,622
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

526
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,981
WeII, Wanda, there are three...

527
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:57,822
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

528
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,061
Yes.

529
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,261
Oh, my God.

530
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,941
What?

531
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,061
You're his alibi.

532
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,941
I can't talk to you!

533
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,420
Why not?

534
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,821
My dear Iady, you're a defence witness!

535
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:12,220
I'm sorry, I must ask you to Ieave.

536
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,660
What did I say?

537
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,540
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

538
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,459
Everybody does it in America.

539
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,379
Not in England, it's forbidden.

540
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,780
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

541
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm sorry. PIease.

542
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,539
Oh, Archie.

543
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,378
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

544
00:31:38,618 --> 00:31:40,418
Come on, you know!

545
00:31:41,978 --> 00:31:44,538
You knew the minute I walked in here.

546
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:47,817
I want you.

547
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,898
What?

548
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,817
(intercom buzzes)

549
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,417
- HeIIo?
- Sir John is here.

550
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,857
Show him in, please.

551
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,657
Make Iove with me.

552
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,217
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

553
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,896
- WiII you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

554
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:07,017
Bye, Uncle.

555
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:12,456
Hi!

556
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:24,936
(rousing music)

557
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,414
He's pleading not guilty...

558
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,815
..so you're safe until the trial.

559
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,575
Leach doesn't think he did it.

560
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,014
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key, ...

561
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:43,534
..but only George knows where it is.

562
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,734
Thank you, Wanda(!)

563
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:50,614
What have you found out?

564
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:52,053
Not a Iot.

565
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,453
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

566
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:55,893
I know that!

567
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,334
So nothing, huh?

568
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:58,573
Nix.

569
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:00,493
Zip.

570
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:02,053
Diddly.

571
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,533
Bupkiss.

572
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:06,853
Niente.

573
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,692
Oh, it's too big!

574
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:15,092
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

575
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:17,492
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

576
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:18,931
No! Absolutely not!

577
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:21,692
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

578
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:23,651
Do shut up, Portia!

579
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,091
AII I get, aII day,
is people complaining to me.

580
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:28,491
Oh dear.

581
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:38,371
Ecco I'uomo.

582
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,330
Ooh, Ie due cupole grandi
deIIa cattedrale di Milano.

583
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:43,366
Benito Mussolini!

584
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,806
Dov'è il Vaticano?

585
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,245
# Volare

586
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,604
# Oh-oh

587
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:17,204
# E cantare

588
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,564
# Oh-oh...

589
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:33,003
Archie, I want you to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

590
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,563
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd Iisten to me.

591
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,723
I want you to speak to Portia.

592
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:41,122
I'II speak to her in the morning.

593
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,922
Goodnight, Archie.

594
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:45,323
Goodnight, Archie!

595
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,202
Goodnight, Wanda.

596
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:49,522
Goodnight, who?

597
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:53,562
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow...

598
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,001
..with some Iousy old hag.

599
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:58,441
Are you George Francis Thomason...

600
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:01,761
..of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue, ...

601
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,321
..London W9?

602
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:05,601
Yes, sir.

603
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:08,081
The charge is one of armed robbery.

604
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,881
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

605
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:13,161
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

606
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,160
That is correct, 6.2.

607
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,480
Here are the statements,
aII to be fuIIy bound, please.

608
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,520
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

609
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,920
You are committed to stand trial...

610
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,280
..at the Central Criminal Court.

611
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:30,199
There is some urgency about this case.

612
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,639
The main witness, Mrs Coady, ...

613
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:35,199
..is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

614
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,758
Is there any possibility
that this case...

615
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,718
..might be put down for an early trial?

616
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:44,118
That is for the OId Bailey Iisting officer.

617
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,918
Take him down to the ceII, please, officer.

618
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:07,636
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

619
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:10,037
You Iook great. I Iove your hair.

620
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:10,997
Got time for a coffee?

621
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:13,397
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

622
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,316
Why did he give you this?

623
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,236
Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.

624
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,796
Does he want you to send her flowers?

625
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:21,075
Do her shopping?

626
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,516
Show her a good time?

627
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,076
Rub her out?

628
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:29,516
He wants you to rub her out?

629
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:32,595
He's going to kiII her!

630
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,635
Fuck off, or I'II kiII you.

631
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:39,954
Limey fruits!

632
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:44,114
So the old Iady wiII
m-meet with an accident?

633
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:46,354
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

634
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,874
What's so funny?

635
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:52,954
Nothing.
Just that wasting old Iadies isn't nice.

636
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:55,993
WeII, it's better than b-buggering people.

637
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:59,633
I bet you pound 1 you don't kiII her.

638
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:01,874
AII right.

639
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:03,353
AII right.

640
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:06,193
I Iove watching your ass when you walk.

641
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:08,313
Is that beautiful or what?

642
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:10,873
Don't go near him!

643
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,473
He's mine!

644
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,312
pound 1 says you won't kiII her!

645
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,112
When could you Iook at it?

646
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:23,312
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

647
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:26,352
I'II Iook at it then
and caII you on Saturday.

648
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:29,072
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

649
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:30,191
Hi.

650
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,591
I know we're not aIIowed to talk.

651
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:34,032
Give me a caII.

652
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:35,431
I can't.

653
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,391
PIease?

654
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,551
We're not aIIowed to speak.

655
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,551
We don't have to.

656
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,830
I don't want you for your conversation.

657
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,551
I'd Iove to...

658
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,509
- What happened?
- Got a date, Friday.

659
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,669
Look here!

660
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:24,507
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

661
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,468
My dogs wiII be having their nap.

662
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:27,988
Nice doggy.

663
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:30,307
Nice... doggy.

664
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:49,027
Otto, what are you doing?

665
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:51,426
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

666
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,346
It focuses your aggression.

667
00:39:53,346 --> 00:39:56,225
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

668
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:58,506
What kind of Buddhism is this?

669
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:04,346
Asshole!

670
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:07,745
It's an early Tantric meditation...

671
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,186
What is this?

672
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:12,624
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

673
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:15,344
WeII, we're ready now, at Iast.

674
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:17,824
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

675
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:20,704
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- MarveIIous.

676
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:22,104
Be good.

677
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,904
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

678
00:40:25,984 --> 00:40:27,823
Cordial? Courteous?

679
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:29,464
Supportive? What?

680
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:32,264
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

681
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:35,944
So, friendly might include actual er...

682
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:38,103
..what, penetration?

683
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,023
I don't need your jealousy now.

684
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,463
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

685
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:44,543
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

686
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:54,823
What about my tits?

687
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:56,341
Does he get to handle them?

688
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:59,222
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'II stand by that.

689
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:00,662
Nuzzling?

690
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:03,062
I think $20 miIIion is worth a nuzzle.

691
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:04,021
80% chance there.

692
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:06,861
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

693
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:10,262
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

694
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,701
One thing, though.

695
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:13,981
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

696
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,740
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

697
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,221
Aren't we going, then?

698
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,221
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

699
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,180
Hurry up

700
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,258
Hi.

701
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:58,738
Do you despise me?

702
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:05,898
No, that's not a word that Ieaps to mind.

703
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:08,297
Can I stay, then?

704
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:15,137
Of course. Look, ...

705
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:17,576
- Wanda...
- I know.

706
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,016
Your wife's coming back.

707
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,417
No, it's not her. She'II be hours.

708
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,337
It's about what I said to you.

709
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:25,256
It is aII right for us to speak.

710
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:26,216
It is?

711
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:28,895
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

712
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:30,775
Oh.

713
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,455
Oh, fine.

714
00:42:32,455 --> 00:42:34,856
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

715
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,695
Oh, but they won't.

716
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,775
Sorry if I seem...

717
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,335
..pompous.

718
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:49,534
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

719
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,774
No.

720
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:56,414
Not yet.

721
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,015
I'm thirsty.

722
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:02,694
What shaII I get you?

723
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:05,494
Whisky.

724
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:12,733
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl...

725
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:15,173
..I have ever seen...

726
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,013
..in my entire Iife.

727
00:43:20,452 --> 00:43:22,173
Get me my drink.

728
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,011
Oh, Archie.

729
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:49,331
Mm, Archie.

730
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,730
So.

731
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,170
If George decides to change his plea, ...

732
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,570
..he'd teII you
where the Ioot is first, wouldn't he?

733
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,890
Mm?

734
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,489
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial, OK?

735
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,969
I know. I just meant theoreticaIIy.

736
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,489
Kiss me there.

737
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,169
Oh. TheoreticaIIy.

738
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,408
Erm.

739
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,728
..to his Iegal representative...

740
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:34,848
What's the matter?

741
00:44:34,848 --> 00:44:36,768
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

742
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:38,007
Ooh!

743
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:41,087
Aah!

744
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,527
What? What, darling?

745
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:44,927
- You're getting me hot!
- Sorry.

746
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,367
I need something to drink.

747
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,807
Something cold?

748
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,247
Maybe in the fridge?

749
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:50,207
Champagne?

750
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,967
Oh, my favourite.

751
00:44:53,086 --> 00:44:54,727
Don't go away.

752
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:58,926
Je reviens!

753
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:10,366
What are you doing here?

754
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:12,766
- Relax!
- Get the fuck out of here!

755
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:16,005
- Your moaning worried me.
- I was faking it, stupid!

756
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,565
Don't ever caII me stupid.

757
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:19,964
- And I'm not jealous.
- Then Ieave!

758
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,165
OK!

759
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,205
It's a nice place.

760
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,684
Don't touch his dick!

761
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:29,965
His wife, his wife!

762
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,364
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

763
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:41,724
God, there isn't any ice.

764
00:45:50,683 --> 00:45:52,162
Champagne!

765
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:53,922
Aaagh!

766
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,842
What's the matter?

767
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,762
What are you doing?

768
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:02,682
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

769
00:46:02,682 --> 00:46:05,001
Erm... let me pour you a glass.

770
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:07,481
Whose is the car?

771
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:08,881
The car?

772
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:10,762
BIocking the drive?

773
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:12,282
There you are, dear. Cheers.

774
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:14,201
Nice to see you again.

775
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:15,161
How was the opera?

776
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:18,041
- Finished early, did it?
- Whose car is it?

777
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,321
Mine.

778
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:20,920
It's a beauty, isn't it?

779
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,400
Where did I Ieave my drink, Archie?

780
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,841
Who is this?

781
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,640
Don't you know?

782
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,080
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

783
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,600
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

784
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:34,840
- I'm... with the CIA.
- The CIA?

785
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,280
That's correct, ma'am.

786
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,000
I was er...
just teIIing your husband...

787
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,680
..before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

788
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:46,679
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

789
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,719
We're debriefing him as of now...

790
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:50,679
..and we're just er...

791
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:53,279
..checking aII the houses in the area.

792
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:55,478
- For what?
- For KGB.

793
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,879
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

794
00:46:57,879 --> 00:46:59,799
No er... No, not now.

795
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,679
We er...

796
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,358
We just want to keep everyone informed.

797
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:06,518
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

798
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,437
Sorry to have troubled you...

799
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:09,878
Keep everyone informed?

800
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:11,798
So there's no panic, ma'am.

801
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:13,238
But isn't it a secret?

802
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:15,157
You've no idea how secret.

803
00:47:15,157 --> 00:47:17,637
WeII, why are you teIIing everyone?

804
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:19,917
It's a smoke screen?

805
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:21,278
What?!

806
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:22,357
Double bluff.

807
00:47:22,357 --> 00:47:25,516
You obviously know nothing
about inteIIigence work.

808
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:28,396
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

809
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:32,076
My father was in the Secret Service,
Mr Manfredjen St John.

810
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,916
I know perfectly weII
you don't keep the public informed...

811
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:38,955
..when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

812
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,116
Oh, you don't, huh(?)

813
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,315
Not unless you're
congenitaIIy insane or stupid, no.

814
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:46,836
Don't caII me stupid.

815
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:49,076
Why on earth not?

816
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:52,595
Oh, you English are so superior,
aren't you?

817
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:56,434
Do you know where you'd be...

818
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:58,835
..without us,
the old US of A to protect you?

819
00:47:58,835 --> 00:47:59,795
I'II teII you.

820
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:03,514
The smaIIest fucking province
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

821
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,394
So don't caII me stupid, Iady.

822
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:07,473
Just thank me.

823
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:09,874
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us(!)

824
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:12,754
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be speaking German!

825
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:14,194
# Deutschland, Deutschland

826
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:15,753
# Über alles

827
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,953
He's covering for me.
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

828
00:48:19,953 --> 00:48:22,353
Necklace. I'II think of something.

829
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:24,753
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself, darling.

830
00:48:24,753 --> 00:48:28,232
- Who was that shouting?
- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

831
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,512
Archie, who on earth...

832
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:31,472
I don't know. He...

833
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,873
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

834
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:35,192
What?!

835
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,752
Let's go to the pub.

836
00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:38,192
Would you Iike to, Portia?

837
00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:39,632
We haven't been for 1 5 years!

838
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,551
Portia could see it now.

839
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,511
Honestly, Archie!

840
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:43,471
Aaagh!

841
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,392
What on earth is the matter?

842
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,271
I thought the picture was faIIing off.

843
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:49,192
WiII you puII yourseIf together?!

844
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,632
What's this?

845
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:52,951
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

846
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:53,991
What was that?

847
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:55,911
- A kind of necklace.
- Aah!

848
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:56,871
What's going on?

849
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,670
Nothing. Let's go.

850
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,750
Can I see that?

851
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,791
- What?
- In your hand.

852
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,591
Your other hand.

853
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,990
Portia, go to your room.

854
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,430
Aren't we going out?

855
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,870
I can explain. I Ieft...

856
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,830
Now!

857
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,229
- They sent a new girl...
- Oh, Archie.

858
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:14,150
No, she's Canadian...

859
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,149
It's Iovely. Thank you.

860
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,630
It's even got a W for Wendy.

861
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,029
Oh, I'm so glad you Iike it.

862
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:28,349
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

863
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:35,228
Oh, Archie. This isn't Iike you.

864
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:44,948
Are you fucking crazy?!

865
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:48,227
Hey, I saved your ass.

866
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:51,108
I had him right where I wanted him,
you asshole!

867
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:53,507
I give you
one fucking thing to!

868
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:56,186
You had to drive me and shut up!

869
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:57,347
Oh, relax!

870
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:06,826
HeIIo.

871
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:09,306
Hold on.

872
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:10,946
It's for you.

873
00:50:12,225 --> 00:50:13,546
HeIIo.

874
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:18,025
Not at the moment, no.

875
00:50:20,865 --> 00:50:24,305
Yes, weII, I'm not quite sure
when I can get hold of that.

876
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:28,065
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

877
00:50:28,065 --> 00:50:30,144
Yes. As soon as possible.

878
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:34,144
WeII, that would be very nice, obviously.

879
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:36,224
So. Erm...

880
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:37,665
See you soon, I hope.

881
00:50:37,665 --> 00:50:39,184
Bye, Frank.

882
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:44,983
Calm down. Calm down!

883
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,143
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

884
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:55,543
Come here!

885
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:57,143
SmeII. SmeII!

886
00:50:57,463 --> 00:50:59,382
SmeII, Maggie, smeII.

887
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:02,822
KiII, kiII!

888
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,463
KiII!

889
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,143
KiII!

890
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,062
KiII!

891
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,380
We therefore
commit its body to the ground.

892
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,340
Earth to earth.

893
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,021
Ashes to ashes.

894
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,860
Dust to dust.

895
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,900
# Miserere Dominus

896
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:47,259
# Miserere Dominus

897
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,179
# Canis mortuus est...

898
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:58,379
HeIIo, honey.

899
00:51:58,379 --> 00:51:59,819
What happened?

900
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,378
N-n-nothing.

901
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:03,178
What's that?

902
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:04,138
Er...

903
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:05,579
Not Granny?

904
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:06,539
Not yet.

905
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:08,578
Oh. Who is it for, then?

906
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:09,898
A f-f-f...

907
00:52:09,898 --> 00:52:11,698
A fish? Frenchman?

908
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:14,218
- A phone operator?
- Friend.

909
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:16,137
Oh, a four-Iegged one? (laughs)

910
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:17,578
Where's my sister?

911
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:19,018
She's in the b-b-b...

912
00:52:19,018 --> 00:52:20,458
Thank you.

913
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:21,418
Lavatory.

914
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:22,737
Wanda!

915
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:25,737
Anything?

916
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:27,177
What? No?

917
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,097
(shouts) Why are you here?

918
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:31,017
I'm here because I'm bored!

919
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:34,697
Bored, wandering around
this awful city, shoving George's pic...

920
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:40,536
Talking to a Iot of snotty, stuck-up,
inteIIectuaIIy inferior British faggots.

921
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:45,536
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of Iife in this country!

922
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,655
Standing there with their hair clenched...

923
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:53,096
..counting the seconds
tiII the weekend, ...

924
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:55,855
..so they can dress up
Iike baIIerinas...

925
00:52:56,455 --> 00:52:58,375
..at the flat at four...

926
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,935
2B, Saint...

927
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:03,135
To be honest, I er... hate them.

928
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,615
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking lawyer...

929
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:11,894
So fucking superior
with those phoney accents.

930
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,173
Not you, Ken.
You've got a beautiful voice...

931
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:16,894
..when it works.

932
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,134
Sonofabitch!

933
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:27,093
So er...
Want to have some Iunch?

934
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:28,612
Have you heard from him?

935
00:53:28,612 --> 00:53:30,373
- Who?
- Archie.

936
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:32,933
No, I have to finish my hair!

937
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:33,893
Nothing?

938
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:35,333
OK, I'm out of here!

939
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,213
No plans to see him?

940
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:38,212
No.

941
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:39,813
OK, bye, bro!

942
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:42,132
Bye, Wanda!

943
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:45,932
Oh, sorry.

944
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,852
- What?!
- It wasn't theirs to seII.

945
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:53,092
A old Iady gave it to them to engrave.

946
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:55,771
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

947
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,371
- That's their problem.
- No. LegaIIy...

948
00:53:58,371 --> 00:53:59,331
You paid for it!

949
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:02,690
They accept their mistake
and they're offering you this.

950
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,610
It's much more valuable.

951
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,491
I adore this
and you want me to give it back...

952
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,890
- I don't want...
- They can't have it.

953
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:10,850
- Wendy.
- No. No!

954
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,290
- Wendy!
- NO!

955
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,210
TeII them they can't have it!

956
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,410
You're the bloody barrister!

957
00:54:49,448 --> 00:54:51,248
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

958
00:54:52,807 --> 00:54:54,967
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

959
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:57,567
It's just beautiful.

960
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,247
Oh, my God, Iook!

961
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:06,006
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

962
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:07,686
Isn't it wonderful?

963
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:09,127
Whose is it?

964
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:11,527
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

965
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:13,366
And where are they?

966
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,886
Hong Kong.

967
00:55:14,886 --> 00:55:16,206
Ah so.

968
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,006
Gone for weeks.

969
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:20,486
Nice rug, Archie.

970
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,406
May I?

971
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:27,845
Archie, what are you doing?

972
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:29,686
The polka, I think.

973
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,085
You make me feel free!

974
00:55:35,525 --> 00:55:36,804
Free?

975
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:40,084
Do you have any idea
what it's Iike being English?

976
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,084
Being so correct aII the time?

977
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:46,684
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

978
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:51,364
Asking someone, 'Are you married?'...

979
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,283
..and hearing, 'My wife Ieft me.'

980
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,883
Or saying,
'Do you have children?'...

981
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:59,044
..and hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday.'

982
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,923
Wanda, we're aII terrified
of embarrassment.

983
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,043
That's why we're so... dead.

984
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:09,403
Most of my friends are dead.

985
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:12,322
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

986
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:15,482
But you're alive, God bless you.

987
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:18,442
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with aII this.

988
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:22,322
I want to make Iove with you, Wanda.

989
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:24,122
I'm a good Iover.

990
00:56:24,122 --> 00:56:27,241
At Ieast, I used to be
in the early 1 4th century.

991
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:31,161
Can we go to bed?

992
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:37,401
Yeah.

993
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,401
Hang on!

994
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,600
Mind your head.

995
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,280
Agh! Aagh!

996
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:47,320
Aaagh! Aaagh!

997
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,480
I think I Iove you, Wanda.

998
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh, Archie.

999
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,319
Can I ask you a question?

1000
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:56,279
Anything.

1001
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,080
Where's my Iocket?

1002
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,640
I couldn't get it.

1003
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,920
What?

1004
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:02,999
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1005
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:04,919
I got you this instead.

1006
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:06,598
Do you Iike it?

1007
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:09,198
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1008
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,718
What's the matter? Why?

1009
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:15,199
My mother gave it to me...

1010
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,919
..on her death... bed.

1011
00:57:20,757 --> 00:57:22,397
Oh, I'm sorry.

1012
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:24,118
AII right, darling.

1013
00:57:24,118 --> 00:57:25,558
I'II get it for you.

1014
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:26,518
You promise?

1015
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:27,957
I'II think of something.

1016
00:57:27,957 --> 00:57:30,357
Sex is very, very difficult for me...

1017
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:33,317
..with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

1018
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:36,316
I promise I'II get it. OK?

1019
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:39,117
Ooh! I Iove you, Archie.

1020
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,476
I've Ioved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

1021
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:48,795
What was that?

1022
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:50,356
What?

1023
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:53,395
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

1024
00:57:53,395 --> 00:57:54,595
No.

1025
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:56,755
He's no idea?

1026
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:58,755
He doesn't have a clue.

1027
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,435
What?

1028
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:02,075
He is so dumb...

1029
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:03,035
ReaIIy?

1030
00:58:03,035 --> 00:58:06,475
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where LincoIn Iived.

1031
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:13,035
Those terrible Iies
he told about the CIA!

1032
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:15,514
So painful!

1033
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:18,395
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia, ...

1034
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:21,394
..he said,
'Why did they name her after a car?'

1035
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:28,154
I Iove the way you Iaugh!

1036
00:58:28,473 --> 00:58:30,553
I Iove you, you're funny.

1037
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:34,314
How come a girl as bright as you...

1038
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:37,593
..can have a brother who's so...

1039
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:39,512
Don't caII me stupid.

1040
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:42,073
Jesus Christ!

1041
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,632
Ouch! Otto!

1042
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:52,912
Come on!

1043
00:58:53,432 --> 00:58:55,512
I'II deal with you Iater!

1044
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:58,232
What have you done with her?

1045
00:58:58,232 --> 00:59:01,111
- She's aII right!
Otto!

1046
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:02,791
Now, apologise.

1047
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:04,311
What?

1048
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:07,831
Shit!

1049
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:09,910
Are you totaIIy deranged?

1050
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,751
You pompous, ...

1051
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:19,590
..stuck-up, snot-nosed, ...

1052
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,990
..English, giant twerp, ...

1053
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,910
..scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

1054
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:27,989
How very interesting.

1055
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:30,390
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1056
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,709
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1057
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:34,469
Now, apologise!

1058
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:36,509
What? Me to you(?)

1059
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:42,909
Apologise.

1060
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:45,749
AII right, I apologise.

1061
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,188
You're really sorry?

1062
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:48,628
I'm really, really sorry.

1063
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,709
I apologise unreservedly.

1064
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:52,467
You take it back?

1065
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:55,348
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1066
00:59:55,348 --> 00:59:58,588
The imputation was totally
without basis in fact, ...

1067
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:01,107
..and was in no way fair comment.

1068
01:00:01,107 --> 01:00:03,507
It was motivated purely by malice.

1069
01:00:03,507 --> 01:00:05,428
I deeply regret any distress...

1070
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:08,307
..my comments
may have caused you or your family.

1071
01:00:08,307 --> 01:00:10,227
I hereby undertake not repeat...

1072
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:13,147
..any such slander
at any time in the future.

1073
01:00:15,986 --> 01:00:17,187
OK.

1074
01:01:17,783 --> 01:01:19,583
# Miserere Dominus

1075
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:23,902
# Miserere Dominus

1076
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:29,822
# Canis mortuus est...

1077
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:33,342
You said you Ioved him!

1078
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:36,341
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

1079
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:38,541
A. Wanda was Iying.

1080
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:40,541
Wanda was teIIing the truth.

1081
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,901
Which one are you going to pick?

1082
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,380
What was the first one?

1083
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,301
You said you were not seeing him!

1084
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:48,701
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1085
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:51,100
I was dealing with something delicate.

1086
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,500
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

1087
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,379
He knows where the Ioot is
and if you'II be arrested.

1088
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,780
You Iope in
Iike Rambo without a jockstrap...

1089
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,700
..and dangle him from a window!

1090
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,620
Now, was that smart?!

1091
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,260
Was it shrewd?

1092
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:07,179
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1093
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,779
Don't caII me stupid.

1094
01:02:10,779 --> 01:02:11,739
Oh, right!

1095
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,619
To caII you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

1096
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:17,018
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1097
01:02:17,018 --> 01:02:19,418
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1098
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:22,498
You think you're an inteIIectual,
don't you, ape?

1099
01:02:23,259 --> 01:02:25,178
Apes don't read philosophy.

1100
01:02:25,178 --> 01:02:28,058
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

1101
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:31,897
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

1102
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:34,017
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1103
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:36,697
The central message of Buddhism...

1104
01:02:36,697 --> 01:02:39,577
- ..is not every man for himself.
- You read...

1105
01:02:39,577 --> 01:02:42,737
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

1106
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:45,337
Those are mistakes. I Iooked 'em up.

1107
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:47,656
Now. You have just assaulted...

1108
01:02:47,737 --> 01:02:51,297
..the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

1109
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:53,976
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

1110
01:02:53,976 --> 01:02:56,255
What would an inteIIectual do?

1111
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,735
What would PIato do?

1112
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,056
Pardon me?

1113
01:03:05,495 --> 01:03:06,455
Apolo...

1114
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:07,735
What?

1115
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:10,655
Right!

1116
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,735
I'm sorry.

1117
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:15,335
No.

1118
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:16,535
Not to me.

1119
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:17,974
To Archie.

1120
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:20,334
And make it good, or we're dead.

1121
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:29,254
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

1122
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:31,893
Fuck you!

1123
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:34,733
I'm s...

1124
01:03:35,254 --> 01:03:37,093
I'm very, very s...

1125
01:03:37,653 --> 01:03:39,093
I'm so...

1126
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:40,533
..very s...

1127
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:42,213
Very, very s...

1128
01:03:56,853 --> 01:03:58,452
Very, very...

1129
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:00,252
..ssfff...

1130
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:09,928
Ugh!

1131
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:12,007
HeIIo, Mr Burglar!

1132
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:13,767
Going somewhere?

1133
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:15,687
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1134
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,607
I'II teach you a Iesson.

1135
01:05:17,607 --> 01:05:19,967
He's a very good friend of mine.

1136
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:21,447
Otto! Otto!

1137
01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:25,046
He'II be very pleased with me
when he finds you aII tied up...

1138
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:27,446
..and ready for the police!

1139
01:05:28,646 --> 01:05:30,566
And don't caII me Otto.

1140
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:32,365
To you, I am Mr...

1141
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:40,965
Aagh!

1142
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,485
Oh, God.

1143
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:48,325
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1144
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:49,804
I'm sorry.

1145
01:05:50,245 --> 01:05:51,604
PIease.

1146
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:53,604
I'm sorry.

1147
01:05:53,604 --> 01:05:55,524
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1148
01:05:55,524 --> 01:05:57,724
How could I know it was you?

1149
01:05:57,925 --> 01:06:00,444
I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

1150
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:01,404
Stupid jerk!

1151
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:04,563
What the fuck are you doing
robbing your own house?

1152
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:07,163
You asshole!

1153
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,724
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1154
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:11,283
Agh!

1155
01:06:11,484 --> 01:06:12,923
I'm sorry.

1156
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:14,363
I'm sorry.

1157
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:15,883
Er... Er...

1158
01:06:16,763 --> 01:06:18,043
Yeah.

1159
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,960
God AImighty!

1160
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,480
BIoody heII!

1161
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,439
Darling!

1162
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,399
Are you hurt?

1163
01:07:13,399 --> 01:07:15,519
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1164
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:18,679
Can't you speak?

1165
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:21,119
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1166
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:26,358
Archie, we've been burgled.

1167
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:27,318
Oh, no!

1168
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:28,758
WeII, are you hurt?

1169
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:30,198
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1170
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:32,118
Bit of a headache. I er...

1171
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:34,518
I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

1172
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:36,438
My God, is that the time?

1173
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:37,398
What?

1174
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:39,797
I didn't realise it was quite so Iate.

1175
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:40,757
What?!

1176
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,197
I'm Iate for a conference.

1177
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:44,117
You've just been attacked!

1178
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:46,038
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1179
01:07:46,038 --> 01:07:48,437
- Archie!
- I'II help you tidy up Iater!

1180
01:07:48,437 --> 01:07:49,877
HeIIo, Portia.

1181
01:07:49,877 --> 01:07:51,596
What's happened?

1182
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:54,796
Your father has finaIIy gone
completely mental.

1183
01:08:17,355 --> 01:08:18,555
Hi.

1184
01:08:29,834 --> 01:08:31,195
Archie!

1185
01:08:34,154 --> 01:08:35,594
Thank you so much.

1186
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,034
Champagne?

1187
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,234
OK.

1188
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:01,872
- To us.
- To us.

1189
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:06,791
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

1190
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,952
Let's make Iove!

1191
01:09:10,632 --> 01:09:12,552
WeII, if you absolutely insist...

1192
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:13,752
No.

1193
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:14,951
What?

1194
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,711
Here. On the rug.

1195
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,271
I'II be right back.

1196
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:20,911
Get undressed.

1197
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,070
Why not?

1198
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:25,790
Why not indeed!?

1199
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:30,070
Afterwards, ...

1200
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:31,390
Yeah?

1201
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,470
..let's go to South America.

1202
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,750
What?

1203
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:36,830
Let's fly to South America.

1204
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,269
Why South America?

1205
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:39,990
OK, ... Iceland?

1206
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,069
What do you really want out of Iife?

1207
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:47,869
I don't know.

1208
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:49,789
Why do I Iike you so much?

1209
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,149
Archie.

1210
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,188
Hm?

1211
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,629
Do you speak Italian?

1212
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:55,069
I am Italian!

1213
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:56,989
Sono italiano in spirito.

1214
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,588
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce Iavorare in giardino...

1215
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,588
..a fare I'amore appassionato.

1216
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,149
Uno sbaglio grande!

1217
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:07,468
But it's such an ugly Ianguage.

1218
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,428
How about... Russian?

1219
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:13,427
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1220
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:19,107
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya
Iyubosyat'sya grust'.

1221
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:25,227
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu

1222
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:30,227
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1223
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:35,626
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak Iegko...

1224
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:37,706
Archie!

1225
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:39,066
Yeah?

1226
01:10:39,225 --> 01:10:40,666
Are you rich?

1227
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:42,106
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1228
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:43,546
What about the house?

1229
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:46,185
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1230
01:10:46,905 --> 01:10:48,105
Oh.

1231
01:10:52,184 --> 01:10:55,185
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1232
01:10:56,025 --> 01:10:59,264
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1233
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:04,504
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1234
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:09,344
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak Iegko!

1235
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:32,182
- What the heII are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

1236
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:34,623
Who are you?

1237
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,582
What?!

1238
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,022
Get your clothes on.

1239
01:11:37,022 --> 01:11:39,902
- WiII you Ieave immediately, please?
- What?!

1240
01:11:39,902 --> 01:11:41,342
You're in the wrong flat.

1241
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:43,902
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1242
01:11:44,262 --> 01:11:45,222
He's in Hong Kong.

1243
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:47,141
He Ient me the key. Now get out!

1244
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:49,942
We Ieased it
from the agents Iast weekend.

1245
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:58,541
Yes, weII obviously
that changes things a bit. Erm...

1246
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,140
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1247
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,740
What?

1248
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:07,700
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

1249
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,740
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

1250
01:12:13,059 --> 01:12:14,900
What a coincidence!

1251
01:12:15,459 --> 01:12:16,739
Ha...

1252
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,779
How nice to see you.

1253
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:48,017
HeIIo.

1254
01:12:48,137 --> 01:12:50,217
Hello, Wanda. It's Archie

1255
01:12:51,498 --> 01:12:54,377
I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it.

1256
01:12:54,377 --> 01:12:55,337
I'm sorry.

1257
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,617
What?

1258
01:12:58,216 --> 01:12:59,697
I'm sorry.

1259
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,936
Archie?

1260
01:13:31,335 --> 01:13:32,615
Er...

1261
01:13:33,734 --> 01:13:34,934
OK.

1262
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:36,615
Oh, no, no. PIease.

1263
01:13:36,615 --> 01:13:38,535
Look, I want to apologise.

1264
01:13:38,535 --> 01:13:39,974
I just finished it.

1265
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:40,934
OK, OK, wait.

1266
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:43,334
Where are you going?
I want speak with you.

1267
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:45,373
WiII you Ieave me alone?

1268
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:47,173
I've ended it, aII right?

1269
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,094
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1270
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:51,014
It's aII over, OK? It's over.

1271
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:52,933
- AII right!
- Jesus Christ!

1272
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,293
- Calm down!
- Someone help me!

1273
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:57,733
- PIease believe me!
- It's aII right!

1274
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,613
Don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

1275
01:14:00,613 --> 01:14:01,573
WiII you shut up?!

1276
01:14:01,573 --> 01:14:03,772
Jesus Christ, don't kiII me!

1277
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,613
Shut up, then.

1278
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:07,092
OK.

1279
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:08,292
Look.

1280
01:14:08,292 --> 01:14:10,212
I just want to apologise...

1281
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:11,652
..sincerely...

1282
01:14:12,613 --> 01:14:14,532
When I hung you from the window.

1283
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:16,171
I'm really....

1284
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,892
It was not a nice thing to do.

1285
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:20,291
Then when I attacked you in there.

1286
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:21,731
I'm really, s...

1287
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:24,571
How did I know
you were robbing your house?

1288
01:14:24,612 --> 01:14:26,052
I was trying to help!

1289
01:14:26,052 --> 01:14:27,851
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1290
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:29,891
I wanted you to trust me.

1291
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:31,931
PIease, it was my fault.

1292
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,210
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1293
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,650
Now, about my sister.

1294
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,611
Otto, ...

1295
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,531
She's a very sexy girl.

1296
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:40,930
I understand
you wanting to play around with her.

1297
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,290
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1298
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:44,770
I was jealous.

1299
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,049
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1300
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:49,570
Fuck her blue.

1301
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,409
I Iike you, Archie.

1302
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,370
I just want to help.

1303
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:57,965
Oh, God!

1304
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:35,723
(man) Send for an ambulance!

1305
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:56,562
Shocking!

1306
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:01,361
I did it!

1307
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:03,281
I did it! I did it!

1308
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:05,161
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1309
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,600
Thomason!

1310
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,880
Yeah?

1311
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,360
You done weII, my son.

1312
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,200
Now, here's the plan.

1313
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,680
You get four tickets
for this evening for Rio, first class.

1314
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,960
- Then...
- F-f-f...

1315
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,400
Yeah, four.

1316
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,839
We get rid of Otto Iater.

1317
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:28,599
Then, back to the flat,
pack, coIIect me.

1318
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,078
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

1319
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:36,839
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1320
01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:41,119
Oi! Oi!

1321
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,958
It's so exciting,
I can't believe it!

1322
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,398
He's s-s-safe.

1323
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:51,677
I'm going to be Iate for court!

1324
01:17:53,197 --> 01:17:54,597
H-HeIIo.

1325
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:56,197
HeIIo, Otto.

1326
01:17:57,998 --> 01:18:00,197
No, she just er... I-I-Ieft.

1327
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:03,037
Oh, and Otto...

1328
01:18:03,757 --> 01:18:05,676
You owe me a p-p-p...

1329
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:08,677
What?

1330
01:18:10,276 --> 01:18:12,277
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1331
01:18:14,116 --> 01:18:15,636
Not Granny?

1332
01:18:16,036 --> 01:18:18,036
M-met with an accident.

1333
01:18:20,836 --> 01:18:22,836
BuIIshit! You're Iying.

1334
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:25,476
Dead?

1335
01:18:31,395 --> 01:18:32,835
I don't believe this.

1336
01:18:32,835 --> 01:18:35,235
So, George wiII be out this afternoon.

1337
01:18:35,235 --> 01:18:37,154
We aII go out to Heathrow, ...

1338
01:18:37,154 --> 01:18:39,074
..coIIect the Ioot and...

1339
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,274
AII thanks to me.

1340
01:18:47,234 --> 01:18:49,954
So the Ioot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1341
01:18:59,713 --> 01:19:01,633
What's h-h-happening?

1342
01:19:03,073 --> 01:19:04,514
WeII, Ken.

1343
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:06,913
I'm going to ask you some questions...

1344
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:08,833
..while I eat my chips.

1345
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,153
First.

1346
01:19:10,273 --> 01:19:11,712
Who was the philosopher...

1347
01:19:11,712 --> 01:19:14,592
..who developed
the concept of the superman...

1348
01:19:14,592 --> 01:19:16,873
..in Also Spracht Zarathustra?

1349
01:19:18,432 --> 01:19:19,672
No?!

1350
01:19:20,352 --> 01:19:22,952
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1351
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:25,631
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1352
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:26,911
Next.

1353
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:29,472
In which book did Nietzsche claim...

1354
01:19:29,472 --> 01:19:32,711
..that almost aII higher culture
is based on cruelty?

1355
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:37,111
Are you thinking
or are you in mid-stutter?

1356
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:38,751
You're m-mad.

1357
01:19:40,511 --> 01:19:42,431
Beyond Good And Evil.

1358
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:46,270
I'II have to ask you an easy one.

1359
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,750
OK. Erm...

1360
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:50,350
Let me think, let me think.

1361
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,590
Where are the diamonds?

1362
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,910
I'II give you a clue.

1363
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:57,109
Somewhere round the airport.

1364
01:19:58,749 --> 01:20:00,189
(stutters)

1365
01:20:00,189 --> 01:20:02,589
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1366
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:05,829
I'II just sit here and eat my chips
tiII you teII me.

1367
01:20:08,349 --> 01:20:11,109
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1368
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:12,668
The chip.

1369
01:20:12,668 --> 01:20:15,589
What do the English
usuaIIy eat with chips...

1370
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:18,388
..to make them more interesting?

1371
01:20:19,388 --> 01:20:21,028
Wait a moment!

1372
01:20:23,228 --> 01:20:25,147
It's fish, isn't it?!

1373
01:20:29,468 --> 01:20:30,947
Here, boy.

1374
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,547
Down the hatch.

1375
01:20:37,147 --> 01:20:38,586
Delicious!

1376
01:20:38,586 --> 01:20:40,146
You b-b-b...

1377
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,866
Better eat the green one? OK?

1378
01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:45,507
What's this one's name?

1379
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:47,826
WeII, not Wanda, anyway.

1380
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:49,746
I'm going to caII her Lunch.

1381
01:20:49,746 --> 01:20:51,626
HeIIo, Lunch. HeIIo!

1382
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:57,746
Eugh!

1383
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,305
Avoid the green ones.

1384
01:21:00,305 --> 01:21:02,225
They're not ripe yet.

1385
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:07,425
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1386
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:08,945
Yes, sir.

1387
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:12,265
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was instaIIing windows...

1388
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,224
..the previous weekend, ...

1389
01:21:14,224 --> 01:21:18,264
..would explain the presence of
smaII particles of glass on his trousers.

1390
01:21:21,904 --> 01:21:23,784
No hurry, Inspector.

1391
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:25,904
PIease do take your time.

1392
01:21:32,463 --> 01:21:34,183
I'm almost fuII.

1393
01:21:35,343 --> 01:21:36,704
AImost.

1394
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:38,383
Stop!

1395
01:21:38,702 --> 01:21:40,343
PIease, don't.

1396
01:21:40,623 --> 01:21:41,583
Come on, Wanda!

1397
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,583
Gullet time!

1398
01:21:46,382 --> 01:21:49,502
What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

1399
01:21:49,742 --> 01:21:51,182
The Airway Sheraton?

1400
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:52,141
The Post House?

1401
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:53,582
The Cathcart Towers?

1402
01:21:53,582 --> 01:21:55,662
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1403
01:21:57,422 --> 01:21:58,781
Mm? Mm?

1404
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:01,261
Yes.

1405
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:03,181
In the safe deposit box?

1406
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:04,141
Yes.

1407
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:06,062
Where's the key?

1408
01:22:06,062 --> 01:22:07,021
What?

1409
01:22:07,021 --> 01:22:07,981
Where's the key?

1410
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:09,901
It's in the t-t-tank.

1411
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:13,740
Where? Where?

1412
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,420
In the t-t-t...

1413
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,821
Treasure chest!

1414
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,260
Where?!

1415
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,620
Where?

1416
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:26,939
Oh!

1417
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:29,220
You m-m-m...

1418
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,900
..murdering k-k-k...

1419
01:22:34,859 --> 01:22:37,099
I'II kiII you, I'II kiII you!

1420
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:42,459
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1421
01:22:43,499 --> 01:22:46,858
StiII, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1422
01:22:48,778 --> 01:22:50,058
What?

1423
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:51,898
Oh!

1424
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:02,577
- HeIIo?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1425
01:23:03,657 --> 01:23:04,618
Where?

1426
01:23:04,618 --> 01:23:06,337
Where's the key?

1427
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:10,857
I've got it.

1428
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:13,537
When can you get
to George's apartment?

1429
01:23:14,737 --> 01:23:16,657
You are Wanda Gershwitz, ...

1430
01:23:16,657 --> 01:23:19,617
..of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

1431
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,737
Yes.

1432
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:24,335
Would you teII the court, ...

1433
01:23:24,335 --> 01:23:26,256
..how do you know the defendant?

1434
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:28,896
We've had a relationship for two years.

1435
01:23:30,096 --> 01:23:31,695
Relationship?

1436
01:23:32,015 --> 01:23:34,055
We're Iovers, your Iord.

1437
01:23:36,335 --> 01:23:39,295
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year, ...

1438
01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:41,135
..in the morning, ...

1439
01:23:41,135 --> 01:23:42,575
..where were you?

1440
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:44,494
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1441
01:23:44,494 --> 01:23:47,734
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

1442
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:50,054
No. Somebody else was there.

1443
01:23:50,255 --> 01:23:51,694
Who was that?

1444
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,215
My brother.

1445
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:55,294
Did your b... ?

1446
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:00,014
Your brother?

1447
01:24:01,294 --> 01:24:02,813
My brother.

1448
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:06,853
Yes.

1449
01:24:08,013 --> 01:24:09,533
Yes, and...

1450
01:24:10,893 --> 01:24:13,293
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1451
01:24:13,293 --> 01:24:15,933
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1452
01:24:23,372 --> 01:24:26,372
W-w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

1453
01:24:27,212 --> 01:24:29,172
Yes, George was there.

1454
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,052
But he Ieft about 6.55.

1455
01:24:31,052 --> 01:24:32,371
Wanda!

1456
01:24:32,971 --> 01:24:34,572
I-I wonder...

1457
01:24:34,891 --> 01:24:36,411
I wonder...

1458
01:24:38,252 --> 01:24:39,771
I wonder...

1459
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,490
Yes, Mr Leach?

1460
01:24:50,731 --> 01:24:52,650
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1461
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:54,090
I wonder... I w-w-w...

1462
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,169
Wh-when you say 6.55, ...

1463
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,609
..Miss er... Gershwitz, ...

1464
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:01,930
..how can you be so sure?

1465
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,170
Oh, I Iooked at the clock.

1466
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,609
Cos I said to myself, ...

1467
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:09,169
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun?'

1468
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:10,849
Darling!

1469
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:12,810
Mr Leach.

1470
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,208
Darling?

1471
01:25:14,249 --> 01:25:15,209
Yes, dear?

1472
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:16,649
You bitch!

1473
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,089
You fucking bitch!

1474
01:25:21,928 --> 01:25:23,728
Restrain that man!

1475
01:25:29,128 --> 01:25:30,568
Restrain this man.

1476
01:25:30,568 --> 01:25:32,008
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1477
01:25:32,008 --> 01:25:34,887
CIear the court!
I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1478
01:25:34,887 --> 01:25:36,608
CIear the court!

1479
01:25:46,406 --> 01:25:47,846
CIear the court!

1480
01:25:47,846 --> 01:25:49,767
CIear the court! CIear the court!

1481
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:51,886

1482
01:25:57,446 --> 01:25:59,845
CIear the court! CIear the court!

1483
01:26:11,365 --> 01:26:13,245
BIoody heII!

1484
01:26:13,286 --> 01:26:15,605
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1485
01:26:16,165 --> 01:26:17,605
Ah, you made it. Good.

1486
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,845
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1487
01:26:20,964 --> 01:26:23,804
I have never been
so humiliated in my Iife.

1488
01:26:24,324 --> 01:26:27,204
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1489
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:29,164
I'II see you in court.

1490
01:26:38,244 --> 01:26:39,483
Yes.

1491
01:26:41,603 --> 01:26:42,883
WeII.

1492
01:26:43,523 --> 01:26:45,243
That's it, then.

1493
01:26:48,322 --> 01:26:49,683
George.

1494
01:26:49,763 --> 01:26:52,002
- What?
- We've got to talk.

1495
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:54,082
TeII those pigs to fuck off.

1496
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:55,762
Fuck off, pigs.

1497
01:26:58,402 --> 01:26:59,841
Did you hear what I said?

1498
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,282
Fuck off.

1499
01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:08,001
What's she up to, George?

1500
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:09,842
What are you up to?

1501
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:11,361
You caIIed her darling, ...

1502
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:12,802
..and Wanda.

1503
01:27:12,802 --> 01:27:15,681
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

1504
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:17,121
It slipped out.

1505
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:19,041
Have you been coaching her?

1506
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:21,440
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

1507
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,360
They'II find you guilty, right?

1508
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,920
PIead guilty now, teII them
where the Ioot is, you may get...

1509
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:29,600
..eight years, out in five and a half.

1510
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,480
What if I teII them about Otto...
and Wanda?

1511
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,919
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1512
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,359
Great, aII right.

1513
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:37,280
Maybe six years, out in four?

1514
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,399
So where are the diamonds?

1515
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,599
Where's Bartlett?

1516
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:43,519
Upstairs, calming things down.

1517
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:44,959
So, where are they?

1518
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,598
TeII Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1519
01:27:48,799 --> 01:27:51,718
George, it'd be a Iot quicker
if you told me.

1520
01:27:55,038 --> 01:27:56,958
OK! I'II teII Bartlett.

1521
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:58,518
Where's Ken?

1522
01:27:58,878 --> 01:28:00,638
He's at the flat.

1523
01:28:05,397 --> 01:28:07,317
Thank you for aII your help.

1524
01:28:07,317 --> 01:28:09,118
I'II be right out.

1525
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:24,196
Taxi! Taxi!

1526
01:28:24,597 --> 01:28:25,556
PIease... shit!

1527
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:26,837
Taxi!

1528
01:28:26,996 --> 01:28:28,396
Come on.

1529
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,396
- What?
- Let's go.

1530
01:28:29,396 --> 01:28:30,836
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1531
01:28:30,836 --> 01:28:33,716
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1532
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:35,076
Get in.

1533
01:28:38,516 --> 01:28:39,955
Got your passport?

1534
01:28:39,955 --> 01:28:40,915
Yeah.

1535
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,835
Check the briefcase for mine.

1536
01:28:42,835 --> 01:28:44,675
Get your head down.

1537
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:53,355
So, you robbed the jeweIIer's,
turned one Iover in, ...

1538
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:56,274
..and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

1539
01:28:56,274 --> 01:28:59,074
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

1540
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:01,074
Everyone does it in America.

1541
01:29:01,074 --> 01:29:02,034
Not in this country!

1542
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:04,394
Right(!) Nobody Iies in England.

1543
01:29:04,434 --> 01:29:08,273
- Like Margaret Thatcher never Iied.
- You Iied to me from the start.

1544
01:29:08,273 --> 01:29:11,953
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I feII in Iove with you!

1545
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:18,673
How come you dumped me, then?

1546
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,633
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1547
01:29:32,753 --> 01:29:34,192
Say something in Russian.

1548
01:29:34,192 --> 01:29:35,392
No!

1549
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:41,871
What are you thinking, Archie?

1550
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:44,271
I'm trying to find one good reason...

1551
01:29:44,271 --> 01:29:46,671
..why I should take you away with me.

1552
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:48,231
How about...

1553
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:51,750
..because I have the key
to the safety deposit box.

1554
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:54,631
(both) That's a good reason!

1555
01:29:58,191 --> 01:29:59,631
What do we do about Otto?

1556
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:01,070
I'II handle Otto.

1557
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,230
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1558
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:04,870
So am I.

1559
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:06,630
Keep it running.

1560
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:12,110
- Why did you bring him?
- Otto, wait!

1561
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:14,989
- I'm beginning to think you Iike him!
- Wait!

1562
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:16,590
Let's get the diamonds!

1563
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:17,509
Ken!

1564
01:30:18,469 --> 01:30:20,028
Are you Ken?

1565
01:30:21,829 --> 01:30:22,789
How do you do?

1566
01:30:22,789 --> 01:30:24,709
I'm George's barrister.

1567
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:28,548
Oh, my God!

1568
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:29,988
Asshole!

1569
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:32,389
- What the bloody heII...

1570
01:30:32,389 --> 01:30:34,268
Oh, aII right, then.

1571
01:30:35,268 --> 01:30:36,628
Archie!

1572
01:30:38,148 --> 01:30:39,588
Where have they gone?

1573
01:30:39,588 --> 01:30:41,507
Quick! Where have they gone?

1574
01:30:41,507 --> 01:30:43,667
They've go... they've go...

1575
01:30:43,907 --> 01:30:44,868
What?

1576
01:30:46,308 --> 01:30:48,107
Are you aII right?

1577
01:30:48,227 --> 01:30:49,667
Where have they gone?

1578
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:51,107
They've gone to the...

1579
01:30:51,107 --> 01:30:52,067
..the Ca-ca-ca...

1580
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:53,986
- Are you iII?
- No, no, no.

1581
01:30:53,986 --> 01:30:54,946
What?

1582
01:30:54,946 --> 01:30:55,906
Ca-ca-ca...

1583
01:30:55,906 --> 01:30:57,347
Have you got a stutter?

1584
01:30:57,347 --> 01:30:59,226
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1585
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:01,186
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1586
01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:03,506
Do you know where they've gone?

1587
01:31:03,586 --> 01:31:04,546
Yeah.

1588
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:05,986
Fine, fine. Where?

1589
01:31:05,986 --> 01:31:07,545
The Ca-ca...

1590
01:31:08,866 --> 01:31:10,265
..Hotel.

1591
01:31:10,786 --> 01:31:11,746
Hotel?

1592
01:31:11,746 --> 01:31:13,306
Which hotel?

1593
01:31:14,145 --> 01:31:15,426
Ca...

1594
01:31:16,065 --> 01:31:17,906
The Ca... The Ca...

1595
01:31:18,465 --> 01:31:19,904
Go on, go on.

1596
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:20,866
Ca-ca-ca...

1597
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:21,825
It's OK.

1598
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:24,064
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1599
01:31:24,705 --> 01:31:26,585
SIowly. Very slowly.

1600
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:27,984
SIowly.

1601
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,424
The Ca...

1602
01:31:32,865 --> 01:31:34,344
The Caa...

1603
01:31:35,264 --> 01:31:36,224

1604
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,584
..Ca...

1605
01:31:37,664 --> 01:31:39,104
The Caa...

1606
01:31:39,104 --> 01:31:40,064
No hurry.

1607
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:41,743
The C-C-Caaa...

1608
01:31:41,983 --> 01:31:43,423
Sing it. Sing.

1609
01:31:43,423 --> 01:31:44,864
# The Caa

1610
01:31:45,824 --> 01:31:47,264
# The Caa

1611
01:31:47,264 --> 01:31:49,063
# The Caa, the Caa

1612
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,543
# Caa

1613
01:31:51,543 --> 01:31:52,503
PIenty of time.

1614
01:31:52,503 --> 01:31:53,783
# Caa

1615
01:31:54,903 --> 01:31:55,863
# Caa

1616
01:31:55,863 --> 01:31:56,822
# The Caa

1617
01:31:56,822 --> 01:31:58,262
Oh, come on!

1618
01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,702
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1619
01:31:59,702 --> 01:32:01,023
Erm...

1620
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,022
# The Caa

1621
01:32:06,422 --> 01:32:08,102
Here. Write it.

1622
01:32:19,381 --> 01:32:20,821
Cathcart Towers Hotel?

1623
01:32:20,821 --> 01:32:22,740
Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1624
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:24,300
Where is it?

1625
01:32:24,661 --> 01:32:26,741
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1626
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:30,981
No, no, no.

1627
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,859
Heathrow Airport.

1628
01:32:51,059 --> 01:32:52,499
Hey! What's the idea?

1629
01:32:52,499 --> 01:32:53,939
You can't stay...

1630
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:56,459
Terribly sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1631
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:04,498
Thank you so much.

1632
01:33:04,498 --> 01:33:06,418
Er... British Airways to Rio.

1633
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:08,257
Rio? Terminal Four.

1634
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:09,818
Thank you.

1635
01:33:15,058 --> 01:33:17,457
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1636
01:33:17,457 --> 01:33:19,377
I'II be with you in a moment.

1637
01:33:19,377 --> 01:33:21,218
I'II be right back.

1638
01:33:21,698 --> 01:33:24,056
Aisle or window?
Smoking or non-smoking?

1639
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:25,497
What was the middle one?

1640
01:33:25,497 --> 01:33:27,856
Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

1641
01:33:27,897 --> 01:33:29,976
Gate 1 4 is boarding now.

1642
01:33:51,895 --> 01:33:53,135
Rio!

1643
01:33:53,815 --> 01:33:56,695
Otto, don't Iook back,
there's a cop behind us.

1644
01:33:56,695 --> 01:33:58,014
Quick!

1645
01:34:01,975 --> 01:34:03,895
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

1646
01:34:03,895 --> 01:34:05,214
Great.

1647
01:34:05,334 --> 01:34:07,214
- Luggage?

1648
01:34:09,654 --> 01:34:11,573
Don't really need any.

1649
01:34:11,573 --> 01:34:13,654
- Gate 1 4.
- Thank you.

1650
01:34:14,934 --> 01:34:16,773
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1651
01:34:23,093 --> 01:34:24,294
Ow!

1652
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,813
Aargh!

1653
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:46,892
Come on, Archie.

1654
01:34:47,091 --> 01:34:48,892
Pick up the phone.

1655
01:34:55,251 --> 01:34:57,531
Ticket, sir. Airport security.

1656
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,570
May I see your boarding pass?

1657
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,011
