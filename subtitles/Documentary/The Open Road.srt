1
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,580
Last season,
a lot of people thought he was playing

2
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,940
even better than his dad did
when he first came into the minors,

3
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,700
but lately, you know,
Garrett's been in a bit of a slump.

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,100
Carlton's father, of course,
retired Hall-of-Famer Kyle Garrett.

5
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,820
And now he's back at the plate.

6
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,660
Halliday sets.
And the 1-2.

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,540
High fly ball,
right centerfield.

8
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,780
This should do it.
Jackie Liston drifts back.

9
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,140
And, well, the Hooks
lose this one 6-0.

10
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,780
Corpus has now lost the series,

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,060
but it's the first series
the Hooks have lost

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,780
since May 26th.

13
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,780
Son of a bitch.

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,740
Hey, Garrett,
come talk to me for a minute.

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,100
What's going on with you?

16
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,220
I'm just trying to
figure some things out.

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,860
Figure things out?

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Yeah, you know,
whatever it is that's eluding me.

19
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,180
No, nothing's
eluding you, Garrett.

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,180
You're just stuck in your head,
that's all.

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,700
And baseball players
don't say things like "eluding."

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,420
So pull it out of your ass
and play some ball for me,

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,500
- will you, please?!
- Okay, Coach.

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,140
I got to level with you.

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,540
If things don't go well this weekend,
I'm thinking of making some changes.

26
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,500
Hey.

27
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,780
She had some
trouble breathing after lunch,

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,860
- drove herself over.
- What did they say?

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,020
They've recommended
a procedure.

30
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,580
It's a catheterization
of some kind.

31
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,980
I don't know.
They've had a lot of success with it,

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,980
but there's always a risk.

33
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,300
Now, listen,

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,300
they've got her on antibiotics
and they have to wait a few days,

35
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,020
but she won't agree to sign
the surgery waiver.

36
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,140
Right.

37
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,820
If she falls unconscious,
they can do it without her consent.

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Otherwise we'll need
a court order

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
and I don't know
if we can get one.

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,580
Okay, Grandad,
I'll talk to her.

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,180
Hey.

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,820
Hey, I was listening.

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,660
What happened to you
out there tonight?

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,820
I thought you were
gonna pull that off.

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,140
Yeah, me too.

46
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,420
Were you wearing your thing?

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,740
Oh.

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
We've been buds a long time,
haven't we?

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,660
Yes we have.

50
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,620
And have I asked you for much
during that time?

51
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,740
Have I asked you
for many favors?

52
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,260
No, not really.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,340
Okay, I need to ask you
for one now.

54
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,860
Anything, Mom.
You know that.

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,940
I need to see your father.

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,620
Mom.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,380
If he's not here
when I go into surgery,

58
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,220
I'm gonna die
on that table.

59
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,580
- Come on.
- You tell him I'm crazy.

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,660
You tell him... I don't care...
whatever you want to tell him,

61
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,220
but I'm not signing that waiver
till he gets here.

62
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,740
I won't.

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,300
Okay, wait a second.
Let's just calm down here.

64
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,660
No, I need to see him, Carlton.

65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
And don't tell me to calm down

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,020
when I'm laying here
with a fucking hole in my heart!

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,100
Mom!

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,100
Shit, I'm scared.

69
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,220
Shit.

70
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm scared!

71
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,660
Okay, this time I am really scared
and I don't know why.

72
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,740
So please tell me you'll do it.

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,780
- If that's what you want.
- That is what I want.

74
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,100
Okay, I'll do it.

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,860
I promise.

76
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,540
Thanks.

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,060
Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,180
Look, I'm sorry
to just call like this, but...

79
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,980
Wow.

80
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,140
Why don't you
just try calling him?

81
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,980
You don't know him, Lucy.

82
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,020
I mean, he's not exactly
easy to talk to.

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,980
Ah.

84
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,540
If you were to ask this guy
how he was doing,

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,900
instead of saying "fine,"

86
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,980
he would say
something like

87
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,900
"Better than a chigger
on the back of a hound dog."

88
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,420
I don't get it either.

89
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Well, I guess
you are in a pickle.

90
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,220
I don't know what to tell you.

91
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,060
I mean, I'm sorry
about your mom.

92
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,980
I am.
This whole thing is just...

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,460
Yeah yeah, I know.

94
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,020
Well, I'm subbing for
two classes in the morning.

95
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,020
You gonna be okay?

96
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,300
- Yeah.
- You call me if you need anything,

97
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,860
or if Katherine needs anything.

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,780
Okay.

99
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,980
Thanks for coming over.

100
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,340
Love you.

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,100
Love you too.

102
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,340
Did I wake you?

103
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,020
No, I was just baking
a fruitcake.

104
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,980
You want some?

105
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,860
Good one.

106
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,620
Um, I wanted to say thanks
for coming by earlier.

107
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,460
- Did you call him?
- I got his agent.

108
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,860
He's at an autograph show
in Ohio.

109
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,860
Can you believe the guy
still doesn't have a cell phone?

110
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,260
So anyway, um...

111
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
I'll go.

112
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,540
- You will?
- But, look, I gotta be back by Wednesday,

113
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,060
- no later.
- Wednesday. Done.

114
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,660
Yeah, so I'm thinking
for this first thing or whatever,

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,180
um, maybe I'll just
do it on my own.

117
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,420
Okay.

118
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,340
Maybe we can have a nice dinner
or something after.

119
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,140
Go.
Go, young man.

120
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,500
Face your demon.

121
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,860
It all boils down to this.
It's all on the shoulders

122
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
of Garrett.
Oh!

123
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,900
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh, it looks to be good!

124
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
Are you kidding me?

125
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,460
It's out of here!

126
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,460
- Absolutely unbelievable!
- This is amazing.

127
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,660
Garrett has done it. Kyle Garrett has just
won the National League pennant

128
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,020
for the Houston Astros!

129
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,740
Thanks.

130
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,340
He's got me swinging
so damn hard

131
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,740
I was spinning around in the dirt
and I strike out.

132
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,860
Then I got to walk
back to the bench

133
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,340
with my teammates
laughing their asses off.

134
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,900
I lose my 100 bucks,

135
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,900
but I learned
an important lesson...

136
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,060
you never trust a rookie.

137
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,620
Ever!

138
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,060
Okay, well, we have time
for one or two more questions.

139
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
- Right there.
- What happened to Palmer?

140
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,820
I thought he was
supposed to be here.

141
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,420
Bob needed to be
at home with his wife.

142
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,420
They're expecting their second child,
so unfortunately he had to cancel.

143
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,700
What do you think
about that, Lonestar?

144
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,980
Well, I guess
maybe Viagra does work.

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,300
Believe it or not,
Kegs is even older than I am.

146
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,660
So when his wife got
pregnant the first time,

147
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,420
I told him not to worry.
I'd find the bastard that did it.

148
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,260
And then last month when he told me
she was pregnant again,

149
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,260
well, that was quite a blow.

150
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,460
I realized I'd killed
the wrong guy.

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,580
All right. Well, there's the pitching contest
tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

152
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,060
So I hope you can all make it.

153
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,660
And we'll be selling tickets outside.

154
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,220
All right now,
who do we got next?

155
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
What you got there for me,
little pardner?

156
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,940
A baseball card.

157
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,580
Well, put it on up here.
I ain't gonna bite.

158
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,260
Only two things you've got to
worry about as far as that goes:

159
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,980
rattlesnakes
and redheads, okay?

160
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,580
You're too young for one,
too far north for the other,

161
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,540
- you know what I'm saying?
- He's growing up quick.

162
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,500
Okay, here's your card.
Let's take our picture.

163
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,140
I think you're the best, Mr. Garrett.
Nobody since Ted Williams

164
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,140
- can swing a bat like you, sir.
- I appreciate that.

165
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,220
All right. All right, you take care
of this little slugger now.

166
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,180
- Oh, yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- All right. See you.

167
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,860
I got about 15 more
in me, sweetie.

168
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,100
All right.
Come on up now.

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,020
Hello.

170
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,140
What can I do for you?

171
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,700
I tried to call you in Arizona.

172
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,820
Mike said you were here
and that you still didn't have a phone,

173
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,700
so I just flew up.

174
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,100
I don't know if that
answers my question,

175
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,660
but it sure is good
to see you.

176
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,140
I need to talk to you
in private.

177
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,940
It's important.

178
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,700
Sweetie, can you put some
more ice in that for me?

179
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,700
If I would have been able
to reach you by phone,

180
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,180
- I just...
- Kyle, they changed the thing

181
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,900
over at the pavilion.
They're gonna do it at 6:00.

182
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,980
Okay, I'll see you over there.
Oh hey,

183
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,100
this is a fan of mine.

184
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,740
He come all the way
up here from Texas.

185
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, all right.
Welcome to Ohio.

186
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,140
- Jack Masterson.
- Carlton Garrett.

187
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,220
Well, see you over there then?

188
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,740
All right, I'll see you there.

189
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,700
- Thank you, darlin'
- Sure thing.

190
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,020
- You're holding up the line.
- Dad.

191
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
- What?
- Please.

192
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,540
Look, I'm staying
at the same hotel you are.

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm here with my friend Lucy.
When you're done with this,

194
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,500
maybe you could just, I don't know,
meet us at the bar or something after.

195
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,700
All right, this dog and pony show
will be over around 8:00.

196
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,780
I'll see about swinging by after.
How's that?

197
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,140
- Thanks.
- Hey, buddy. What you got there?

198
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,300
Lonestar, sir, I have to say
it is an honor to meet you.

199
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,220
Maybe you should
just call his room.

200
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,780
Let's just give him 20 minutes.

201
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,540
- If he's not down here in 20 minutes...
- A whole lot can happen in 20 minutes.

202
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,420
You must be Lucy.

203
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,300
- Yeah.
- Oh, I swear,

204
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,260
Garrett must've been born
under a lucky star.

205
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,540
You're prettier than a spotted heifer
in a pansy patch.

206
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,340
Well, thank you.

207
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,500
I got to apologize to y'all.

208
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,540
They got me acting like
a little circus bear around here.

209
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,140
Had to have drinks
with the programmers up there.

210
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,980
You know, cocktails up
in my room and they just...

211
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,540
well, they just kept
going on and on ad infinitim.

212
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,860
And now they got me

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,780
going to this damn dinner.

214
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,860
Didn't even know about it.
Didn't tell me about it.

215
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,380
But I sure would love
to have you join me.

216
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,020
Would you mind doing that?

217
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,660
And then we could go over
the private matter?

218
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,340
It's really kind
of serious, Dad.

219
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,060
Yeah, well, I know, son,

220
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,500
but hey, if you'd
given me a heads-up...

221
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,660
if you'd let me know
you were coming,

222
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,100
I would've made time.

223
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,380
I would've canceled
this whole deal.

224
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,660
Mom's dying.

225
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,860
- What?
- The thing with her heart,

226
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,420
the defect,

227
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,100
it finally got worse

228
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,380
and now they have to operate.

229
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,700
And she wants to see you.

230
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,300
What are you talking about?

231
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,500
She wants to see you
before she goes into the operating room.

232
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,380
That's what she asked for.

233
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,140
That's what we came to tell you.

234
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,700
Well...

235
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,500
you know,
I'd love to come,

236
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,740
but I'm, uh...

237
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm under contract
here with this thing.

238
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,020
I don't know if I can just
drop everything and fly off.

239
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,820
Uh...

240
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,020
- when's the operation?
- They want to do it as soon as possible.

241
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
Hmm.

242
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Well, you caught me
a little off guard here,

243
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,700
but sure.

244
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,380
Yeah.
Of course.

245
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,180
So you'll fly down?

246
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,580
Well, I'm not gonna walk.
Of course I'm gonna fly down.

247
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,620
When I check into this party,
this dinner deal,

248
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,620
and I'll tell 'em the situation.
I'll look into flights in the morning.

249
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,260
Okay?
We're on the 10:00 tomorrow,

250
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,460
so we could all go together.

251
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
As long as I can sit next to you.

252
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,820
Okay then.

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,660
Well, I wish the circumstances
had been better,

254
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,380
- but it sure is good to meet you.
- You too.

255
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,260
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.

256
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,500
- Call your room.
- Thank you.

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,820
All right.

258
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,180
- That seemed to go pretty well.
- You're a total liar.

259
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,100
What are you talking about?

260
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,860
Mom's dying?

261
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,860
If she doesn't get
the operation, she will.

262
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,380
Look, what are you
trying to do, okay?

263
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,860
He said he would go.

264
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,780
- Can we not just be happy about that?
- Hmm.

265
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,980
You're the one who blushed
when he called you a heifer.

266
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
That's a cow.

267
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,980
- I know what a heifer is.
- Well well.

268
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,700
Here you go, pardner.

269
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,020
Lonestar, I appreciate it.

270
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,900
#11 in your program;
#1 in your heart.

271
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,860
- He doesn't stop.
- All right.

272
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

273
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,780
All right then.

274
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,940
Let's go to Houston.

275
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,620
- Hi.
- Hey.

276
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,420
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport in Columbus.

277
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,140
Are you...
how you feeling?

278
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,660
I'm fine.

279
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,620
Have you talked to your dad?

280
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,300
Yeah yeah, I'm looking
at him right now.

281
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,500
He's getting his ticket.
We should be in tonight.

282
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,140
Mom?

283
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,820
Yeah.
I didn't know if he would come.

284
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,380
Well, he's coming.

285
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,540
I'm bringing him
just like you asked.

286
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,620
What'd he say?

287
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,980
He said that if you wanted
him there, he was there.

288
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,620
And now we're at the airport.

289
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,860
Tell him I said thank you.

290
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,140
I will and I'll call you
when we get in, okay?

291
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,260
Thanks, baby.

292
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,540
You're welcome, Mom.

293
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,380
Now get some rest.
I'll call you in a few hours, okay?

294
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,500
Okay.

295
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,820
Hey.
Who's he talking to?

296
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,460
Homeland Security.

297
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,060
He lost his wallet,
so he doesn't have an ID.

298
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,140
I completely understand
your predicament, Tom.

299
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,060
- Good.
- And believe me,

300
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,580
I thank God that you boys
are down here doing your jobs

301
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,260
- which isn't an easy one.
- Thank you.

302
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,980
It's not like you don't know
who I am.

303
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,620
Right?
I mean, uh,

304
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,860
the Lonestar
ain't exactly no Arab.

305
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,980
Mr. Garrett,

306
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,140
believe me, if there's
anything I could do,

307
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,380
I would do it.
If I don't scan something,

308
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,700
- I'll lose my job.
- You believe this?

309
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,500
May I talk to you for a minute?

310
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,980
With the new security laws,
they won't let you on a private flight...

311
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,820
I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.

312
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,420
Well, pal, I really don't know
what happened to it.

313
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,220
I don't know.
See, I had a few drinks last night.

314
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,380
Maybe we could
check the hotel.

315
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,940
Please tell me
you're not gonna do this.

316
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,780
- Do what?
- I just got off the phone with her.

317
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,500
She's counting on you.

318
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,660
Well, what do you
want me to do, kiddo?

319
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,340
Haven't you ever lost
your wallet?

320
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,820
Couldn't you have someone
overnight your passport?

321
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,620
It expired. Besides, there's nobody
to overnight it anyway.

322
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,700
You know, I think the Lonestar
is being a pretty good guy here.

323
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,300
I mean, you show up
out of the blue,

324
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,860
I haven't seen you
for five years,

325
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,340
- here I am trying to get on a plane.
- No you're not.

326
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,100
And it's been four.

327
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,980
Let me try and explain
something here, okay?

328
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,700
Now she asked
for you to be there,

329
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,580
not for you to try
to get on a plane,

330
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,420
- but for you to be there.
- Looks like I'm at the airport to me.

331
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,540
- Without your wallet!
- What do you want me to do?!

332
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,980
Huh.

333
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,780
Sorry.
Was that me?

334
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,020
Yeah.
What were you gonna say?

335
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,020
No, nothing. I was just trying
to internally ponder something,

336
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,900
but the internal thing
didn't really work out.

337
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,020
You go on, sweetheart.

338
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,580
Something tells me if you've got
something to say, it's probably good.

339
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,180
- What is it?
- Well,

340
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,500
I was just thinking...
this is entirely up to y'all,

341
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,260
but you could always
just drive.

342
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,620
You'd think a car this size
would have some leg room.

343
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,940
Jesus God.

344
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,300
This is the most uncomfortable seat.

345
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,900
I don't understand this.

346
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,180
You asked for the biggest thing
they had. This was it.

347
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,940
- I asked for a Lincoln.
- They didn't have a Lincoln.

348
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,780
You know,
when I was a kid,

349
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,500
what we called
"a hummer"

350
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,420
was something
entirely different.

351
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,820
It was a kid in the choir
who couldn't sing.

352
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,420
Barbara Big Legs...
she was the one in ours.

353
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,420
Sang like a goat.

354
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,340
- You okay back there?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

355
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,580
- How about you?
- So I guess you two

356
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,580
have known each other
for quite a while now.

357
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,540
Yeah, about five years.

358
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,300
Hmm.

359
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,900
We met at a book reading.

360
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,180
- Oh really? Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,460
I try to read to myself
every now and then,

362
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
but my lips get tired.

363
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,380
Carlton's actually been
doing some writing...

364
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,020
some short stories and stuff.

365
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,300
Eventually, he's gonna
write a book.

366
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,500
- You're kidding me.
- Hm-mm.

367
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,780
Huh.

368
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,140
He must get that
from his mother's side.

369
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,460
I remember he used
to talk about you,

370
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,260
you know, back when.

371
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,540
- Really?
- No, good stuff.

372
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,140
Good stuff.

373
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
I remember thinking

374
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,180
his voice would always
kind of sound different

375
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,660
whenever he'd say your name.

376
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,020
It always brought
a smile to my face.

377
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,020
How do you mean different?

378
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,300
Oh, you know, like someone
who's happy, I guess.

379
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,100
In love.

380
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Well...

381
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
I think I'm gonna go in there
and get some booze,

382
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,780
get drunk.
You want anything?

383
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,780
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

384
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,700
Okay.

385
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,540
Mmn.

386
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,660
I called the school.

387
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
They kind of want me
back by tomorrow.

388
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,820
Tomorrow.

389
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,300
Yeah.

390
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,020
Yeah, of course.

391
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,180
Hey.

392
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,980
- Look...
- You're welcome.

393
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,020
- I mean it.
- I know.

394
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,580
You didn't have
to do any of this,

395
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,980
but you did
and I'm grateful.

396
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,620
I appreciate it.

397
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,460
Hey, there's something
else I have to tell...

398
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
I mean, this whole thing
is so strange, right?

399
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,580
I mean, I look at the guy
and I know he's my father,

400
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,900
but I'm not sure
he even exists anymore.

401
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,260
He's probably been playing
the part for so long,

402
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,340
- the real Kyle's just gone.
- Did you hear what I said?

403
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,300
What?

404
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,100
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No, that should be fine.

405
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,620
I mean, I think we'll make
Memphis tonight.

406
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,260
We'll get you a flight
out in the morning.

407
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,660
I'm serious, Lucy.

408
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,740
I couldn't have
done this without you.

409
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,260
See you later, buddy.

410
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,580
God, what the hell's
he doing now?

411
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,860
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

412
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,380
All right, well,

413
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,820
should probably
get back in the...

414
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,740
right?
Gotta try and make Memphis.

415
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,780
Yeah. Right.
Darlin',

416
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,340
would you mind doing me a favor
and grabbing my bag there?

417
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,140
- I got some pills in there.
- Yeah, sure.

418
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,380
- Would you bring it to me?
- Sure.

419
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,300
Thank you.

420
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,860
- What kind of pills?
- I don't know. Blue ones.

421
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,060
- What are they for?
- Well, let's say they're for my hip,

422
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,060
they're for my leg bone,

423
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,740
my back, some are
for my ankle.

424
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,540
What aren't they for?

425
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,620
You should never
dive head-first, son.

426
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,100
Always slide into the base,

427
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,020
but don't dive.

428
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,020
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Probably.

429
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,980
I can't say the idea
of crawling back

430
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,740
into that oversized Tonka Toy
and speeding through the night

431
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,060
particularly lights
my candle, though.

432
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,780
Well, if we stop now, we're not
gonna make it by Friday, Dad.

433
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,340
We're barely gonna make it
by Thursday as it is now.

434
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,980
We can't stop.

435
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,500
I'm sorry, but we just can't.

436
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,980
Yeah, I'll miss tomorrow night's
practice, but that's it.

437
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,780
Yeah, I'll see you on Friday.
Thanks.

438
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,860
You get through to your mom?

439
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,420
Yup.
And the team.

440
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,900
This whole thing is just...
I don't know about all this.

441
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,380
About what?

442
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,380
The wallet, the hipbone,
the neck... whatever.

443
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,500
This is his thing.
This is what he does.

444
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,220
I told you.

445
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,180
He commits to something
and then the idea

446
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,620
of commitment itself
starts to totally freak him out.

447
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,300
I know him.

448
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,980
He's looking for a way out.

449
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,900
He's just...

450
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,420
well, let's just say
the guy has some issues.

451
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,780
What, commitment issues?

452
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,780
Yeah, exactly.

453
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,700
Oh, Carlton.

454
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
- You want a drink?
- No.

455
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,860
Lucy's waitin'
I don't want the food to get cold.

456
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,620
She seems like a great girl.

457
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,700
You know, I've been around.

458
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,140
I had a chance
to meet a few people.

459
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,700
There's not as many great ones
out there as you would think.

460
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,580
So how come
you stopped calling?

461
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,620
One day we're talking
and the next thing I know...

462
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,700
You disconnected
your phone, Dad.

463
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Well, so did you.

464
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,020
That was my dorm phone.

465
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,900
I graduated.

466
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,420
I ever tell you about the first time
I met your mother?

467
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,340
No.

468
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,060
I was at this party.

469
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,780
And she just walked
into the room.

470
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
I wish you could've seen her.

471
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,380
She was 19 years old.
She had this smile that just...

472
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,540
whoo!

473
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,020
Anyway, I get her number,

474
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,300
and then I start to...

475
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,180
talk to this other girl, see?

476
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,540
Was gonna make her jealous.

477
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,100
And that...

478
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,580
is when this shoe

479
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,300
hits me right in the head.

480
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,140
She hucked a shoe

481
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,900
straight across the room...

482
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,860
hit me right here,
drew a little blood.

483
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,140
But she had a hell
of an arm.

484
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,060
- Mmm!
- I guess so.

485
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,740
Oh, bam!

486
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,300
I think it was that smile, though.
That's what got me.

487
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,500
Oh, that was something else.

488
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,820
What about you?
You gonna marry her?

489
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,860
- What? Lucy?
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,460
Ah, we're just friends.

491
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,220
Friends?

492
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,100
That girl, she's finer
than the hair on a frog.

493
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,180
What the... what are you thinkin'?

494
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,860
Uh, well,

495
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,020
we used to go out,

496
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,220
but, uh, I don't know.

497
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,660
I guess I was too focused
on the game.

498
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,700
How's that slump going?

499
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,460
I'm working
my way out of it.

500
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,780
Look, I'm gonna go.

501
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,980
We should probably leave
first thing in the morning

502
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,940
- so try to get some rest.
- Hey, uh,

503
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,580
thanks for finding me.

504
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,460
Son, thanks for gettin' me.

505
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,860
See you in the morning.

506
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,860
Hey.

507
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,820
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,340
From flying and everything.

509
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,020
I miss you.

510
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,700
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe any of this shit.

511
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,700
Reeves is gonna take me out of
the lineup if I don't play well on Saturday,

512
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,260
my mom is in a hospital bed
convinced she's about to die

513
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,100
and this guys is, I don't know,
just out with a barfly.

514
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,100
That's...

515
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,980
I mean, who does that?

516
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,580
How could anybody do that?

517
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,220
Hey, um,
there's something

518
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,660
that I've been trying
to tell you,

519
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,180
but it felt really weird.

520
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,260
What?

521
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,660
Jason proposed to me.

522
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,580
I know it's a bad time,

523
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,580
but I felt really weird
keeping it a secret

524
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,460
from you.

525
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,980
And it's one of the reasons why
I have to get back on Wednesday.

526
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,740
What did you say?

527
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,620
I told him I'd think about it.

528
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
What does that mean?
Are you...

529
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,540
are you leaning
in a particular direction?

530
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
I don't know.

531
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,460
Jesus.

532
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,460
Uh...

533
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,340
well, that is news.

534
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,980
Shit.

535
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,100
That's, uh...
that's great.

536
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,740
I mean, Jason is, uh...

537
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,140
he's, uh...
he's a great guy.

538
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,420
And, uh...

539
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
I thought you'd...

540
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,020
you know.

541
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,980
No. No.

542
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,940
I know it may not
seem like it sometimes,

543
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,420
but I want you to be happy.

544
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,820
You know?
I love you.

545
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,300
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- Yeah.

546
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,380
- You, dear?
- No, thank you.

547
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,180
We're just waiting
on someone.

548
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,060
I'll see you later now.
Bye bye.

549
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,860
Okay.

550
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,820
I want you to wear that mask next time.

551
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,620
All set?

552
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
I guess that's a yes.

553
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,860
If you get tired and you want me
to drive, just let me know.

554
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,540
No thanks. I'm good.

555
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,300
So I hear you're
working on a novel.

556
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,740
- Nope.
- That's not what I heard.

557
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,340
Well, you heard wrong.

558
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,900
Whatcha workin' on then?

559
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,900
One day I'd like to write a book.

560
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,340
Right now I just do
journal entries.

561
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,980
- Journal entries.
- Yup.

562
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,540
What's that, like a diary?

563
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,180
No, it's like
a writer's notebook.

564
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,060
Short stories, essays...
stuff like that.

565
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,540
Why don't you just
write the novel?

566
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,140
I will. Eventually.

567
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,940
Thank you.

568
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,140
Well, you know what
Papa Garrett always used to say:

569
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,300
"There ain't no tomorrow
quite as nice as today."

570
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,060
Of course, that's just one man's opinion.

571
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,060
It sure is nice country.
Beautiful, hmm?

572
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,020
Yup.

573
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,420
Rolaid?

574
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,340
No. Thanks.

575
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,940
Go on, have one.

576
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,620
Why would I want a Rolaid?

577
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,220
Well, I don't know.
Might be for relief.

578
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,020
You know, I don't know
where along the way

579
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,780
you became so joyless, son,

580
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,140
but that's probably why
you can't hit the ball anymore.

581
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,100
You're not having fun out there,
you don't stand a chance.

582
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,540
Hey, the guy in there said

583
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,060
there's a lot of
construction on the 65.

584
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,580
He said we should take
this one... the 79, I think.

585
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,540
Well, that sounds like a good idea.

586
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,140
Well...

587
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,340
That big ol' red Hummer looks like
I'm about to do battle with something.

588
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,380
But what the heck?

589
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,340
That did not say 79.

590
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,060
- This is like an access road.
- The map says it'll curve around.

591
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Keep curving.
It's like a slider...

592
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,580
keeps heading south.

593
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,860
And he hit that ball
so damn hard

594
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,980
that I'm coming
around like this, you know?

595
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,540
'Cause you know what Dr. Pepper is,
don't you?

596
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,820
You know what it is?

597
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,740
Okay, look,

598
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,620
this is the exact same
intersection we were at.

599
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,900
Take a right.

600
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,980
- Operator.
- Yeah, hi.

601
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,900
Operator, I'm in a phone booth

602
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,140
somewhere, obviously,

603
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,540
and I was... well, I was hoping
you could tell me where that might be.

604
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
You want me
to tell you where you are?

605
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,260
Yeah yeah. Yes, please. From your little
computer map there or whatever.

606
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,980
From my what?

607
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,140
Sir, will you please speak up?
I can't hear you.

608
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,820
Sir?

609
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,900
Hello?

610
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,100
Hey, Dad,

611
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,260
instead of just waving
at the next car that drives by,

612
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,020
maybe the next one you just flag 'em down
and ask 'em where the hell we are.

613
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,220
Yeah.
Great.

614
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
A Kentucky phone booth?

615
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,900
We kind of got off the highway.

616
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,900
And I can't get any
cell range out here.

617
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,620
Now we're completely lost.

618
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,700
Sounds like you're on
an interesting ride.

619
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,620
Yeah, well, I'm a little more
concerned about you right now.

620
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,060
Yeah, well, you mustn't
ever ignore the ride, honey.

621
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,620
Mom, okay, the truth of it is
I don't know how long this is gonna take.

622
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,980
And I just don't think
it's a good idea to wait for us.

623
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,100
Well, that's not
your decision to make.

624
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,500
Mom, we could be
talking about your life.

625
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,260
We are talking about my life.

626
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,100
Right.

627
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,540
All I'm asking
is that you do your best.

628
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,420
Look, I'm gonna
get him down there, okay?

629
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,380
- I promise you that.
- You do that.

630
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,180
I'll call you when we get
further down the road.

631
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,100
Let's go.

632
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,780
Come on, forget the map.
We'll stop and ask at the first place we see.

633
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,020
- I think we're on Farm Road 20.
- Whatever. Let's go.

634
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,540
- What is your problem?
- Problem?

635
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,780
- Yeah!
- Problem? I think it's plural, Lucy.

636
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,700
- I think I have problems.
- Okay, first of all,

637
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,780
stop calling me "Lucy."
My whole life

638
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,780
it's been "honey" or "baby"
or whatever,

639
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,300
and now all of a sudden
it's "Lucy."

640
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,780
And second of all, have you
even stopped for a minute

641
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,220
- to think about why I came on this trip?
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

642
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,180
- You have?
- Yeah.

643
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,340
- Really? Why?
- I know exactly why!

644
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,900
- Why?
- To rub it in.

645
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,820
- What?
- I blew it, okay?!

646
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,420
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me

647
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,260
and I fucked it all up!
What else do you want me to do?!

648
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,460
Do you want me to take this bumper
and plunge it through my chest?!

649
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,140
- Yes, that would be a start!
- Fine! Fine!

650
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,100
What are you doing?

651
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,060
You look like an idiot!

652
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,140
I am an idiot, okay?!
Are you happy now?

653
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,460
I am an idiot, okay?
That's me.

654
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,340
So do you two
have a favorite song?

655
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,980
You know,
like a couple's song?

656
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,700
No.

657
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,980
"Que Sera, Sera."

658
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh yeah.

659
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,340
I remember that one.
That's a good one.

660
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,060
There was this singer
called Jonny Ace

661
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,940
back in the day.

662
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,460
He had this beautiful song

663
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,580
called "Forever My Darling."

664
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,140
It was a real dandy.
That was his mother and mine's.

665
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,820
# Forever my darling #

666
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,340
# I'll always be true #

667
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,980
# From now till forever #

668
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,980
# I'll love only you... #

669
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,500
# Just promise me, darling #

670
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,500
# Your love in return #

671
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,180
# Make this fire in my soul, dear #

672
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,100
# Forever burn. #

673
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,780
That gonna be it?

674
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,260
Maybe just some cyanide.

675
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,380
Uh, Advil would be fine.

676
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,820
My wife makes those.

677
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,700
- How much are they?
- Five bucks.

678
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,980
I think she's
charging too much.

679
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,580
I don't know, man.
Here. I'll take two.

680
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,820
Let's see,
that's gonna be...

681
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,700
$14.50.

682
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,740
- Uh, so...
- Yeah.

683
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,340
So this is gonna be easy.

684
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,340
You just go straight
down here to the 20

685
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,100
and you're gonna see
that sign for the interstate.

686
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,460
Thank you.

687
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,020
- You get it all figured out?
- Yup.

688
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,340
You'd think this humdinger
would have one of them sonar deals

689
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,900
to track our course
straight from the start.

690
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,340
You know what I'm saying?

691
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,260
But then again, we could've
stayed on the interstate.

692
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,460
Well, what the hell do I know?

693
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,580
I'm just Tom
and Hazel's baby boy.

694
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,380
I always kind of wished
that I'd played ball

695
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,500
back when they
used to take trains.

696
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,380
Travel around with the boys.

697
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,260
Wouldn't that be something?

698
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,620
The last team that did that

699
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,260
was the Royals.

700
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,540
Now they...
see, they went

701
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,860
from train to plane.
They never took a bus.

702
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,820
I don't know. I guess
the owner's wife must have died

703
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
in a bus crash or something.

704
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,980
Something chapped your hide?

705
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,300
- What, me?
- Yeah, you. Yeah.

706
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,100
No.

707
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,220
- Well, what is it then?
- Nothing.

708
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
You don't like my stories,
you can just say so.

709
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,460
Dad, it's not that.

710
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
I just... I'm worried about
a lot of things right now.

711
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,820
I'm sorry if I'm a little pensive.

712
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,980
- Pensive.
- Yeah, I guess I'm just distracted.

713
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,220
I know what it means.

714
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,860
I wasn't suggesting that you
didn't know what it meant.

715
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,820
Just because you make
diary notes now,

716
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,940
you think you're the only
literate one in the family?

717
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,660
- Is that about right?
- What?

718
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,380
- Okay, what's happening here?
- I'll tell you what's happening.

719
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,660
You're being a pissant.

720
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,020
- Excuse me?
- You got two good people

721
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,820
to agree to go on this
whole road trip with you.

722
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,780
You ain't being very nice
to either of them.

723
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,100
Maybe you should appreciate
what you've got in front of you.

724
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,660
My mom is waiting for you
in an emergency room

725
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,260
and you have the gall
to criticize me?!

726
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,600
You're the worst husband
in the history of time!

727
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,800
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?!

728
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,680
This whole thing
is a revenge thing.

729
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,240
- What are you talking about?!
- Hey, let me tell you something.

730
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,400
I don't owe you anything!

731
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,760
Understand that.
I never have and I still don't.

732
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,320
Who said you owed me anything?!
I don't want anything from you!

733
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,840
- What do you call this?!
- This is for Katherine!

734
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
What part of your brain
can't understand that?

735
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,000
Hey hey, I don't spend my life
just hanging on a coat rack.

736
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,560
- What?!
- For five years, not one word?!

737
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,160
- Oh, come on!
- You don't call me

738
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,120
- for five years?!
- Nobody called me either!

739
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,240
- I called you last.
- No you didn't!

740
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,040
I left you a message
two Christmasses ago.

741
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, and I left one for you
on New Year's!

742
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,760
That was three
New Years' ago!

743
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,080
What are you doing?

744
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,200
Shit.

745
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,440
- What happened? Here.
- Get away from me!

746
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,520
- Let me help you
- Get away from me!

747
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,120
- You okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fi...

748
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,360
What the hell'd you do to him?

749
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
Hey, how's he doing?

750
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Well, he's pretty banged up,

751
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,120
but I gave him a shot of cortisone.
Should do the trick.

752
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,280
I'll refill his prescriptions
and you can pick 'em up at the pharmacy.

753
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,040
- All right, thank you so much.
- Sure thing.

754
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,840
- Are you holding up okay?
- Yeah, I...

755
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,840
I have a bit of a snowball effect
thing happening here,

756
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,040
- but I'm fine.
- Oh, you don't sound fine.

757
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,800
What's on your mind?

758
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,480
I don't know, Grandad.

759
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,680
I guess I thought I knew
what I was doing with my life

760
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,520
and I'm starting to think
I just screw everything up.

761
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,320
You know,
I'm no one to give advice,

762
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,960
but I can tell you this:

763
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,000
Life is about
screwing things up, Carlton.

764
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
That's what we're here for.

765
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,560
It's the things you screw up
and still have the courage to fight for.

766
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,080
Those are the things
that usually matter the most.

767
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,960
Okay?

768
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,160
Okay.

769
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,360
It's open.

770
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,600
It's open!

771
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,840
Hey, Kyle, it's me.

772
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,440
Oh. Hey.
Come in.

773
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,240
- Ol' doc took care of me.
- Well, good.

774
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm gonna get your
prescription in a minute.

775
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,800
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'm gonna pick that up myself.

776
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,080
I just need to
take a little time here.

777
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,800
Everything all right?

778
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,760
Yeah.
Um, I was just wondering

779
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
if I could talk to you
for a minute.

780
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
A minute? Yeah, you could talk
to me for a whole hour.

781
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,560
Come here. Sit down.

782
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,600
What you got
on your mind, darlin'?

783
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,240
Well, remember the other day
at the gas station

784
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,080
when I got your bag for you?

785
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,920
Yeah.

786
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,080
What are you doing out here?

787
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
I was just thinkin'

788
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,280
What were you
thinking about?

789
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,440
Actually, um,

790
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,000
I was thinking about

791
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,640
that time in Galveston.

792
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,960
Do you remember that carnival
in Galveston?

793
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,960
There was that big fat guy
who would not

794
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,360
sell me that heart-shaped
necklace you wanted.

795
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,240
Yeah. He made you
trade him your watch for it.

796
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,560
Yeah.
That's right.

797
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,280
That was a fun night.

798
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,920
It sure was.

799
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,200
- Do you still have it?
- What, the necklace?

800
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,400
I don't know. Yeah.

801
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,920
I doubt it.

802
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,640
Hey, I...

803
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,240
I don't want you
to marry him.

804
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,080
I know that I hurt you

805
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,600
and, ha...

806
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,680
and there's nothing I can do
to take it back.

807
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,280
You just came home
one day and said,

808
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,640
"Sorry, I'm moving to Corpus.
I need to focus on my game."

809
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,760
God. That's because
I was an idiot.

810
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,000
Hey.

811
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,760
You're going through
a lot right now. I know.

812
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,360
It's not fair of me
to have brought it up.

813
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,320
No. No, it's completely fair.

814
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,240
It's completely fair.

815
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,960
I just want you to know
how sorry I am...

816
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,640
and that if you thought
there was ever a chance that...

817
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,120
that you could forgive me...

818
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,680
What, for being an idiot?

819
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,400
Yeah.

820
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,680
And for not cherishing you.

821
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,800
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go
get your dad's prescription.

822
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,520
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

823
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,760
How you holding
up there, pardner?

824
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,000
- Not to bad.
- Oh, hell. That's better 'n most.

825
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,200
What can I get for you?

826
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,200
Why don't you start me off
with a good old cold beer?

827
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,120
Lonestar if you've got one.

828
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,240
I know you from somewhere?

829
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,040
No, I don't think so.

830
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,240
You're Kyle Garrett, aren't you?

831
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,640
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I have been called worse.

832
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,200
What are you doing here?

833
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
Well, I'm drinking.

834
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,280
- Hey.
- Hey. Where are you?

835
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,400
I'm still in Kentucky,
but I should be back tomorrow night.

836
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,160
I'm gonna fly out of Memphis.

837
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,640
I thought you were
gonna be back last night.

838
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,640
I don't understand
any of this.

839
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,520
It's just something
that I had to do, Jason.

840
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,240
It doesn't mean anything.

841
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,160
It doesn't mean that I don't...

842
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,480
I wish I just knew what
was going on, you know?

843
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,560
Well, I'll just have to explain it
when I get back then, okay?

844
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,080
" You're supposed to do this.
You're supposed to do that,"

845
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,800
and on and on,
nagging.

846
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,640
And I turn to him
and I say,

847
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,520
"I may not know much,
but what I do know

848
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,960
I know the hell out of."

849
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,640
Son of a bitch docks me
two days' pay!

850
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,680
- No! That son of a...
- Hey, I was looking earlier for you.

851
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,400
- Hey.
- Come on in here.

852
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,520
This is...
Johnny, this is my son.

853
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,800
Welcome.
Glad you made it.

854
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,160
- Carlton Garrett.
- Nice to meet you.

855
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,880
He's a ballplayer like his old man,
what you call a natural-born athlete.

856
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,240
- How about getting him a Lonestar?
- All right, slugger.

857
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,600
Give me one of those too,
would you please?

858
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,920
Whoa.
Oh oh.

859
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,200
Time for the Lonestar
to take a load off.

860
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,320
Let's get a table.

861
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,040
Come on, just the two of us.

862
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,160
You sure it's a good idea

863
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,840
to drink with all these
painkillers and everything?

864
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,000
Oh, always
a good idea to drink.

865
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,920
- Oh, thank you, Johnny.
- Thank you.

866
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,920
Hey, I don't care
what they say about you.

867
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,360
You're a good man.

868
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,080
Remember it.

869
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,920
- Lucy got these for you.
- Aww.

870
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,880
She's a peach, that girl.

871
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,120
Whew. 25.

872
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,000
I'd kill a man to be 25 again.

873
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,680
You would?

874
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,040
You talk to her?
Your mother?

875
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,960
How's she doing?

876
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,600
She's hanging in there.

877
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,800
Well, I'll tell you something.

878
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,160
I know this old boy,
works for the airlines in Dallas...

879
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,840
Walter Henry Heigan.

880
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,040
And he's got his top guy
here in Memphis.

881
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,640
He's gonna walk us
straight through security

882
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,200
right onto the plane.

883
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,400
- Just show up?
- Yup. That's it.

884
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,960
You don't need your ID
or anything?

885
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,760
No, I sure don't.
Talked to him back at the motel.

886
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,880
That's great.
Thanks.

887
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,840
Don't mention it. I figured
I'd slowed us down enough already.

888
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,920
I know you didn't have
to come on this trip.

889
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,560
Oh, forget about it.

890
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,080
I got to spend some time
with my son.

891
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,240
Hey, I don't want to be
telling you your business,

892
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,520
but if I were you and I had
a pretty little thing like that

893
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,480
waiting for me back
at the Blue Moon Motel,

894
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,160
I sure as hell wouldn't be
sitting here with me talking.

895
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,840
All right.

896
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,640
Dad?

897
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,280
I'm sorry I didn't call you
for so long.

898
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

899
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,600
- Guess what?
- What?

900
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,120
- He did it.
- Did what?

901
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,080
Uh, whatever.
That thing you were talking about.

902
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,840
He got us on a flight out
of Memphis in the morning.

903
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,400
I guess somebody's
down there waiting.

904
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,400
Uh, yeah, I know.

905
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,520
I was there
when he figured it out.

906
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,160
He said he wanted
to tell you himself,

907
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,000
otherwise I would've
said something.

908
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,360
Huh.

909
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,320
Well, this is a good development.

910
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,080
I must concur.

911
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,000
You look good.

912
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,480
Thanks.

913
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,600
- Um, did you want to talk about earlier?
- No.

914
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,200
Because...

915
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,120
I'm just gonna read.

916
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,880
Uh...

917
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,840
I'm just gonna take a...

918
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,080
a shower.

919
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,880
Cold shower.

920
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,760
You boys hold down the bar.

921
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,920
The Lonestar shall return.

922
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,440
#... a little girl #

923
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,640
# I asked my mother #

924
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,600
# What would I be #

925
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,400
# Here's what she said to me #

926
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,360
# Que sera, sera #

927
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,480
#Whatever will be, will be. #

928
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,800
Hey, come on.

929
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,200
- Where's Kyle?
- He's gonna meet us at the gate.

930
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,520
Why didn't he just
wait for us?

931
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,920
I don't know. Maybe they had to walk him
through security or something.

932
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,880
Yeah, tell her we'll be in
around 7:00.

933
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,480
Okay. Bye.

934
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,600
We should board.
You ready?

935
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,480
Okay.

936
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,480
- What are you drinking?
- Tasty beverage.

937
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,960
So your friend took care
of your ticket then, huh?

938
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,520
- Yeah.
- That was nice of him.

939
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,920
Yeah, well,
that's old Walter for you.

940
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,760
He even walked me
through security.

941
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,600
I thought you said
Walter was based in Dallas.

942
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,760
He is.

943
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,960
There are two Walters.

944
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,920
His son's actually based here...
Walter Jr.

945
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,880
Walter Jr.

946
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,840
Uh, yeah.

947
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,720
He's a good one.

948
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,000
Heart as big
as all outdoors... Walter Jr.

949
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,320
I'm gonna go find Lucy.
I'll be right back.

950
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,160
Time to go?

951
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,000
What?

952
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,760
- I'd like to know what's going on.
- What do you mean?

953
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,920
I'm trying as hard as I can
to be honest with you.

954
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,360
Okay?

955
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,200
I'm trying as hard as I can
to forgive my father

956
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,160
for being dishonest
his entire life.

957
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,920
And I don't know.
I have this sneaking suspicion

958
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,520
that everyone involved
has been lying to me.

959
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,400
It's not like that.
It just seemed pointless to tell you.

960
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,080
Tell me what?

961
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,640
Well, when I helped
your dad with his bag,

962
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,160
I noticed his wallet in there.

963
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,880
When I asked him about it,
he said it'd be pointless to tell you

964
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,880
because there's no way you'd believe
he'd hide it there intentionally.

965
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,560
Okay, so he made up this whole story
about his airline friend.

966
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,000
And, look, he didn't tell you
'cause he didn't want to upset you.

967
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,440
He didn't want to upset me.

968
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,240
What was I supposed to do?
He's here, isn't he?

969
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,000
You were supposed
to tell me the truth!

970
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,320
I was stuck, okay?
I was stuck in between.

971
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,280
You got him his bag
at the gas station.

972
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,880
- That was two days ago.
- What difference does it make?

973
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,080
We could've flown
out of Louisville.

974
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,800
- We could've been there already.
- No, we couldn't have.

975
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,920
Hey, my mom has been
in the hospital the entire time.

976
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

977
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,160
Will you wait a second, Carlton?

978
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,800
You don't understand.

979
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,560
- Where the hell is he?
- Can we talk about this, please?

980
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,720
Just stop, okay?

981
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,600
He's not in there.

982
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,560
Calm down.
He probably got onboard already.

983
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,160
Why would he board
without us?

984
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,760
I can't believe this.

985
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,120
You don't even care, do you?

986
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,400
No, Carlton.
I don't care.

987
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,960
That's why I came on this trip

988
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,520
and canceled a week of classes
and alienated my fianc.

989
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,320
Oh, so now he's your fianc.

990
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,160
Well, I didn't know
you had accepted.

991
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,960
I'm gonna go try to
find him, okay?

992
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,840
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,
will you... meet me out front.

993
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,480
This is the final boarding call
for flight 580 to Houston.

994
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cabin doors are now closed.

995
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
The captain has turned on
the Fasten Seat Belt sign.

996
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,120
Please make sure
your seat backs and tray tables

997
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,000
are in their upright
and locked position.

998
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,960
- Where are you now?
- Memphis.

999
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,320
I'm afraid I got some bad news.

1000
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,640
Did I ever tell you what I did
for the first 18 years of your life?

1001
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,040
- Mom, come on.
- Sleep deprivation for five years.

1002
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,440
Uh, PTA meetings.
I fit in real well there.

1003
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,160
- Mom.
- Ju-juice-jit...

1004
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,920
- Jujitsu.
- Jujitsu.

1005
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,320
Um, every time you would
leave the house,

1006
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,400
I prayed to Jesus, Buddha,
whoever would listen,

1007
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,440
that you would come back
in one piece.

1008
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,640
I don't regret it. I'm not saying
I regret a second of it, Carlton,

1009
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,080
but if you're gonna tell me
it was all for nothing,

1010
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,360
and now when I need you the most
you're not there,

1011
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,840
then who do I have?

1012
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,840
- Who do I have, Carlton?
- Mom!

1013
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,280
If I don't have you,
who do I have?

1014
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,000
Would you stop
this stuff, please?

1015
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,600
Look, I love you. I love you
and I'd do anything for you,

1016
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,760
but... but he's gone.

1017
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,520
He left me here at the airport.

1018
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,680
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
something real important.

1019
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,400
Sometimes in our life,
some of us anyway,

1020
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,040
we really only get
one person.

1021
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,960
No matter how much we try,

1022
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,200
no matter who else we meet,

1023
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,320
we're not ever gonna love
anybody else

1024
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
as much as we love them.

1025
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,880
What do you want me to do?

1026
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,800
Um...

1027
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,720
well, there's
an old hotel downtown...

1028
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,560
I guess it's still there...

1029
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,680
called The Peabody.

1030
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,920
If your dad's still in Memphis,

1031
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,440
I bet that's where he'll be.

1032
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,160
Actually, if you just want
to keep the same car,

1033
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,280
it'll be cheaper that way.

1034
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,960
Good evening.
How may I help you?

1035
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,840
I'm trying to find someone.

1036
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,520
Last name?

1037
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,720
Garrett.

1038
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,560
No. No one by that name
has checked in yet.

1039
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,720
No reservation.
Nothing.

1040
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,600
- Afraid not.
- All right. I'll take a room if you have one.

1041
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,680
- Just for the one night?
- Just for the one night.

1042
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,040
Hi, this is Lucy.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

1043
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,640
- You doing all right?
- Oh yeah.

1044
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,360
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

1045
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,960
You here on business?

1046
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,880
Uh, sort of.

1047
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,480
What do you do,
if you don't mind my asking?

1048
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,280
Well, uh...

1049
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,520
I'm... I'm a writer.

1050
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,400
A writer. No kidding.
What kind of stuff you write?

1051
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,240
Short stories and stuff like that,

1052
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,720
but I think that I've come up
with an idea for a book.

1053
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,600
Well, that sounds good.

1054
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,280
So you know what
it's gonna be about?

1055
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,160
Actually, I don't know how
it all ends yet,

1056
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,480
but I guess you could say
it's mainly about,

1057
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,400
uh, an idiot.

1058
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,560
- An idiot?
- Yeah.

1059
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,480
- You got a title picked out?
- No.

1060
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,200
I guess I should work on that.

1061
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,520
I'm gonna probably
set it on the road.

1062
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,840
An idiot on the road.

1063
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah.

1064
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,840
- Exactly.
- I'll keep my eyes peeled.

1065
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,000
Great. Well, I should
probably call it a night.

1066
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,640
Sure thing.
I can put that on your room if you like.

1067
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,640
Oh, okay.
Last name's Garrett.

1068
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,360
Oh, so you're here with Kyle.

1069
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,920
What?

1070
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Are you Kyle's son?

1071
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,120
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1072
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,000
He was just in here earlier.
And he was actually talking about you.

1073
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,720
But I thought he said
you were a ballplayer.

1074
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,800
Did he sign for his drinks,

1075
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,400
- put 'em under a room?
- Yeah.

1076
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,960
Yeah, it's under
another name though.

1077
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,320
You want me
to put it on that one?

1078
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,480
Hey, Dad.
Hey!

1079
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,120
- Hey.
- Move your foot.

1080
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,600
- No.
- Move your foot!

1081
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,800
I can't!
You've got it pinned.

1082
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,080
Hey.

1083
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,640
Get out!

1084
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,760
Get the f...

1085
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,040
Get off! Get off of me!

1086
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,040
Get off of me!

1087
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,760
Why didn't you love us?

1088
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,240
I did.

1089
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,240
I just loved myself more.

1090
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
We're leaving

1091
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,600
first thing in the morning.

1092
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,200
All right.

1093
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

1094
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,520
please give a warm welcome
to the Peabody ducks.

1095
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,520
The march of the Peabody ducks
is a time-honored tradition

1096
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,600
dating back to 1933.

1097
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,840
General manager Frank Schutt
and his friend

1098
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,960
returned from
a weekend hunting trip,

1099
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,360
decided to slip
their live duck decoys

1100
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,560
into the hotel's lobby fountain
as a practical joke.

1101
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,880
Hey.
Hi there.

1102
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,240
You all right, Mr. Garrett?

1103
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,920
Oh, this.

1104
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,400
My son bashed my head
into a towel rack, but I'm fine.

1105
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,080
- Thanks for asking, though.
- My pleasure.

1106
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,800
I've always been a huge fan, sir.

1107
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,560
Ah. #11 in the program;
#1 in your heart.

1108
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,120
Have a good day.

1109
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,120
You too.

1110
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,800
What's the deal with the ducks?

1111
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,840
I don't know.
Some kind of custom they have here.

1112
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,080
I guess they live
up on the roof.

1113
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,800
Huh.

1114
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,440
Reminds me of something.

1115
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,040
Yeah, well,
you've seen 'em before.

1116
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,480
Your mother and I,
we used to bring you here

1117
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,280
back... back when
we was a family.

1118
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,400
Here you go, babe.

1119
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,760
back up in Memphis
and he's rented the exact same Hummer.

1120
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,240
Say, uh, is he some kind of
a big deal or something?

1121
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,960
Baseball player.

1122
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,040
Oh, baseball.

1123
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,800
Now there's an exciting sport.

1124
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,600
I think I'd rather watch
the grass grow.

1125
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,160
Thanks.

1126
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Hey.

1127
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,440
All right, there you boys go.

1128
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,440
Hey. She got an infection.
They had to take her in.

1129
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,760
- What?
- They took Katherine into surgery.

1130
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,320
- They're right over there, sir.
- Oh.

1131
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,040
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1132
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,400
- Hey there, Amon.
- Hey.

1133
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,320
- Kyle, how you doing, buddy?
- All right.

1134
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,600
- How you doing? Virg'
- Kyle.

1135
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,720
Uh, I just got through talking
to the chief of staff.

1136
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,720
He was telling me
that this surgeon that they got for her

1137
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,880
is one of the top in the country.

1138
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,240
They say he's highly regarded.

1139
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,280
Yeah.

1140
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,800
So, uh...

1141
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,080
she's gonna be fine.

1142
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,560
Hey, how is she?

1143
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,400
She's, uh, still
in the operating room.

1144
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,760
Doctors won't
tell us anything.

1145
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,320
But I think it's taking longer
than we expected.

1146
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,640
So...

1147
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,800
- Hey, look...
- I'm not... I'm not mad at you.

1148
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,240
I understand.

1149
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,040
Well, we're still waiting, so...

1150
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,640
Hey there, folks.

1151
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,960
Okay, well, we're gonna
keep her here for about 10 days,

1152
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,760
watch her progress,
but I think she's gonna be all right.

1153
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,840
Oh.

1154
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,480
But the truth is
it's never gonna be the same.

1155
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,680
I will say if she takes
care of herself,

1156
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,440
if the patch
doesn't break down,

1157
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,080
then I think she
has a real good chance.

1158
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,040
Well, thank you, Doctor.

1159
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,760
Thanks for saving my girl.

1160
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,120
Yes, sir.

1161
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,560
They'll move her into recovery

1162
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,720
and then I'll have the nurse
show you where she is

1163
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,880
- so y'all can get her settled.
- Sure appreciate it, Doc.

1164
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,000
- Have we met before?
- No,

1165
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,960
but I sure am glad
to know you now.

1166
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,320
All right.

1167
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,840
Here you go.

1168
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,640
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1169
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,200
I was having this dream.

1170
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,760
Yeah?

1171
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,640
What was it about?

1172
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,200
I don't know.

1173
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,400
We were both in it.

1174
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,400
I remember that.

1175
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,200
And that was nice.

1176
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,360
Well, you know how that goes.

1177
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
You're gonna get up,
you're gonna have your coffee

1178
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,200
and then as the day goes on

1179
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,200
you're gonna start
to see little clues.

1180
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,520
Yeah.

1181
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,360
I love how that happens.

1182
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,800
Little clues.

1183
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,240
Life was so new
and exciting.

1184
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,200
Yeah, it was.

1185
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,200
I talked to the doctors.

1186
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,040
They said you're gonna be fine.

1187
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,920
How's our son?

1188
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,440
Our son was raised
by an amazing woman.

1189
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,480
I think he's
gonna be fine too.

1190
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,440
After 82 years of hanging around,

1191
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,160
there's one thing
I've figured out,

1192
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,520
one thing I know for sure.

1193
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,920
Yeah? What's that?

1194
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,920
I can't tell you.

1195
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,680
What?

1196
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,120
I want to, I really do,

1197
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,560
but I can't put it
into words right now.

1198
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,520
Any reason

1199
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,200
you would bring it up
at all then?

1200
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,440
Just felt like talking.

1201
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,480
Ahh.

1202
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

1203
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,600
Carlton, there's something
I have to tell you.

1204
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,160
I'm not gonna play
baseball anymore.

1205
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,080
What are you talking about?

1206
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,600
I don't think
I ever really liked it.

1207
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,640
- It's been your whole life.
- I know,

1208
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,840
but I don't want it to be.

1209
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,920
Not anymore.

1210
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,720
What are you gonna do?

1211
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,080
Get "The Gazette" to hire me
to write for sports.

1212
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,800
Maybe I could work
on my book.

1213
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,800
So you're gonna be a writer.

1214
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,560
Ah, maybe.

1215
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,600
Carlton, he's not my fianc.

1216
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,920
I don't know why
I ever called him that.

1217
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,560
Look...

1218
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,160
I know that I'm gonna screw
things up every now and then,

1219
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,360
and I know things
won't be perfect...

1220
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,520
but if you give me
one chance...

1221
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,960
I swear to God
I'll never hurt you again.

1222
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:13,160
#Love is like a dying ember #

1223
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:21,200
# And all the memories remain #

1224
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:27,880
# Through the ages,
I'll remember #

1225
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,000
# Blue eyes crying in the rain. #

1226
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,880
Looks like a good day to fly.

1227
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,840
No storm.

1228
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,200
- You got your wallet?
- Got it.

1229
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,680
Oh, yeah, almost forgot.

1230
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,280
I don't know if you want this.

1231
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,560
- Oh.
- I found that in the bathroom.

1232
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,160
Yeah.
Thanks.

1233
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,680
I don't know
if you'd be interested,

1234
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,120
but maybe one of these days
you could come out there to Arizona.

1235
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,520
We could do Christmas
or something.

1236
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,280
I'd like that.

1237
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,960
Maybe you could
come here for New Year's.

1238
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,640
I'll be here.

1239
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,280
I'll be here for New Year's.

1240
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,280
I'll see you at Christmas then.

1241
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,720
All right.

1242
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,560
# I want you to be my love #

1243
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,000
# I want you to be
my love #

1244
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,000
# 'Neath the moon
and the stars above #

1245
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:51,320
# I want you to be my love #

1246
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,920
# Break a promise,
make a vow #

1247
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,920
# I know you want me now #

1248
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:20,800
# Like I want you #

1249
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,600
# Like I want you #

1250
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:51,000

1254
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,280
# Yeah. #
