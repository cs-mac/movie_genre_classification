1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,155
<i>Hey, I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,835
<i>Here's a couple of things you might need
to know, or maybe you just forgot.</i>

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,950
Bryce Larkin from Connecticut is a spy?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,151
A rogue spy.
Did he try to contact you?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,395
He sent me an e-mail.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,950
<i>Bryce sent me a database
of government secrets...</i>

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,232
<i>...that are now locked in my brain,
keeping me in state of fear...</i>

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,078
<i>...danger and anxiety.</i>

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,191
Bryce Larkin
pretended to be his buddy...

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,470
...sexed up his girl,
got him kicked out of Stanford.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,473
If Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,478
Stanford was five years ago.
You need to move on.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,832
It's our subconscious
that we're gonna be talking about today.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,230
How can we penetrate
the human mind?

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,438
How can we understand it?

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,631
- How many images do you see?
Two.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,398
Five.
- Ten.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,990
There are hundreds of images
compressed inside this picture.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,679
The encoding is special.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,073
You only remember that one.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,236
Your subconscious, though,
saw them all.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,712
We'll see how you do
on the final exam.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,156
I include a section on subliminal
image-recognition where you'Il...

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,669
Um...

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,670
Thank you. We'II, uh...
We'll end early today.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,791
Class dismissed.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,637
Professor, how can we isolate the...?

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,554
This is Glass Castle
reporting hostile contact.

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,392
I made a mistake, Black Coat.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,676
I copied intel for myself onto a disc.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,674
They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,153
<i>Chuck, we have an emergency.</i>

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,157
We need to talk.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,355
I'm on the phone.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,394
Shh. Not here, not here.
There are spies at the Buy More.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,039
- Spies, really?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,470
Yeah, Tang's minions, man.
They're everywhere.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,916
<i>He's like Sauron
from Lord of the Rings.</i>

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,634
Only, he's taken control
of the assistant managership.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,638
Yeah, from me.
Right, thanks for the reminder.

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,592
Got it, man.
Listen, we need your help.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,639
- Help, what am I supposed to do? I'm...
- Just one small hobbit?

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,394
So thought Frodo Baggins, my friend.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,471
So thought Frodo Baggins.

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,678
"Rules and regulations
for the Buy More break room.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,233
From the desk of Harry Tang"?

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,833
He doesn't even have a desk.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,150
This is an affront to human decency.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,108
"No swearing. No expectorating.
No fornicating. "

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,113
- Wait, have people been getting freaky?
- No, no.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,555
But I like to know
that I have the option.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,395
- Okay, so it's a little strict.
- It's torture, man.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,630
The no-drug policy includes Red Bull.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,832
Oh, ouch. I remember the last time
you tried to detox.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,389
How am I supposed to move electronics
with the sweaty shakes?

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,074
I'm sorry, fellas,
but is this the Talk More?

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,949
No, sir. It's the Buy More.

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,674
So why don't you get back
to helping these customers...

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,150
...buy more electronics, Mr. Grimes?

60
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,316
I'm sorry, but is Harry wearing
a new assistant-manager polo shirt?

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,511
It's monogrammed.

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,749
- He must be stopped.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,592
Wow. That new High-Def screen
sure shows every wrinkle.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,119
They can hear you.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,072
What? Twinkle.

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Every twinkle in her eye.

67
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,551
Eyes.

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,948
<i>We have a situation.</i>

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,270
<i>A CIA asset has gone missing.</i>

70
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,153
<i>We've had no communication
from him for two days.</i>

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,150
- No way.
- What, did you flash?

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,955
No, I don't have to.
That guy was my professor at Stanford.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,034
Wait. Asset, he's CIA?
My professor was a spy?

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,435
The CIA recruits on campuses
across the country.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,353
Professor Fleming is a company scientist,
not an operative.

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,351
<i>This is our last communication
from him.</i>

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,034
<i>This is
Glass Castle reporting hostile contact.</i>

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,918
<i>I made a mistake, Black Coat.</i>

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,753
<i>I copied intel for myself onto a disc.</i>

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,154
<i>They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.</i>

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,075
<i>- Do we know what intel he copied?
We don't.</i>

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,398
<i>He's handled many sensitive projects
for us. Any leak could prove devastating.</i>

83
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,994
<i>- How can we help?
- Fleming has contacts in L.A.</i>

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,755
<i>- Lf we find him, you can extract him.
- We'd like your help on this, Chuck.</i>

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,755
Look, I don't think
I'm your go-to guy on this one.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,030
<i>Your knowledge of Fleming
and Stanford is key here.</i>

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,875
<i>We only have his official reports.
You have a personal connection.</i>

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,231
Yeah, I do have a personal connection.
Very bad personal connection.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,032
You guys have the file.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,595
You know all about Fleming
and what happened to me.

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,239
The guy kicked me out of school.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,197
Professor Fleming is one of us.

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,278
Maybe you can find somebody else
to help you this time.

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,759
Maybe Just this once.

95
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,872
I'm going deep.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,630
Who invited the UCLA brain trust?

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,751
Those are Devon's fraternity brothers.

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,839
We are all caravanning up to Stanford
for the UCLA game this weekend.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,036
Hey, Chuck. Go deep, bro.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,994
Ooh.

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,593
Right in the pills.

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,030
Don't touch, don't.
Please don't touch me.

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,310
Come on, man.
Let me make it up to you, bro.

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,789
Get up.
I got you a ticket for the game.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,479
Wow.

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,758
Thanks. But, uh, Sarah
and I already have plans.

107
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,552
It's your alma mater, dude.

108
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,274
Look, no offense,
but I'd rather get hit...

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,870
...in the produce section again
than go back to that place.

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,958
Ha, ha. Suit yourself.
Let's go. Game on, boys.

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,071
- Where's the ball?
Let's do this.

112
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,234
Uh, listen, I know that Stanford doesn't
hold a lot of good memories for you...

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,038
Look, Ellie, Ellie.

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,475
They kicked me out
for something I didn't do.

115
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,473
Okay? So that's it. Me and Stanford?

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,557
We're officially done.

117
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,473
Sucks you have to leave, Chuck.

118
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,035
I don't get it, Bryce.

119
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,428
Why are you doing this?

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,910
You did this to yourself.

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,997
What?

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,072
I Just flashed on myself.

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,629
Why am I in the Intersect?

124
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,476
So you don't know
why I'm in the Intersect.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,428
Well, you didn't appear on the NSA radar
until after Bryce sent you the Intersect.

126
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,068
- Same with the CIA.
- Why don't I find that reassuring?

127
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,629
The files that you saw
were of you in college, right?

128
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,354
Yes, yes.
Wait, what about Professor Fleming?

129
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,835
I was in his class, he was CIA.
Could that be it?

130
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,554
If we can find Fleming,
maybe he could give us answers.

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,598
- Okay. Let's do that.
It won't be easy.

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,830
Intel suggests the professor's
being hunted.

133
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,589
The NSA interviewed one witness
who ID'd a Magnus Einersson.

134
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,954
He's an Icelandic spy.

135
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,270
I'm sorry, Iceland does espionage?

136
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,795
Magnus buys and sells intel
to the highest bidder.

137
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,758
And Iceland isn't officially aware
of his activities.

138
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,394
It says here the crossbow
is his weapon of choice.

139
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,551
Oh, what, slingshot's too ineffective?

140
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,229
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- What's up?

141
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,197
My lunch break is over.

142
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,396
- You haven't seen?
- Seen what?

143
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,189
New staggered lunch schedule. Dude.

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,713
Single shifts.

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,797
No more fraternization
in the break room.

146
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,679
We can't even eat lunch
together anymore.

147
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,599
No more Wednesday-Friday
surf and turf?

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,478
Harry Tang is drunk with power.

149
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,914
He could have an accident.

150
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,193
I'm Just saying,
I know a guy, very reasonable.

151
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,639
His rates, I mean.

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,875
Not him.

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,031
Way to think outside of the box,
Anna.

154
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,434
Me likey.

155
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,635
- What do you say, Chuck?
- Are you two crazy? What?

156
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,355
I'm not gonna have a guy rubbed out
Just because he upsets our lunch routine.

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,755
I see.
So you've already thrown in the towel?

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,148
Cool.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,275
Not me, Chuck.

160
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,153
I'm not getting pushed around anymore.
No way.

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,398
I hope you were aiming
for the recycling bin, Grimes...

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,910
...now that I'm instituting
a new Buy More Green program.

163
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,354
Tree-hugging
is all the rage these days.

164
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,200
And I plan on exploiting
the burgeoning conscience...

165
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,828
...of the American consumer.

166
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,315
Oh, that's very inspiring, Harry.

167
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,631
I'm gonna be the one
who breaks you, Grimes.

168
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,590
You know why?

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,196
Because you're soft.

170
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,032
Like pudding.

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,316
I've been doing
all these crunches, man.

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,629
I know, buddy.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
You didn't offer
to kill Harry for Anna, did you?

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,357
No. Why, you want me to kill him?

175
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,596
No. No, Just curious.

176
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,832
We Just got a hit off
a traffic camera in Hollywood.

177
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,914
- That's Fleming.
- Thanks.

178
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,832
You saved me
a lot investigative work there.

179
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,349
- The DMV told me that.
- Wow. Sarcasm, what a surprise.

180
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,314
We located car Fleming's driving, local
address. We're bringing him in a. s.a. p.

181
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,909
- What do you need me for?
- Yours is a friendly face.

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,469
Professor sees you, he'll be
more inclined to cooperate, copy?

183
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,108
Yeah, except that I wasn't
the professor's star pupil.

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,038
We leave in three.

185
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,238
<i>As you're aware, you scored
perfectly on your midterm exam.</i>

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,516
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I was up all night studying.

187
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,557
- It was a monster.
- No offense.

188
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,517
You even aced the last section.

189
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,358
Encoded images.

190
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,790
Yeah, those were Just kind
of a shot in the dark.

191
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,798
You may be aware, I keep an answer key
to every exam locked inside this office.

192
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,393
No, no, I wasn't aware of that.

193
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,635
Really?

194
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,872
Then how do you explain
the midterm answer key...

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,837
...being found in your fraternity room?

196
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,432
I'm sorry. You searched my room?

197
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,710
We received the tip
from a student this morning.

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,478
What? You got a tip about my room?

199
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,559
I need to know how you broke into
this office and stole the answers, Chuck.

200
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,359
I didn't steal anything.
I don't have to, I'm acing your class.

201
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,671
Exactly. The student also claimed
that you're selling copies.

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,915
What?

203
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,197
I know you're a scholarship student
and Stanford is a very expensive school.

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,115
Look, whoever gave you your tip
was lying.

205
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,279
Our source was Bryce Larkin.

206
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,789
Your roommate.

207
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,631
All right. We all know the game.

208
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,279
We all know the rules.

209
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,237
This is Fingers of Fury.

210
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,035
The win goes to the contestant who can
identify the most TV shows in a minute.

211
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,031
All right. Who do you want next?

212
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,319
I challenge the ruling champion,
Morgan Grimes.

213
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,875
That's Mr. Morgan Grimes,
if you're nasty.

214
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,832
- Really?
- Oh, the suspense.

215
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,553
- You don't want me, punk.
- I do.

216
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,352
- Challenge accepted.
- Bang.

217
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,878
On my mark.

218
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,595
Three, two, one.

219
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,199
Mark.

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,759
<i>Dukes of Hazzard.
One Tree Hill.</i>

221
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,831
<i>Veronica Mars. Cold Case.
Gilmore Girls. Nip/ Tuck.</i>

222
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,314
<i>- Animaniacs.

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,549
<i>- Smallville.
O. C., season two.</i>

224
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,829
<i>Pinky and the Brain.

225
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,679
<i>- Kung Fu: The Movie.
- Night Court. Night Court.</i>

226
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,150
They're not changing.
Anna, the channels are not changing.

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,316
It is now mine.

228
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,669
The one remote that controls them all.

229
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,916
The master remote.

230
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,317
- Your slacking days are over.
- Tang, there aren't even any customers.

231
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,476
Three repair orders Just came in...

232
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,552
...which you nerds would know
if you were at your stations.

233
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,469
And, Grimes,
since there aren't any more customers...

234
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,996
...I need a cleanup
in the diaper-changing station.

235
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,394
Wear a mask.

236
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,033
We'll extract the professor
as quickly as possible.

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,519
You'll keep watch?

238
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,557
If I flash on any bad guys, I'll call.

239
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,318
Everything looks quiet, but...

240
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,875
I know, I know, stay in the car.

241
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,508
Okay, good. Let's go.

242
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,358
Professor Fleming. Hey.

243
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,915
No, no, no, wait, professor,
it's me, Chuck.

244
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,311
Professor, stop.
We're here to extract you, Glass Castle.

245
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,795
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,560
But it's... It's Chuck.

247
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,514
I was in your Psychology
and Symbolism class at Stanford.

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,114
- I don't know if you remember me.
- Chuck Bartowski.

249
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,753
Of course I remember you.

250
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,074
Ha, ha. I guess it's not every day
you kick a guy out of school, huh?

251
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,037
At least, I hope not.

252
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,590
So you're, uh, with the Agency now.

253
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,196
- Why didn't you say so?
- I don't think I'm supposed to, really.

254
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,755
Well, we have code phrases.

255
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,480
- Didn't they train you?
- I mostly Just stay in the car.

256
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,958
Next time, if it's a dangerous situation,
say, "Are you coming to the toga party?"

257
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,879
"Are you coming...?"
A real code phrase.

258
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,359
I like it. That's awesome.

259
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,118
What are we doing?
Who's bringing me in?

260
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,795
Oh, right. Yeah.
So Sarah and Casey will do that.

261
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,713
But, um, I was wondering
if I could ask you something first.

262
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,195
Why did the CIA
have a file on me at Stanford?

263
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,589
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,236
Oh, hey. Hey.

265
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,356
Hey, hey, buddy.

266
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,069
Let's not beat ourselves up.
You know, the past is the past.

267
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,916
Okay. Look, we didn't really know
each other that well at college.

268
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,389
And this is a little awkward, so...

269
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,357
What the...?

270
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Oh, boy. Hey, hey, hang in there.

271
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,038
- Hang in there.
- I put in...

272
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,839
Give this to Bryce Larkin.

273
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,793
Bryce? Bryce Larkin? What...?

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,718
What did Bryce have to do with this?

275
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,433
Ah.

276
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,949
Ah.

277
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,512
I'm nobody, I swear.

278
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,796
Casey, come on. Over here.

279
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,349
Man down, man down! Help me!

280
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,710
Help. Hey, hey, come on.

281
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,558
Come on.

282
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,557
I'm sorry, Chuck, but we have to talk.

283
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,755
Okay.

284
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,636
So how was the hospital?
Is the professor gonna be okay?

285
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,389
- They're putting him into surgery now.
- We can't talk to him, sort this mess out.

286
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,279
- You sure it was Magnus you saw?
- Gee, I don't know, Casey.

287
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,749
How many psycho archers
do you know?

288
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,190
I asked Fleming
about why I was in the Intersect.

289
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,113
- Should've brought him to you, sorry.
- It's not your fault.

290
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,151
I keep thinking about what he said.

291
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,709
Why would he want me
to bring those numbers to Bryce?

292
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,678
Bryce must have been one
of his CIA contacts.

293
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,956
Fleming was probably never told
of his death.

294
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,037
List off the numbers you remember.

295
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,549
There were like 10 of them.
A couple of nines.

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,029
- Five, started with a two.
That's it?

297
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,119
- You have a computer for a brain...?
- It was a very stressful situation, okay?

298
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,555
I watched a guy
get skewered by a crossbow.

299
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,113
Look, Fleming knew something.

300
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,788
Before he fell, he said, "I'm sorry. "
Why would he say that?

301
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,552
I don't know, Chuck.

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,712
Yeah, well, I think he might know
why I'm in the Intersect.

303
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,432
You okay?

304
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,718
It's not late for you to change your mind
about revisiting the old alma mater.

305
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,593
- Spending time with me and Devon.
- Oh, please.

306
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,190
You Just don't wanna be stuck in a car
alone with Awesome's frat buddies.

307
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,194
Maybe, or maybe I'm your sister
and I care about you...

308
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,638
...and I think that going back to Stanford
would help you to move on.

309
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,034
I love you, sis.

310
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,196
And I'd take a lot of bullets for you...

311
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,033
...but five hours in a car with Awesome
and his bros, that is asking too much.

312
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,153
Besides, if I came, you wouldn't have
room for your fun old foam finger.

313
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,793
- Stop it.
- What is this?

314
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,192
I don't know, but look at what I found.
See this? It was in my old college stuff.

315
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,796
<i>"The Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire. "</i>

316
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,833
You want me to return it
to the Stanford Library for you?

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,151
No. No, I'd kind of like to finish it.

318
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,272
- See how it ends.
- That book is like four years overdue.

319
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,630
What do you think
Stanford's gonna do, huh?

320
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,869
Expel me?

321
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,992
<i>You're a dead man, Chuck Bartowski.</i>

322
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,550
All right. Come on, Bryce.

323
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,310
Give it up, buddy. I know you're out
of ammo, I've been counting.

324
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,953
Buddy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

325
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,556
You wouldn't fire at an unarmed guy.

326
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,988
I might.

327
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,435
It's hardly sportsmanlike.

328
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,518
What's this?

329
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,516
<i>Gynecology for Geeks.</i>

330
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,317
- You read this?
- No, is it a good read?

331
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,839
Got you. Larkin over Bartowski again.

332
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,997
I know what the numbers mean.
They're for a book in Stanford Library.

333
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,230
Bryce had a place
where he would stash stuff.

334
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,029
He told Fleming about it. Fleming must
have left the intel there for Bryce.

335
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,835
It's a matter of time before Magnus
figures it out and beats us to the book.

336
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,076
- Bingo.
- Unless we can beat him to it.

337
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,516
Bryce kept his stuff on the third floor.
There was a turn...

338
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,919
There was a turn...

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,558
I'd have to be there to remember.

340
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,998
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I have to go back to Stanford.

341
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,639
Cool.

342
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,951
This is really freaking me out.

343
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,437
It's like nothing has changed.

344
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,079
Is that good or bad?

345
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,037
It's, uh...

346
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,758
It's, you know... Yeah, it's... Yeah.

347
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,036
Woo! Go Bruins, huh?

348
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,555
Devon, put me down.

349
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,955
- Put me down. Stop it.
Ha-ha-ha.

350
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,709
You ladies ready to rock?

351
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,718
Yeah, when you put it that way,
maybe not. Okay.

352
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,512
- Nice barbecue.
Woo!

353
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,079
"Woo" you.

354
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,555
Uh, you wanna meet us
at the stadium?

355
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,359
I think we're gonna hang out here
until the game starts.

356
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,348
Yeah. I'm gonna take Sarah
for the Chuck Bartowski memorial tour.

357
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,069
So call me if any rabid Stanford fans
decide to put Awesome in the hospital.

358
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,429
Ah. See you.

359
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,589
- Have fun.
- Bye.

360
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,999
Plant a Stanford tree.

361
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,674
Create a renewable resource
for your children's future.

362
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,559
You wanna save
our environment, huh?

363
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,312
Take a shower, hippie.

364
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,759
Nice Job blending in with the crowd.
Who you rooting for, death?

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,751
Enh. Leave the quips to me.

366
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,275
The library's this way,
across the quad.

367
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,552
What is it?

368
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,109
I don't know, I figured this'd be tough,
but this place...

369
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,350
...is Just a lot to take in, you know.

370
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,669
I used to have so much fun here,
and then...

371
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,915
And then?

372
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,157
It was the worst day of my life,
getting kicked out of here.

373
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,511
Having to hear Ellie's voice
when I told her I was coming home.

374
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,673
Packing up all my stuff
and leaving as Bryce Just stood there.

375
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,512
He said I brought it on myself.

376
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,955
Why do you think
that Bryce betrayed you?

377
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,317
I don't know. He's had four years
to call and set the record straight.

378
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,277
And now that he's gone...

379
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,394
You know what? Forget it.

380
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,358
Bryce has betrayed
a lot of people, hasn't he?

381
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,110
Mm. Roger that.

382
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,638
We have to play this really cool.

383
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,950
Magnus has the book number.
He could have beat us here.

384
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,395
Think he's in there?
- Maybe you should stay here.

385
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,118
Yeah, that always works out well.

386
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,953
You can't find the book without me.
I'm going in.

387
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,278
Oh, no, no, no.

388
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,476
Looking for this?

389
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,111
- You stole my ID?
- I borrowed it to reactivate it.

390
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,748
Sorry, I couldn't wipe the idiot grin
off your face in Photoshop.

391
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,512
Mm.

392
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,078
We have a situation.

393
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,510
We have a situation here.

394
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,352
Harry Tang is a control freak.

395
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,555
And his master remote
is a symbol of that control.

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,358
It's his totem.

397
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,552
We steal the remote,
and we take control of the televisions.

398
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,716
Rendering Harry impotent.

399
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,950
That's totally curable, by the way.

400
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,194
Here's the thing,
he keeps the remote in his locker.

401
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,318
He does, but it's padlocked.
Harry has the only key.

402
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,590
- So...
- I can get it.

403
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,430
Trust me, you do not want to know.

404
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,995
- I do want to know.
- I wanna know.

405
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,998
- You guys wanna know?
You shouldn't make that call.

406
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,754
Assistant Manager Tang?

407
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,635
I'm busy.

408
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,872
I'd like your opinion
about how we could streamline...

409
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,759
...our standing work orders
to operate more efficiently.

410
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,870
That's a admirable goal, young lady.

411
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,596
You know, your new position
of authority has changed you.

412
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,433
You look different.

413
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,596
Maybe it's the new
monogrammed shirt.

414
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,632
Maybe it's Just the cut of your slacks.

415
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,512
I hope you plan to make other changes
around the Buy More.

416
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,393
In fact, I can't wait...

417
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,118
...for your next massive,
invasive move.

418
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,956
Well, ahem, for starters...

419
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,352
...I think that the staff sits around
too far, far too often.

420
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,232
Thank you.

421
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,519
There. There, that row.

422
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,597
Oh, no.

423
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,274
We're too late, Magnus beat us here.
He's got the book.

424
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,038
Hold on.

425
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,153
Got you.

426
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,998
Hold on a second.

427
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,231
- Gotcha.
- The intel.

428
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,990
The book number was Just a way
to mark the spot.

429
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,470
Let's get out here before Magnus
realizes that book he has is worthless.

430
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,959
Hey, you, don't move.

431
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,354
Charles Bartowski?

432
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,268
You still owe the library $294.68
in late fees.

433
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,150
- Do you take credit cards?
This isn't funny.

434
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,394
Chuck, run.

435
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,391
Head for the back door, Chuck.

436
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,829
It's hard to hate Stanford
because they suck so hard.

437
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,991
I wish we were playing
SC today, huh?

438
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,437
- There you are.
Hey, you, freeze!

439
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,240
All right, they spotted us.
Okay, we have to go.

440
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,874
- I swear this school has it in for me.
- Come on.

441
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,109
Excuse us, excuse us!

442
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,909
That guy is wasted.
I want what he had.

443
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,115
Wake up. Wake up.

444
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,549
Jackpot, baby.

445
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,799
Looking for something, Mr. Grimes?

446
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,197
Are you kidding me? You betrayed us?

447
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,677
Nice try, pudding.

448
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,391
I'm not afraid of you.
You can't fire me.

449
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,994
No, but I can make you wish I did.

450
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,270
I need fresh bodies in The Hole.

451
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,118
Come on, dude, not The Hole.

452
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,079
Harry, Just let's...

453
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,518
We're safe for now.

454
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,915
I need to see what's on this disc.
Hey, Chuck.

455
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,991
- That's top secret.
Yeah, well, so am I.

456
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,550
There could be answers on this disk
about why I'm in the Intersect.

457
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,313
That's testing data.

458
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,196
And videotaped interviews.
These are students.

459
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,238
Exactly. Students that were recruited
into the CIA by Fleming.

460
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,233
Ten years worth.
It's all their current information.

461
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,392
No wonder Magnus wanted it so badly.
Foreign governments would pay for that.

462
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,278
Look at this: Bryce Larkin.

463
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,596
Bryce Joined the CIA our Junior year?

464
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,588
- Enough. Now we know what he's after.
- No, wait, that's me. I'm in here too.

465
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,432
- Click it.
- Don't click it.

466
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,272
I never applied to be in the CIA.

467
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,198
Chuck, get down!

468
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,759
Go!

469
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,356
You think this would be a good time
for me to be waiting in the car?

470
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,072
I have an idea. Get me out of here.

471
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,120
Chuck, when I say go,
run out the side door.

472
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,675
Protect the disc. We'll cover you.

473
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,152
Go!

474
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,039
All right. Computers.

475
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,792
Here we go.

476
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,757
Ow.

477
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,150
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,073
Come on.

479
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,551
Excuse me.

480
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,194
<i>Hello?
- Hi. Hi, is this...?</i>

481
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,874
Is this Glenda Mitchell?
We're in the science building.

482
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,071
It's an emergency.
Bring lots of big guns.

483
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,236
I'm sorry,
you've got the wrong number.

484
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,351
Crap, there's a code phrase.

485
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,756
Are you coming to the toga party?

486
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,113
There's a place you can plant it
in the quad. Let me give you directions.

487
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,833
We have a situation right now.

488
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,871
<i>Bring any ammunition.</i>

489
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,917
Any equipment you have
for killing bad guys.

490
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,270
Are you coming to the toga party?

491
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,591
Lots of bad guys are surrounding us.

492
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,751
Are you coming to the toga party?
Bye-bye.

493
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,750
- Agent Katz?
- Yeah, hey, Frodo, is that you?

494
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,797
I thought my codename
was Samwise Gamgee.

495
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,110
Samwise.
Why don't you get your thumb out?

496
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,709
Morgan,
this is really, really not a good time.

497
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,717
It's not a good time here either, okay?

498
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,553
I'm stuck in The Hole
doing customer service. Ow!

499
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,034
<i>These kids are animals.</i>

500
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,435
But I'm at Stanford.
What do you want me to do?

501
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,029
Do you have the code
to Harry Tang's master remote?

502
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,634
<i>I think I can use it to bargain
for my freedom.</i>

503
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,310
<i>Okay, okay.
The code is O-U-8- 1-2-pound.</i>

504
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,040
Dude, this is why you're my hero.
Thank you so much.

505
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,835
Throwing things at adults' heads is not...
That's not gonna help you in life.

506
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,192
Oh, no.

507
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,908
I got two rounds left.

508
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,079
- I've got half a mag.
Drop your weapons and stand up.

509
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,669
Hands where we can see them.

510
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,359
I'm gonna go for it.

511
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,909
- You in?
- You bet.

512
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,274
Hate long goodbyes.

513
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,634
Actually, why don't you drop
your weapons?

514
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,751
- Like someone called the cavalry.
Good.

515
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,349
Because I only had one shot left.

516
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,469
Whew.

517
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,751
- Aren't you in econ. With me?
- Yeah.

518
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,075
Please don't, please don't,
please don't.

519
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,715
Don't.

520
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,874
You must be Chuck Bartowski.
I Just got your message.

521
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,753
- Are you okay?
- I'm Just glad you check your voice mail.

522
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,512
<i>Probably got
a game plan here. He's got a good caddy.</i>

523
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,989
<i>Coming on now
and breaking through the pack.</i>

524
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,795
<i>- She almost got knocked off by two...
- What's going on?</i>

525
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,555
<i>She gets passed...</i>

526
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,234
<i>...has only the pavement to beat
for another critical point.</i>

527
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,277
What's happening?

528
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,111
Grimes!

529
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,713
- Hey, what's up? What going on?
- You reprogrammed my remote.

530
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,276
- Wow, you can do that?
- You've gone too far, Grimes.

531
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,792
I've done nothing. I've been here all day
helping these lovely customers.

532
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,997
But I may be able to fix it.

533
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,310
For a price.

534
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,839
I want out of The Hole.

535
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,999
I'd rather take a potato peeler
to my groin.

536
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,270
Okay. Fine with me.

537
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,113
I hope that Big Mike
doesn't get too upset, though...

538
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,750
...if all the televisions Just happen
to change to, I don't know...

539
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>...Passion Cove?</i>

540
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,839
Quid pro quo, Harry.

541
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,991
Yes or no?

542
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,633
Attaboy. Nice and easy.

543
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,715
Smart man.

544
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,519
You're dismissed.

545
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,079
Go ahead. Yes.

546
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,794
True leader. Yes.

547
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,154
The Grimes.

548
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,511
<i>I can't believe that game
was such a wash.</i>

549
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,715
<i>What a blowout.</i>

550
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,834
Worst game ever.

551
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,878
It's not coming off.
I think I used the wrong kind of paint.

552
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,439
Well, what brand was it?

553
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,398
Brand? I don't know.
One of the guys picked it up.

554
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,630
Try some stronger soap.

555
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,639
So how painful was it?
Not the game, I mean.

556
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,310
Well, uh, do you remember the evening
with Morgan at the karaoke club?

557
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,472
His cover of Peter Cetera's
"Glory of Love" he dedicated to you?

558
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,358
<i>That completely ruined Karate Kid II.</i>

559
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,755
Seriously, though,
thanks for pushing me.

560
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,635
After the initial shock and horror,
it was a relief to finally go back.

561
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,472
Say goodbye.

562
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,318
I'm proud of you. You know?

563
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,040
You faced your past, head-on.

564
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,668
Did you find
what you were looking for?

565
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,317
Almost.

566
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,272
You'll get there.

567
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,955
You didn't think
we'd let you keep that, did you?

568
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,911
I need to know, Sarah.

569
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,115
Okay, Chuck.

570
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,397
<i>Test subject 0326. Bartowski.</i>

571
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,994
<i>This will be his first interview.</i>

572
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,959
<i>Send Chuck in.</i>

573
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,913
<i>Bryce? This isn't a good time.
I'm waiting for another student.</i>

574
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,670
<i>Chuck Bartowski?
He never got your message.</i>

575
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,159
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

576
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,397
<i>You put Chuck
on the CIA recruitment track?</i>

577
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,597
<i>It's not up to me, Bryce.
They want him for the Omaha Project.</i>

578
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,268
<i>That's a military operation.
They'll turn Chuck into...</i>

579
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,477
<i>I'm required to send
all the top test results to the Agency.</i>

580
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,438
<i>- I want my friend out of this.
He's a perfect candidate.</i>

581
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,637
<i>Keywords in his essay responses
correlate to 98 percent...</i>

582
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,472
<i>...of the images in the exam.</i>

583
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,671
<i>You don't get it.</i>

584
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,273
<i>Chuck's a good person.</i>

585
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,150
<i>He's got too much heart
for this kind of work.</i>

586
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,436
<i>He's no operative.</i>

587
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,989
<i>You can't put him out in the field.
He won't survive.</i>

588
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,630
<i>The Agency is not gonna
let go of a recruit this promising.</i>

589
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,360
<i>The amount of information
he can retain...?</i>

590
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,511
<i>They're not gonna give him a choice?</i>

591
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,870
<i>He's in no matter what.</i>

592
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,951
<i>If he cheated on the exam,
copied all the answers...</i>

593
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,793
<i>...it would invalidate the results,
wouldn't it?</i>

594
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,030
<i>Yes.
Good.</i>

595
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,634
<i>Now you're going to help me,
professor.</i>

596
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,074
Bryce framed me for cheating
to save me.

597
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,952
- Why didn't he Just tell me that?
- He couldn't.

598
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,230
They had already recruited him.

599
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,710
If he had a reason
for getting me kicked out...

600
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,314
...maybe he had a good reason
to break into the Intersect too.

601
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,351
And maybe he had a good reason
for sending it to you.

602
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,834
I Just wish I could talk to him.

603
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,638
It must have tore him up
to not be able to tell me.

604
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,714
No one can know about this.

605
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,072
For your own safety, okay?

606
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,713
Sure.

607
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,675
No one would believe me anyway.

608
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,677
You're in Double-E 131?

609
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,875
Catch you later, Bryce.
- It's pretty brutal, huh?

610
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,475
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I...

611
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,275
The only reason I signed up is because
I'm building my own version of, uh...

612
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,395
- It's kind of embarrassing, actually.
- What?

613
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,035
You don't remember
that old computer game "Zork," do you?

614
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,549
- "You are likely to be eaten by a grue. "
- Ha-ha-ha.

615
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,234
- Holy crap, you do remember "Zork. "
- I loved that game.

616
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,470
I haven't thought about it
in a while, but...

617
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,993
It's probably a good thing.

618
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,428
I disagree.

619
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,074
It's 1999.

620
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,831
- Next millennium belongs to the geek.
- All right.

621
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,552
But still, text-based computer games
don't exactly play with the chicks.

622
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,352
Well, this girl, Jill, on my floor
is nuts about EverQuest.

623
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,431
- Are you serious?
- Lf you want, you can meet her.

624
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,200
- Really? Right now?
- Yeah, she's over in the quad.

625
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,035
Uh, yeah. I would very much like
to meet her.

626
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,358
- You need some help?
- No, oh, no, I'm fine. I Just, you know...

627
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,638
College.

628
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,791
- Hi, I'm, uh, Chuck, by the way.
- Bryce.

629
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,758
- Nice to meet you, Chuck.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

630
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,754
So, um, she really likes EverQuest, huh? I
mean, it's not...

631
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,990
Yeah, I think she even plays "Zork. "

632
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,798
Are you kidding?
