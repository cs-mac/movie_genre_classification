1
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:41,472
You look at that river

2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,259
gently flowing by.

3
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,646
You notice the leaves

4
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,695
rustling with the wind.

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,930
You hear the birds.

6
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:55,293
You hear the tree frogs.

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,636
In the distance, you hear a cow.

8
00:00:58,311 --> 00:00:59,937
You feel the grass.

9
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,970
The mud gives a little bit
on the river bank.

10
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:07,553
It's quiet. It's peaceful.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,889
And all of a sudden,

12
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:12,770
it's a gear shift inside you.

13
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:16,421
And it's like taking a deep breath
and going,

14
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,035
"Oh, yeah, I forgot about this."

15
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:31,296
This is the first picture of the Earth
from space

16
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,630
that any of us ever saw.

17
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,507
It was taken on Christmas Eve, 1968

18
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,219
during the Apollo 8 Mission.

19
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,813
...within relatively comfortable
boundaries.

20
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:47,843
But we are filling up that thin shell
of atmosphere with pollution.

21
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:09,885
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Al Gore.

22
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:12,829
I am Al Gore.

23
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:16,194
I used to be the next president
of the United States Of America.

24
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,308
I don't find that particularly funny.

25
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,772
I've been trying to tell this story
for a long time,

26
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,290
and I feel as if I've failed to get
the message across.

27
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:16,480
I was in politics for a long time
and I'm proud of my service.

28
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,592
You gotta be kidding me.
This is a national disaster.

29
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:28,828
Get every doggone Greyhound bus line
in the country,

30
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,718
and get their... moving to
New Orleans.

31
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,498
That's them thinking small, man,

32
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,666
and this is a major, major, major deal.

33
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,167
What do you need right now?

34
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:40,541
There are good people,

35
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,022
who are in politics in both parties

36
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,481
who hold this at arm's length

37
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:50,774
because if they acknowledge it
and recognize it,

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,142
then the moral imperative to make
big changes

39
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,670
is inescapable.

40
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,119
...unless you fix the biggest damn crisis
in the history of this country.

41
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:17,177
...scouted out landing spots
and they lost radio contact

42
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:20,149
when they went around
the dark side of the moon.

43
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:22,654
And there was inevitably
some suspense.

44
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,469
Then when they came back
in radio contact,

45
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,165
they looked up

46
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:30,712
and they snapped this picture,
and it became known as Earth Rise.

47
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,820
And that one picture exploded

48
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,538
in the consciousness of humankind.

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,646
It lead to dramatic changes.

50
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,409
Within 18 months of this picture,

51
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,999
the modern environmental movement
had begun.

52
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:47,065
The next picture was taken on the last
of the Apollo missions,

53
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,629
Apollo 17.

54
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:52,444
This one was taken
on December 11, 1972,

55
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,569
and it is the most commonly published
photograph in all of history.

56
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,918
And it's the only picture of the Earth
from space that we have

57
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:04,377
where the sun was directly
behind the spacecraft

58
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:09,209
so that the Earth is fully lit up
and not partly in darkness.

59
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,718
The next image I'm gonna show you
has almost never been seen.

60
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:18,196
It was taken by a spacecraft
called The Galileo

61
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,668
that went out to explore
the solar system.

62
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:25,467
And as it was leaving Earth's gravity,
it turned its cameras around

63
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,684
and took a time lapse picture
of one day's worth of rotation,

64
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,249
here compressed into 24 seconds.

65
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,929
Isn't that beautiful?

66
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:38,935
This image is a magical image in a way.

67
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,491
It was made by a friend of mine,
Tom Van Sant.

68
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,331
He took 3,000 separate
satellite pictures

69
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:49,714
taken over a three-year period,
digitally stitched together.

70
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,334
And he chose images
that would give a cloud-free view

71
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:55,922
of every square inch
of the Earth's surface.

72
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,963
All of the land masses
accurately portrayed.

73
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,922
When that's all spread out,
it becomes an iconic image.

74
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:08,857
I show this because I wanna tell you
a story about two teachers I had.

75
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:13,782
One that I didn't like that much,
the other who is a real hero to me.

76
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,556
I had a grade school teacher
who taught geography

77
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,726
by pulling a map of the world down
in front of the blackboard.

78
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,563
I had a classmate in the sixth grade
who raised his hand

79
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:29,271
and he pointed to the outline
of the east coast of South America

80
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:33,300
and he pointed
to the west coast of Africa

81
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,492
and he asked,
"Did they ever fit together?"

82
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,346
And he asked,
"Did they ever fit together?"

83
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,032
And the teacher said,

84
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,988
"Of course not. That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard."

85
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,694
That student went on to become
a drug addict and a ne'er-do-well.

86
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,955
The teacher went on to become
science advisor

87
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,553
in the current administration.

88
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:03,570
But, you know,
the teacher was actually reflecting

89
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,417
the conclusion of the scientific
establishment of that time.

90
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:12,184
Continents are so big,
obviously they don't move.

91
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,210
But, actually, as we now know,
they did move.

92
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,264
They moved apart from one another.

93
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:21,329
But at one time they did,
in fact, fit together.

94
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,799
But that assumption was a problem.

95
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,615
It reflected the well-known wisdom

96
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,299
that what gets us into trouble
is not what we don't know,

97
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:32,119
it's what we know for sure
that just ain't so.

98
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:36,502
This is actually an important point,
believe it or not,

99
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:39,417
because there is another
such assumption

100
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:43,409
that a lot of people have in their minds
right now about global warming

101
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,297
that just ain't so.

102
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:48,916
The assumption is something like this.
The Earth is so big

103
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,366
we can't possibly have
any lasting harmful impact

104
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,196
on the Earth's environment.

105
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:57,199
And maybe that was true at one time,
but it's not anymore.

106
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,672
And one of the reasons
it's not true anymore

107
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,664
is that the most vulnerable part
of the Earth's ecological system

108
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,418
is the atmosphere.

109
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,491
Vulnerable because it's so thin.

110
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,785
My friend, the late Carl Sagan,
used to say,

111
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,184
"If you had a big globe
with a coat of varnish on it,

112
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,150
"the thickness of that varnish
relative to that globe

113
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,368
"is pretty much the same

114
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,709
"as the thickness
of the Earth's atmosphere

115
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:25,397
"compared to the Earth itself."

116
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,797
And it's thin enough

117
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,408
that we are capable
of changing its composition.

118
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,224
That brings up the basic science
of global warming.

119
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:37,872
And I'm not gonna spend a lot of time
on this because you know it well.

120
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,455
The sun's radiation comes in
in the form of light waves

121
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,901
and that heats up the Earth.

122
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:47,472
And then some of the radiation
that is absorbed and warms the Earth

123
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:50,030
is reradiated back into space

124
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,851
in the form of infrared radiation.

125
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,780
And some of the outgoing
infrared radiation is trapped

126
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,844
by this layer of atmosphere
and held inside the atmosphere.

127
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,528
And that's a good thing because
it keeps the temperature of the Earth

128
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,453
within certain boundaries,

129
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,364
keeps it relatively constant and livable.

130
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:13,389
But the problem is this thin layer
of atmosphere is being thickened

131
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:18,031
by all of the global warming pollution
that's being put up there.

132
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,797
And what that does is
it thickens this layer of atmosphere,

133
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:26,032
more of the outgoing infrared is trapped.

134
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:29,486
And so the atmosphere heats up
worldwide. That's global warming.

135
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,143
Now, that's the traditional explanation.

136
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,611
Here's what I think is
a better explanation.

137
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:53,968
You're probably wondering
why your ice cream went away.

138
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,752
Well, Susie, the culprit isn't foreigners.

139
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,793
It's global warming.

140
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,998
- Global...
- Yeah.

141
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:04,941
Meet Mr. Sunbeam.

142
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:08,110
He comes all the way from the sun
to visit Earth.

143
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:11,788
Hello, Earth.
Just popping in to brighten your day.

144
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,592
And now I'll be on my way.

145
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,796
Not so fast, Sunbeam.

146
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,510
We're greenhouse gases.
You ain't going nowhere.

147
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:28,813
Oh, God, it hurts.

148
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,762
Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full
of Sunbeams.

149
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,674
Their rotting corpses heating
our atmosphere.

150
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:40,015
How do we get rid
of the greenhouse grasses?

151
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,635
Fortunately, our handsomest politicians

152
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:46,417
came up with a cheap, last-minute way
to combat global warming.

153
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,466
Ever since 2063,

154
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:52,751
we simply drop a giant ice cube
into the ocean every now and then.

155
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,966
Just like Daddy puts in his drink
every morning.

156
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,756
And then he gets mad.

157
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:03,465
Of course, since the greenhouse gases
are still building up,

158
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,417
it takes more and more ice each time.

159
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,287
Thus, solving the problem
once and for all.

160
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:11,727
- But...
- Once and for all!

161
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,471
This is the image that started me

162
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:25,034
in my interest in this issue.

163
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:27,341
And I saw it
when I was a college student

164
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:30,124
because I had a professor
named Roger Revelle

165
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:33,674
who was the first person to propose
measuring carbon dioxide

166
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,338
in the Earth's atmosphere.

167
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,970
He saw where the story was going

168
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,203
after the first few chapters.

169
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,858
After the first few years of data,

170
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,864
he intuited what it meant

171
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,994
for what was yet to come.

172
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:58,826
They designed the experiment in 1957.

173
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,708
He hired Charles David Keeling

174
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,526
who was very faithful and precise

175
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,525
in making these measurements
for decades.

176
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,465
They started sending
these weather balloons up every day

177
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,185
and they chose the middle of the Pacific

178
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,606
because it was the area
that was most remote.

179
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,259
And he was a very hard-nosed scientist.

180
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,009
He really emphasized the hard data.

181
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,614
It was a wonderful time for me

182
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,823
because, like a lot of young people,

183
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:34,603
I came into contact
with intellectual ferment,

184
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:37,803
ideas that I'd never considered

185
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,270
in my wildest dreams before.

186
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:43,789
And he showed our class

187
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:48,590
the results of his measurements
after only a few years.

188
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,509
It was startling to me.

189
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:53,386
Now he was startled

190
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,164
and made it clear to our class

191
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,019
what he felt the significance of it was.

192
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:02,313
And I just soaked it up like a sponge.

193
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,743
He drew the connections

194
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:08,619
between the larger changes
in our civilization

195
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,653
and this pattern that was now visible

196
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,278
in the atmosphere of the entire planet.

197
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,796
And then he projected into the future
where this was headed

198
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:19,975
unless we made some adjustments.

199
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,046
And it was just as clear as day.

200
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:28,035
After the first seven, eight, nine years,

201
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,280
you could see the pattern
that was developing.

202
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,231
But I asked a question.

203
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:36,262
Why is it that it goes up and down
once each year?

204
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,681
And he explained that if you look
at the land mass of the Earth,

205
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:42,243
very little of it is south of the equator.

206
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,416
The vast majority of it is
north of the equator,

207
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,866
and most of the vegetation is
north of the equator.

208
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:52,874
And so, when the Northern Hemisphere
is tilted toward the sun,

209
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,460
as it is in our spring and summer,

210
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:59,078
the leaves come out
and they breathe in carbon dioxide,

211
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:01,483
and the amount in the atmosphere
goes down.

212
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,808
But when the Northern Hemisphere is
tilted away from the sun,

213
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,080
as it is in our fall and winter,

214
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,278
the leaves fall
and exhale carbon dioxide,

215
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,577
and the amount in the atmosphere
goes back up again.

216
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,450
And so, it's as if the entire Earth

217
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,857
once each year breathes in and out.

218
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:26,053
So we started measuring
carbon dioxide in 1958.

219
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,099
And you can see

220
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:32,225
that by the middle '60s,
when he showed my class this image,

221
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,601
it was already clear that it was going up.

222
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,345
I respected him and learned from him
so much, I followed this.

223
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,728
And when I went to the Congress
in the middle 1970s,

224
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,774
I helped to organize the first hearings
on global warming

225
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,258
and asked my professor to come
and be the leadoff witness.

226
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,305
And I thought that would have
such a big impact,

227
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:53,608
we'd be on the way to solving
this problem, but it didn't work that way.

228
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:57,343
But I kept having hearings.
And in 1984 I went to the Senate

229
00:14:57,451 --> 00:15:00,450
and really dug deeply into this issue

230
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,529
with science roundtables and the like.

231
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,628
I wrote a book about it,
ran for President in 1988,

232
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,218
partly to try to gain some visibility
for that issue.

233
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:13,477
And in 1992 went to the White House.
We passed a version of a carbon tax

234
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,783
and some other measures
to try to address this.

235
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,623
Went to Kyoto in 1997
to help get a treaty

236
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:22,655
that's so controversial,
in the US at least.

237
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,648
In 2000,

238
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:28,607
my opponent pledged to regulate CO2
and then...

239
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:31,140
That was not a pledge that was kept.

240
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,628
But the point of this is

241
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:36,261
all this time you can see

242
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:39,039
what I have seen all these years.

243
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:42,143
It just keeps going up. It is relentless.

244
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:45,918
And now we're beginning to see
the impact in the real world.

245
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:49,633
This is Mount Kilimanjaro
more than 30 years ago

246
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,044
and more recently.

247
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:54,079
And a friend of mine just came back
from Kilimanjaro

248
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,867
with a picture he took
a couple of months ago.

249
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,901
Another friend, Lonnie Thompson,
studies glaciers.

250
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:04,480
Here's Lonnie with a last sliver
of one of the once mighty glaciers.

251
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:09,092
Within the decade there will be
no more snows of Kilimanjaro.

252
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,836
This is happening
in Glacier National Park.

253
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,576
I climbed to the top of this in 1998
with one of my daughters.

254
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,494
Within 15 years, this will be the park
formerly known as Glacier.

255
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:24,704
Here is what's been happening
year by year to the Columbia Glacier.

256
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:27,676
It just retreats every single year.

257
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:30,972
And it's a shame
'cause these glaciers are so beautiful.

258
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,315
But those who go up to see them,

259
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,674
here's what they're seeing every day,
now.

260
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,720
In the Himalayas
there's a particular problem

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,604
because 40% of all the people
in the world

262
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,152
get their drinking water
from rivers and spring systems

263
00:16:57,254 --> 00:17:00,832
that are fed more than half
by the melt water

264
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,461
coming off the glaciers.

265
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:07,037
And within this next half century
those 40% of the people on Earth

266
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,858
are gonna face a very serious shortage

267
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,194
because of this melting.

268
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,941
Italy, the Italian Alps.

269
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,795
Same sight today.

270
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,979
An old postcard from Switzerland.

271
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:23,035
Throughout the Alps,
we're seeing the same story.

272
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,181
It's also true in South America.

273
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:27,871
This is Peru 15 years ago.

274
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,209
And the same glacier today.

275
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:34,269
This is Argentina 20 years ago.
Same glacier today.

276
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,132
Seventy-five years ago in Patagonia
on the tip of South America.

277
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:44,254
This vast expanse of ice is now gone.

278
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,949
There's a message in this.

279
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:47,330
There's a message in this.

280
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,835
It is worldwide.

281
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,898
And the ice has stories to tell us.

282
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,319
My friend, Lonnie Thompson,
digs core drills in the ice.

283
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,801
They dig down

284
00:17:56,901 --> 00:18:00,032
and they bring the core drills back up
and they look at the ice

285
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,692
and they study it.

286
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,697
When the snow falls,
it traps little bubbles of atmosphere

287
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,221
and they can go in and measure

288
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:12,448
how much CO2 was in the atmosphere
the year that that snow fell.

289
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:14,969
What's even more interesting, I think, is

290
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:18,720
they can measure
the different isotopes of oxygen

291
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,983
and figure out
a very precise thermometer

292
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:24,385
and tell you what the temperature was

293
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:28,858
the year that that bubble was trapped
in the snow as it fell.

294
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,541
When I was in Antarctica,
I saw cores like this.

295
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,912
And a guy looked at it. He said,

296
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,394
"Right here is where the US Congress
passed the Clean Air Act."

297
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:39,744
And I couldn't believe it.

298
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,786
But you can see the difference
with the naked eye.

299
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:44,640
Just a couple of years
after that law was passed,

300
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,910
it's very clearly distinguishable.

301
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:49,945
They can count back year by year

302
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,700
the same way a forester reads
tree rings.

303
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:56,762
And you can see each annual layer
from the melting and re-freezing,

304
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:01,084
so they can go back in a lot of these
mountain glaciers 1,000 years.

305
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,576
And they constructed a thermometer
of the temperature.

306
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:08,543
The blue is cold and the red is warm.

307
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,678
Now, I show this
for a couple of reasons.

308
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:16,504
Number one, the so-called skeptics
will sometimes say,

309
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,969
"Oh, this whole thing,
this is a cyclical phenomenon.

310
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:22,935
"There was a medieval warming period,
after all."

311
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,237
Well, yeah, there was.
There it is, right there.

312
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,440
There are two others.

313
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,926
But compared to what's going on now,

314
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:33,942
there's just no comparison.

315
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:37,403
So if you look at 1,000 years'
worth of temperature

316
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,862
and compare it to 1,000 years of CO2,

317
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,822
you can see how closely
they fit together.

318
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:49,182
Now, 1,000 years of CO2
in the mountain glaciers,

319
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,228
that's one thing.

320
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:54,907
But in Antarctica,
they can go back 650,000 years.

321
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,832
This incidentally is the first time

322
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:04,342
anybody outside of a small group
of scientists has seen this image.

323
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,219
This is the present day era,

324
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,518
and that's the last ice age.

325
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,843
Then it goes up. We're going back
in time now 650,000 years.

326
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:18,041
That's the period of warming
between the last two ice ages.

327
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:21,176
That's the second
and third ice age back.

328
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,024
Fourth, fifth, sixth

329
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,487
and seventh ice age back.

330
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,862
Now, an important point.

331
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:33,718
In all of this time, 650,000 years,

332
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:37,085
the CO2 level has never gone above

333
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:39,901
300 parts per million.

334
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,264
Now, as I said,
they can also measure temperature.

335
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,043
Here's what the temperature
has been on our Earth.

336
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,429
Now, one thing that kind of jumps out
at you is...

337
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:54,427
Well, let me put it this way.
If my classmate from the sixth grade

338
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:57,047
that talked about Africa
and South America were here,

339
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,997
he would say,
"Did they ever fit together?"

340
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:03,069
"Most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."

341
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,626
But they did, of course.

342
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,920
And the relationship is
actually very complicated.

343
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,571
But there is one relationship
that is far more powerful

344
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,493
than all the others and it is this.

345
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,845
When there is more carbon dioxide,
the temperature gets warmer

346
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:22,263
because it traps more heat
from the sun inside.

347
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:26,363
In the parts of the United States
that contain the modern cities

348
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,385
of Cleveland, Detroit, New York,
in the northern tier,

349
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,290
this is the difference between a nice day

350
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:38,162
and having a mile of ice over your head.

351
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,104
Keep that in mind
when you look at this fact.

352
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:44,597
Carbon dioxide,

353
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,568
having never gone above
300 parts per million,

354
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:51,122
here is where CO2 is now.

355
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:58,041
Way above where it's ever been

356
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,561
as far back as this record will measure.

357
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,733
Now, if you'll bear with me,
I wanna really emphasize this point.

358
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,778
The crew here

359
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:09,458
has tried to teach me
how to use this contraption here.

360
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,800
So, if I don't kill myself, I'll...

361
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,004
It's already right here.

362
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:27,027
Look how far above
the natural cycle this is,

363
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,820
and we've done that.

364
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:32,502
But, ladies and gentlemen,
in the next 50 years,

365
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,609
really, in less than 50 years,

366
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:37,234
it's gonna continue to go up.

367
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:40,850
When some of these children
who are here are my age,

368
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:44,720
here is what it's going to be
in less than 50 years.

369
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,750
You've heard of off the charts.

370
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,998
Within less than 50 years, it'll be here.

371
00:23:00,474 --> 00:23:03,505
There's not a single fact
or date or number

372
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:06,837
that's been used to make this up
that's in any controversy.

373
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:10,131
The so-called skeptics look at this
and they say,

374
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:11,608
"So? That seems perfectly okay."

375
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,261
"So? That seems perfectly okay."

376
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,618
Well,

377
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,290
again, if on the temperature side,

378
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:31,352
if this much on the cold side is
a mile of ice over our heads,

379
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:36,627
what would that much
on the warm side be?

380
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:42,769
Ultimately this is really not
a political issue

381
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:45,293
so much as a moral issue.

382
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,924
If we allow that to happen,

383
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:51,030
it is deeply unethical.

384
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:56,561
I had such faith
in our democratic system,

385
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:58,386
our self-government.

386
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,155
I actually thought and believed

387
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:07,085
that the story would be compelling
enough to cause a real sea change

388
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:10,451
in the way the Congress reacted
to that issue.

389
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,071
I thought they would be startled, too.

390
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,504
And they weren't.

391
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:20,629
The struggles,

392
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:25,549
the victories that aren't really victories,
the defeats that aren't really defeats.

393
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:30,415
They can serve to magnify
the significance

394
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:33,073
of some trivial step forward,

395
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:38,065
exaggerate the seeming importance

396
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,338
of some massive setback.

397
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:46,770
April 3, 1989.

398
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,862
My son pulled loose from my hand

399
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:53,136
and chased his friend across the street.

400
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,425
He was six years old.

401
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,797
The machine was breathing for him.

402
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,261
We were possibly going to lose him.

403
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:16,556
He finally took a breath.

404
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,443
We stayed in the hospital for a month.

405
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,703
It was almost as if

406
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:30,892
you could look at that calendar
and just go...

407
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:33,906
And everything just flew off.

408
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,401
Seemed trivial, insignificant.

409
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,980
He was so brave. He was such...

410
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,407
He was such a brave guy.

411
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:48,755
It just turned my whole world
upside down

412
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:51,917
and then shook it
until everything fell out.

413
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:58,160
My way of being in the world,
it just changed everything for me.

414
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,328
How should I spend my time
on this Earth?

415
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,459
I really dug in,

416
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:12,844
trying to learn about it
much more deeply.

417
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,922
I went to Antarctica.

418
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:17,611
Went to the South Pole, the North Pole,
the Amazon.

419
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:21,969
Went to places where scientists
could help me understand

420
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,488
parts of the issue that

421
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,661
I didn't really understand in depth.

422
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,047
The possibility of losing
what was most precious to me.

423
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:39,144
I gained an ability

424
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:44,012
that maybe I didn't have before.

425
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,862
But when I felt it,

426
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:50,919
I felt that we could really lose it,

427
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:57,327
that what we take for granted
might not be here for our children.

428
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,603
These are actual measurements
of atmospheric temperatures

429
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,364
since our Civil War.

430
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:07,977
In any given year,
it might look like it's going down,

431
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,699
but the overall trend is extremely clear.

432
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,524
And in recent years,

433
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,041
it's uninterrupted and it is intensifying.

434
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:20,901
In fact, if you look at the 10 hottest
years ever measured

435
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,897
in this atmospheric record,

436
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,676
they've all occurred in the last 14 years.

437
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,513
And the hottest of all was 2005.

438
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,548
We have already seen
some of the heat waves

439
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,752
that are similar
to what scientists are saying

440
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:37,382
are gonna be a lot more common.

441
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:40,902
Couple of years ago in Europe
they had that massive heat wave

442
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,428
that killed 35,000 people.

443
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:47,244
India didn't get as much attention,

444
00:27:47,343 --> 00:27:49,830
but the same year
the temperature there went

445
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,968
to 122 degrees Fahrenheit.

446
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,364
This past summer
in the American West,

447
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:59,147
there were a lot of cities that broke
all-time records for high temperatures

448
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:03,883
and number of consecutive days
with a 100-degree temperature or more.

449
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:08,685
Two hundred cities and towns
in the west set all-time records.

450
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,999
And in the east there were a lot of cities
that did the same thing.

451
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,971
Including, incidentally, New Orleans.

452
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:20,167
So the temperature increases are
taking place all over the world,

453
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:22,180
including in the oceans.

454
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:26,505
This is the natural range of variability
for temperature in the oceans.

455
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,232
You know, people say,
"Oh, it's just natural.

456
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:30,603
"It goes up and down,
so don't worry about it."

457
00:28:30,702 --> 00:28:34,728
This is the range that would be
expected over the last 60 years,

458
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:38,505
but the scientists who specialize in
global warming have computer models

459
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:43,112
that long ago predicted
this range of temperature increase.

460
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:46,315
Now I'm gonna show you,
recently released,

461
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:49,480
the actual ocean temperatures.

462
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:54,538
And, of course, when the oceans get
warmer, that causes stronger storms.

463
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:57,509
We have seen
in the last couple of years

464
00:28:57,614 --> 00:28:59,337
a lot of big hurricanes.

465
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,593
Hurricane Jeanne and Frances
and lvan were among them.

466
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:07,753
And the same year that we had
that string of big hurricanes,

467
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:11,334
we also set an all-time record
for tornadoes in the United States.

468
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:15,458
Japan again didn't get
as much attention in our news media,

469
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:18,313
but they set an all-time record
for typhoons.

470
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:19,623
Previous record was seven.

471
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,336
Here are all 10 of the ones
they had in 2004.

472
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:25,992
The science textbooks have had
to be rewritten

473
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:29,439
because they say that it's impossible to
have a hurricane in the South Atlantic.

474
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:32,265
But the same year the first one ever
hit Brazil.

475
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:35,332
Summer of 2005 has been
one for the books.

476
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,824
The first one was Emily
that socked into Yucatan.

477
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:42,754
Then Hurricane Dennis came along
and it did a lot of damage,

478
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,616
including to the oil industry.

479
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:48,970
This is the largest oil platform
in the world after Dennis went through.

480
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:51,717
This one was driven into the bridge
at Mobile.

481
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:54,887
And then, of course, came Katrina.

482
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:59,879
It's worth remembering that when
it hit Florida, it was a Category One.

483
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:03,844
But it killed a lot of people and caused
billions of dollars' worth of damage.

484
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:05,769
And then what happened?

485
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,074
Before it hit New Orleans,

486
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,138
it went over warmer waters.

487
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,959
As the water temperature increases,

488
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,680
the wind velocity increases

489
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:19,627
and the moisture content increases.

490
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,010
And you'll see Hurricane Katrina
form over Florida.

491
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:26,375
And then as it comes into the gulf
over that warm water,

492
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:30,151
it picks up that energy and gets
stronger and stronger and stronger.

493
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,072
Look at that hurricane's eye.

494
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,446
And, of course,
the consequences were so horrendous,

495
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,136
there are no words to describe it.

496
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,595
Yeah, we're getting reports and calls
that are just breaking my heart.

497
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:10,854
From people saying, "I've been
in my attic. I can't take it anymore.

498
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,946
"The water is up to my neck.
I don't think I can hold out."

499
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:17,540
And that's happening as we speak.

500
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,535
We told everybody the importance
of the 17th Street Canal issue.

501
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:24,322
We said,
"Please, please, take care of this.

502
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,629
"We don't care what you do.
Figure it out."

503
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,228
Something new for America.

504
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:43,141
But how in God's name
could that happen here?

505
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:49,346
There had been warnings
that hurricanes would get stronger.

506
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:53,030
There were warnings
that this hurricane,

507
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:56,063
days before it hit,
would breach the levees,

508
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,910
would cause the kind of damage
that it ultimately did cause.

509
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,188
And one question
we as a people need to decide

510
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,098
is how we react when we hear warnings

511
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,882
from the leading scientists in the world.

512
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:15,461
There was another storm in the 1930s
of a different kind.

513
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,931
A horrible, unprecedented storm
in continental Europe,

514
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,130
and Winston Churchill warned
the people of England

515
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:29,183
that it was different from anything
that had ever happened before

516
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,555
and they had to get ready for it.

517
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,296
And a lot of people did not want
to believe it.

518
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,180
And he got real impatient
with all the dithering.

519
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,325
And he said this,

520
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:59,394
Making mistakes in generations
and centuries past

521
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:02,655
would have consequences
that we could overcome.

522
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,084
We don't have that luxury anymore.

523
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,099
We didn't ask for it,

524
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,682
but here it is.

525
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,954
Al Gore is the winner
of the national popular vote.

526
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:18,209
But the state of Florida, whomever
wins there wins the White House.

527
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,066
We call Florida, in the Al Gore column...

528
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,775
Bulletin: Florida pulled back
into the undecided column.

529
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,724
George Bush is the president elect
of the United States. He is...

530
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:30,017
Florida goes Bush.
The presidency is Bush. That's it.

531
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:32,735
And at 2:18 this morning, we project...

532
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:36,800
All right, we're officially saying
that Florida is too close to call.

533
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,456
While I strongly disagree
with the court's decision,

534
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,787
I accept it.

535
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:08,603
I accept the finality of this outcome.

536
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,329
...do solemnly swear...

537
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:20,573
I, George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear...

538
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:23,228
...that I will faithfully execute
the Office of President...

539
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,563
Well, that was a hard blow, but...

540
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:42,169
What do you do? You...

541
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,464
You make the best of it.

542
00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:00,699
It brought into clear focus

543
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,957
the mission that I had been pursuing

544
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,064
for all these years, and

545
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:12,919
I started giving the slide show again.

546
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:22,623
One often unnoticed effect
of global warming

547
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,727
is it causes more precipitation,

548
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:27,997
but more of it coming
in one-time big storm events.

549
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:31,898
Because the evaporation off the oceans
puts all the moisture up there,

550
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,264
when storm conditions trigger
the downpour, more of it falls down.

551
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,681
The insurance industry has
actually noticed this.

552
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:41,369
Their recovered losses are going up.

553
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,641
You see the damage
from these severe weather events?

554
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,743
And 2005 is not even on this yet.

555
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:50,330
When it does, it'll be off that chart.

556
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,877
Europe has just had a year very similar
to the one we've had

557
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:57,942
where they say
nature's been going crazy.

558
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:00,697
All kinds of unusual catastrophes,

559
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:03,188
like a nature hike
through the Book of Revelations.

560
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,199
Flooding in Asia.

561
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:09,150
Mumbai, India this past July.

562
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:12,279
Thirty-seven inches of rain in 24 hours.

563
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,635
By far, the largest downpour

564
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,425
that any city in India has ever received.

565
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,530
Lot of flooding in China, also.

566
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:26,108
Global warming, paradoxically,
causes not only more flooding,

567
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:28,468
but also more drought.

568
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:31,890
This neighboring province
right next door

569
00:36:32,094 --> 00:36:36,184
had a severe drought at the same time
these areas were flooding.

570
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,802
One of the reasons for this
has to do with the fact

571
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:44,572
that global warming not only increases
precipitation worldwide,

572
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,734
but it also relocates the precipitation.

573
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,610
And focus most of all
on this part of Africa

574
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,010
just on the edge of the Sahara.

575
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,372
Unbelievable tragedies have been
unfolding there,

576
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,989
and there are a lot of reasons for it.

577
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:05,082
But Darfur and Niger are
among those tragedies.

578
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:08,978
And one of the factors
that has been compounding them

579
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:12,118
is the lack of rainfall
and the increasing drought.

580
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:16,851
This is Lake Chad, once one
of the largest lakes in the world.

581
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:22,133
It has dried up over the last
few decades to almost nothing,

582
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,974
vastly complicating the other problems
that they also have.

583
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:28,183
The second reason

584
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,347
why this is a paradox.

585
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:35,090
Global warming creates
more evaporation off the oceans

586
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:36,658
to seed the clouds,

587
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,829
but it sucks moisture out of the soil.

588
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,151
Soil evaporation increases dramatically

589
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:46,073
with higher temperatures.

590
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,391
And that has consequences
for us in the United States, as well.

591
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:53,849
So this is the Carthage exit.

592
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,256
When I was 14 years old,
I totaled the family car

593
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:01,177
right there.

594
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:04,944
Went off that shoulder, turned it over.

595
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,849
And see this Black Angus bull?

596
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:11,510
We raised Black Angus.

597
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,748
My father was named
Breeder of the Month.

598
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,745
He grew up on a farm.

599
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:26,230
All through his career in the Senate

600
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:29,211
he continued to come back here
and raise cattle.

601
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:33,718
Learning it from your dad on the land,

602
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:38,455
that's really something special.

603
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:44,530
My childhood upbringing was
a little unusual in the sense that

604
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:49,399
I spent eight months of each year
in Washington DC

605
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,466
in a small little hotel apartment.

606
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:57,656
And then the other four months were
spent here on this big, beautiful farm.

607
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,137
I had a dog here.

608
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,795
I had a pony here.

609
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:06,577
I could shoot my rifle here.

610
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:10,064
I could go swimming in the river here.

611
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:13,846
Go out and lay down in the grass.

612
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,506
As a kid, it took me a while

613
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,423
to learn the difference
between fun and work.

614
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,250
The places where people live
were chosen

615
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:38,134
because of the climate pattern

616
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:42,125
that has been pretty much the same
on Earth

617
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:45,713
since the end of the last ice age
11,000 years ago.

618
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,892
Here, on this farm,
the patterns are changing.

619
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:54,769
And it seems gradual
in the course of a human lifetime

620
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,928
but in the course of time,
as defined by this river,

621
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:03,314
it's happening very, very quickly.

622
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,343
Two canaries in the coal mine.

623
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,060
First one is in the Arctic.

624
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,296
This, of course, is the Arctic Ocean,
the floating ice cap.

625
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:15,827
Greenland, on its side there.

626
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,714
I say canary in the coal mine

627
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:20,749
because the Arctic is
one of the two regions of the world

628
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:24,465
that is experiencing faster impacts

629
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:25,941
from global warming.

630
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:29,102
This is the largest ice shelf
in the Arctic,

631
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:31,060
the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf.

632
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,945
It just cracked in half three years ago.

633
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:35,018
The scientists were astonished.

634
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:39,017
These are called drunken trees
just going every which way.

635
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:42,387
This is not caused by wind damage
or alcohol consumption.

636
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:46,794
These trees put their roots down
in the permafrost,

637
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,233
and the permafrost is thawing.

638
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,180
And so they just go
every which way now.

639
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,315
This building was built
on the permafrost

640
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:58,065
and has collapsed
as the permafrost thaws.

641
00:40:58,196 --> 00:41:01,262
This woman's house has had
to be abandoned.

642
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:05,674
The pipeline is suffering
a great deal of structural damage.

643
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:10,477
And incidentally, the oil that they want
to produce in that protected area

644
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:13,064
in Northern Alaska,
which I hope they don't,

645
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:16,620
they have to depend on trucks
to go in and out of there.

646
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,626
And the trucks go over
the frozen ground.

647
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:24,304
This shows the number of days
that the tundra in Alaska is

648
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:26,193
frozen enough to drive on it.

649
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,666
Thirty-five years ago, 225 days a year.

650
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:34,219
Now it's below 75 days a year

651
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:38,569
because the spring comes earlier
and the fall comes later

652
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:41,326
and the temperatures
just keep on going up.

653
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:43,562
I went up to the North Pole.

654
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,795
I went under that ice cap
in a nuclear submarine

655
00:41:47,123 --> 00:41:49,905
that surfaced through the ice like this.

656
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:53,424
Since they started patrolling in 1957,

657
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:55,823
they have gone under the ice

658
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:58,738
and measured
with their radar looking upwards

659
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,335
to measure how thick it is

660
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,442
because they can only surface in areas

661
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:05,230
where it's three and a half feet thick
or less.

662
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:08,173
So they have kept a meticulous record

663
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:10,892
and they wouldn't release it
because it was national security.

664
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:14,191
I went up there in order to persuade
them to release it, and they did.

665
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,592
And here's what that record shows.

666
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:21,105
Starting in 1970,
there was a precipitous drop-off

667
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:25,095
in the amount and extent and thickness
of the Arctic ice cap.

668
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,036
It has diminished by 40% in 40 years.

669
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,919
And there are now
two major studies showing

670
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,439
that within the next 50 to 70 years,

671
00:42:34,545 --> 00:42:37,064
in summertime
it will be completely gone.

672
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,169
Now, you might say,
"Why is that a problem?"

673
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:44,909
And "How could the Arctic ice cap
actually melt so quickly?"

674
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:47,919
When the sun's rays hit the ice,

675
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:52,236
more than 90% of it bounces off
right back into space like a mirror.

676
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:56,166
But when it hits the open ocean,
more than 90% of it is absorbed.

677
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,184
And so, as the surrounding water
gets warmer,

678
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,094
it speeds up the melting of the ice.

679
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:06,311
Right now, the Arctic ice cap acts
like a giant mirror.

680
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,383
All the sun's rays bounce off,
more than 90%.

681
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:11,343
It keeps the Earth cooler.

682
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:13,127
But as it melts

683
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:16,623
and the open ocean receives
that sun's energy instead,

684
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,760
more than 90% is absorbed.

685
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:22,343
So there is
a faster buildup of heat here,

686
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:25,225
at the North Pole, in the Arctic Ocean,

687
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:28,775
and the Arctic generally
than anywhere else on the planet.

688
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,510
That's not good for creatures like
polar bears who depend on the ice.

689
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:37,740
A new scientific study shows that

690
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,347
for the first time they're finding
polar bears that have actually drowned,

691
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:47,757
swimming long distances,
up to 60 miles, to find the ice.

692
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:50,700
And they didn't find that before.

693
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:53,030
But what does it mean to us?

694
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,330
To look at a vast expanse of open water

695
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:59,847
at the top of our world
that used to be covered by ice.

696
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,281
We ought to care a lot

697
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:04,802
because it has planetary effects.

698
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:09,763
The Earth's climate is like a big engine
for redistributing heat

699
00:44:09,871 --> 00:44:11,780
from the equator to the poles.

700
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:15,497
And it does that by means
of ocean currents and wind currents.

701
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:20,109
They tell us, the scientists do, that the
Earth's climate is a nonlinear system.

702
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:23,173
Just a fancy way they have of saying

703
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,604
that the changes are not
all just gradual.

704
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:29,418
Some of them come suddenly,
in big jumps.

705
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,157
On a worldwide basis,
the annual average temperature is

706
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:36,011
about 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

707
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:39,492
If we have an increase of five degrees,

708
00:44:39,757 --> 00:44:42,441
which is on the low end
of the projections,

709
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,675
look at how that translates globally.

710
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:48,163
That means an increase of only
one degree at the equator,

711
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,117
but more than 12 degrees at the pole.

712
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:54,309
And so all those wind
and ocean current patterns

713
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:58,885
that have formed since the last ice age
and have been relatively stable,

714
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,705
they're all up in the air and they change.

715
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:04,364
And one of the ones
they're most worried about,

716
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,139
where they've spent a lot of time
studying the problem,

717
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,124
is in the North Atlantic

718
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:13,185
where the Gulf Stream comes up
and meets the cold winds

719
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,432
coming off the Arctic over Greenland.

720
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:18,980
And that evaporates so that the heat
out of the Gulf Stream

721
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,059
and the steam is carried over
to Western Europe

722
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:23,750
by the prevailing winds
and the Earth's rotation.

723
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,536
But isn't it interesting that
the whole ocean current system

724
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:29,025
is all linked together in this loop?

725
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:31,368
They call it the ocean conveyor.

726
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:34,888
And the red are
the warm surface currents.

727
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:37,060
The Gulf Stream is
the best known of them.

728
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:41,125
But the blue represent the cold currents

729
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:42,635
running in the opposite direction,

730
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:46,822
and we don't see them at all because
they run along the bottom of the ocean.

731
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:51,365
Up in the North Atlantic,
after that heat is pulled out,

732
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:55,074
what's left behind is
colder water and saltier water

733
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:57,153
because the salt doesn't go anywhere.

734
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,908
And so that makes it
denser and heavier.

735
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:03,140
And so that cold, dense,
heavy water sinks

736
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:07,071
at the rate of five billion
gallons per second.

737
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:11,134
And then that pulls that current
back south.

738
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:13,926
At the end of the last ice age,

739
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:14,441
as the last glacier was receding
from North America,

740
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:17,191
as the last glacier was receding
from North America,

741
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:21,702
the ice melted
and a giant pool of fresh water

742
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,426
formed in North America.

743
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:27,358
And the Great Lakes are the remnants
of that huge lake.

744
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:32,063
An ice dam on the eastern border
formed and one day it broke.

745
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:35,809
And all that fresh water
came rushing out,

746
00:46:35,912 --> 00:46:38,116
ripping open the St. Lawrence there,

747
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:41,863
and it diluted the salty, dense,
cold water,

748
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:45,504
made it fresher and lighter,
so it stopped sinking.

749
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,541
And that pump shut off.

750
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:51,437
And the heat transfer stopped.

751
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,723
And Europe went back into an ice age
for another 900 to 1,000 years.

752
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:59,854
And the change from conditions
like we have here today

753
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,964
to an ice age

754
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:05,678
took place in perhaps
as little as 10 years' time.

755
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,430
So that's a sudden jump.

756
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:11,409
Now, of course that's
not gonna happen again

757
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:14,572
because the glaciers of North America
are not there, and...

758
00:47:14,673 --> 00:47:18,317
Is there any other big chunk of ice
anywhere near there?

759
00:47:19,058 --> 00:47:20,270
Oh, yeah.

760
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,243
We'll come back to that one.

761
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:46,544
It's extremely frustrating to me

762
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:52,522
to communicate over and over again,
as clearly as I can.

763
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,760
And we are still, by far,

764
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:02,380
the worst contributor to the problem.

765
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:08,459
And I look around

766
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:12,109
and look for really meaningful signs

767
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,079
that we're about to really change.

768
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:19,145
I don't see it right now.

769
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:24,007
A number of very reputable scientists
have said that one factor of air pollution

770
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:27,500
is oxides of nitrogen
from decaying vegetation.

771
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:31,913
This is what causes the haze that gave
the big Smoky Mountains their name.

772
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,035
Thank you very much, okay.

773
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:38,059
This guy is so far off
in the environmental extreme,

774
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:42,027
we'll be up to our neck in owls
and out of work for every American.

775
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,881
This guy is crazy.

776
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:48,815
Even if humans were causing
global warming, and we are not,

777
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:52,212
this could be maybe the greatest hoax
ever perpetrated

778
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:53,801
on the American people.

779
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:56,777
We're dealing with something
that's highly emotional.

780
00:48:57,843 --> 00:49:00,712
If an issue is not

781
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:05,418
on the tips
of their constituents' tongues,

782
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:08,747
it's easy for them to ignore it.

783
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,413
To say, "Well, we'll deal
with that tomorrow."

784
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:26,640
So the same phenomena of changing
all these patterns

785
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:29,227
is also affecting the seasons.

786
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,730
Here is a study from the Netherlands.

787
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:35,209
The peak arrival date for migratory birds

788
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:38,034
25 years ago was April 25th,

789
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,848
and their chicks hatched
on June the 3rd.

790
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:44,397
Just at the time when the caterpillars
were coming out.

791
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:46,962
Nature's plan.

792
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:49,936
But 20 years of warming later,

793
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,679
the caterpillars peaked
two weeks earlier,

794
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:56,584
and the chicks tried to catch up with it,
but they couldn't.

795
00:49:57,363 --> 00:49:58,922
And so, they're in trouble.

796
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:01,960
And there are millions
of ecological niches

797
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:05,391
that are affected by global warming
in just this way.

798
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:09,740
This is the number of days with frost
in Southern Switzerland

799
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:11,337
over the last 100 years.

800
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:13,713
It has gone down rapidly.
But now watch this.

801
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:17,805
This is the number
of invasive exotic species

802
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:22,739
that have rushed in to fill the new
ecological niches that are opening up.

803
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,267
That's happening here
in the United States, too.

804
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:27,852
You've heard
of the pine beetle problem?

805
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,402
Those pine beetles used to be killed
by the cold winters,

806
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,772
but there are fewer days of frost,

807
00:50:33,873 --> 00:50:36,623
and so the pine trees are
being devastated.

808
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:41,459
This is part of 14 million acres
of spruce trees in Alaska

809
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,551
that have been killed by bark beetles.
The exact same phenomenon.

810
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:48,082
There are cities that were founded

811
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:50,829
because they were just above
the mosquito line.

812
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:54,413
Nairobi is one, Harare is another.
There are plenty of others.

813
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,636
Now the mosquitoes, with warming,
are climbing to higher altitudes.

814
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:03,057
There are a lot of vectors for infectious
diseases that are worrisome to us

815
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:05,132
that are also expanding their range.

816
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:08,084
Not only mosquitoes,
but all of these others as well.

817
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,928
And we've had 30 so-called
new diseases

818
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:14,225
that have emerged
just in the last quarter century.

819
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:18,160
And a lot of them, like SARS, have
caused tremendous problems.

820
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:21,039
The resistant forms of tuberculosis.
There are others.

821
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:23,441
And there's been a re-emergence
of some diseases

822
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,611
that were once under control.

823
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:30,450
The avian flu, of course,
quite a serious matter, as you know.

824
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:32,210
West Nile Virus.

825
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:35,437
It came to the eastern shore
of Maryland in 1999.

826
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,743
Two years later,
it was across the Mississippi.

827
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:41,455
And two years after that,
it had spread across the continent.

828
00:51:41,716 --> 00:51:43,985
But these are very troubling signs.

829
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:46,352
Coral reefs all over the world,

830
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,719
because of global warming
and other factors,

831
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,753
are bleaching and they end up like this.

832
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:54,772
And all the fish species
that depend on the coral reefs

833
00:51:54,868 --> 00:51:57,323
are also in jeopardy as a result.

834
00:51:57,428 --> 00:52:00,493
Overall, species loss is now occurring

835
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:03,213
at a rate 1,000 times greater
than the natural background rate.

836
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:07,723
This brings me to the second canary
in the coal mine.

837
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:09,038
Antarctica.

838
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,042
The largest mass of ice on the planet
by far.

839
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,057
A friend of mine said in 1978,

840
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,665
"If you see the breakup of ice shelves
along the Antarctic peninsula,

841
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:20,145
"watch out

842
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:24,367
"because that should be seen
as an alarm bell for global warming."

843
00:52:24,468 --> 00:52:27,597
And actually, if you look
at the peninsula up close,

844
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:31,890
every place where you see
one of these green blotches here

845
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:35,494
is an ice shelf larger
than the state of Rhode Island

846
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:39,147
that has broken up
just in the last 15 to 20 years.

847
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:41,193
I want to focus on just one of them.

848
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:42,725
It's called Larsen B.

849
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:46,184
I want you to look
at these black pools here.

850
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:50,099
It makes it seem almost
as if we're looking through the ice

851
00:52:50,196 --> 00:52:52,944
to the ocean beneath.
But that's an illusion.

852
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:56,522
This is melting water
that forms in pools,

853
00:52:56,788 --> 00:52:59,177
and if you were flying over it
in a helicopter,

854
00:52:59,285 --> 00:53:01,706
you'd see it's 700 feet tall.

855
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:05,357
They are so majestic, so massive.

856
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:09,069
In the distance are the mountains
and just before the mountains

857
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:12,106
is the shelf of the continent, there.

858
00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:15,087
This is floating ice,

859
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:19,243
and there's land-based ice
on the down slope of those mountains.

860
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:24,235
From here to the mountains
is about 20 to 25 miles.

861
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:27,723
Now they thought this would be
stable for at least 100 years,

862
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:29,353
even with global warming.

863
00:53:29,746 --> 00:53:32,560
The scientists who study
these ice shelves

864
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:35,593
were absolutely astonished

865
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,455
when they were looking
at these images.

866
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:40,331
Starting on January 31, 2002

867
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:43,084
in a period of 35 days

868
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,194
this ice shelf completely disappeared.

869
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:51,214
They could not figure out how
in the world this happened so rapidly.

870
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,273
And they went back to try to figure out
where they'd gone wrong.

871
00:53:56,723 --> 00:54:00,497
And that's when they focused
on those pools of melting water.

872
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:04,201
But even before they could figure out
what had happened there,

873
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,641
something else started going wrong.

874
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,137
When the floating sea-based ice
cracked up,

875
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:11,952
it no longer held back
the ice on the land,

876
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:15,433
and the land-based ice
then started falling into the ocean.

877
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,644
It was like letting the cork
out of a bottle.

878
00:54:17,747 --> 00:54:21,291
And there's a difference between
floating ice and land-based ice.

879
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:25,005
That's like the difference between
an ice cube floating in a glass of water,

880
00:54:25,106 --> 00:54:28,587
which when it melts doesn't raise
the level of water in the glass,

881
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,441
and a cube that's sitting atop
a stack of ice cubes

882
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,928
which melts and flows over the edge.

883
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,715
That's why the citizens
of these Pacific nations

884
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:40,201
have all had to evacuate
to New Zealand.

885
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:43,794
But I want to focus on West Antarctica

886
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:48,527
because it illustrates two factors about
land-based ice and sea-based ice.

887
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:51,942
It's a little of both.
It's propped up on tops of islands,

888
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:54,896
but the ocean comes up underneath it.

889
00:54:55,315 --> 00:54:57,934
So as the ocean gets warmer,
it has an impact on it.

890
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:00,811
If this were to go,

891
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,596
sea level worldwide
would go up 20 feet.

892
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,560
They've measured disturbing changes
on the underside of this ice sheet.

893
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,336
It's considered relatively
more stable, however,

894
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:15,979
than another big body of ice
that's roughly the same size.

895
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:20,818
Greenland would also raise sea level
almost 20 feet

896
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:22,223
if it went.

897
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:24,844
A friend of mine just brought back
some pictures

898
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:27,631
of what's going on on Greenland
right now.

899
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:31,635
Dramatic changes.
These are the same kinds of pools

900
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:35,087
that formed here,
on this ice shelf in Antarctica.

901
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:37,771
And the scientists thought

902
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,966
that when that water seeped back
into the ice, it would just refreeze.

903
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:45,355
But they found out
that actually what happens

904
00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:48,776
is that it just keeps on going.
It tunnels to the bottom

905
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,368
and makes the ice like Swiss cheese,

906
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:52,936
sort of like termites.

907
00:55:53,394 --> 00:55:55,881
This shows what happens
to the crevasses,

908
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:00,362
and when lakes form,
they create what are called moulins.

909
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:02,318
The water goes down to the bottom

910
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,833
and it lubricates
where the ice meets the bedrock.

911
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:08,236
See these people here for scale.

912
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:12,495
This is not on the edge of Greenland,
this is in the middle of the ice mass.

913
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:15,695
This is a massive rushing torrent

914
00:56:15,926 --> 00:56:17,899
of fresh melt water

915
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:21,300
tunneling straight down
through the Greenland ice

916
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:23,120
to the bedrock below.

917
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,888
Now, to some extent,
there has always been seasonal melting

918
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:32,050
and moulins have formed in the past,
but not like now.

919
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:36,522
In 1992, they measured
this amount of melting in Greenland.

920
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:39,336
Ten years later, this is what happened.

921
00:56:39,635 --> 00:56:42,088
And here is the melting from 2005.

922
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:46,408
Tony Blair's scientific advisor
has said that

923
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:49,264
because of what's happening
in Greenland right now,

924
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:52,077
the maps of the world will have
to be redrawn.

925
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:54,954
If Greenland broke up and melted,

926
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:59,409
or if half of Greenland
and half of West Antarctica

927
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:01,063
broke up and melted,

928
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:04,401
this is what would happen
to the sea level in Florida.

929
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:12,078
This is what would happen
to San Francisco Bay.

930
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:16,457
A lot of people live in these areas.

931
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:20,108
The Netherlands,
one of the low countries.

932
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,946
Absolutely devastating.

933
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:27,880
The area around Beijing that's home
to tens of millions of people.

934
00:57:29,843 --> 00:57:33,008
Even worse, in the area
around Shanghai,

935
00:57:33,107 --> 00:57:35,211
there are 40 million people.

936
00:57:37,202 --> 00:57:41,425
Worse still, Calcutta,
and to the east, Bangladesh,

937
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,206
the area covered includes
60 million people.

938
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:50,033
Think of the impact of a couple
hundred thousand refugees

939
00:57:50,355 --> 00:57:53,040
when they're displaced
by an environmental event.

940
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,488
And then imagine the impact
of a hundred million or more.

941
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:00,298
Here's Manhattan.

942
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:03,789
This is the World Trade Center
memorial site.

943
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:08,208
And after the horrible events of 9/11,

944
00:58:09,938 --> 00:58:11,733
we said, "Never again."

945
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,242
But this is what would happen
to Manhattan.

946
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,474
They can measure this precisely,

947
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:25,424
just as the scientists could
predict precisely

948
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,392
how much water would breach
the levees in New Orleans.

949
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:33,994
The area where the World Trade Center
Memorial is to be located

950
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,114
would be underwater.

951
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:42,000
Is it possible that we should prepare
against other threats besides terrorists?

952
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:46,091
Maybe we should be concerned
about other problems as well.

953
00:58:53,202 --> 00:58:55,375
1.3 billion people.

954
00:58:57,428 --> 00:58:59,433
An economy that's surging.

955
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:03,563
More and more energy needs.

956
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:06,448
Massive coal reserves.

957
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:10,705
The coal belt in Northern China,

958
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:13,710
- Inner Mongolia.
- Right.

959
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,624
Then there's Shaanxi province.

960
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:20,431
- And also biggest coal mine here.
- Up here.

961
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:22,569
- Yeah.
- Now, is that an open pit mine?

962
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,269
- Yes.
- Yes.

963
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:26,957
Every time I've visited China,

964
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:30,798
I've learned from their scientists.
They're right on the cutting edge.

965
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,484
Give me some sense of the numbers of

966
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:36,436
new coal fire generating plants.

967
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:39,281
Well, I have to say
that the number is enormous

968
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:41,104
because it's so profitable.

969
00:59:41,428 --> 00:59:45,899
This issue is really the same for China
as it is for the US.

970
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:51,443
We are both using old technologies
that are dirty and polluting.

971
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:52,967
...more flooding and more drought

972
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:55,465
and stronger storms is going up,

973
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:58,026
and global warming is implicated
in the pattern.

974
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:01,907
And if you were to give some
suggestions to everybody here

975
01:00:02,004 --> 01:00:05,929
about, like, what we can do
for the situation now.

976
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:09,348
Separating the truth from the fiction

977
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:14,127
and the accurate connections
from the misunderstandings

978
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,784
is part of what you learn here.

979
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:22,287
But when the warnings are accurate
and based on sound science,

980
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:26,344
then we as human beings,
whatever country we live in,

981
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:28,589
have to find a way to make sure

982
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:32,335
that the warnings are heard
and responded to.

983
01:00:39,537 --> 01:00:43,947
We both have a hard time
shaking loose the familiar patterns

984
01:00:44,051 --> 01:00:45,961
that we've relied on in the past.

985
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:50,993
We both face completely
unacceptable consequences.

986
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:04,617
And there are three factors
that are causing this collision,

987
01:01:04,722 --> 01:01:06,511
and the first is population.

988
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:11,080
When my generation, the baby boom
generation, was born after World War II,

989
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:13,868
the population had just crossed
the two billion mark.

990
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:17,807
Now, I'm in my 50s,

991
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:21,256
and it's already gone
to almost six and a half billion.

992
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:26,735
And if I reach the demographic
expectation for the baby boomers,

993
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:28,781
it'll go over nine billion.

994
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:33,935
So if it takes 10,000 generations
to reach two billion

995
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:37,035
and then in one human lifetime, ours,

996
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,757
it goes from two billion to nine billion,

997
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:43,371
something profoundly different's
going on right now.

998
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:46,026
We're putting more pressure
on the Earth.

999
01:01:46,129 --> 01:01:49,032
Most of it's in the poorer nations
of the world.

1000
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,724
This puts pressure on food demand.

1001
01:01:51,826 --> 01:01:53,997
It puts pressure on water demand.

1002
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:57,359
It puts pressure on vulnerable
natural resources,

1003
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:58,864
and this pressure's one of the reasons

1004
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:01,864
why we have seen all the devastation
of the forest,

1005
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,945
not only tropical, but elsewhere.

1006
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,970
It is a political issue.

1007
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:10,374
This is the border between Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.

1008
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:14,477
One set of policies here,
another set of policies here.

1009
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:18,762
Much of it comes not only
because of cutting, but also burning.

1010
01:02:18,994 --> 01:02:22,376
Almost 30% of all the CO2 that goes up
each year into the atmosphere

1011
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:24,872
comes from forest burning.

1012
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:29,005
This is a time-lapse picture of the Earth
at night over a six-month period

1013
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:31,312
showing the lights of the cities in white

1014
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:33,800
and the burning forests
and brush fires in red.

1015
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:36,974
The yellow areas are the gas flares,
like these in Siberia.

1016
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,181
And that brings me to the second factor

1017
01:02:39,282 --> 01:02:41,934
that has transformed our relationship
to the Earth.

1018
01:02:42,035 --> 01:02:46,157
The scientific and technological
revolution is a great blessing

1019
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:48,938
in that it has given us
tremendous benefits

1020
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:52,077
in areas like medicine
and communications.

1021
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:56,007
But this new power that we have
also brings a responsibility

1022
01:02:56,114 --> 01:02:57,577
to think about its consequences.

1023
01:02:57,843 --> 01:02:59,021
Here's a formula to think about.

1024
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,801
Old habits plus old technology
have predictable consequences.

1025
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:07,437
Old habits that are hard to change
plus new technology

1026
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,514
can have dramatically
altered consequences.

1027
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:13,676
Warfare with spears
and bows and arrows

1028
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:17,774
and rifles and machine guns,
that's one thing.

1029
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,045
But then a new technology came.

1030
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:30,091
We have to think differently about war

1031
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,726
because the new technologies
so completely transformed

1032
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,419
the consequences of that old habit

1033
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:41,745
that we can't just mindlessly continue
the patterns of the past.

1034
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:47,178
In the same way, we have always
exploited the Earth for sustenance.

1035
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:51,399
For most of our existence,
we used relatively simple tools.

1036
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:53,897
The plow, the tractor.

1037
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:57,169
But even tools like shovels
are different now.

1038
01:03:57,684 --> 01:03:59,211
Shovel used to be this.

1039
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:01,421
Shovels have gotten bigger.

1040
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:04,333
And every year, they get more powerful.

1041
01:04:04,563 --> 01:04:08,972
So our ability to have an effect,
in this case on the surface of the Earth,

1042
01:04:09,076 --> 01:04:10,767
is utterly transformed.

1043
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:15,249
You can say the same thing
about irrigation, which is a great thing.

1044
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:19,600
But when we divert rivers
without considering the consequences,

1045
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:23,493
then sometimes rivers no longer
reach the sea.

1046
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,576
There were two rivers in Central Asia

1047
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:28,169
that were used
by the former Soviet Union

1048
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:29,768
for irrigating cotton fields unwisely.

1049
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:32,874
The Aral Sea was fed by them.

1050
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,628
It used to be the fourth largest
inland sea in the world.

1051
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:38,729
When I went there,
I saw this strange sight

1052
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:42,825
of an enormous fishing fleet
resting in the sand.

1053
01:04:43,377 --> 01:04:47,982
This is the canal that the fishing
industry desperately tried to build

1054
01:04:48,082 --> 01:04:50,056
to get to the receding shoreline.

1055
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:53,038
Making mistakes in our dealings
with nature can have

1056
01:04:53,137 --> 01:04:54,763
bigger consequences now

1057
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:58,664
because our technologies are often
bigger than the human scale.

1058
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:02,543
When you put them all together,
they've made us a force of nature.

1059
01:05:02,835 --> 01:05:05,223
And this is also a political issue.

1060
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,792
This is a computer map of the world

1061
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:12,199
that distorts to show the relative
contributions to global warming.

1062
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,269
In our country, we are responsible
for more than all of South America,

1063
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,758
all of Africa, all of the Middle East,

1064
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:21,735
all of Asia, all combined.

1065
01:05:22,161 --> 01:05:26,767
The per capita average in Africa, India,
China, Japan, EU, Russia.

1066
01:05:26,868 --> 01:05:29,965
There's where we are.
Way, way above everyone else.

1067
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:33,775
If you take population into account,
it's a little bit different.

1068
01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:36,809
China's playing a bigger role,
so is Europe.

1069
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:40,559
But we are still by all odds
the largest contributor.

1070
01:05:40,787 --> 01:05:44,168
And so it is up to us to look
at how we think about it,

1071
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,828
because our way of thinking
is the third and final factor

1072
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:49,420
that transforms our relationship
to the Earth.

1073
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:53,778
If a frog jumps into
a pot of boiling water,

1074
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:57,136
it jumps right out again
because it senses the danger.

1075
01:05:57,234 --> 01:05:59,374
But the very same frog,

1076
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:02,702
if it jumps into a pot of lukewarm water

1077
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:05,071
that is slowly brought to a boil,

1078
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,170
will just sit there and it won't move.

1079
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:12,497
It'll just sit there, even as the
temperature continues to go up and up.

1080
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:17,068
It'll stay there, until...
Until it's rescued.

1081
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:20,271
It's important to rescue the frog.

1082
01:06:23,889 --> 01:06:25,416
But the point is this.

1083
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:29,481
Our collective nervous system is like
that frog's nervous system.

1084
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:33,811
It takes a sudden jolt sometimes
before we become aware of a danger.

1085
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:36,972
If it seems gradual,
even if it really is happening quickly,

1086
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:41,449
we're capable of just sitting there
and not responding.

1087
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:42,187
And not reacting.

1088
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:50,793
I don't remember a time
when I was a kid

1089
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:55,780
when summertime didn't mean
working with tobacco.

1090
01:06:55,882 --> 01:06:59,200
It was just... I used to love it.
It was during that period

1091
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:02,950
when working with the guys on the farm

1092
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:04,805
seemed like fun to me.

1093
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:10,627
Starting in 1964,
with the Surgeon General's report,

1094
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:14,505
the evidence was laid out
on the connection

1095
01:07:14,603 --> 01:07:18,563
between smoking cigarettes
and lung cancer.

1096
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:23,690
We kept growing tobacco.

1097
01:07:27,529 --> 01:07:31,688
Nancy was almost 10 years
older than me,

1098
01:07:31,787 --> 01:07:34,340
and there were only the two of us.

1099
01:07:36,267 --> 01:07:38,505
She was my protector

1100
01:07:38,605 --> 01:07:42,019
and my friend at the same time.

1101
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:47,330
She started smoking
when she was a teenager

1102
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:51,239
and never stopped.

1103
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:54,953
She died of lung cancer.

1104
01:07:58,924 --> 01:08:01,410
That's one of the ways
you don't want to die.

1105
01:08:04,523 --> 01:08:07,653
The idea that we had been

1106
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,627
part of that economic pattern

1107
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:14,474
that produced the cigarettes,

1108
01:08:14,574 --> 01:08:17,419
that produced the cancer,

1109
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:19,082
it was so...

1110
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:23,274
It was so painful on so many levels.

1111
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,706
My father, he had grown tobacco
all his life. He stopped.

1112
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:35,399
Whatever explanation

1113
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:39,555
had seemed to make sense in the past,
just didn't cut it anymore.

1114
01:08:41,195 --> 01:08:42,657
He stopped it.

1115
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:54,338
It's just human nature to take time
to connect the dots. I know that.

1116
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,202
But I also know that there can be
a day of reckoning

1117
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:05,164
when you wish you had connected
the dots more quickly.

1118
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:16,460
There are three misconceptions in
particular that bedevil our thinking.

1119
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,312
First, isn't there a disagreement
among scientists

1120
01:09:18,413 --> 01:09:20,746
about whether the problem
is real or not?

1121
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:22,981
Actually, not really.

1122
01:09:23,404 --> 01:09:26,917
There was a massive study
of every scientific article

1123
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:31,461
in a peer-reviewed journal written
on global warming for the last 10 years.

1124
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:35,910
And they took a big sample of 10%,
928 articles.

1125
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:40,451
And you know the number of those that
disagreed with the scientific consensus

1126
01:09:40,554 --> 01:09:43,938
that we're causing global warming
and that it's a serious problem?

1127
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:45,899
Out of the 928, zero.

1128
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,638
The misconception that there's
disagreement about the science

1129
01:09:50,929 --> 01:09:54,975
has been deliberately created
by a relatively small group of people.

1130
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:57,750
One of their internal memos leaked.

1131
01:09:57,854 --> 01:10:00,695
And here's what it said,
according to the press.

1132
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:04,360
Their objective is to reposition
global warming

1133
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,342
as theory rather than fact.

1134
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,700
This has happened before.

1135
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:13,993
After the Surgeon General's report.

1136
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:17,986
One of their memos leaked
40 years ago. Here's what they said.

1137
01:10:18,086 --> 01:10:19,578
"Doubt is our product,

1138
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:24,719
"since it is the best means of creating
a controversy in the public's mind."

1139
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:27,110
But have they succeeded?

1140
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:31,039
You'll remember that there were
928 peer-reviewed articles.

1141
01:10:31,168 --> 01:10:34,007
Zero percent
disagreed with the consensus.

1142
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:37,479
There was another study of all
the articles in the popular press.

1143
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:41,183
Over the last 14 years,
they looked at a sample of 636.

1144
01:10:41,286 --> 01:10:42,875
More than half of them said,

1145
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,276
"Well, we're not sure. It could be
a problem, may not be a problem."

1146
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,063
So no wonder people are confused.

1147
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:00,235
Hey.

1148
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,508
What did you find out?

1149
01:11:04,901 --> 01:11:06,425
Working for who?

1150
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:10,678
Chief of Staff?

1151
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:11,765
I'm gonna...

1152
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,026
That's the White House
environment office.

1153
01:11:14,382 --> 01:11:19,004
American Petroleum Institute. It's fair
to say that's the oil and gas lobby.

1154
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,625
Is that fair?

1155
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,379
Totally fair.

1156
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:28,509
Do a little bit more and see
who his clients were.

1157
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:31,863
So he was defending
the Exxon Valdez thing.

1158
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:35,184
Uh, very. Thank you.

1159
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:41,533
Scientists have
an independent obligation

1160
01:11:42,277 --> 01:11:45,464
to respect and present the truth
as they see it.

1161
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:52,355
Why do you directly contradict yourself

1162
01:11:53,126 --> 01:11:57,009
in the testimony you're giving
about this scientific question?

1163
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,618
The last paragraph in that section
was not a paragraph which I wrote.

1164
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,507
That was added to my testimony.

1165
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:06,011
If they force you to change
a scientific conclusion,

1166
01:12:06,116 --> 01:12:09,040
it's a form of science fraud by them.

1167
01:12:09,177 --> 01:12:12,269
You know, in the Soviet Union,
ordering scientists

1168
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,037
to change their studies to conform
with the ideology...

1169
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,097
I've seen scientists

1170
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:25,613
who were persecuted,

1171
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,126
ridiculed,

1172
01:12:28,869 --> 01:12:33,593
deprived of jobs, income,

1173
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:38,788
simply because the facts
they discovered

1174
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:41,916
led them to an inconvenient truth

1175
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:47,663
that they insisted on telling.

1176
01:12:51,336 --> 01:12:54,112
He worked for
the American Petroleum Institute.

1177
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,440
And in January of 2001,

1178
01:12:56,541 --> 01:13:00,105
he was put by the president in charge
of environmental policy.

1179
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:04,353
He received a memo from the EPA

1180
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,956
that warned about global warming

1181
01:13:08,312 --> 01:13:11,404
and he edited. He has no
scientific training whatsoever.

1182
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,013
But he took it upon himself
to overrule the scientist.

1183
01:13:15,112 --> 01:13:18,137
I said, "I want to see
what this guy's handwriting looks like."

1184
01:13:18,237 --> 01:13:21,843
This is the memo from the EPA.
These are his actual pen strokes.

1185
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:25,667
He says, "No, you can't say this.
This is just speculation."

1186
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:28,476
This was embarrassing
to the White House,

1187
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:32,051
so this fellow resigned a few days later.

1188
01:13:32,155 --> 01:13:35,943
And the day after he resigned,
he went to work for Exxon Mobil.

1189
01:13:37,358 --> 01:13:40,284
You know, more than 100 years ago,
Upton Sinclair wrote this.

1190
01:13:40,388 --> 01:13:43,164
That it's difficult to get a man
to understand something

1191
01:13:43,706 --> 01:13:47,724
if his salary depends upon
his not understanding it.

1192
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:56,080
The second misconception.

1193
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,515
Do we have to choose between
the economy and the environment?

1194
01:13:58,612 --> 01:14:00,067
This is a big one.

1195
01:14:00,173 --> 01:14:02,176
Lot of people say we do.

1196
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:05,371
I was trying to convince
the previous administration,

1197
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:08,335
the first Bush administration,
to go to the Earth Summit.

1198
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:10,408
And they organized
a big White House conference

1199
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,267
to say, "Oh, we're on top of this."

1200
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:14,117
And one of these view graphs
caught my attention.

1201
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:16,003
And I want to talk to you about it
for a minute.

1202
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:19,507
Now here is the choice
that we have to make

1203
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:21,199
according to this group.

1204
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:25,739
We have here a scales that balances
two different things.

1205
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,342
On one side, we have gold bars.

1206
01:14:33,205 --> 01:14:34,892
Don't they look good?

1207
01:14:35,408 --> 01:14:38,183
I'd just like to have
some of those gold bars.

1208
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:45,551
On the other side of the scales,
the entire planet.

1209
01:14:59,281 --> 01:15:02,502
I think this is a false choice
for two reasons.

1210
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:06,295
Number one, if we don't have a planet...

1211
01:15:09,653 --> 01:15:13,351
The other reason is that
if we do the right thing,

1212
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,516
then we're gonna create a lot of wealth

1213
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,918
- and we're gonna create a lot of jobs.
- Yes.

1214
01:15:18,016 --> 01:15:21,040
Because doing the right thing
moves us forward.

1215
01:15:25,674 --> 01:15:29,851
I've probably given this slide show
1,000 times.

1216
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,789
I would say, at least 1,000 times.

1217
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:42,170
Nashville to Knoxville
to Aspen and Sundance.

1218
01:15:42,266 --> 01:15:46,348
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Portland, Minneapolis.

1219
01:15:46,863 --> 01:15:51,554
Boston, New Haven, London, Brussels,
Stockholm, Helsinki,

1220
01:15:51,653 --> 01:15:54,710
Vienna, Munich, Italy and Spain

1221
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:57,585
and China, South Korea, Japan.

1222
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:01,830
Thank you.

1223
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:05,817
I guess the thing I've spent more time
on than anything else in this slide show

1224
01:16:05,915 --> 01:16:08,277
is trying to identify

1225
01:16:08,696 --> 01:16:11,755
all those things in people's minds

1226
01:16:11,856 --> 01:16:16,508
that serve as obstacles
to them understanding this.

1227
01:16:18,523 --> 01:16:22,637
And whenever I feel like
I've identified an obstacle,

1228
01:16:22,737 --> 01:16:26,073
I try to take it apart, roll it away.
Move it.

1229
01:16:27,331 --> 01:16:29,301
Demolish it, blow it up.

1230
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:39,353
I set myself a goal.

1231
01:16:41,787 --> 01:16:44,977
Communicate this real clearly.

1232
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,738
The only way I know to do it

1233
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,423
is city by city,

1234
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:58,506
person by person,

1235
01:17:03,236 --> 01:17:05,114
family by family.

1236
01:17:08,945 --> 01:17:10,252
- Bye-bye. Thank you again.
- Bye.

1237
01:17:10,862 --> 01:17:13,276
And I have faith that pretty soon

1238
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,834
enough minds are changed

1239
01:17:17,019 --> 01:17:19,728
that we cross a threshold.

1240
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:22,951
Let me give you an example

1241
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:26,109
of the wrong way to balance
the economy and the environment.

1242
01:17:26,339 --> 01:17:28,600
One part of this issue
involves automobiles.

1243
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:31,150
Japan has mileage standards up here.

1244
01:17:31,254 --> 01:17:33,483
Europe plans to pass Japan.

1245
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,107
Our allies in Australia and Canada
are leaving us behind.

1246
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,120
Here is where we are.

1247
01:17:42,361 --> 01:17:43,666
Now there's a reason for it.

1248
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:47,429
They say that we can't protect
the environment too much

1249
01:17:47,528 --> 01:17:50,586
without threatening the economy
and threatening the automakers.

1250
01:17:50,688 --> 01:17:54,902
Because automakers in China might
come in and just steal all our markets.

1251
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,557
Well, here is where China's
auto mileage standards are now.

1252
01:18:00,868 --> 01:18:01,882
Way above ours.

1253
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:04,501
We can't sell our cars in China today

1254
01:18:05,021 --> 01:18:08,520
because we don't meet
the Chinese environmental standards.

1255
01:18:09,739 --> 01:18:12,582
California has taken an initiative

1256
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:16,757
to have higher-mileage cars
sold in California.

1257
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,948
Now the auto companies
have sued California

1258
01:18:20,049 --> 01:18:22,410
to prevent this law from taking effect

1259
01:18:22,507 --> 01:18:26,391
because, as they point out,
11 years from now

1260
01:18:26,496 --> 01:18:30,481
this would mean that California
would have to have cars for sale

1261
01:18:30,584 --> 01:18:33,294
that are as efficient 11 years from now

1262
01:18:33,392 --> 01:18:35,077
as China's are today.

1263
01:18:35,179 --> 01:18:38,485
Clearly too onerous a provision
to comply with.

1264
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:41,421
And is this helping
our companies succeed?

1265
01:18:41,528 --> 01:18:44,685
Well, actually, if you look at
who's doing well in the world,

1266
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:48,068
it's the companies that are building
more-efficient cars.

1267
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,207
And our companies are in deep trouble.

1268
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,211
Final misconception.

1269
01:18:52,314 --> 01:18:55,027
If we accept that this problem is real,

1270
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:57,606
maybe it's just too big
to do anything about.

1271
01:18:57,963 --> 01:19:01,782
And, you know, there are a lot of people
who go straight from denial

1272
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:03,412
to despair

1273
01:19:03,518 --> 01:19:06,381
without pausing
on the intermediate step

1274
01:19:06,487 --> 01:19:09,443
of actually doing something
about the problem.

1275
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:13,276
And that's what I'd like to finish with.
The fact that we already know

1276
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,904
everything we need to know
to effectively address this problem.

1277
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:20,679
We've got to do a lot of things,
not just one.

1278
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:23,752
If we use more efficient

1279
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:25,817
electricity appliances,

1280
01:19:25,922 --> 01:19:29,523
we can save this much off
of the global warming pollution

1281
01:19:29,623 --> 01:19:32,486
that would otherwise be
put into the atmosphere.

1282
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:35,583
If we use other end-use efficiency,
this much.

1283
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:38,048
If we have higher mileage cars,
this much.

1284
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:41,133
And all these begin to add up.
Other transport efficiency,

1285
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:43,089
renewable technology,

1286
01:19:43,186 --> 01:19:45,221
carbon capture and sequestration.

1287
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:48,512
A big solution that you're gonna
be hearing a lot more about.

1288
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,230
They all add up,

1289
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:54,601
and pretty soon we are below
our 1970 emissions.

1290
01:19:55,603 --> 01:19:57,800
We have everything we need,

1291
01:19:58,028 --> 01:20:00,801
save perhaps political will.

1292
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:05,230
But you know what? In America,
political will is a renewable resource.

1293
01:20:10,057 --> 01:20:11,777
We have the ability to do this.

1294
01:20:12,356 --> 01:20:14,773
Each one of us is
a cause of global warming,

1295
01:20:14,879 --> 01:20:17,490
but each of us can make choices
to change that.

1296
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:21,734
With the things we buy, the electricity
we use, the cars we drive,

1297
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:25,721
we can make choices to bring
our individual carbon emissions to zero.

1298
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:28,794
The solutions are in our hands.

1299
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:32,073
We just have to have the determination
to make them happen.

1300
01:20:32,174 --> 01:20:35,711
Are we gonna be left behind
as the rest of the world moves forward?

1301
01:20:35,814 --> 01:20:39,229
All of these nations have ratified Kyoto.

1302
01:20:39,326 --> 01:20:44,045
There are only two advanced nations
in the world that have not ratified Kyoto,

1303
01:20:44,141 --> 01:20:47,928
and we are one of them.
The other is Australia.

1304
01:20:48,353 --> 01:20:51,379
Luckily, several states
are taking the initiative.

1305
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:54,343
The nine northeastern states
have banded together

1306
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,354
on reducing CO2.

1307
01:20:57,067 --> 01:20:59,745
California and Oregon are taking
the initiative.

1308
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:04,437
Pennsylvania's exercising leadership
on solar power and wind power.

1309
01:21:04,536 --> 01:21:08,138
And US cities are
stepping up to the plate.

1310
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,142
One after the other, we have seen

1311
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:16,695
all of these cities pledge
to take on global warming.

1312
01:21:19,058 --> 01:21:21,570
So what about the rest of us?

1313
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:27,032
Ultimately this question
comes down to this.

1314
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:30,158
Are we, as Americans,

1315
01:21:31,025 --> 01:21:33,733
capable of doing great things

1316
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,126
even though they are difficult?

1317
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,716
Are we capable

1318
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:41,423
of rising above ourselves
and above history?

1319
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:45,768
Well, the record indicates
that we do have that capacity.

1320
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:48,507
We formed a nation,
we fought a revolution

1321
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:51,351
and brought something new
to this Earth,

1322
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:54,855
a free nation guaranteeing
individual liberty.

1323
01:21:55,406 --> 01:21:59,771
America made a moral decision.
Its slavery was wrong,

1324
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:04,277
and that we could not be half free
and half slave.

1325
01:22:04,724 --> 01:22:06,380
We, as Americans, decided

1326
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:09,256
that of course
women should have the right to vote.

1327
01:22:09,356 --> 01:22:11,771
We defeated totalitarianism
and won a war

1328
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:15,092
in the Pacific and the Atlantic
simultaneously.

1329
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,310
We desegregated our schools.

1330
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:21,572
And we cured fearsome diseases
like polio.

1331
01:22:21,674 --> 01:22:23,099
We landed on the moon.

1332
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:26,609
The very example of what's possible
when we are at our best.

1333
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:29,805
We worked together
in a completely bipartisan way

1334
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:31,756
to bring down communism.

1335
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:35,518
We have even solved
a global environmental crisis before,

1336
01:22:35,616 --> 01:22:38,291
the hole in the stratospheric
ozone layer.

1337
01:22:38,394 --> 01:22:40,808
This was said to be
an impossible problem to solve

1338
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,426
because it's
a global environmental challenge

1339
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:47,199
requiring cooperation
from every nation in the world.

1340
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:49,341
But we took it on.

1341
01:22:49,438 --> 01:22:52,626
And the United States took the lead
in phasing out the chemicals

1342
01:22:52,725 --> 01:22:54,507
that caused that problem.

1343
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:59,165
So now we have to use our political
processes in our democracy,

1344
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,423
and then decide to act together
to solve those problems.

1345
01:23:02,555 --> 01:23:05,578
But we have to have
a different perspective on this one.

1346
01:23:05,999 --> 01:23:08,860
It's different from any problem
we have ever faced before.

1347
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:15,856
You remember that home movie
of the Earth spinning in space?

1348
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:21,090
One of those spacecraft continuing
on out into the universe,

1349
01:23:21,732 --> 01:23:25,139
when it got four billion miles
out in space,

1350
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:28,780
Carl Sagan said,
"Let's take another picture of the Earth."

1351
01:23:30,061 --> 01:23:31,999
You see that pale blue dot?

1352
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:34,019
That's us.

1353
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:37,902
Everything that has ever happened
in all of human history

1354
01:23:38,488 --> 01:23:40,621
has happened on that pixel.

1355
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:43,657
All the triumphs and all the tragedies.

1356
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:46,494
All the wars, all the famines.

1357
01:23:47,073 --> 01:23:48,924
All the major advances.

1358
01:23:50,456 --> 01:23:52,048
It's our only home.

1359
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:57,147
And that is what is at stake.

1360
01:23:57,762 --> 01:24:01,648
Our ability to live

1361
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:03,594
on planet Earth,

1362
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:06,854
to have a future as a civilization.

1363
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,806
I believe this is a moral issue.

1364
01:24:14,519 --> 01:24:17,411
It is your time to seize this issue.

1365
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:21,533
It is our time to rise again,
to secure our future.

1366
01:24:32,296 --> 01:24:36,375
There's nothing that unusual
about what I'm doing with this.

1367
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:41,575
What is unusual is that
I had the privilege to be shown it

1368
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:43,234
as a young man.

1369
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,230
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Al Gore.

1370
01:24:47,964 --> 01:24:51,980
It's almost as if a window was opened
through which

1371
01:24:52,242 --> 01:24:55,910
the future was very clearly visible.

1372
01:24:57,284 --> 01:24:59,186
"See that?" he said, "See that?

1373
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:04,741
"That's the future in which you are
going to live your life."

1374
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,941
Future generations

1375
01:25:29,613 --> 01:25:32,636
may well have occasion
to ask themselves,

1376
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:35,541
"What were our parents thinking?

1377
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:39,855
"Why didn't they wake up
when they had a chance?"

1378
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:48,185
We have to hear that question
from them, now.

1379
01:29:17,569 --> 01:29:27,134
THE END
