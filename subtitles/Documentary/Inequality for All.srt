You know? It's pretty little.

that we are in proportion,

16
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:52,189
This kind of gaping inequality
gives lie to the promise

17
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,190
that's at the very heart
of America.

18
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,926
There is income inequality
in America.

19
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,193
There always has been,

20

and hopefully
there always will be.

much higher level, who cares?

Income inequality
has been ticking up.

23

Income inequality is bull.

I think it's about envy.

I think it's about
class warfare.

26
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,906
It's class warfare,

Those were tough times.

55
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:51,507
We are going to deal
with three questions.

56
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:55,812
The first question is,
what is happening

57
00:03:55,813 --> 00:04:00,216
in terms of the distribution
of income and wealth?

58
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:02,787
Number two, why?

59
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:05,589
Number three, is it a problem?

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,726
Maybe it's not a problem.

61
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,995
Many of you call yourselves
conservatives.

62
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,363
Many of you call yourselves
liberals.

63
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:16,833
Those labels will become
increasingly irrelevant

64
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,972
as you get deeper and deeper
into this subject.

65
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:25,775
I want you to test
your assumptions.

66
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:29,679
If possible, I want to shake
your assumptions a little bit

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,333
about why the system
works as it does.

68
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,505
Some inequality is inevitable.

69
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,472
If people are gonna have
the proper incentives

70
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:59,478
to be productive, to work
hard, to be inventive...

71
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,080
that's the essence
of capitalism,

72
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,154
and capitalism does generate
a lot of good things.

73
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:13,123
Look, the question
is not inequality per se.

74
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:17,528
The question is, when does
inequality become a problem?

75
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,165
How much inequality
can we tolerate

76
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,900
and still have an economy
that's working for everyone

77
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:27,703
and still have a democracy
that's functioning?

78
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:31,909
Of all developed nations
today, the United States has

79
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,580
the most unequal distribution
of income and wealth by far.

80
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:41,552
And we're surging toward
even greater inequality.

81
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,854
One way of looking at
and measuring inequality

82
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:46,556
is to look at the earnings
of people at the top

83
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:47,825
versus the earnings

84
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,562
of the typical worker
in the middle.

85
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:54,564
The typical male worker in 1978

86
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:58,802
was making around $48,000,
adjusted for inflation,

87
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:01,470
while the average person
in the top 1%

88
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,874
earned $390,000.

89
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,410
Now fast-forward.

90
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,547
By 2010, the typical male worker

91
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,681
earned even less
than he did then,

92
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:13,350
but the person at the top

93
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,822
got more than twice as much
as before.

94
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:21,525
Today the richest 400
Americans have more wealth

95
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:25,729
than the bottom 150 million
of us put together.

96
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,797
Now, think about it.

97
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,732
400 people have more wealth

98
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:34,203
than half the population
of the United States.

101

102
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:44,080
but leaves many
feeling left behind.

103
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,616
After the economy crashed
in 2008,

104
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:49,753
inequality suddenly
became front-page news.

105
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:52,189
Who else wants to join the 1%?

106
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,523
You look like a one percenter.

107
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:55,292
We're a fabulous percent.

108
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:59,330
People from both parties were
looking for someone to blame.

109
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,265
But most people have no idea
how it got this bad

110
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,406
or why.

111
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,974
Not until the last few years

112
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:14,410
have we really understood
all that much about inequality.

113
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,780
I mean,
we knew the top 10% or 20%

114
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,249
were moving in one direction

115
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,886
and the bottom 10% or 20%
was moving in another.

116
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,621
But we didn't know what was
happening at the very top,

117
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,224
to the top 1%.

Good to see you.

120
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,462
And then a few years ago,
two researchers,

121
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,797
Emmanuel Saez
and Thomas Piketty,

122
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,737
found a different
source of data.

123
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,004
They looked at IRS tax data,

124
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,340
not just over the last few years

125
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:48,011
but all the way back to 1913,

126
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:51,584
when the income tax
was instituted.

127
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:56,487
It showed that there
were two peak years.

128
00:07:56,488 --> 00:08:01,290
1928 and 2007
become the peak years

129
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,126
for income concentration,

130
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,595
both of them in which the
top 1% is taking home

131
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,668
more than 23% of total income.

132
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:13,537
We knew that inequality
had started to increase

133
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:16,006
in the late '70s and the 1980s,

134
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:20,210
but we didn't know
how dramatically

135
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,910
income concentration
had increased,

136
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,147
especially within the top 1%.

137
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:27,650
When you had this study
come out in 2003,

138
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,753
it sat there
for a number of years,

139
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:34,023
and then suddenly
it became important.

140
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:36,427
But you see them
starting to recover...

141
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,796
This graph becomes very central

142
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:42,132
for explaining what has
happened to the U.S. economy

143
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:46,635
and, indeed, what's happening
and has happened to our society.

144
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,908
It looks like
a suspension bridge.

145
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:53,476
What happened
the year after 1928?

146
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:54,710
The Great Crash.

147
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:57,279
And what happened
just after 2007?

148
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,317
Another crash.

149
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:03,552
The parallels are breathtaking

more concentrated

the wealthy turned
to the financial sector,

156

and in both periods, the
financial sector ballooned.

157
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,580
They focused on a limited
number of assets

00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,321
And that creates
a speculative bubble

161
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,257
in both times.

162
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:42,725
We also know
that the middle class,

163
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:46,129
in both periods, their
incomes were stagnating,

164
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,264
and they went deeper
and deeper into debt

165
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,933
to maintain
their living standards.

166
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,238
And that creates a debt bubble.

167

<font color="#808080">(CHILD SCREAMING)</font>

169
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:58,874
That's why you see,
in both these periods,

170
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,144
economic instability.

171
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:06,917
What makes an economy stable
is a strong middle class.

172
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:10,620
Look, the most important
thing to understand

173
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:13,790
is that consumer spending is 70%

174
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,759
of the United States economy.

175
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,461
And the middle class
is the heart

176
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:23,133
of that consumer spending.

177
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:27,738
So it's your middle class
that keeps the economy going.

178
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:31,041
There's no way you can sustain
the economy over the long term

179
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:35,778
without a strong and vibrant
and growing middle class.

180
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:36,779
Can't be done.

181
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,151
People are being intimidated.
Correct.

182
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:42,985
I mean, they might
lose their jobs if they...

183
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,721
I talk to a lot
of different groups.

184
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:49,292
Some are wealthy.
Some are working-class.

185
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,128
Some are conservative.
Some are liberal.

186
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:55,231
And he finally got
a full-time job.

187
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,267
The middle class is struggling.

188
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:59,668
It is going downhill.

189
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,904
I hear it all the time.

190
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:03,473
Well, everyone tells me
that I am,

191
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,908
but I don't feel
like I'm middle-class,

192
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:07,344
because I'm barely making it.

193
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:10,346
Middle-class
is living comfortably

194
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:13,950
and not having to... not having
every week be a struggle.

195
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,185
I'd like to save up
and buy a house one day,

196
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:18,455
and, you know, I haven't
really been able to do that

197
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,791
and been kind of holding back

198
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:23,529
and just trying to make rent
right now.

199
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,932
How much do you make an hour?

200
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:34,303
Right now,
I think it went up... $21.50.

201
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,672
$21.50 an hour.

202
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,541
<i>Hola, Alberto.</i>

203
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,442
I think I'm being paid fair.

204
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:43,112
It got to a point
that we were able to afford,

205
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:48,284
you know, a condo
on Olivera Road,

206
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,086
and we bought it.

207
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:52,723
We had our own things,
our own place.

208
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,796
It was little,
you know, two-bedroom.

209
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:02,999
We bought it in 2004.

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,604
Around 2006, start of 2007,

211
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,939
the market just dropped
like a rock.

212
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,009
And not that long after,
actually,

213
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,547
I lost my job that I'd been at
for a long time.

214
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,048
Luckily we had
some really good friends,

215
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,750
and one of them said,

216
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:24,521
"Come over here
and live with me."

217
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:27,393
So that's where we are now.

218
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,692
Go with Daddy.

219
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:31,561
Go with Daddy. I'm hungry.

220
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:34,330
You're hungry?

221
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:39,869
Child care for Paulina right now
costs me about $400.

222
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,907
I'm, like, undecided whether
I should make her walk home...

223
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:45,542
buy her a phone and walk home,

224
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,610
making sure she gets home okay,

225
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,612
or keep paying a day care.

226
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,485
Bye. Here, Mom.

227
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:55,485
Ready?

228
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,460
I have $25 in my
checking account right now

229
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:08,031
and just thinking about
all the things that we need.

230
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,532
I don't have a way
of communicating

231
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,100
with Robert right now.

232
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:14,003
He doesn't have a phone,
so we have to wait for that.

233
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,872
I got to figure out...
we have to have enough,

234
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:19,947
you know, food on the
table for the kids.

235
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,848
$25 in your checking account,

236
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:27,617
that's got to be...

237
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,552
That's not very much.

238
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,553
No, it's not.

239
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,023
<font color="#808080">(SNIFFLES)</font>

240
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,591
But, I mean, it's Tues...
it's Wednesday.

241
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,859
I'll survive today.

242
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,061
I'll look up in the pantry,

243
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,663
see what else is there to eat.

244
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:44,968
I have a full tank of gas,
so I'm fine on that part.

245
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:47,009
I don't need to go anywhere
right now.

246
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,778
When I was laid off,
I decided to go ahead

247
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,714
and pursue my degree
at that point.

248
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:02,485
Most of the classmates I have
are a lot younger than I am.

249
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,354
It's different
when you're reading about it

250
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,422
or somebody else's issues.

251
00:14:06,423 --> 00:14:08,891
That's different from when
it's your own family's.

252
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:10,159
So when it hits home,

253
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,629
that's probably
the hardest part.

254
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,100
There is no official definition
of the middle class.

255
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,468
But Alan Krueger,

256
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,403
chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisors,

257
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:22,104
these are the percentage
of households

258
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:27,643
with annual incomes within 50%
of the median household.

259
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:32,285
$50,000, median income,
50% above, 50% below.

260
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,653
If you're in the top %1,
you're earning

261
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:40,790
at least $380,000 a year.

262
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,892
If you're at the lower end
of this group,

263
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:44,528
you're probably
at the top levels

264
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,997
of the professional fields,
a top doctor or a top lawyer.

265
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:49,298
Higher in this group,

266
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,933
earning several million
dollars a year,

267
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:54,403
are successful entrepreneurs
who start profitable companies.

268
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:58,474
At the highest levels, earning
$10 million a year or more,

269
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,743
are the CEOs of big companies,

270
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:04,080
the heads of Wall Street
banks, top entertainers,

271
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:06,883
and also the top sports stars.

272
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:12,021
Last year, we made $36,000,
and we're a family of three.

273
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:13,290
I think I probably make

274
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,358
in between $45,000
and $50,000 a year

275
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:19,129
working 70 hours a week,
six days a week.

276
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,696
Combined income with the army

277
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:27,070
and with my personal job,
maybe $55,000 to $60,000 a year.

278
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:32,841
Probably close to $600,000.

279
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:36,778
Usually more than $10 million,
less than $30 million

280
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,148
but, you know, a lot,

281
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,221
a ridiculous amount of money.

282
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:46,755
I am an entrepreneur
and venture capitalist.

283
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:49,959
My family owns a large
manufacturer of bed pillows

284
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,394
and down comforters called
Pacific Coast Feather Company.

285
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,297
We are, in fact,
one the largest manufacturers

286
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,375
of those things in the world.

287
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,311
The problem
with rising inequality is,

288
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,080
a person like me,
who earns 1,000 times as much

289
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,649
as the typical American,

290
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,418
doesn't buy 1,000 pillows
a year.

291
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,293
Even the richest people only
sleep on one or two pillows.

292
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,393
The pillow business
is quite tough,

293
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,196
as it is for many,
many industries,

294
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:31,367
because fewer and fewer
people can afford to buy

295
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:34,206
the products that we make.

296
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,543
<font color="#808080">(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)</font>

297
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,311
And I have the nicest
Audi you can get,

298
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:45,281
but it's still only one Audi.

299
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,517
I personally hate fancy food.

300
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:50,653
I would infinitely rather
go have a great bowl

301
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,721
of pho at the local
Vietnamese place

302
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:57,130
than a five-course $300
dinner at some fancy place.

303
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,763
You know, we can only
go out to eat

304
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:02,331
so many times a year.

305
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:04,633
We can only get
so many haircuts a year.

306
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:07,604
We can only get...
I can, you know...

307
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,471
Three pairs of jeans
will do you, you know?

308
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,176
Like, you don't need 300 pairs.

309
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:15,178
The problem isn't that the rich

310
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,046
spend too much
of what they earn.

311
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:20,350
It's actually, paradoxically,
that they spend too little.

312
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:23,154
They're not generating
enough economic activity.

313
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,390
Somebody earning
$10 million a year

314
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,293
doesn't spend $10 million.

315
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:31,826
They save it.

316
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,797
And those savings go
anywhere around the world.

317
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,135
They can make the most money,
get the highest return.

318
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:42,838
They become part
of the global capital market,

319
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,274
including a lot
of speculative instruments,

320
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:48,178
having gold and real estate
and anything else

321
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,747
that they're all chasing.

322
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:55,317
With the exception of the
money I personally invest

323
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:59,221
to start companies,
I have essentially no idea

324
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:00,990
what happens to my money.

325
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,993
I invest in funds of funds,

326
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:08,097
and those hedge funds
do God knows what with it.

327
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:10,700
But I do believe absolutely

328
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,702
that most of the return
that's being created

329
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:17,073
isn't creating
any kind of social utility

330
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:20,175
other than creating
a return for me.

331
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,178
Now, ordinarily we like saving.

332
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,046
I mean, savings are good,
but when we have

333
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,683
so much unemployment,
so much underutilized capacity

334
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:31,822
here in the United States,
we need spending.

335
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:37,259
Every single person there has
to process 12 units per hour.

336
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,496
How are we gonna create jobs
if you're taxing

337
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,698
the very successful people
in America

338
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,399
who provide those jobs?

339
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,568
Sometimes we think
that this is a debate

340
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,970
over facts and figures and data.

341
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:52,409
To raise taxes on the job
creators in this country...

342
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,709
I think if you believe that,

343
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,444
you're fooling yourself
a little bit.

344
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:58,448
The people that you call rich,
I call job creators.

345
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,783
When somebody calls
themselves a job creator,

346
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,419
they're not describing
the economy

347
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,787
or how the economy works,

348
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,722
although that's
what it sounds like.

349
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,592
What they're really doing
is making a claim

350
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:13,364
on status, privileges,
and power.

351
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:16,731
If a guy like me
is a job creator

352
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,800
at the center
of the economic universe,

353
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,971
the current
economic arrangements

354
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:25,208
are righteous and justified.

355
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,976
I know how comfortable
this is to believe

356
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,545
because I used to believe it.

357
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,914
You know, I grew up
kind of believing that.

358
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:34,316
You know, and when people
challenged that idea,

359
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:35,751
I would say things like,

360
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:37,886
"Well, you just don't
understand economics."

361
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,889
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>

362
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,659
But of course,
if rich business guys like me

363
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,960
are not job creators...
it's actually our customers

364
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:46,496
that are the job creators...

365
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:49,265
we are not the center
of the economic universe.

366
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,536
They are.

367
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,338
We need to replace
trickle-down economics

368
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,741
with middle-out economics.

369
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:02,644
And, indeed,
every place you look on Earth

370
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:06,548
where you find prosperity,
you finds massive investments

371
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,317
in the middle class
and the poor,

372
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:12,854
because at the end of the day,
they are the true job creators.

373
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,758
The most pro-business thing
you can do

374
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,394
is to help middle-class
people thrive.

375
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,395
Okay, I'm gonna get the box.

376
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:57,633
Now, see, this box
is really important.

377
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,935
I travel not only
with my MINI Cooper

378
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:01,903
but with my box.

379

<font color="#808080">(HUMMING)</font>

380
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,608
Hello, George. How are you?

381
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,143
You are so kind
to bring the box.

382
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:08,510
We have one for you too.

383
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:09,745
It's the same room and...

384
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,047
In recent years, I've discovered

385
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:14,217
that I actually have
a very, very rare

386
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:16,585
genetic condition.

387
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,854
It's Fairbanks Syndrome

388
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:22,324
that is responsible
for me being very short.

389
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,393
Hey, Bob, let me carry that.
No, no, no, that's fine.

390
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:27,630
My parents were normal size.

391
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,732
My grandmother
always said to me,

392
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,367
"Don't worry," 'cause when I hit

393
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:34,738
about 10 or 11 or 12, I'm gonna,

394
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,573
you know,
have a real growth spurt.

395
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,541
And then I got to be
about 10, 11,

396
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,576
and nothing happened, you know?

397
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:42,945
Right up this way to the right.

398
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:43,979
Right this way.

399
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,413
Yup, behind you.

400
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:48,765
<font color="#808080">(APPLAUSE)</font>

401
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,467
I grew up in the shadow
of World War II.

402
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:08,136
My father was in the war.

403
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:10,105
We were middle-class.

404
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:13,144
My father sold dresses.
My mother helped in the shop.

405
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:19,147
My first job in Washington
was working as a summer intern

406
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:22,719
for Robert Kennedy.

407
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,454
It was a time when there
were kind of giants.

408
00:22:25,455 --> 00:22:28,391
Robert F. Kennedy,
Martin Luther King,

409
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:31,559
they were all
trying to change society.

410
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,997
There was a sense
of possibility.

411
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:37,232
It kind of turned me on
to politics.

412
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,635
A few years later, I was
picked to be a Rhodes Scholar.

413
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,904
In those days,
all the Rhodes Scholars

414
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,946
who were selected
took a boat to England.

415
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,582
The problem was, you know,
when you go over there,

416
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:57,120
the Atlantic Ocean
is pretty rough.

417
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:00,021
You know, I and most
of the other Rhodes Scholars

418
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:02,892
were sick,
and I went down to my cabin.

419
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:04,531
You know,
I thought I was gonna die.

420
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,665
And then there was a knock
on the door,

421
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,701
and this fellow was there,

422
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:15,004
this kind of tall,
gangly Southerner,

423
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,306
and he had chicken soup
in one hand

424
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:19,374
and crackers in the other,

425
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,743
and he said, "I hear
you aren't feeling too well."

426
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,278
"I thought these might help.

427
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,149
My name is Bill Clinton."

428
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,550
At Oxford,
we were at the same college.

429
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:30,556
We kept in touch.

430
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,958
At Oxford,
I studied mostly economics

431
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,326
and philosophy.

432
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:40,595
But those experiences
really were a study for me

433
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,232
of the rules by which
markets are organized.

434
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,767
And this is an important point,

435
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:47,903
and it's one
that's very often lost,

436
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,339
but it was the focus
of my attention.

437
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,608
You see, there's no such thing

438
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,044
as a perfectly free market
anywhere.

439
00:23:55,045 --> 00:24:00,016
Government sets the rules
by which the market functions.

440
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:02,885
All of these rules are necessary

441
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:06,889
in order to construct
a free market.

442
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,526
The real question is,
who do these rules benefit

443
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,760
and who do they hurt?

444
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,130
And in the last 30 years,

445
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:18,201
as the structure of the
economy began to shift,

446
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:20,769
many of the rules
governing our market

447
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,009
began to shift as well.

448
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:28,411
Today we're going
to try to explain

449
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:34,616
the mystery of why inequality
has been widening.

450
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:37,586
Remember, the economy is
growing all of this time.

451
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:38,787
The economy is...

452
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:40,789
The economy continues to grow.

453
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,258
Look, here is
gross domestic product growth

454
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,261
from 1929 to 2011.

455
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:49,565
The economy overall
has done extremely well,

456
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,933
and productivity
keeps on increasing.

457
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,269
We are producing
more and more and more

458
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,738
and more and more value.

459
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:58,007
That's a big, big success story.

460
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:00,041
But here is the problem.
Here's the puzzle.

461
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,845
Because if you look at the
average hourly earnings

462
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,614
of production workers,

463
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:09,050
the average hourly earning
continued to rise

464
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:15,191
until the late 1970s,
and then something happened,

465
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:17,693
flattening wages.

466
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,596
Look at the gap.

467
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:24,200
Something happened
in the late 1970s.

468
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:29,771
Something happened
in the late 1970s, folks.

469
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:32,976
<font color="#808080">(FUNKY MUSIC)</font>

470
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,516
In the late 1970s,

471
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:43,251
I was at the Federal
Trade Commission.

472
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,453
I was looking at
a lot of studies

473
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:50,191
about the direction that
the economy was going in.

474
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:53,796
More of American manufacturing
was beginning to move abroad.

475
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:59,133
There was the beginnings
of a technological revolution.

476
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:03,105
Financial markets were becoming
a little bit more powerful.

477
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:05,844
There was a move to deregulate.

478
00:26:07,844 --> 00:26:10,479
Well, you connect the dots,
and all of these

479
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,851
begin to look as if
they're connected somehow

480
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,624
to this widening inequality.

481
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:24,727
For example, we knew that
labor unions were declining.

482
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:27,864
And that decline mirrored
almost exactly

483
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,931
the decline
in the middle class' share

484
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:32,401
of national income.

The hard part is stepping back

487
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,806
and seeing the big picture.

488
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,875
Many people, even to this day,

489
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:44,614
say that the decline of unions
really was attributable

490
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:49,352
to Ronald Reagan taking on
the air traffic controllers.

491

to report for duty this morning,

493
00:26:55,392 --> 00:27:00,262
they have forfeited their
jobs and will be terminated.

494
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:03,499
There's no question that
beginning in the late '70s

495
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,769
but also after Reagan fired
the air traffic controllers,

496
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:14,277
there was a major assault
on unions.

497
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,181
Employers did try to prevent
unions from being formed

498
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,382
much more aggressively
than before...

499
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:22,986
I'll go.
You don't have to hang on to me.

500
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:26,322
And employers fought
to bust unions

501
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:27,856
that were already there.

But maybe they were doing so
because they felt they had to

504
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,600
in order to maintain
their competitiveness

505
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:44,006
given so many other companies
that were nonunion

506
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:48,678
in the United States and
also many companies abroad.

507
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:56,679
The major underlying issue
was two interrelated things

508
00:27:57,054 --> 00:28:01,323
globalization and technology.

509
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:03,191
I mean, you hear the word
"globalization"

510

over and over and over again.

Globalization, globalization,
globalization.

Well, here is where
your dollars go.

533
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:10,526
Most of your dollars
are going to Japan.

534
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:13,295
Some of your dollars
are going to Germany.

535
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:15,130
In fact, Germany
is the biggest...

536
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:16,397
is the second-biggest one.

537
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,432
South Korea's the third,
and here,

538
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,568
6% of your dollars are going
to the United States,

539
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:24,574
and only 3.6% of your dollars
are going to China.

540
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:27,576
Now, it's assembled in China.

541
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:28,710
Do you get this?

542
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,278
It's assembled in China,

543
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,083
but the assembly is of pieces

544
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,851
from all over the place.

545
00:29:35,852 --> 00:29:38,692
Everything is coming
from everywhere.

546
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:46,729
I wanted my students to see
it's not just

547
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,329
cost of wages or labor.

548
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,170
It's also which country's
workers add what value.

549
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,073
My MINI Cooper
is made by a foreign company.

550
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:00,276
But where a company's
headquartered

551
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,413
means less and less
in this new global economy.

552
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:07,950
Technologies
like cargo ships, containers,

553
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,419
satellite communication
technologies,

554
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,154
and eventually
computers and the internet,

555
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:16,893
these technologies enabled
the production process

556
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:20,162
to be parceled out
around the world.

557
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:22,831
Large numbers of American
manufacturing workers

558
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:25,701
began to lose their jobs,

559
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:29,136
which meant it inevitably
began undercutting

560
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:33,010
the wages of a lot
of working Americans.

561
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,312
Even factories remaining
in the United States

562
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:40,787
shed workers as they automated.

563
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,954
And we have this romantic idea

564
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:48,022
that we can get
manufacturing back.

565
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:50,124
But you get manufacturing
plants back,

566
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,126
and they're filled
with robots and computers.

567
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:54,697
The old assembly line is gone.

568
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:58,768
I was one of the earliest
investors in amazon.com.

569
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:02,904
I consider amazon.com
to be one of the greatest

570
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,106
economic achievements
of our time

571
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:08,778
and certainly something
I'm incredibly proud of.

572
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:15,616
<font color="#804040">But make no mistake:</font>
amazon.com employs 60,000 people

573
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:20,489
and does $70 billion,
$80 billion in sales.

574
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,624
But if mom-and-pop retailers
were doing

575
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,027
that $70 billion or
$80 billion in sales,

576
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:28,497
it would be 60,000 people
employed doing it.

577
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:32,567
It'd be 600,000 or 800,000
or a million people

578
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:38,172
because those business models
are so much less efficient.

579
00:31:38,173 --> 00:31:41,710
So Amazon created
a huge economic windfall

580
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,711
here in the Pacific Northwest,

581
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,914
but all over the country,

582
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:48,150
there are people
who are no longer employed

583
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:51,890
in selling stuff
who are not happy.

584
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,624
As a manager for Circuit City,

585
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:59,361
it was a look behind
the curtain, so to speak,

586
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:03,531
as a manager, to see exactly
how everything worked.

587
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,901
So when you got laid off,
did you see it coming,

588
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,536
or was it sudden?

589
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:11,106
They did several layoffs
while I was there.

590
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:12,908
People who had been there too long.

591
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:14,677
"They're making too much money

592
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,577
"because they've
been there too long,

593
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:21,450
and we're gonna have to do
something to cut the payroll."

594
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:25,491
The hardest part was thinking,
"Is it gonna happen to me?"

595
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,360
Until I became a student,
it was pretty dicey.

596
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:32,894
I mean, it would have been
easy for me

597
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:34,997
to just fall into depression,

598
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:36,499
which happens
to a lot of people,

599
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,067
or go for a lower-paying job,
which would have

600
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:43,074
put me in a worse
financial situation.

601
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:49,678
Looking back on it,
you can see the pattern.

602
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,014
It's not as easy to see
when you're in it,

603
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:53,481
but the signs were there.

604
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:58,720
I mean, there was
a major slowdown in business,

605
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,556
and I think a lot of that
had to do

606
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:03,758
with things like Amazon.

607
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,961
Because I've been in retail
for so long,

608
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:10,198
I don't go through
the automated checkout lines.

609
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,366
And one of the main reasons
is because I know

610
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,269
that every time
I go through that,

611
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,974
it's taking a little bit
of someone's job away.

612
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:21,308
It's not that I think
that I'm going to...

613
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,746
save their jobs in the long run.

614
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,448
But I know
that I'm gonna slow down

615
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:28,717
the transition a little bit
so that maybe

616
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:31,252
they're gonna have
a little bit longer

617
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:33,127
to get ready for the transition.

618
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,096
Contrary to popular mythology,

619
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:44,100
globalization and technology
haven't really

620
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,701
reduced the number of jobs
available to Americans.

621
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:51,586
These transformations
have reduced their pay.

622
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:05,187
I mean, it's not just
that wages are stagnating,

623
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,655
but when you take
into consideration

624
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,392
rising costs...

625
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:13,129
the rising costs of rents
or homes,

626
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,297
dramatically increasing costs
of health care,

627
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,667
the rising costs of child care,

628
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:21,569
and also the rising costs
or higher education,

629
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,605
rising much faster
than inflation...

630
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:27,142
Take all of these
into consideration,

631
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,509
and you find
that it's much worse

632
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,645
than just stagnating wages.

633
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:33,883
It's basically
middle-class families,

634
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:35,484
often with two wage earners,

635
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:38,020
working harder and harder
and harder

636
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,393
and getting nowhere.

637
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:49,031
I work at a law firm
as a litigation assistant.

638
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:50,899
And Moises?

639
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,403
I work as a bus operator.

640
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:57,573
Do you know how much is in
your bank account right now?

641
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:59,475
Mine is less than 100 bucks.

642
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:02,576
So I want to say maybe $80.

643
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:05,080
Yeah, yesterday it was only $30.

645
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:08,183
And that's with us working.

646
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:09,484
Yeah.

647
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,220
Car insurance, $125.

648
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,221
Kids' World, $150.

649
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,758
Rent, $1,375.

650
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,259
We felt like we had
to write it all down,

651
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,662
because how could we
not have money?

652
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:21,562
We make money.

653
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,332
You know, I'm working now.

654
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,067
We don't know how much we're
gonna be paying on that.

655
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:27,502
The Y.

656
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,171
This is my money that I donate.

657
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,306
$16 a month
to Children International.

658
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:36,578
We don't even have here
my UCSF bill.

659
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,647
Remember that hospital bill?

660
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:40,348
It's, like,
200 and something dollars

661
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,017
that's not even here
that we need to pay.

662
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,317
Oh, yeah.

663
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:45,654
What about savings?

664
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,122
We haven't been able to.

665
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,723
We don't have a savings account.

666
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:53,528
I took it off because it...
It wasn't working.

00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:57,433
Oh, you brought your glove.

669
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,100
Did you guys play baseball?

670
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,035
And she's been playing with you?

671
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,971
When she was born,
we had no money.

672
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:05,841
The refrigerator was empty.
The freezer was empty.

673
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:08,009
I said, "This is not the way
I want to raise my daughter."

674
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,812
How was your day? Good.

675
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:14,549
I've seen single mothers
work three jobs

676
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,252
just to be able to pay rent.

677
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:20,020
And I didn't want that.

678
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:21,527
So I started going to school.

679
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,495
How do you build wealth?

680
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:29,263
Not that I want to be wealthy.

681
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:30,265
I just...

682
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:31,834
How do you do it?

683
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,401
How the heck
do you build wealth,

684
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,203
like, when you don't
have anything,

685
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:38,439
when you don't have any assets,
when you don't have nothing?

686
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,310
This is gonna be Mommy's office.
Look.

687
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,312
This is gonna be my office.

688
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,812
It's not my office yet,

689
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:47,915
but it's going to be
my office really soon.

690
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,218
Hmm?

691
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,785
People, I think,
would be less concerned

692
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,455
about inequality
of income and wealth

693
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:56,692
if everybody had a chance
to make it.

694
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,493
As long as there's
upward mobility,

695
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:01,796
as long as anybody
with enough guts and gumption

696
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:04,332
and hard work
can make it in America,

697
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:09,605
can move up the income ladder,
then we don't have a problem.

698
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:12,908
But as income inequality rises,

699
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:16,712
upward mobility is actually
less than it was before.

700
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:18,245
Come on.
You want to see the rest?

701
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,547
Yeah.

702
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:24,419
In the United States,
42% of kids born into poverty

703
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,154
will not get out.

704
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,723
Compare that to Denmark,

705
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:31,794
where only 25% of kids
born into poverty stay there.

706
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,160
Even Great Britain,

707
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:35,796
a country that still has
an aristocracy,

708
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,503
has more upward mobility
than we do.

709
00:37:40,503 --> 00:37:43,471
You know, people
occasionally say to me,

710
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:47,642
"Okay, Reich, if you think
it can be done better,

711
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,944
"what nation does it better?

712
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:52,446
Whom should we emulate?"

713
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,417
And the answer is

714
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:56,418
the United States.

715
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:04,459
In the three decades
after World War II,

716
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,062
a period that I call
"the Great Prosperity,"

717
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:08,997
the economy boomed,

718
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:11,033
but not only
did the economy boom,

719
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:14,472
but you had very low inequality.

720
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:19,306
We made education
a national priority,

721
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:22,776
particularly higher education.

722
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:26,147
By 1940,
only 5% of adult Americans

723
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:27,982
had a four-year college degree,

724
00:38:27,983 --> 00:38:31,289
but that percentage
began to explode.

725
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,225
The GI Bill paid college costs

726
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,792
for those who returned from war,

727
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:40,796
and the subsequent expansion
of public universities

728
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:44,899
made higher education
affordable to many.

729
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,038
By the late '50s, we had
the best-educated workforce

730
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,073
of any country in the world.

731
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,306
<font color="#808080">(GAVEL POUNDING)</font>

732
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,679
We also had labor unions.

733
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,381
By the mid-1950s,
more than 1/3 of all workers

734
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,917
belonged to a union.

735
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:05,421
This gave average workers
bargaining leverage

736
00:39:05,422 --> 00:39:08,689
to get a larger share
of the growing pie.

737
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,292
We created
the largest middle class

738
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:12,826
the world had ever seen.

739
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:17,487
And that middle class
was part of a virtuous cycle.

740
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:40,254
The wider their prosperity,

741
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:42,957
the more people were included
in that prosperity,

742
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,137
the more that prosperity
generated more prosperity.

743

Hello.

744
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:03,278
Okay, now,

745
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,716
they're gonna be calling in
momentarily.

749
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:18,560
America's already
making it harder

750
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:21,163
for young people of modest
means to attend college.

751
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:24,598
41 states are cutting spending
for public higher education,

752
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,806
and tuition and fees
are rising as a result.

753
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,839
One of the things we've
learned about inequality

754
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,776
is that it's clearly
linked to education,

755
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:39,214
including higher education.

756
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:41,883
More than anything else,
that's what lifted people

757
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:43,685
out of poverty
and into the middle class

758
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:45,854
during the Great Prosperity.

759
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:48,089
But starting in the late 1970s,

760
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:51,197
our college graduation rates
began to flatten out.

761
00:40:55,197 --> 00:40:58,033
Countries that kept focusing
on higher education

762
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:00,767
were able to deal
with globalization better

763
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:03,937
by creating
a highly skilled workforce.

764
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:06,040
Look at South Korea.
Look at the Netherlands.

765
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,343
Look at Germany.

766
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:11,212
They've invested
substantially in education,

767
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:15,582
in skill building
of all of their workers.

768
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,017
Even though their wages
are high,

769
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:18,752
it's worth it to make stuff

770
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:21,156
that goes into the iPhone
from Germany

771
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:25,627
because it is so well made
and is so precise.

772
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,761
Basically, every other
industrialized country...

773
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:30,966
Japan, Germany, France...
they are investing per capita

774
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:34,335
much more public investment
in all of the areas

775
00:41:34,336 --> 00:41:36,571
roads, bridges,
public education.

776
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:37,671
That's what we're not doing.

777
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:38,872
That's what we have to be doing.

778
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,207
We're almost out of time.

779
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,676
We can't do it,
not with new tech.

780
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:43,310
For years, I have been writing

781
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,680
about the importance
of investing in people,

782
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,383
in our workforce, so that
our people could compete

783
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:50,954
in this new global economy.

784
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:55,589
And then in 1992,
I thought I finally

785
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,991
might be able
to do something about it.

786
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:01,029
Today I proudly announce
my candidacy

787
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,665
for president of the
United States of America.

789
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:09,404
Bill Clinton told me
he had read all my books.

790
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:10,904
They must have influenced him,

791
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:14,676
because it formed the
backbone of his 1992 campaign

792
00:42:14,677 --> 00:42:16,977
about putting people first.

793
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:19,046
If you put people first,
if you do what works,

794
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,316
what we know works
in the global economy,

795
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:23,919
you'll do what the Germans do;
you'll do what the Japanese do.

796
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,053
You'll put your people first.

797
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:26,955
You'll expand the middle class.

798
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:29,357
I mean, here was, you know,
somebody I'd known

799
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,493
from the age of 22,
and he called me one day

800
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:35,663
and said, "Look, Bob,
what I really want you to do"

801
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:37,799
"is come down to Washington
right now.

802
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,468
I need you to run the
economic transition team."

803
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:44,476
I didn't even know what an
economic transition team was.

804
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:52,881
You can't imagine the
headiness, the excitement.

805
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:56,618
I mean, the chance
to actually take these ideas,

806
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:59,220
put them into practice...

807
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:02,756
I named my economic plan
Putting People First

808
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,759
to highlight my belief
that our nation

809
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,196
can only become a high-wage,
high-growth economy

810
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:11,700
if we make a commitment to
invest in the American people

811
00:43:11,701 --> 00:43:14,535
to make the American economy
prosper.

812
00:43:14,536 --> 00:43:18,506
That is why I'm naming today
one of my most trusted advisors

813
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:20,008
and closest friends

814
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,047
to the position
of secretary of labor.

815
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:28,216
Well, modesty aside,
I have assumed for months

816
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:31,051
that I was on Bill Clinton's
short list.

817
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:32,986
You can step up on that, Bob.
There is a step.

818
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:35,524
Oh, there is a step here. Okay.

819
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:37,459
It was a dream job

820
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,794
for somebody like me,
who had worried about

821
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:43,631
and fretted about
and studied and taught about

822
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:45,600
and wrote about
what was happening

823
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:48,102
to the American workforce
for years.

824
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:51,038
That long decline
in median wages...

825
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,841
the wage of that person
smack in the middle

826
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:55,776
of the wage scale...
that decline started in 1978.

827
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:57,278
Those wages began to decline

828
00:43:57,279 --> 00:43:59,379
in terms of the real purchasing
power of the dollar...

829
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,850
You know, on the one side,
it was pretty clear

830
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:05,854
that wages were flat
for most people.

831
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,489
The flip side was that
some people in this country

832
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,032
were doing extraordinarily well.

833
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,232
You see,
the same new technologies

834
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,870
that brought globalization
and automation

835
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:24,738
bestowed ever larger rewards
on people

836
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:27,642
who had the right education
and connections

837
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:29,347
to take advantage
of globalization.

838
00:44:32,347 --> 00:44:34,549
Some people say to me,
"But wait a minute.

839
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,986
You've got technologies today
that you didn't have in 1980."

840
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:40,254
You know, we didn't have
flat-screen televisions.

841
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,522
We didn't have
low-cost air travel.

842
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:44,225
We didn't have Skype.

843
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:47,127
We didn't have the internet.

844
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,062
So who are
the winners and losers

845
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:52,634
from this great shift?

846
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:54,868
Consumers certainly are winning.

847
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:57,538
I mean, you guys, as consumers,

848
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:58,874
you are doing very well.

849
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:01,207
You get wonderful products.

850
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:05,212
Almost everything you're
buying is getting cheaper,

851
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:08,216
and the investors
are doing well.

852
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:12,687
Here is a chart showing
the rise and fall

853
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:14,723
of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.

854
00:45:14,724 --> 00:45:17,459
You can see something here.

855
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,326
There is sort of a pattern.

856
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:20,361

859
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:28,803
and I think it happened
starting right in these years.

862
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:37,779
years I was labor secretary.

863
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,647
And investors got very excited.

864
00:45:40,648 --> 00:45:42,584
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

865
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:43,817
I mean, we all saw

866
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:45,986
the stock market
going like this.

867
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:47,022
I mean, how...

868
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:48,489
What in the world was going on?

869
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,957
How could that be possible?

870
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:53,463
Were companies suddenly
that much more profitable?

871
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,297
One of the big reasons
corporations

872
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:02,069
were showing higher profits is,
they were keeping pay down.

873
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,437
At the same time, corporate CEOs

874
00:46:04,438 --> 00:46:07,308
were starting to pay
themselves large multiples

875
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,544
of what the average worker
was earning.

876
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:12,113
When we, in the fourth
quarter of last year,

877
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,913
along with a number
of other companies,

878
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:16,984
has to consider
workforce reductions,

879
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,953
it was a difficult time.

880
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:22,357
You knew that you
were impacting people

881
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,426
who would have a difficult
time, many of them,

882
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,995
in finding new jobs,
but you had to do it

883
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:34,804
for the organization to,
in that day, look to survive.

884
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:39,006
This chart shows you
the compensation

885
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:43,444
of the highest-paid
executives in 2010.

886
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:46,948
These executives are being
paid a lot of money.

887
00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:50,116
Executive pay keeps going up.

888
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:53,254
Here's the ratio
of average CEO compensation

889
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:55,122
to the average worker's pay.

890
00:46:55,123 --> 00:47:00,294
Suddenly this ratio
goes kablooey.

891
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:04,966
Bill Clinton in 1992,
one of his campaign planks

892
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,435
was that no company
should be able

893
00:47:07,436 --> 00:47:10,171
to deduct the cost
of executive compensation

894
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,772
in excess of $1 million.

895
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:15,042
Many big corporate executives
raised their own salaries

896
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,243
even when their companies
were losing money

897
00:47:17,244 --> 00:47:20,848
and their workers were being put
into the unemployment lines.

898
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:23,283
I expect the jet-setters
and the featherbedders

899
00:47:23,284 --> 00:47:26,254
of corporate America to know
that if you sell your companies

900
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:28,221
and your workers and your
country down the river,

901
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:29,890
you'll be called on the carpet.

902
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:33,026
That's what the president's
bully pulpit is for.

903
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:34,595
When it came
to actually implementing it,

904
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:38,332
the Treasury Department decided
that as long as CEO pay

905
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,868
was linked
to company performance,

906
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:43,504
you could deduct pay
over $1 million.

907
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:47,341
Well, that was the signal
to a lot of executives

908
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:51,412
and to their boards of directors
to make more and more

909
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:54,316
of executive pay
into stock options.

910
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:57,218
That's where the whole
stock option thing came from.

911
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:00,221
It was kind of a perversion
of Bill Clinton's promise

912
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:02,559
in the 1992 election.

913
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,694
Another result of all of this
is that you get

914
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:11,431
the third group of people who
are doing remarkably well.

915
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:13,535
They're the people
who always do well,

916
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:16,604
particularly in times
of high inequality

917
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:17,872

919
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,611
Between 1997 and 2007,

920
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:27,582
finance was the fastest-growing
part of the American economy.

921
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,651
In 2009, during the depths
of the recession,

922
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:34,654
the seven highest-paid
hedge fund managers

923
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:37,927
were taking in
more than $1 billion each.

924
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,363
Remember that government
sets the rules

925
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,737
by which the market functions.

926
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:50,171
We deregulated Wall Street,

927
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:52,306
allowing Wall Street to engage

928
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,047
in more and more excessive
behavior.

929
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:01,482
These are
the financial sector wages

930
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,219
relative to everyone else's.

931
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:07,520
Does this graph look familiar?

932
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:09,957
I mean, this is
our bridge graph,

933
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,859
our old inequality graph.

934
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,331
It's the same pattern.

does works against you

We ask You to bless it.

944
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,754
Bless the hands
that prepared it.

945
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:41,254
Bless it'll strengthen
our bodies.

946
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:42,957
We ask a special blessing
this day, Lord,

947
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,225
for those that have no food.

948
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:46,426
Bless them
with comfort and hope.

949
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:47,261
Amen.

950
00:49:47,262 --> 00:49:50,131
Ooh, ooh. This looks good.

951
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:53,067
I am registered as a Republican.

952
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:55,502
It probably has to do
with our religion too,

953
00:49:55,503 --> 00:49:56,837
okay, Mormons.

954
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:58,305
The majority of the Mormons are.

955
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,441
There are those rare Democrats,

956
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:02,276
but the majority of them
are Republicans.

957
00:50:02,277 --> 00:50:04,477
Oh, I called them,
but you know what it is?

958
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:06,546
I don't look at myself
as someone

959
00:50:06,547 --> 00:50:08,281
that's economically troubled.

960
00:50:08,282 --> 00:50:10,884
No way.
But I am worried about my kids.

961
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:15,790
We have paid for doctor bills.
We've paid for dental bills.

962
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,692
Two of my children right now
do not have health insurance.

963
00:50:18,693 --> 00:50:22,196
Our kids without health care
was a big turning point for us.

964
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:24,034
That really got my attention.

965
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:29,470
I'm a power plant operator.

966
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:31,105
Where I work, The Geysers,

967
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:34,008
it's a renewable energy source.

968
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:35,776
Calpine is a good company.

969
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:37,812
They are.

970
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:39,814
So then why are they
cutting back on people

971
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,281
and cutting sick leave?

972
00:50:41,282 --> 00:50:44,551
Well, the operation
will be more profitable

973
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:47,687
if they cut back on personnel.

974
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:49,960
That's a given.

976
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:02,303
I've always been pro-union
from a philosophical standpoint.

977
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:05,205
I consider myself
part of the labor force.

978
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:08,711
Therefore I think labor
needs a say.

979
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:13,781
The company brought in
anti-union consultants

980
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:18,252
and put on a good campaign
to counter the union.

981
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:20,754
Let me just say I came here...

982
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:22,656
Some of you were still
on the fence.

983
00:51:22,657 --> 00:51:23,558
Some people walked out.

984
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,959
There was tension in the air.

985
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,162
The underlying reality

986
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:29,997
is that if workers
don't have power,

987
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:32,066
if they don't have a voice,

988
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:36,437
inevitably their wages
and benefits start eroding.

989
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:38,872
It happens inevitably.

990
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:41,109
Personally
I'm a proud Christian.

991
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,276
I'm a proud Calpine employee.

992
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:46,013
I think they treat me more fair

993
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:47,582
than I should be treated.

994
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:52,419
If you have a company that is
dependent on shareholders,

995
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,056
there is growing and growing
pressure on that company

996
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:57,457
to show better
and better profits

997
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,259
and have higher and higher
share prices.

998
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,960
That's just
the way capitalism is.

999
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:02,162
That's not bad.

1000
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,864
But what that means inevitably

1001
00:52:04,865 --> 00:52:07,533
is that there's greater
and greater pressure

1002
00:52:07,534 --> 00:52:12,105
to push wages and benefits
down to the minimum.

1003
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:14,308
So you're a capitalist.
I'm a capitalist.

1004
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,243
I say for these people
making their millions,

1005
00:52:16,244 --> 00:52:17,678
that's fantastic.

1006
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,413
I could have done the same thing

1007
00:52:19,414 --> 00:52:21,415
if I went to school
and had the brains for it.

1008

I do not. <font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>

So I'm a laborer.

1010
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:25,785
And there's such a burden
on the companies

1011
00:52:25,786 --> 00:52:29,189
in the United States now
that the cost of business

1012

drives that...
them to go elsewhere.

1013

But this right now

1014

in this country

00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:56,783

I do twice the duties.

in the United States.

1031
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:25,513

This isn't a matter of fault.

1035
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:32,386
You know, the head of GE

1036
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:34,654
is on the president's
Jobs Council.

1037
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:36,790
I want to start off
by thanking Jeff

1038
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:41,629
for his continued outstanding
leadership of this Jobs Council.

1039
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,265
Well, GE has been creating
more jobs abroad

1040
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:47,334
than it's been creating jobs
in the United States.

1041
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:49,971
So who is taking care
of the American worker?

1042
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:52,473
Who is looking out
for the American worker

1043
00:53:52,474 --> 00:53:55,908
as GE and other big companies
and Wall Street

1044
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:57,377
and the very wealthy,

1045
00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:59,946
who basically have capital
all over the world...

1046
00:53:59,947 --> 00:54:03,051
As they have more and more
political power,

1047
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:07,355
who is actually working in a way

1048
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:09,089
in Washington
and in state capitals

1049
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,259
that improves the well-being
of the American workforce?

1050
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,041
The answer is nobody.

1051
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:30,678
So why didn't the nation respond
to the great regression

1052
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:33,680
that started around 1980?

1053
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:36,584
Why didn't we take bold steps
to make the economy

1054
00:54:36,585 --> 00:54:40,824
continue to work
for just about everyone?

1055
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,526
Because we figured out
three ways

1056
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:48,462
to cope with flattening
or declining incomes

1057
00:54:48,463 --> 00:54:51,668
without reducing our
relative standard of living.

1058
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:57,136
Remember,
starting in the late '70s,

1059
00:54:57,137 --> 00:54:59,473
the typical wage is flat.

1060
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:02,009
But a lot of people are buying.

1061
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,678
How did they do that?

1062
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:11,417
How does the middle class
manage to keep on spending

1063
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:14,087
when wages are flat?

1064
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:18,026
The first coping mechanism,
starting in the late '70s,

1065
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:23,363
is, women go into paid work.

They didn't go to work
because there were

1085
00:56:08,943 --> 00:56:12,913
all these wonderful professional
opportunities open to women.

1086
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:14,247
Some of them did,

1087
00:56:14,248 --> 00:56:16,616
but that's not the major
reason women went to work.

1088
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:19,486
They went to work mainly
because they had to prop up

1089
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,122
family incomes
that were dropping

1090
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,857
because the men in the family,

1091
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:25,826
their wages were going nowhere.

1092
00:56:25,827 --> 00:56:29,196

And so the second strategy

was that families...

When I was secretary of labor,
I remember looking at the data,

1101
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:51,551
and I was amazed,

1102
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:53,287
and then I'd go out
into the field,

1103
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,055
and I'd go to various cities,
and I'd talk with people,

1104
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:57,524
and people were working,
you know, all hours...

1105
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:01,629
I mean, second jobs,
third jobs, overtime.

1106
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,962
If they were professionals,

1107
00:57:02,963 --> 00:57:05,431
billable hours
coming out of their ears.

1108
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:10,236
We were working 300 hours a year
more than the typical European.

1109
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:13,374
I mean, we were working harder
than the industrious...

1110
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,408
enormously industrious Japanese.

1111
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:18,444
But there's a limit
to how hard you can work.

1112
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:21,415
When those were exhausted,
the third coping mechanism

1113
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,517
was borrowing, going into debt,

1114
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:27,687
which seemed easy because
housing prices were going up.

1116
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:32,526
For 13 years, Americans
have enjoyed a housing boom,

1117
00:57:32,527 --> 00:57:34,727
the longest ever.

1118
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:37,765
This a great time to buy
a house in Delray Beach.

1119
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:39,633
You can make,
if you have some cash,

1120
00:57:39,634 --> 00:57:41,602
an unbelievable deal.

1121
00:57:41,603 --> 00:57:45,939
From the mid-to late '90s
onward,

1122
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,975
you have this huge rise
in housing prices.

1123
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:51,412
People said, "Well,
I can take out a loan"

1124
00:57:51,413 --> 00:57:52,712
against my home."

1125
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:54,314
"I could use my home
as collateral,"

1126
00:57:54,315 --> 00:57:55,982
or, "I can refinance my home."

1127
00:57:55,983 --> 00:57:57,852
And that kept the
middle class going.

1128
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,121
Homes were like piggy banks.

1129
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:04,625
Americans have been using
their home as an ATM,

1130
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:09,296
cashing out more than
$500 billion in home equity

1131
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:14,067
from 2001 to 2005 to cover
expenses like health costs,

1132
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:17,474
student debt, repairs,
and credit cards.

1133
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:24,278
We had a debt bubble prompted
by middle-class America

1134
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:27,848
trying to maintain
its living standard

1135
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:30,654
in the face of stagnant wages.

1136
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:35,122
We're seeing more clients
every day that,

1137
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:37,625
very sadly, they've gotten
into a debt hole

1138
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:40,896
that is very difficult
to dig out of.

1139
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:44,096
But there's a limit
to how far you can do that.

1140
00:58:44,097 --> 00:58:46,500
You know, that was a
speculative bubble,

1141
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:49,602
and it burst in 2008.

1142
00:58:49,603 --> 00:58:50,803
We know what happened.

1143
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:53,306
And so all of the coping
mechanisms

1144
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:59,680
that the middle class has used
to avoid the inevitable reality

1145
00:58:59,681 --> 00:59:02,950
that their wages have gone
nowhere for 30 years,

1146
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:07,391
adjusted for inflation,
are now exhausted.

1147
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:14,026
When the middle class doesn't
share in the economic gains,

1148
00:59:14,027 --> 00:59:17,132
you get into this downward
vicious cycle.

1149
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:54,701
The problem is,
for the last three decades,

1150
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:57,203
nothing
has fundamentally changed

1151
00:59:57,204 --> 00:59:58,612
in terms of inequality.

1152
01:00:00,842 --> 01:00:03,243
And it wasn't until
the Clinton administration

1153
01:00:03,244 --> 01:00:07,080
that there was an opportunity
to reverse all of this.

1154
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:10,984
And that was what was
so damn frustrating.

1155
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:13,453
The Senate, I believe,
is on the verge of passing

1156
01:00:13,454 --> 01:00:16,323
the jobs program.

1157
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:17,491
Things are going well.

1158
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,127
I mean, we had budget surpluses.

1159
01:00:20,128 --> 01:00:21,995
We might have been able
to take those surpluses

1160
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:24,397
and invest them in education
and job training,

1161
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:28,134
change the structure,
ultimately, of the economy.

1162
01:00:28,135 --> 01:00:32,872
But there wasn't the
political will to do that.

1163
01:00:32,873 --> 01:00:34,441
Before I leave,
I also want to say

1164
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:35,676
a special word of thanks

1165
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,078
to my longtime friend
Secretary Reich,

1166
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,379
who's carried on this fight
for the minimum wage.

1167
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,850
This was an especially
sweet day for him as well,

1168
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,384
and I thank him for his efforts.

1169
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:49,154
I should say something just
so it's not misunderstood.

1170
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,392
You know,
Bill Clinton did preside

1171
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:56,263
over one of the best economies
we've had in this country

1172
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:57,631
in living memory.

1173
01:00:57,632 --> 01:00:59,665
The wages
of most people went up.

1174
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,303
Poverty actually declined.

1175
01:01:02,304 --> 01:01:04,939
But we didn't do enough.

1176
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:09,614
We did really alter
the underlying trend.

1177
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:15,515
I became a true pain in the ass.

1178
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:18,953
I mean, looking back on it,
I'm embarrassed.

1179
01:01:18,954 --> 01:01:21,488
In meetings,
I would sound off about,

1180
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,723
you know, inequality,
and, "Are we looking"

1181
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:27,026
at the distributional impacts
of this policy or that policy?"

1182
01:01:27,027 --> 01:01:28,495
I mean, I became predictable.

1183
01:01:28,496 --> 01:01:30,263
People would roll their eyes.

1184
01:01:30,264 --> 01:01:34,067
I'm surprised Bill Clinton
kept me around.

1185
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:35,602
I did want to bring you
up to date

1186
01:01:35,603 --> 01:01:37,236
on a couple of matters.

1187
01:01:37,237 --> 01:01:40,339
First of all,
the president was reelected.

1194
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:57,823
In the end, I left.

1195
01:01:57,824 --> 01:01:59,491
Partly, I was frustrated.

1196
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:02,730
Partly, I just hadn't seen
anything in my family.

1197
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:04,096
I hadn't seen the boys.

1198
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:07,945
I said to Bill Clinton
I had to go home.

1199
01:02:17,945 --> 01:02:21,814
I... I do ask myself

1200
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:25,322
whether I've been
a total failure.

1201
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:31,124
I've been saying much of the
same thing for 30 years.

1202
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:34,498
And some of the trends
have grown worse.

1203
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:38,464
Inequality has become worse.

1204
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:41,271
The danger to the economy and
democracy have become worse.

1205
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:47,374
But here's what I tell myself

1206
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,375
in my quiet moments.

1207
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:55,381
I say, close to home,
you know, nuts and bolts,

1208
01:02:55,382 --> 01:02:58,518
over the kitchen sink,
dining room table,

1209
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,087
you know, this is what counts
for most people

1210
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:08,062
good jobs, good wages,
a good opportunity

1211
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:11,665
and set of opportunities
for their kids.

1212
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,036
This is where people live.

like big government?

1218
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,653
I wouldn't have spent
so much of my adult life

1219
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:36,122
banging my head against the
wall if I didn't think

1220
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:38,892
that ultimately it would pay off

1221
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:41,227
in terms of social change.

1222
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:44,997
No!

1223
01:03:44,998 --> 01:03:47,404
That's why I teach.

1224
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:52,339
Now, people who are worried
about widening inequality

1225
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:56,276
are also worried
about something else.

1226
01:03:56,277 --> 01:03:58,044
It's not upward mobility.

1227
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:00,046
It's not even trust.

1228
01:04:00,047 --> 01:04:06,556
They are worried about the
undermining of democracy...

1229
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:12,158
when so many resources,
so much money, so much wealth,

1230
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:14,794
so much income
accumulates at the very top,

1231
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:19,598
that with money
comes the capacity

1232
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,938
to control politics.

There's nothing sinister
the way it starts.

1235
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:38,183
Usually they bring in somebody

1236
01:04:38,184 --> 01:04:39,919
you haven't seen
for a few years.

1237
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,888
You know,
they're paying them 10 grand.

1238
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:43,857
Might be the best man
in your wedding

1239
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:45,392
or a guy
you played football with.

1240
01:04:45,393 --> 01:04:47,259
You say, "Eddie, hell,
I haven't seen you..."

1241
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,796
And then they say, "Now,
I'd like to turn it over"

01:04:49,797 --> 01:04:51,964
to old Freckles here..."

1243
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:54,701
And then they give you
the whole load.

1244
01:04:54,702 --> 01:04:57,504
But money...
I mean, do the lobbyists come in

1245
01:04:57,505 --> 01:05:02,241
and obviously
the unspoken reality is,

1246

"We can help you win
your next election

1247

if you cooperate with us"?

1248

There's a guy in every office

1249
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,281
to say, "So-and-so
wants to see you."

01:05:14,688 --> 01:05:18,125
the maximum in your primary
when you first started.

1253
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,326
"They gave you the maximum
in every general.

1254
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:21,962
"You've run three times now,

1255
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:24,730
and they were there for you
at every point."

1256
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:25,966
And what for?

1257
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,670
Access.

1258
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,904
This is actually
where there is blame,

1259
01:05:31,905 --> 01:05:35,008
and I think the blame
is justifiable.

1260
01:05:35,009 --> 01:05:36,475
It's not that people are rich.

1261
01:05:36,476 --> 01:05:40,279
It's that they abuse
their wealth

1262
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:46,720
by lobbying for bailouts
and subsidies and taxes

1263
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,756
that are going to entrench
their wealth.

1264
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:53,593
That's the reason why the rules
have changed so dramatically.

1265
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:54,895
Look at history.

1266
01:05:54,896 --> 01:05:57,430
Inequality and top tax rates

1267
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,899
have had
an inverse relationship.

1268
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,669
When inequality was lowest,
top tax rates were higher.

1269
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,439
When inequality was highest,
tax rates on the wealthy

1270
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,753
went down.

1271
01:06:19,753 --> 01:06:23,089
Under Dwight D. Eisenhower...
you know, he was a Republican;

1272
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,058
nobody dared call him
a socialist...

1273
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:29,395
the top marginal tax rate
was 91%.

1274
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:30,997
I mean, even when you consider

1275
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:33,100
all deductions
and all tax credits,

1276
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:35,602
they were still paying
way over 50%.

1277
01:06:35,603 --> 01:06:38,705
I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
do solemnly swear...

1278
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:40,306
I will faithfully execute...

1279
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:43,709
The office of president
of the United States...

1280
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:44,877
So help me, God.

1281
01:06:44,878 --> 01:06:46,178
So help me, God.

1282
01:06:46,179 --> 01:06:50,484
Taxes on the top
were never below 70%

1283
01:06:50,485 --> 01:06:54,126
until Reagan dropped
those taxes on the top.

1284
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:01,694
Read my lips.

1285
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:05,098
No new taxes.

1286
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:07,968
I, William Jefferson Clinton...

1287
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:09,134
I, George Walker Bush...

1288
01:07:09,135 --> 01:07:10,335
Do solemnly swear...

1289
01:07:10,336 --> 01:07:11,772
Do solemnly swear...

1290
01:07:11,773 --> 01:07:15,140
I, Barack Hussein Obama,
do solemnly swear...

1291
01:07:15,141 --> 01:07:16,977
In fact, most of the very
rich in this country

1292
01:07:16,978 --> 01:07:18,412
don't even pay close to that

1293
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,312
because most of their income
is in the form

1294
01:07:20,313 --> 01:07:23,482
of capital gains,
which is now taxed at 15%.

1295
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:27,654
My total taxes paid... payroll
taxes plus income tax,

1296
01:07:27,655 --> 01:07:31,158
mine came to 17.7%.

1297
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:33,725
The average for the office
was 32.9%.

1298
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:35,495
There wasn't anybody
in the office,

1299
01:07:35,496 --> 01:07:37,730
from the receptionist on,
that paid as low a tax rate.

1300
01:07:37,731 --> 01:07:41,334
The taxation system
has tilted toward the rich

1301
01:07:41,335 --> 01:07:43,837
and away from the middle
class in the last ten years.

1302
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,573
It is dramatic, and I don't
think it's appreciated.

1303
01:07:46,574 --> 01:07:48,475
What's the effective rate
I've been paying?

1304
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:51,076
Well, it's probably closer to
the 15% rate than anything.

1305
01:07:51,077 --> 01:07:54,781
Mr. Romney's income taxes
were finally posted,

1306
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:57,383
and he paid 13.9%.

1307
01:07:57,384 --> 01:08:00,854
Nancy and I paid 33% or more.

1308
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:04,957
It was in the 30s,
and I find that atrocious.

1309
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:10,796
I paid 11% last year
on an eight-figure income.

1310
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:13,567
Wowzers.
So less than Mitt Romney.

1311
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:17,170
When you give rich
businesspeople tax breaks

1312
01:08:17,171 --> 01:08:18,705
all in the name of job creation,

1313
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:21,974
all that really happens is
that the fat cats get fatter.

1314
01:08:21,975 --> 01:08:23,876
And, of course,
that's what's happened

1315
01:08:23,877 --> 01:08:24,978
over the last 30 years.

1316
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:26,712
That's the signature feature

1317
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:29,485
of the economy
over the last 30 years.

1318
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:36,822
Look, nobody wants to pay taxes.

1319
01:08:36,823 --> 01:08:40,093
But taxes are the price we pay
to finance the kinds of things

1320
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:44,634
that we can't do individually,
that we need to do together.

1321
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:48,935
There's kind of a negative
trickle-down effect,

1322
01:08:48,936 --> 01:08:50,670
and it starts in Washington.

1323
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:53,706
I mean, if the wealthy are
not paying their fair share

1324
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:56,309
and if the middle class
are basically stagnant

1325
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,943
and are not paying much in taxes

1326
01:08:57,944 --> 01:09:00,212
because they're not making
much money,

1327
01:09:00,213 --> 01:09:02,247
then you're gonna have
a budget crisis

1328
01:09:02,248 --> 01:09:03,353
somewhere along the line.

1329
01:09:06,353 --> 01:09:09,024
That means less revenue
sharing with the states.

1330
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:13,459
That means the states
have to pull in their belts.

1331
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,663
They cannot support
public higher education.

1332
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:22,702
As state funding to institutions
of higher education went down,

1333
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:25,475
tuitions went up to compensate.

1334
01:09:27,475 --> 01:09:29,443
I mean, at Berkeley,
where I teach,

1335
01:09:29,444 --> 01:09:33,080
in the 1960s, tuition was free.

1336
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:36,483
In the 1970s, it was $700 a year

1337
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:39,286
in today's dollars.

1338
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:43,055
But now it costs $15,000

1339
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:44,228
for in-state residents.

1340
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:48,861
Next week, members of Congress

1341
01:09:48,862 --> 01:09:50,863
are gonna have a chance
to vote on what we call

1342
01:09:50,864 --> 01:09:52,999
the Buffett Rule,
and it's simple.

1343
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,970
If you make more money...
more than $1 million a year,

1344
01:09:57,971 --> 01:10:00,473
not if you have $1 million

1345
01:10:00,474 --> 01:10:03,644
but if you make more
than $1 million a year,

1346
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,946
you should pay
at least the same percentage

1347
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:09,482
of your income in taxes
as middle-class families do.

1348
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:10,916
He is killing the economy,

1349
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,718
and this is class warfare.

1350
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,188
I think Barack Obama
is a socialist.

1351
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:16,488
It'll only be a minimum tax

1352
01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:18,558
on people who make
lots of money.

1353
01:10:18,559 --> 01:10:21,394
More class warfare
from an affable billionaire.

1354
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:23,996
Is he completely a socialist?

1355
01:10:23,997 --> 01:10:26,072
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

1356
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,805
Is Warren Buffett a socialist?

1357
01:10:33,806 --> 01:10:35,175
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

1358
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:38,978
You really have no <font color="#808080">(BLEEP)</font> clue
what socialism is, do you?

1359
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:41,214
CEOs and Wall Street
have been doing terribly...

1360
01:10:41,215 --> 01:10:42,514
you know, enormously well.

1361
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:44,651
Why should they get
continued tax cuts

1362
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:48,153
when, in fact, we have a huge
deficit way down the line?

1363
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:49,589
Robert Reich.
You know Robert Reich?

1364
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,023
I do indeed. He's a Communist.

1365
01:10:51,024 --> 01:10:53,326
You know that, right?
Communistsocialist.

1366
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:55,261
Okay. Confused. He's a confused.

1367
01:10:55,262 --> 01:10:56,929
The guy secretly adores
Karl Marx

1368
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:59,264
and is up there in Cambridge...

1369
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:00,599
Can I just be clear about this?

1370
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,569
I am not, nor have I ever been,

1371
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:06,505
a member of the Communist
Party or a Communist.

1372
01:11:06,506 --> 01:11:08,175
A lot of people are
watching Fox, and I like Fox.

1373
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,643
I like appearing with you,
and I like you personally.

1374
01:11:10,644 --> 01:11:12,511
I used to be on O'Reilly's show.

1375
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:13,880
In fact, I even substituted

1376
01:11:13,881 --> 01:11:15,848
for Bill O'Reilly
a couple of times.

1377
01:11:15,849 --> 01:11:17,283
He asked me.

1378
01:11:17,284 --> 01:11:18,984
I was on Fox quite a lot.

1379
01:11:18,985 --> 01:11:21,020
Joining us now
is former labor secretary,

1380
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:22,221
our good friend Robert Reich.

1381
01:11:22,222 --> 01:11:23,724
Secretary, how are you,
my friend?

1382
01:11:23,725 --> 01:11:24,823
Good see you.

1383
01:11:24,824 --> 01:11:26,358
But no longer.

1384
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:28,728
They don't ask.

1385
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:30,662
The football field
of American politics

1386
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:33,633
has kept on shifting
to the right.

1387
01:11:33,634 --> 01:11:36,702
I just... you know,
basically I just stand here.

1388
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,772
I've watched it move.

1389
01:11:38,773 --> 01:11:40,907
I used to be
something of a centrist.

1390
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:44,778
In fact, my first job was
in the Ford administration.

1391
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:45,879
Hello.

1392
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,746
That's a Republican
administration.

1393
01:11:47,747 --> 01:11:51,283
You know, were considered
conservative in the 1990s.

1394
01:11:51,284 --> 01:11:52,785
Yeah.

1395
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:56,555
You almost became the majority
leader of the Senate.

1396
01:11:56,556 --> 01:11:58,724
I could have been king.

1397
01:11:58,725 --> 01:12:01,461
Our staffs
were not terribly happy

1398
01:12:01,462 --> 01:12:02,995
that we were getting together.

1399
01:12:02,996 --> 01:12:07,867
My staff said, "Don't have lunch
with this right-winger."

1400
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:09,602
From Wyoming. From Wyoming.

1401
01:12:09,603 --> 01:12:11,871
"There's nothing in it."

1402
01:12:11,872 --> 01:12:13,973
We were approached
about doing a show.

1403
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:15,006
Mm-hmm.

1404
01:12:15,007 --> 01:12:17,345
<font color="#808080">(APPLAUSE)</font>

1405
01:12:19,345 --> 01:12:21,179
Hello, Robert.
Good to see you again.

1406
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,348
Good evening. Yeah, here.

1407
01:12:22,349 --> 01:12:25,352
Oh, thank you so much.

1408
01:12:25,353 --> 01:12:27,554
You're now considered
a moderate,

1409
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:29,589
if not lefty.

1410
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,825
Commie. What happened?

1411
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:34,359
They came in,
and they brought with them

1412
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,029
an antigovernment hatred.

1413
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:40,233
And you don't have
adversaries anymore.

1414
01:12:40,234 --> 01:12:42,167
You have enemies.

1415
01:12:42,168 --> 01:12:44,804
There does seem to be
a strong correlation

1416
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:48,474
between political
polarization on the one hand

1417
01:12:48,475 --> 01:12:52,278
and widening
economic inequality.

1418
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:54,412
Researchers measured
the distance

1419
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,049
between the median
voting patterns

1420
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,950
of one party
and the other party,

1421
01:12:57,951 --> 01:13:02,621
and what they found is that
in times of high inequality,

1422
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:06,826
you have the highest degree
of polarization.

1423
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:09,667
It almost tracks exactly.

1424
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:17,871
You see how totally
integrated and connected

1425
01:13:17,872 --> 01:13:21,273
the issue of inequality is
to our democracy.

1426
01:13:21,274 --> 01:13:25,144
And you see how the ultimate
guardians of our democracy...

1427
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:26,813
if Congress doesn't do it

1428
01:13:26,814 --> 01:13:28,781
and if the executive
doesn't do it,

1429
01:13:28,782 --> 01:13:31,923
the ultimate guardians
are up here.

1430
01:13:36,923 --> 01:13:41,027
In 2010, the Supreme Court
in Citizens United

1431
01:13:41,028 --> 01:13:44,363
decided that corporations
are people.

1432
01:13:44,364 --> 01:13:47,166
And as Citizens United was
interpreted by lower courts,

1433
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:49,368
it basically said
that corporations,

1434
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:52,572
wealthy individuals, anybody
who has a lot of money,

1435
01:13:52,573 --> 01:13:54,840
can flood the political system,

1436
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:58,044
can basically inundate
our democracy

1437
01:13:58,045 --> 01:13:59,582
with their money.

1438
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:04,084
Mr. Wertheimer?

1439
01:14:04,085 --> 01:14:06,620
Robert, how are you?
How are you?

1440
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:11,489
The idea that a corporation
could spend $1 billion

1441
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:14,660
in an election
to elect a president

1442
01:14:14,661 --> 01:14:17,229
and it would not have
the capacity

1443
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:20,233
to have a corrupting influence
over government decisions...

1444
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:21,533
That's absurd. I mean...

1445
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:24,373
Is a concept
from another planet.

1446
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:29,541
The money isn't new.

1447
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:32,379
The quantity of the money
is new.

1448
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,013
In the last
presidential election,

1449
01:14:34,014 --> 01:14:36,950
we saw for the first time
in this country

1450
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:37,950
billionaires...

1451
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,419
I mean,
a handful of billionaires...

1452
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,855
contributing huge sums of money

1453
01:14:42,856 --> 01:14:44,189
to individual candidates,

1454
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:46,229
basically keeping
those candidates going.

1455
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:51,430
I mean, is this America?

1456
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:52,765
Not in my mind.

1457
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:54,570
I think
it's absolutely stupefying.

1458
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:59,805
I think, if you keep going,

1459
01:14:59,806 --> 01:15:01,407
in the next presidential
election,

1460
01:15:01,408 --> 01:15:05,344
it will be, "Have you got
$300 million in your pocket?"

1461
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:07,681
'Cause you can buy a president."

1462
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:11,718
There are liberal billionaires.

1463
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:14,187
There are conservative
billionaires.

1464
01:15:14,188 --> 01:15:21,126
So if you see someone buying
a result that you like,

1465
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:24,496
someone else can buy a result
that you're gonna hate

1466
01:15:24,497 --> 01:15:27,099
if they can give
a huge amount of money.

1467
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,141
You cannot have government
on the auction block.

1468

1561
01:19:30,043 --> 01:19:34,080
If you can permit me
a personal note.

1562
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:36,447
Because I was always
short for my age

1563
01:19:36,448 --> 01:19:39,718
and I was always very short...
in fact...

1564
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:41,086
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

1565
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:44,189
when I was a little boy,
I was even shorter...

1566
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:46,291
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

1567
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:48,335
I was always getting beat up.

1568
01:19:55,335 --> 01:19:58,603
When I was a kid,
the bigger boys

1569
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:00,273
would pick on me.

1570
01:20:00,274 --> 01:20:02,474
You know, that was what you did.

1571
01:20:02,475 --> 01:20:05,277
That's what is done.

1572
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:08,447
So I got an idea
that I would make alliances

1573
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:09,747
with older boys,

1574
01:20:09,748 --> 01:20:11,350
you know, like, just one or two

1575
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:13,189
who would be my protectors.

1576
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:18,991
The summer when I was about ten,

1577
01:20:18,992 --> 01:20:21,193
one of the older boys
who I depended on

1578
01:20:21,194 --> 01:20:25,665
to kind of be a protector, his
name was Michael Schwerner.

1579
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:30,435
In the summer of '64,
I learned that Mickey

1580
01:20:30,436 --> 01:20:37,376
had been in Mississippi
registering voters.

1581
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:41,913
And he and two other people
who had been with him

1582
01:20:41,914 --> 01:20:45,718
registering voters were...

1583
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,056
were tortured and murdered.

1584
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:54,193
And when I heard
that my protector

1585
01:20:54,194 --> 01:21:01,002
had been murdered
by the real bullies...

1586
01:21:03,002 --> 01:21:06,138
I think it changed my life.

1587
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:10,108
I had to protect people
from the bullies,

1588
01:21:10,109 --> 01:21:12,344
the people who would
beat them up economically

1589
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:15,480
or the people who would subject
them and their families

1590
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:18,082
to real harm.

1591
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,751
Because if you don't
have a voice,

1592
01:21:19,752 --> 01:21:21,120
if you don't have power,

1593
01:21:21,121 --> 01:21:23,956
if you are vulnerable
economically in society,

1594
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:27,033
you don't have anybody
to protect you.

1595
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:37,536
There's no single magic bullet

1596
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:38,871
to solving this problem.

1597
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:40,540
I mean, I've written
a lot of books.

1598
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,442
I've come up with a lot
of policy ideas.

1599
01:21:43,443 --> 01:21:47,248
I'm not alone.
Policy ideas are plentiful.

1600
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:52,684
Remember, we make the rules
of the economy.

1601
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:56,658
And we have the power
to change those rules.

1602
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:00,960
You've got to mobilize.
You've got to organize.

1603
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:04,196
You've got to energize
other people.

1604
01:22:04,197 --> 01:22:08,033
Politics is not out there.

1605
01:22:08,034 --> 01:22:10,873
It starts here.

<font color="#808080">(STUDENTS GROAN)</font>

1612
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:29,788
Remember the first part
of the course,

1613
01:22:29,789 --> 01:22:32,825
we looked at the dynamics
of wealth and poverty,

1614
01:22:32,826 --> 01:22:34,260
and many of you... many of you

1615
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:38,163
were a little bit down
after that?

1616
01:22:38,164 --> 01:22:40,700
And some of you worried
that that dynamic

1617
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:42,667
was inevitable.

1618
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,769
Is this going to be
just a partisan fight?

1619
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:48,806
Are we just going to have
class warfare in this country?

1620
01:22:48,807 --> 01:22:50,175
No.

1621
01:22:50,176 --> 01:22:53,246
The rich actually do better

1622
01:22:53,247 --> 01:22:56,014
with an economy
that is growing faster,

1623
01:22:56,015 --> 01:22:58,084
when everybody else
is doing better.

1624
01:22:58,085 --> 01:23:01,754
This is not a zero-sum game.

1625
01:23:01,755 --> 01:23:08,094
History is on the side
of positive social change

1626
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:11,162
unemployment insurance,
social security,

1627
01:23:11,163 --> 01:23:14,233

need to be elected
