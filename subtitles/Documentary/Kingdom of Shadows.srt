it was this guy that started

475
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,438
They were like, "You know, hey,

you wanna come on a detail
and work with us?"

477
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,980
And I was like, "Of course."
I was still a trainee,

478
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,109
and that was unheard of
at that time.

479
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,046
From that point on, that's
basically what my career was,

00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,187

- It's very common in Mexico
for elected officials

490
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,477
to make a major part
of their platform

491
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,744
overhauling their police force,
and with good reason,

492
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:56,549
because the police forces
that they inherit are corrupt.

493
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,694
The missing piece is that
you can train police force

494
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,158
and give them all
the resources that they need

495
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,094
and look for the best people,

496
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,870
but if you don't
hold them accountable

497
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,900
when they commit crimes
or they're corrupt

498
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,004
or they commit abuses,

499
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,211
you're never gonna build

There are many cases where
we have been able to document

501
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,611
very strong evidence that
shows that these disappearances

502
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:27,549
were carried out by security
forces, by soldiers and police.

503
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:31,383
Even in those cases,
they don't do anything.

504

The most that will happen to you

505
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,463
is that you might lose your job,
you know?

506
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,563
If you disappear someone
or you kill someone,

You need to look at it <i>as
a</i> picture of a larger puzzle.

513
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:45,156
The real underlying cause
is poverty.

514
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,955
Fact is, you can't make money
subsistence farming in Mexico.

They're born

and they can't get out of it.

And if they're born poor,
they're gonna die poor.

That's just the way it is.

Oscar Cabello
was the guy in charge,

but in all honesty,
everybody was involved.

521
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,891
The whole town

523

They helped him.

524
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:33,004
- There was a sense of pride
that I heard, you know.

525
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,505
"Your father was this,"
"Your father was that."

526
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,839
And naturally, I wanted
to follow in his footsteps.

527
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:44,746
I started at the age of 15.

528
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,080
You know of the dangers,
the risks,

529
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,619
but it's not something

530
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:54,192
that you're constantly
thinking about.

531
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,261
- There wasn't such a thing
as quitting from my station.

532
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,536
It was very, very difficult
to get out of it.

533
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,031
Dead or prison.

534

That was
the only two exits for me.

- Oscar fronted me
about 200 pounds of marijuana.

538
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,876
We loaded the plane,

539
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:23,057
and we took off
for the United States.

540
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:25,487
As we broke out
of the cloud cover,

541
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:28,593
we encountered a plane
coming directly towards us,

542
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,423
almost like driving
by the freeway.

543
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:35,169
They would pull up and fly up,

544
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,234
right up in front of our prop.

545
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,802
- The Customs Bureau

546
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,734
has set up
an aerial interdiction program

547
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:43,740
using military type aircraft,
searching the sky

548
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,777
for any aircraft
not on a regular flight plan.

549
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,245
- The prop wash would propel us
up into the air,

550
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:55,923
and then when you hit that
down-burst, the plane would fall.

551
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,853
It would fall a lot.

552
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,254
And it was extremely scary.

553
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,522
These guys began to motion
for us to go down

554
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:08,634
or for us to pick up the radio.

555
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,372
As we stopped, people with arms

556
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,005
appeared from
all over the place.

557
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,935
Even the security guard
at the airport

558
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,145
came outwith his shotgun.

559
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,175
And I still had
a seat-belt on,

560
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,643
and there was a guy
with a 12-gauge shotgun

561
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,384
pointed at my face.

562
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,314
And he could not see
what I was doing with my hands.

563
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,954
Every time that I would
go to lower my hands

564
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,658
to undo the seat-belt,

565
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:34,327
I'd see this guy tightening up
on that trigger.

566
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,224
Finally I yelled loud enough
to these guys.

567
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,228
And as I came across
the pilot's seat,

568
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,503
they grabbed me,
and my first step back

569
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:46,468
onto American soil was
face first into the tarmac of-

of an airport.

571
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:57,049
I barely got in before the
minimum mandatory sentencing

572
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,254
were issued to the judges that
took away their discretion.

573
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,387
It was after
I got into the jail,

574
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,353
and they began
to describe this stuff

575
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,356
that I realized
how fortunate I was,

576
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,823
because some of the people

577
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:11,760
that were busted right after me,

578
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:14,536
they would have been facing
a 20-year sentence

579
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:19,831
without any possibility of
them-you know, mitigation.

580
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,873
I was lucky to have been caught
when I was caught.

581
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,614
I ended up getting paroled

582

Okay.

A lot of the undercover work
that we did along here

was transportation.

I had a commercial

I was able to infiltrate
a lot of organizations

I didn't want to know

When I was pregnant,
there was a list that came out.

There was just

Oscar a couple more guns

for the family
to keep in the house.

00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:33,097
- Three Rivers.

631
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,097
That's a medium also, isn't it?

632
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,735
- That's a medium.
- Yeah.

633
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:40,201
- I reached out to Don
when I was incarcerated.

634
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:42,466
It was a sense of joy
hearing of Don.

635
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,246
That he was doing well.
He was out.

636
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,448
At the time of sentencing,
you get sentenced to months.

637
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:53,119
Sol hear 150 months,
and it didn't seem like much.

638
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,718
But I go back to my cell

639
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,288
and I start breaking it down
into years.

640
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,583
It's 14 1/2 years.

641
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,261
Because of marijuana
being illegal,

642
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,964
I lost all my 20s.

643
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,725
- All that stuff
is so old and gone,

644

but the way these idiots
are down there now,

645
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,005
it's almost as though
you fear retribution

646
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,903
just so they can say, you know,

647
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:22,310
"I - I killed so-and-so and
that makes me achingon."

648
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:26,611
What Auden got is just
absolutely unreasonable.

649
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,288
14 years for marijuana.

650
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,822
That's just absolutely insane.

651
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,357
Our law is unjust.

652
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:40,192
It's not effective.

653
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,367
Yes, it is a path I took.

654
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,038
Yes, it did result
in me going to prison.

655
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,801
I think my children paid a
heavy price for my actions.

656
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,378
I was young.
I had a lot of kids.

657
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,278
I started having kids
very early.

658
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:01,614
I thought, "I'm providing
money and a place for them,"

659
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,951
but there was always
some selfishness involved.

660
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:11,894
I bear some shame for that, but
I can't change any of it now.

661
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,645
- The biggest thing
was to see him

662
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:34,047
brought in by guards,
handcuffed.

663
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,416
He had raised his hand to
ask to go to the restroom.

664
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,819
Just the process of going
through door after door

665
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,586
of locked door behind you
to go see your father,

666
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:46,891
that was really
strange for me as a child.

667
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,760
We always kind of
would try to hide it,

668
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,436
that my father
was a drug dealer,

669
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,001
but it would get out.

670
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:54,105
Principals find out,
teachers find out.

671
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:56,275
It makes its way through school.

672
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,274
Some people were
almost intrigued by it

673
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,105
to the point
that they idolized that,

674
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,249
and then some people
really looked down at you.

675
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,462
- I'm gonna live with my share

for having committed a crime,

677
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,635
but it grows from the bottom up.

678
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,131
There's always somebody else

679

just ready to take
the place in line.

680

I don't think they stop
one damn joint, to be honest.

681
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,204
I mean they catch some of it,

682
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:35,439
but there's always surplus
created to deal with that.

683
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,092
- We're still seeing
the traditional drugs

684
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:47,157
that we always saw:
cocaine, marijuana.

685
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,125
What's troubling to us
as U.S. law enforcement

686
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,128
is the fact that we're seeing
more and more meth.

687
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,666
Marijuana still continues to be
a heavy profit earner

688
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,669
for the Mexican cartels,
but the laws are shifting

689
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,502
to where more and more places
are legalizing it.

690
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,940
They're businessmen,
they're gonna adapt.

691
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,615
If they're not getting a profit
from smuggling marijuana,

692
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:10,917
then they're gonna
move into something else

693
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,113
that is profitable.

694
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,514
Meth is more addictive
than any drug

695
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,313
and it's more destructive.

696
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,117
So they're trying
to push more and more meth.

697
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,628
There's been
some historical marks

698
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,630
where the drug game changes.

699
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:32,099
One of them was the death of
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

700
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,842
He died during a botched
plastic surgery attempt

701
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,339
in 1997.

702
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,446
After his death, there wasn't
one true cartel leader.

703
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:43,145
That's when people started
scrambling

take plazas.

The reason that I do
a lot of media now

708
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,136

putting my face out there,

01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,874
it's, in my way,
it's my sense of protection.

The more people to know
that I was a federal agent,

so that they know that if
they go after me
