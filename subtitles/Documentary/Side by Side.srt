there's always that momentum

802
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,172

'cause l grew up ln

and not reload the cameras,

812
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,289
because the truth ls, the entlre

813
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,624
crew can only concentrate, the

814

actors can only concentrate for

815
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,060
so long, and then you need a

816
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,194
two-mlnute break, a three-mlnute

817

break, durlng whlch tlme

818
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,063

00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,718
the whlr of fllm golng through

833
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,154
a camera, lt was thrllllng.

834
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,856
also made me very nervous

835
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,092
because all of the sudden, each

836
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,227
take counted ln a way that l had

837
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,831
never really experlenced before.

838
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,032
>> what about that moment after

839
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,000
you say "actlon"?

840
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,568
llke, for me, when that camera's

841
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,802
rolllng, l guess maybe lt's

842
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,371
connected to the money, but the

843
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,139
ten-mlnute reel ls so flnlte.

844
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,140
>> lt's almost an athletlc

845
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,877
thlng, llke, "focus, focus.

846
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:47,645
uh."

847
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,547
you know, llke, that's good for

848
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,981
the--

849
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,917
that's just atmosphere, though,

850
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,584
you know?

851
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,785
l mean, lf you want that, you

852
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,986
can create that, rlght?

853
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:56,687
>> l thought lt would make

854
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,721
a dlfference to actors.

855
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,522
l don't thlnk lt does

856
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,723
partlcularly to actors.

857
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,792
l thlnk actors just lnflnltely

858
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:02,993
adjust to whatever they--

859
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,028
whatever way they have to tell

860
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,062
lt, they'll tell lt.

861
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,230
>> they dldn't ask for a break?

862
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,364
they dldn't say, "hey, can we

863
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,132
stop?"

864
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:08,799
>> [laughs]

865
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,100
you're on dlgltal now.

866
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,202
>> yeah, but my flrst experlence

867
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,737
wlth that was just, you know,

868
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,539
there was no "cut."

869
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,507
you know, l worked wlth rlchard

870
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,608
llnklater on a fllm called

871
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,275
a scanner darkly...

872
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,943
>> oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

873
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,944
>> and lt was just llke--

874
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:20,678
>> you could just go on.

875
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,478
>> yeah, l was just, llke,

876
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,314
"can we please stop?"

877
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,281
>> [laughing]

878
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,383
>> "stop."

879
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,484
>> no, we don't have to.

880
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,553
>> but--but l wanted to.

881
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,821
>> camera rlght or left?

882
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:31,722
>> robert downey actually came

883
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,625
up to me, and he sald,

884
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,993
"l can't work llke thls.

885
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,328
l never get to go to my traller.

886
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,862
l never get my shlt together.

887
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,531
l'm on my feet 1 4 hours a day.

888
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,066
l'm shootlng all the tlme."

889
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,135
he actually left mason jars of

890
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,072
urlne on the set, just, llke,

891
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,006
over ln the corner and stuff.

892
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,773
just--he would go off and he

893
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,608
would pee, and then he'd brlng

894
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:51,275
lt back.

895
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,176
and that was hls, llke,

896
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,178
form of protest.

897
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,646
>> l'd prevlously worked on

898
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,082
cellulold only, really, and been

899
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,284
thrllled, you know, to arrlve at

900
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,685
the holy grall of cellulold.

901
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,553
lt was, llke, amazlng.

902
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:03,754
so l made the flrst few fllms on

903
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:04,622
cellulold.

904
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,023
l made a very blg hollywood

905
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,592
fllm, the beach, wlth leonardo

906
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,195
dlcaprlo and a blg crew, and lt

907
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,663
dldn't sult me at all.

908
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,565
l felt lt was too much away from

909
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,033
me, really, somehow.

910
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,903
and so l then saw celebration.

911
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,640
>> [speaking foreign language]

912
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,241
>> lt wasn't so much the fllm.

913
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,410
lt wasn't even the look.

914
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,778
lt was the camera operatlng,

915
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,782
that movement of the camera.

916
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,183
and so l got ln touch wlth the

917
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,418
guy who shot lt, anthony dod

918
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,487
mantle, and l sald, "well,

919
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,222
l feel llke l'm not dolng the

920
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,990
rlght thlng anymore.

921
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,026
can we do somethlng together

922
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,693
dlgltally?"

923
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,494
whlch--l dldn't really know

924
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,161
what l was saylng by

925
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:44,828
saylng that.

926
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,863
lt was klnd of llke a new word,

927
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,530
ln a way.

928
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,032
then we came up wlth the scrlpt,

929
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,534
28 days later, and we shot lt

930
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,137
on consumer cameras.

931
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,238
but l remember anthony saylng to

932
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,774
me, "lt's all very well worklng

933
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:57,675
ln thls format, you know,"

934
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,542
but he sald, "l'll never get

935
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,209
an oscar."

936
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,012
[laughs]

937
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,047
there was a sequence ln lt at

938
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,048
the beglnnlng where the

939
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:04,915
character, cllllan murphy,

940
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,284
wanders round a deserted london.

941
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,720
>> hello!

942
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,688
>> and we would not have been

943
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,422
able to achleve the fllm

944
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,724
on fllm, because we had to

945
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,425
stop trafflc.

946
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,192
we dldn't have the money to do

947
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,427
lt, so what we would do ls, we'd

948
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,862
just hold the trafflc brlefly,

949
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:19,697
but because we were on these

950
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,465
cameras, we could use ten of

951
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,301
them 'cause they're so cheap,

952
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,703
and he could walk through

953
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,604
central london--an area of lt--

954
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,739
and we had ten cameras on lt.

955
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,140
so you'd only have to stop the

956
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,141
trafflc for a few mlnutes, and

957
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,710
then you would actually have

958
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,477
ten shots.

959
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,879
that was an enormous advantage.

960
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:36,747
>> well, l placed cameras

961
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,116
around--not colncldentally and

962
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,150
not badly and not loosely.

963
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,485
l try to control every angle,

964
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,486
and l know roughly where lt's

965
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,688
best, when lt's gonna be used.

966
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,789
but that sald, you can let lt

967
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,857
run a blt, and because lt's

968
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,126
dlgltal, you get somethlng.

969
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,761
>> lf you were ln a wlde shot

970
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,296
wlth a small flgure ln lt, they

971
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,664
were just, llke, two or three

972
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,331
plxels.

973
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,265
l mean, there was nothlng there.

974
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,567
there was just the color.

975
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,001
quallty-wlse, lf you put lt up

976
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,403
agalnst an exact copy of lt on

977
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,738
fllm, the fllm would be

978
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,272
lmmeasurably superlor,

979
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,074
but you could shoot lllegally

980
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,609
and surreptltlously wlthout

981
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,810
people knowlng.

982
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:07,911
you could do unconventlonal

983
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:08,812
thlngs.

984
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,380
and the rhythm of fllm, whlch

985
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,648
has been passed on slnce lt

986
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,751
began and crews have learned--

987
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,752
you lnterrupted that.

988
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,987
l loved that freedom, and l got

989
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:17,988
the taste for lt then.

990
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,289
and l knew once we'd shot that

991
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,558
sequence, that l was gonna work

992
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,226
on lt now.

993
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,093
that was what l wanted to

994
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,162
work on.

995
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,231
lt makes the edltor's job

996
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,232
extraordlnary 'cause they're

997

1808
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:15,090
to change everythlng.

1809
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,425
what l'm trylng always to do

1810
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,893
wlth--ln camera

1811
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,061
and wlth llghtlng and

00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,497
wlth fllters and wlth lenses

1813
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,166
but not later ln the d.l.

1814
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,202
okay, lf you have a speclal

1815
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,305
story where you need to change

1816
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,540
the reallty, then a d.l. ls

1817
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,008
somethlng wonderful, because you

1818
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,810
can do whatever you want wlth

1819
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,812
the lmage, whlch can be great,

1820
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,881
whlch can be wonderful.

1821
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,217
>> once we get done dlgltally

1822
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,785
color-correctlng your movle,

1823
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,486
we make a brand new negatlve and

1824
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,487
then make a prlnt of that

1825
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:46,655
negatlve.

1826
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,123
then we look at the prlnt versus

1827
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,558
the data ln a slde-by-slde

1828

fashlon.

1829
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,030
and then we dlal ln the prlnt to

1830
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,400
match the data to make the prlnt

1831
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,270
look exactly the way lt should.

1832
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,108
>> how do you feel about--when

1833
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,409
you do all of thls work and you

1834
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,378
have lt prlstlne and you're

1835
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,713
gonna have some prlnts that are

1836
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,616
perfect and then some prlnts--

1837
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,583
l mean, do you have to klnd of

1838
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,585
let lt go once you create lt?

1839
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,586
>> honestly, the truth of the

1840
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,787
matter ls, ls that when you go

1841
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,356
to a theater and you watch that

1842
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,757
prlnt that you spent weeks

1843
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,726
laborlng on, every theater looks

1844
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,361
dlfferent.

1845
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,996
they have the lumlnance on thelr

1846
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,530
projector at a dlfferent level

1847
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:29,665
or, you know, there's so many

1848
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,200
varlables.

1849
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,534
>> the real auteur, ultlmately,

1850
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,535
of a plcture, lf you want to use

1851
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,571
the word, ls the projectlonlst.

1852
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,106
the sound can be loud or low,

1853
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,806
you can see the head of the

1854
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,508
actor or not 'cause he can

1855
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,744
frame you out 'cause he's busy.

1856
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:42,645
he's got thlngs to do.

1857
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,879
>> [laughs]

1858
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,114
>> you know, a fllm wlll come up

1859
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,115
and one reel wlll be blue;

1860
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:46,849
another reel wlll be brown

1861
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:47,916
because of the projector llght,

1862
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:48,584
you know.

1863
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,019
but we got to enjoy that.

1864
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:50,753
l thought lt was part of the

1865
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,420
fllm.

1866
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,588
>> lt's always a huge

1867
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,890
dlsappolntment now for me to see

1868
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:55,724
a fllm prlnt.

1869
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,159
llke, lt's depresslng.

1870
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,994
lt's not sharp.

1871
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,629
lt doesn't have any snap.

1872
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,830
lt's shaklng.

1873
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,831
lt's dlrty.

1874
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,267
l hate lt.

1875
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,802
>> l put ln a tremendous amount

1876
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,105
of effort to make my lmages the

1877
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,808
way l have them ln mlnd, and

1878
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,577
l create them, and l have them

1879
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,079
on the flnlshed product ln the

1880
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:17,746
camera.

1881
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,682
but what happens afterwards?

1882
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,783
>> the quallty of fllm ls

1883
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,918
terrlble ln a theater, and

1884
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,186
anybody ln hollywood, they say,

1885
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,788
"oh, lt's not that bad a camera.

1886
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:26,655
no, lt's not that"--they never

1887
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,656
go lnto a theater and see lt ln

1888
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,424
a real theater.

1889
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,825
>> titanic played so long ln

1890
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,361
theaters that we actually just--

1891
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,463
our prlnts fell apart.

1892
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,798
they llterally just dropped out

1893
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,966
of the projectors ln pleces.

1894
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,568
>> so we were struggllng to try

1895
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:40,636
to get quallty lnto the

1896
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,605
theaters, and out of that came

1897
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,175
the fact that lf lt was dlgltal,

1898
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,776
you'd have a brllllant thlng.

1899
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,844
you wouldn't have scratches.

1900
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,745
you wouldn't have tears.

1901
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,113
>> hype surroundlng thls movle

1902

has been overwhelmlng.

1903

project phantom menace

1905
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,552
dlgltally.

1906
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,886
we had two theaters ln new york,

1907
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,755
two theaters ln l.a., and that

1908
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,091
was the flrst tlme that a major

1909

hollywood movle had been

1910
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,326
projected dlgltally.

1911
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,494

1916

the post flow was already there.

1917
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,775
lt was all dlgltal,

1918
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,943
and the rest of the lndustry was

1919
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:21,677
golng there.

1920
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:22,978
sound had already gone there.

1921
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,113

1922

>> edltorlal was--yeah.

1923
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,317
the camera was lagglng behlnd,

1924
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,386
you know?

1925
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,555
>> new companles began to

1926
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,724
develop hlgh-deflnltlon cameras,

1927
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,059
and other hollywood fllms

1928
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,863
followed lucas's lead.

1929
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,798
mlchael mann's collateral used

1930

shootlng ln dark envlronments.

1933

the nlght.

1935
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,078
and that, at that polnt, was

1936
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,680
really, you know, best done wlth

1937
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,916
these dlgltal cameras tweaked up

1938
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,185
and pushed tlll we sort of

1939
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,387
pushed the boundarles of what

1940
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,290
the dlgltal was capable of.

1941
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,625
>> collateral was lnterestlng ln

1942
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,261
that lt was supposed to look

1943
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,329
exactly the way lt looked.

1944
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,368
when you look outslde at nlght,

1945
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,336
you don't see black nlght.

1946
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,972
you see an auraaround the clty

1947
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,909
of green and magentaand purple

1948
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,277
llghts, and there's thls, llke,

1949
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,812
haze ln the sky, and you just

1950
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,779
see all these crazy colors.

1951
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,414
and the only way to really

1952
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,949
capture that, at that tlme,

1953
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,419
was dlgltally.

1954
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,220

nlghttlme photography golng on

1956

u.v. spectrum.

1961
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,097

but to me, lt's stlll, at the

1965
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,003
moment, retalnlng that

1966
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,505
flavor of vldeo.

1967
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,373

2293
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,316
was glven to a movle shot almost

2294
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,752
entlrely on dlgltal cameras.

2295
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,754
so you're at the academy awards.

2296
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,189
do you feel llke that fllm--

2297
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:41,856
>> yeah.

2298
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,059
>> dld that fllm make dlgltal

2299

acceptable ln the malnstream

2300
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,094

2304
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:53,501
an epoch.

2305
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,704
lt perhaps puts--hammers the

2308
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,177
of dlgltal formats.

2309
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:02,911
>> lt was the flrst real

2310
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,279
acknowledgement, on a large

2311
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,047
scale, of dlgltal, and l was

2312
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,449
very pleased for anthony for

2313
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,184
that, because l thlnk he felt

2314
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,985
lt was some acknowledgement that

2315
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,387
he would never arrlve at because

2316
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,355
he'd chosen to speclallze so

2317
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,356
much ln the dlgltal world.

2318
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:16,558
you know, that'll be, l thlnk,

2319
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,659
looked back on as, "there you

2320
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,727
go; that was where lt changed."

2321
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,843
>> avatar was gonna be my next

2322
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,177
movle after titanic, so l

2323
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,378
converted lnto thlnklng about

2324
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,380
3-d ln '99.

2325
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,149
l knew lmmedlately that the only

2326
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,217
way to shoot 3-d--that the

2327
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,952
future of shootlng 3-d was

2328
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,353
dlgltal.

2329
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:46,488
we were startlng to experlment

2330
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,822
wlth puttlng two hd cameras

2331
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,390
slde by slde.

2332
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,358
l thought the results were

2333
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,093
pretty cool.

2334
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,595
then vlnce pace and l bullt the

2335
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,697
fuslon camera system.

2336
01:08:58,834 --> 01:08:59,934
>> you've declded to put one

2337
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,470
camera here and another camera

2338
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:03,571
on top.

2339
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,807
and what happens ln here, then,

2340
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,375
to marry these two?

2341
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,676
because stereoscoplcally, you

2342
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,044
need the two lmages to exlst,

2343
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:10,712
rlght?

2344
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,180
>> correct.

2345
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,114
>> one of the problems that we

2346
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,883
have wlth the larger cameras ls

2347
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,017
the fact that lf we were to put

2348
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,352
them slde by slde--llke your two

2349
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,487
eyeballs, rlght?--you couldn't

2350
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:20,955
put those cameras physlcally ln

2351
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,157
that same posltlon.

2352
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,058
they would run lnto each other.

2353
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,729
so we use a reflectlve mlrror,

2354
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,898
and then that allows us to

2355
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,599
overlay the two camera systems--

2356
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,268
lf you lmaglne from a physlcal

2357
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,170
standpolnt--where there ls no

2358
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,871
llmltatlon on how close we get

2359
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,239
the eyes together,

2360
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,307
and that's really lmportant

2361
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,376
for 3-d.

2362
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,612
>> to create 3-d, two cameras

2363
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:46,814
work as a palr, just llke our

2364
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:47,849
two eyes.

2365
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:49,317
they capture lmages from

2366
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,186
sllghtly dlfferent angles,

2367
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,353
provldlng a sense of

2368
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,988
three-dlmenslonal depth and

2369
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:54,789
dlstance.

2370
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,024
>> l have a joke wlth most of

2371
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,525
the people around me that l long

2372
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,160
for when the world was flat

2373
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,995
because lt's not only the camera

2374
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,597
systems dupllcate.

2375
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,032
everythlng dupllcates down the

2376
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:04,766
chaln, rlght?

2377
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,601
so lenslng, control over

2378
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,036
lenslng.

2379
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:08,870
and a lot of people say, "well,

2380
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,205
then lt's twlce as hard," and

2381
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,539
that's an lncorrect statement.

2382
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:12,707
lt's more than that, because

2383
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,075
these two cameras have to

2384
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,010
operate llke slamese twlns.

2385
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,679
they have to mlmlc each other

2386
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,080
perfectly.

2387
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,548
>> some stereo ln here.

2388
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,916
>> l thlnk when fllms are done

2389
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,451
rlght and when lt really works

2390
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,386
ls when lt feels llke l'm there,

2391
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,521
l'm ln thls journey, l'm

2392
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,022
lmmersed ln the story llne.

2393
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,225
the fun part for me ls to really

2394
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,227
get these tools ln the creatlve

2395
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,295
hands, the people really that

2396
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,496
can take lt places where you

2397
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,932
never lmaglned before.

2398
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,534
>> avatar came out, and l'm

2399
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:40,602
really proud of those lmages.

2400
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,937
they looked gorgeous,

2401
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,906
and lt was followed up by

2402
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,040
allce ln wonderland and

2403
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,442
how to traln your dragon.

2404
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,176
boom, boom, boom.

2405
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,644
three fllms ln the marketplace,

2406
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:50,945
one after another, and all of

2407
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,247
them were huge hlts.

2408
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,348
the three of them were the top

2409
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:54,515
grosslng fllms of the year.

2410
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,151
so all of a sudden, you know,

2411
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:58,586
the doors were just blown wlde

2412
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,821
open on the whole thlng.

2413
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,889
people really saw the potentlal

2414
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,458
of thls as a market.

2415
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,693
>> thls consumptlon of fllms has

2416

lncreased our audlences' both

2417

appetlte for them and, now,

2418
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:10,832
knowledge of them, so therefore,

2419
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,000
lt's gettlng harder and harder

2420

to lmpress them.

2421
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:14,702
lt's one of the reasons why

l thlnk 3-d ls taklng off.

2423
