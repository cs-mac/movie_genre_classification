1
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,890
Sir, time is running out. You must
leave immediately. I'm begging you.

2
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,950
They will arrest you.

3
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,220
Bring me the candles.

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,790
- I'm going to work late tonight.
- But, sir...

5
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,960
And my usual glass of wine.

6
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,100
<i>Our world had to change. </i>

7
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,940
<i>The revolution has become a terror</i>
<i>sweeping the land... </i>

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,610
<i>and soon I, too, </i>
<i>will become its victim. </i>

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,210
<i>Convictions can make men blind</i>
<i>and drive them mad. </i>

10
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,780
<i>They can devour their hearts... </i>

11
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,350
<i>and transform them into beasts. </i>

12
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,680
<i>It was in the year 1764... </i>

13
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,690
<i>that the beast first appeared</i>
<i>on our land and made it its own. </i>

14
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,190
<i>One year later... </i>

15
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>its infamy had spread</i>
<i>beyond the borders of our province... </i>

16
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,100
<i>and we came to believe no mortal</i>
<i>would be able to eliminate the terror. </i>

17
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,190
<i>Under its attack, </i>
<i>the province of Gevaudan... </i>

18
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,800
<i>sank deeper and deeper</i>
<i>into darkness. </i>

19
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,740
Who are you?

20
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,670
What has he done?

21
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,110
- What has he done?
- He's a thief.

22
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,720
And the girl?

23
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,340
His daughter... a bloody witch!

24
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,820
I'm a healer. I took care
of their horses. They won't pay me.

25
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,980
Don't listen to him, sir.
These people can't be trusted.

26
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,760
- And did he heal the horses?
- Yes.

27
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,770
Be on your way.

28
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,860
Welcome to the land
of the beast, my lords...

29
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,700
but beware of the wolf traps!

30
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,740
<i>The knight Gregoire de Fronsac</i>
<i>and his companion Mani... </i>

31
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,040
<i>were neither hunters, </i>
<i>nor were they soldiers. </i>

32
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,910
<i>Naturalist and taxidermist</i>
<i>to the king and royal gardens... </i>

33
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,110
<i>Sir de Fronsac</i>
<i>had quite a reputation in Paris... </i>

34
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,650
<i>for being a libertine</i>
<i>and a sharp wit. </i>

35
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,280
<i>As for the man that followed him</i>
<i>like a shadow... </i>

36
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,730
<i>he was a foreigner, </i>
<i>and you knew nothing about him. </i>

37
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,690
<i>As night fell... </i>

38
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,130
<i>the two voyagers arrived at the castle</i>
<i>of the Marquis d'Apcher... </i>

39
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,360
<i>who had offered them refuge</i>
<i>in the Gevaudan region... </i>

40
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,130
<i>for as long as their mission endured. </i>

41
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,130
Our people would not be afraid
of a simple wolf.

42
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,330
The beast is different.

43
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,870
It flees from men
as if it knew to fear them...

44
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,140
but it spares
neither woman nor child.

45
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,080
- Have you ever seen it?
- No.

46
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,110
Then how can you be sure
this is the work of only one animal?

47
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,620
All those who survive
give the same description.

48
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,680
The beast is much larger
than a wolf...

49
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,350
and they say it has no fear
of the hunter's bullet.

50
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,260
I understand
your skepticism, Fronsac...

51
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,360
and I don't believe in... dragons
any more than you do.

52
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,630
But I've had a report drawn up...

53
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
a memoir of the beast's crimes.

54
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,870
You may judge for yourself.

55
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,010
Grandfather tells me you fought
the English in New France.

56
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,850
Yes.

57
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,480
I went there to study
the flora and the fauna...

58
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,780
and I've returned with several scars
and the rank of captain in the Royal...

59
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,190
I've opened a hospital
for the victims of the beast...

60
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,930
in an old priory.

61
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,200
It's a woman from Lorcieres.

62
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,760
She was coming back from the fair
when the beast attacked her on the road.

63
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,200
Her two companions came to her rescue.
The beast ran off.

64
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,080
But it had enough time
to destroy half of her face.

65
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,650
Tell me, Monsieur Fronsac...

66
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,780
has Monsieur Buffon
heard the news from Paris?

67
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,320
And <i>The Ingenue</i>?
Have you read <i>The Ingenue</i>?

68
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,520
Marquis, it's a bit late
to discuss philosophy.

69
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,860
You're quite right.
Let's discuss theater.

70
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,160
Do you know any actresses?

71
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,700
What's the theater this season?

72
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
You can put it there.

73
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,600
They say actresses are gallant.

74
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,470
I don't know if it's true...

75
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,570
but I've read some are quite free
with their charm.

76
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,510
Tell me all about it.

77
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,740
Here's something
to satisfy your curiosity.

78
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,580
The <i>Mercure of France</i>!

79
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,120
Here we have only
the <i>Avignon Courier. </i>

80
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,090
- I'll show you the servants' quarters.
- Leave him. He'll sleep here.

81
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,890
Very well.
Good night, Sir de Fronsac.

82
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,440
It isn't Versailles,
but his wine is good.

83
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,600
As large as a cow.

84
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,370
Jacques has seen many wolves...

85
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,670
but he says the animal
that attacked him is not one.

86
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,310
His muzzle was elongated
and his teeth are like knives.

87
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,290
If it wasn't a wolf,
what was it?

88
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,030
The beast has attacked
a girl near St. Alban.

89
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,480
There.

90
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,680
Calm, sir. No one's there.

91
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,920
Stop there!

92
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,420
What are they doing here?
Damn sons of whores!

93
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,990
Good day, Captain.

94
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,390
Good day, Marquis.

95
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm pleased to see you.

96
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,700
Be on your guard.
There are traps everywhere.

97
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,540
Duhamel, this is Gregoire de Fronsac,
of the king's royal gardens.

98
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,910
He would like to examine the body of
this unfortunate woman more closely...

99
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,810
with your permission, of course.

100
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,180
So it was you, sir,
who butchered my men.

101
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,850
I didn't know, Captain, that they were
carrying out your orders.

102
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,760
They were not.

103
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,850
You did the right thing,
and I offer you my apologies.

104
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,020
My soldiers are not from this province.
They are trained for war, not hunting.

105
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,230
Beware.
She has been filled with poison.

106
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,510
What sort of gardener are you?

107
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,420
When your men
have killed the beast...

108
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,650
His Majesty wishes it to be
brought back and studied in Paris.

109
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,850
I've been sent to capture
its true nature on paper...

110
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,790
then naturalize it
when the hunt has ended.

111
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,420
For the moment,
I'm simply trying to get an idea.

112
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,470
My God! With a jaw this size,
the beast must weigh 500 pounds.

113
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,660
This time I'll kill it, Marquis.

114
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,930
Before the first snow I'll shoot it.

115
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,070
If everyone shows at the hunt,
it won't be able to escape.

116
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,970
Have you ever seen it?

117
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,070
One time, sir, in 13 months,
I had it in my line of fire.

118
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,310
I shot it. My word, sir.

119
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,370
I saw it collapse
and revive itself immediately.

120
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,010
We lost sight of it
at the foot of Mont Mouchet...

121
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,220
as if it vanished into the woods.

122
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,350
Did it look anything like this?

123
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,590
It had a black stripe on its back...

124
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,000
with a line of spikes, you might say.

125
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,480
My friends...

126
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,920
I would like to present
the author of these drawings.

127
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,010
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...

128
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,490
man of the hour if there is one,
as he's come to us from Paris to...

129
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,590
Capture the beast?

130
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,720
His Eminence the Bishop of Mende...

131
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,270
His Lordship
the Duke de Moncan...

132
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,890
His Grace the Count of Morangias...

133
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,440
and Madame the Countess...

134
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,670
their son Jean-Franqois...

135
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,570
who has also traveled a great deal.

136
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,970
- Nice touch, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

137
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,250
Monsieur Laffont, administrator...

138
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,020
Father Henri Sardis,
of St. Alban's church.

139
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,430
And so, tell us all, sir:

140
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,860
Is there much talk of the beast
in Paris?

141
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,030
- They even write songs.
- When they should be saying prayers.

142
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,910
Do you think Captain Duhamel
would truly need the help of God?

143
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,740
And who may do without it?

144
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,340
Duhamel can barely disguise
his soldiers as women...

145
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,580
to lure the beast with strategy.

146
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,590
Duhamel does his best.

147
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,490
You're being very indulgent.
Duhamel is incompetent.

148
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,820
His hunts exhaust the people...

149
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,260
his soldiers devastate our lands,
and the beast is still at large.

150
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,300
- Certainly.
- My word!

151
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,930
Is it to pay Duhamel that my taxes
are sent to the ministries in Paris?

152
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,440
I would much rather give it
to my valets.

153
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,670
- What do you think, sir?
- Don't feel obliged to reply, sir.

154
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,040
My friend the duke loves to argue,
but he's a good Christian.

155
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,840
When you arrived, this brilliant
assembly was chattering away...

156
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,010
about the good lord
and the whole saintly affair.

157
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,920
It seems the pope has even
sent a spy to determine...

158
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,950
if the beast is or is not
a manifestation of the devil.

159
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,440
Excuse me.

160
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,990
Your beauty has charms
so powerful that I cannot resist...

161
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,790
Marianne de Morangias.
Difficult, sir, very difficult.

162
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,020
All the best in the province
have tried and failed.

163
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,560
- Who's the future victim?
- Maxime des Forets, a playwright.

164
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,630
Then this will be easy.

165
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,870
Be careful.
She's a Morangias.

166
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,980
- Mademoiselle.
- Hello, sir. We were conversing...

167
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,210
- You're Maxime des Forets.
- Maxime before you?

168
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,880
It's an honor to meet you. Authors
of quality are so rare in these times.

169
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,750
- The marquis has spoken of you...
- Really?

170
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,230
He wants to write a memoir
of his family, and he's thinking of you.

171
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,560
Really?

172
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,100
Between us, he's in good spirits.

173
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,360
But do it with finesse,
as if you didn't know.

174
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,890
And, above all, wait
until he broaches the subject.

175
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,970
Mademoiselle, excuse me.

176
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,010
- Have you no shame?
- Dear God, no!

177
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,710
And so, Mr. Naturalist,
is our province to your liking?

178
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,680
For the moment,
I've only glimpsed the beauty.

179
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,240
Well, at least one.

180
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,350
Is this how one speaks
in the king's court?

181
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,790
No.

182
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,350
It's a couplet you've reserved
for innocent provincials.

183
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,390
I might go to the court more often
if I could meet young ladies like you.

184
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,030
They're serving, sir.
Let's go to dinner.

185
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,970
Whither thou goest.

186
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,980
We had been sailing up
the St. Lawrence River for 12 days...

187
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,910
when we brought up in our nets
the strangest animal I'd ever seen.

188
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,050
The Indians had spoken to me
of their sacred fish...

189
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,550
but I was sure
that it was only a legend.

190
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,160
What I saw before me was a fish
in the shape and size of a trout...

191
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,890
but whose body
was entirely covered...

192
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,230
with jet-black, fine fur.

193
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,400
A furry trout?
Sir, you must be joking.

194
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,170
No, sir.

195
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,250
<i>Salmo trutta dermopilla</i>
from Canada.

196
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,460
It's as soft as mink.

197
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,670
- Nature is extraordinary.
- The water must be very cold.

198
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,100
That proves that the impossible
is sometimes possible.

199
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,440
Well said.

200
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,100
There's a discovery that must have
earned you honors in the Royal Gardens.

201
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,580
But I doubt he deserves them.

202
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,640
However, I do recognize, sir,
your talent for comedy.

203
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,650
Had I both my hands,
I'd applaud you.

204
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,150
Jean-Franqois.

205
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,350
Would you please be kind enough
to excuse him, sir?

206
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,390
Your son is right,
Count de Morangias.

207
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,790
This animal does not exist.

208
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,030
My embalmer at the Royal Gardens
is a skillful man.

209
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,030
Pardon me this little farce
at your expense.

210
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,130
Are we to believe
the moral of your story is...

211
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
that there is no beast
in Gevaudan...

212
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,570
and that our province
is filled with idiots?

213
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,940
The moral of my fable,
mademoiselle...

214
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,280
is that we find dragons and unicorns
only in books and poems.

215
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,370
Lies may often appear as truths
when they're dressed in Latin.

216
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,610
Be careful, sir.

217
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,980
We may lose all sense
of what you're saying.

218
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,890
But, indeed, what are you?
A naturalist or a philosopher?

219
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,930
Or worse: an actor?

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,590
I think our friend is,
above all, Parisian.

221
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,260
Enough said about this evil beast.
After all, it only devours vermin.

222
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,100
Charades?

223
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,160
This morning I composed
a little poem about love.

224
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
If Madame the Countess
will permit?

225
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,240
- If it isn't indecent.
- Indecent? Oh, no.

226
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,710
It's a poem.
It's very chaste, very pure.

227
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,680
It's improvised.
It just came to me.

228
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,740
It's entitled
"To the Wolf, to the Wolf."

229
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,160
"I was caught unawares,
though I thought not of evil.

230
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,390
I was caught in your stares.
Your sly eye pierced my heart.

231
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,230
I'm ensnared."

232
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,820
Shall I see you again?

233
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,420
Have you other amazing animals
to show me?

234
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,360
You seem rather set
in your ideas about me.

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,860
- Permit me to change your opinion.
- You can try.

236
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,560
- Will you come to Duhamel's hunt?
- Most certainly.

237
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,340
I can't allow it.
My dear, it's much too dangerous.

238
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,740
Obedience is the first virtue
of well-bred young women.

239
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,210
The young man's right.

240
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,880
<i>There was that day in Gevaudan... </i>

241
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,580
<i>the largest hunt ever organized</i>
<i>in the kingdom of France. </i>

242
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,790
<i>The king offered a reward</i>
<i>of 6,000 pounds... </i>

243
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,990
<i>to the beast's assassin. </i>

244
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,590
<i>There were thousands of enlisted</i>
<i>peasants, swordsmen and soldiers... </i>

245
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>as well as all the hunters</i>
<i>and adventurers in the region. </i>

246
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,270
<i>And for several hours we forgot... </i>

247
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,360
<i>that we were the beast's prey. </i>

248
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,570
Each one of you has
a map and a meeting point.

249
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,630
The hunt will begin at 7:00.
I thank you very much.

250
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,440
You may, Captain, you may.
My men have other things to do.

251
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,310
Your generosity, Duke,
rivals your courage and...

252
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,820
That's enough, Duhamel. I hope
for your sake that we kill the beast.

253
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,480
It's a certainty, Duke.

254
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,380
What is that ruckus?

255
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,560
Fine weapon, isn't it?

256
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,920
I had it made by an armorer in Mende
upon my return.

257
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,720
You understand, of course,
it must be made to measure.

258
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,260
Here, look at this.

259
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,600
Even in Paris,
you'll never find these bullets.

260
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,500
I make them myself.

261
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,410
Silver? Are you afraid
of werewolves?

262
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,100
No.

263
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,110
But I like to sign my shots.

264
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,110
I am a hunter, Fronsac...

265
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,650
and it's a passion
that has cost me dearly.

266
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,810
What happened to you?

267
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,020
Let's just say
I learned the hard way...

268
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,610
some wild animals need
more than a bullet to bring them down...

269
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,660
and no matter what Sardis says...

270
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,290
you need more than prayers
to heal gangrene.

271
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,300
- Was it a bear that injured you?
- A lion.

272
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,990
A lion?

273
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,500
Yes. Two years in the navy
took me to many places.

274
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,440
Have you ever been to Africa,
Fronsac?

275
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,110
My lords, my daughter is
the cause of all this.

276
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,510
Here she is.
Punish her as you see fit.

277
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,390
She's ill! She's sick!
She's not possessed.

278
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,690
She is not possessed!

279
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,870
Keep her from swallowing her tongue.
She'll suffocate.

280
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,180
She's not possessed.

281
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,240
I know.

282
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,720
Naturalist, philosopher,
and even healer.

283
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,420
Bravo.

284
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,600
She didn't come, Fronsac.
You owe me a gold piece.

285
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,380
Marquis.

286
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,360
And the natives?

287
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,940
Superstitious brutes, like anywhere.
Like here.

288
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,000
Indian hunters eat the heart
of their prey to boost their strength.

289
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,750
Are they brutes for doing so?

290
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,720
In Africa it's the heart of the enemy
that the warrior devours.

291
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,780
Count de Morangias?
Jean-Franqois?

292
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,150
Please ask your men
to move to the east.

293
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,150
Well, here you are.

294
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,920
Mademoiselle, your mother
will be worried.

295
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,330
My mother is always worried.

296
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,330
If I listened to her,
I'd be in a convent.

297
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,700
I know you didn't believe me.
You're a libertine.

298
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm not a libertine
when I'm in love.

299
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
You're in love?

300
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,480
That's ridiculous.
We hardly know each other.

301
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,940
You thought I was speaking of you?

302
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,990
We'll have to teach her someday
how to ride like a lady.

303
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,790
No harm in getting
a little exercise at her age.

304
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,800
My father sees no evil.

305
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,300
And my son sees evil everywhere.

306
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,530
People have died here.

307
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,400
How do you know?

308
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,430
I hear their cries.

309
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,440
Mani, stop that.

310
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,360
He's right. This was once
a Templar stronghold.

311
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,540
When it burned, 25 heretics
were burned alive in the chapel.

312
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,580
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be a seer.

313
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,350
Simply observe.

314
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,560
When I was young,
I had played here with my brother.

315
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,260
Were you not afraid?

316
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,800
He told me he would
protect me from ghosts.

317
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,280
Have you no taste for the hunt?

318
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,220
Is that a crime in these parts?

319
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,180
The Indians say to draw someone's
portrait is to steal their soul.

320
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,120
Are you interested
in my soul as well?

321
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,230
What are you doing on foot during
the hunt? Do you want to be killed?

322
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,430
- It's my fault.
- I asked nothing of you, sir.

323
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,440
- What possessed you?
- It was a wolf.

324
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,080
- And if it were the beast?
- I don't think so, Marianne.

325
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,020
Thank you.

326
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,790
I hope for your sake, Captain,
that the beast is among these wolves.

327
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,100
In any case,
these won't attack anyone again.

328
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,370
What a curious character.
Where did you find him?

329
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,170
In New France.

330
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,410
He's a... What is it?
An Acadian.

331
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,940
He's an Indian.
An Iroquois, from the Mohawk tribe.

332
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,850
An Indian? A real one?

333
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,890
He doesn't look at all
like an Indian.

334
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,390
Please join us tonight at St. Alban.

335
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,660
It will be amusing with your valet.

336
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,930
- He's not my valet.
- Then what the devil is he?

337
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,900
He's my brother.

338
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,250
Really, how could you have mixed
your blood...

339
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,350
with that of a savage?

340
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,460
A man is not a savage
when he shares in your misfortune.

341
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,160
Mani helped me escape the English
after the Battle ofThree Rivers.

342
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,270
I thought they were cannibals,
those animals over there.

343
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,100
Well, as you can see,
Monsieur Laffont...

344
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,340
Mani is not an animal.

345
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,810
Are you able to reproduce
with a woman of our race?

346
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,550
All women have same color
when candle is out.

347
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,780
And, yes, they even have humor.

348
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,060
If Indians slept with the whites,
they even had children...

349
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,400
which proves we are
the same species.

350
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,870
Don't speak too soon.
It's a bit like the Negroes, actually.

351
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,130
What say you, Sardis?

352
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,330
Without doubt your blood brother is,
like us, a creature of God.

353
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,240
- Have you had him baptized?
- He didn't request it.

354
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,840
Poor reasoning.
You're a man of your times.

355
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,580
Mani has his own beliefs.

356
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,590
At home he was a sort of... priest,
one might say.

357
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,620
If Indians have priests,
they're surely lost.

358
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,220
What exactly are their beliefs?

359
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,820
The Mohawks believe
for each man there is an animal spirit.

360
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,060
- They call it totem.
- Very amusing, but I don't understand.

361
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,100
Would you, please?

362
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,950
Don't be afraid.
It doesn't hurt.

363
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,990
You... <i>oskenunda. </i>

364
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,260
Caribou. It's a kind of stag.

365
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,420
Oh, yes, a stag.

366
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,330
And what do you think, my dear?

367
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,630
Am I a stag because of my horns
or because of something else?

368
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,530
And my dear Thomas...
what is his "totem"?

369
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,170
Worm. Bookworm, probably.

370
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,290
- Serpent.
- Serpent?

371
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,720
To the Indians,
the serpent represents wisdom.

372
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,280
Serpent wise.

373
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,230
And you, Laffont?

374
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,560
- His Grace?
- A bull.

375
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,970
Laugh, Laffont.

376
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,270
For these barbarians,
pigs may be the symbol of nobility, eh?

377
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,400
Whose turn now? Sardis?

378
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,570
No.

379
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,690
It's mine. What am I?

380
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,310
Half lion?

381
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Half eagle?

382
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,290
Go on, transform me into a lizard,
Indian, so my arm may grow back.

383
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,800
Jean-Franqois, that's enough!

384
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,100
What's the matter?
Am I in poor taste?

385
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,310
Let me go!

386
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,340
Mademoiselle, would it please you?

387
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,350
Pardon me, sir,
but I've tired of your games...

388
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,110
and I prefer to retire before you begin
juggling or dancing on a ball.

389
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,450
Good night.

390
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,530
This will cheer your spirit, Fronsac.

391
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,210
It certainly isn't Paris,
but it's the best house in Mende...

392
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,940
and you'll sleep better here
than at the inn.

393
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,930
They're all for you, my lords...

394
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,870
and we have a new girl,
very, very...

395
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,260
My dear marquis.

396
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
Come.

397
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm costly, Gregoire de Fronsac.

398
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,280
Do you know me?

399
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,920
From here, Gevaudan is small.

400
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,350
Italian.

401
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,930
Just passing through the region.

402
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,660
I have money.

403
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,830
You'll need more than just money.

404
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,010
What, then?

405
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,930
Who did this to you?

406
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,430
An Iroquois arrow.

407
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,240
Far from your heart?

408
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,770
I hope so.

409
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,250
I'm a lucky man.

410
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,480
And this?

411
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,390
A bear.

412
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,790
And he didn't like me at all.

413
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,700
You haven't seen anything yet.

414
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,350
My business is dangerous...

415
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,730
and all men are not like you.

416
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,730
Something to remember me by.

417
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,100
None of this scandal in my house!

418
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,210
- Valentine, what is it?
- Madame, I won't sleep with a sorcerer.

419
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,110
- What are you talking about?
- He has snakes on his body.

420
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,410
- Our reputation! You must go.
- It's nothing.

421
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,580
Our friend is an Indian,
not a sorcerer.

422
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,890
- Well, I will not sleep with Indians.
- Your whores are quite delicate.

423
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,220
Come on, girls. Who's going
to take care of the redskin?

424
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,360
Come on, I'll double the price.

425
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,560
- I like his tattoos.
- There we go. All arranged.

426
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,440
So, are you really a sorcerer?

427
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Will you draw my portrait?

428
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,420
If you don't behave.

429
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,610
<i>As the weeks passed, </i>
<i>it became apparent... </i>

430
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,880
<i>that Duhamel's soldiers</i>
<i>could not find the beast. </i>

431
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,350
<i>It was to be our third winter</i>
<i>spent under the beast's reign... </i>

432
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,820
<i>and we knew that the snow</i>
<i>and the cold would not stop it... </i>

433
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,230
<i>any more than our guns</i>
<i>and our dogs. </i>

434
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,840
<i>Remember the warnings of God</i>
<i>sent to us in the words of Moses. </i>

435
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,510
<i>"I shall come unto you like a bear</i>
<i>whose cubs have been ravished. </i>

436
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,640
Like a lion I will devour your children
and tear out their entrails.

437
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,220
<i>I will set upon you</i>
<i>a ferocious beast... </i>

438
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,590
<i>who will consume</i>
<i>you and your flocks... </i>

439
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,490
and turn your fields into deserts."

440
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,660
How long, O Lord,
wouldst thou forsake us?

441
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,360
A candle for each victim.

442
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,400
Is this truly the Age of Reason?

443
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,610
Mercy!

444
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,050
I'll ask forgiveness!

445
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,950
Mercy!

446
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,920
Bless me, Father.

447
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,670
What has happened, my son?

448
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,330
God has punished me.
My children disappeared at Mont Mouchet.

449
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,200
I am damned.

450
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,800
We are all damned!

451
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,180
Gather your men, Marquis.
We're leaving immediately.

452
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,610
Tell Mani.
I'll meet you on the road.

453
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,360
Hello, sir, friend to the wolves.

454
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,760
I have something for you.

455
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,940
I'd like to see you again, Marianne.
Alone.

456
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,470
In ten days.

457
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,570
My mother is going to a retreat
and my father will be in...

458
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,140
- Ten days?
- I am not as free as you.

459
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,200
Bring the torch.

460
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,380
Bring the torch!

461
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,410
A storm is coming.
The men are tired.

462
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,040
We had better go back.

463
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,750
No, we must find the girl.

464
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,350
I found the child!

465
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,850
Captain, the traps with which
you have infested this region...

466
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,550
have killed more peasants
than wolves.

467
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,050
Your men have long been
extorting the population.

468
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,130
And since your hunt,
the wolf has killed 12 times.

469
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,330
I don't understand.
It should never have gotten away.

470
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,340
- What's that?
- It should never have gotten away.

471
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,470
And you, Sir de Fronsac?

472
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,810
Do you know what sort of wolf
we're up against?

473
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,340
Gentlemen...

474
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,720
my only certainty concerning the beast
is that it's not a wolf.

475
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,650
Contrary to popular belief, wolves
do not attack people, or very rarely.

476
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,710
I made a study of them
in New France.

477
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,660
The wolves in this country
are perhaps of a different type.

478
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,990
A rabid wolf would attack anyone.

479
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,120
When an animal is rabid,
it will die within a fortnight...

480
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,060
but the beast has bled
your country dry for two years.

481
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:18,270
I've seen wounds on the cadavers
that no wolf could inflict.

482
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:23,170
And I also found
in the body of a victim...

483
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,270
this piece of metal.

484
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,680
And so?

485
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,780
And so...

486
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,580
no animal has fangs of steel.

487
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,520
The beast is not an animal.
So be it.

488
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,190
Then tell us, sir,
how to capture it.

489
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,060
While we speculate,
it's killing our people.

490
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,930
Gentlemen...

491
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,030
I think we should listen to Monsieur
de Fronsac with the utmost attention.

492
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,900
So, sir, according to you...

493
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,470
the beast would not be
an ordinary animal?

494
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,480
We all think the same thing.

495
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,350
And as for me...

496
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,750
I am pleased that you admit
to its supernatural character.

497
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,150
I did not admit to anything, Father.

498
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,860
I have only doubts.

499
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,520
Fronsac, have you anything to add?

500
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,460
No, sir.

501
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,700
Gentlemen, I've just received this
from Paris.

502
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,070
Captain Duhamel,
His Majesty has been informed...

503
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,440
of your failed attempts
to kill the beast...

504
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,410
and he's asked me
to dismiss you from your functions.

505
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,950
You and your men will join your regiment
in Langogne at once.

506
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,890
Monsieur Beauterne, the king's
master-at-arms, is on his way...

507
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,020
and His Majesty has sent him
to kill the ferocious wolf.

508
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,700
He is the only authorized hunter
in the diocese.

509
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,200
Gentlemen.

510
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,510
Have you forgiven me?

511
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,640
Let's say I was curious to know
my totem. Is that how you say it?

512
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,710
I would say a mermaid.

513
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,420
Are you never serious?

514
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,760
I'll ask your redskin.

515
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,100
And the beast...
have you seen it yet?

516
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,430
No.

517
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,300
You don't wish to speak of it?

518
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,730
I have nothing to say
but absurd suppositions...

519
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,930
that will earn me the title
of fool in the king's garden.

520
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,410
If I were to say that the beast
is made up of flesh and steel...

521
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,310
that it could reason
and that it could disappear at will...

522
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,680
what would you think?

523
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,310
That our country air
has affected your head.

524
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,280
As if it were eluding me.

525
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,050
You haven't been here
three months...

526
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,150
and you expect
to have finished already?

527
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,290
Did you think the beast
would surrender when it saw you?

528
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,860
- Perhaps it's frightened of you.
- Am I really that frightening?

529
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,270
A victory that comes dearly
is better savored.

530
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,540
Jean-Franqois tells me
you'd like to go to Africa.

531
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,140
For the moment
it's only a dream of a naturalist...

532
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,940
who's had enough of winter.

533
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,180
And you? Have you never wanted
to know other horizons?

534
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,010
The girls here have
more duties than desires.

535
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,350
Do you see Sardis on the ramparts?

536
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,680
- Are you being watched?
- Oh, no.

537
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,850
He's there to protect me.

538
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,330
Alone with you in this park,
God knows what might happen to me.

539
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,100
Let's go in.
Our priest will catch cold.

540
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,380
Good evening, sir.

541
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,650
Good evening, sir.

542
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,530
You are in love.

543
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,660
I don't know.

544
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,960
I know.

545
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,990
The cards?

546
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,060
I've never had a need for them
for you, my friend.

547
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,070
So let's drink.

548
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,150
To Mademoiselle de Morangias.

549
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,840
What?

550
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,350
Her brother was here last night.

551
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,080
And you slept with him?

552
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,430
Slept with him?
He can't stand to be touched.

553
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,860
He watches, he drinks...

554
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,730
and when he's drunk too much,
he talks in his sleep, like all men.

555
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,530
Do I talk in my sleep?

556
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,630
And I say?

557
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,850
Do you know how Florentine women
keep their husbands at home?

558
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,580
No.

559
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,260
Each morning they slip them
poison, slow poison...

560
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,560
and each evening, the antidote.

561
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,470
The husband
who doesn't come home...

562
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,460
has a very bad night.

563
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,370
A woman like you
has no need of that.

564
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,340
No.

565
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,650
Anyway, we're not married.

566
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,670
Make way for Antoine de Beauterne,
royal master-at-arms...

567
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,040
who has come to rid the country
of the beast.

568
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,960
Sir, I'm Gregoire de Fronsac.

569
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,400
Oh, yes, sent by Buffon.
The royal taxidermist.

570
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,500
Lord Beauterne is staying
at Sir Laffont's.

571
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,560
We're expected at 2:00 precisely.

572
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,080
His Majesty has asked my advice
concerning your report.

573
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,390
Very complicated fables, indeed.

574
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,620
I think the beast is a wolf.

575
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,790
I will ride into the country
tomorrow.

576
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,300
I do not wish you
to accompany me.

577
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,640
And why is that?

578
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,770
It pleases the king
to assign me this matter, young man...

579
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,330
and to let me handle it
as I see fit.

580
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,440
I have no need of you
to terminate this affair.

581
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,810
On the table you will find a letter
signed by the Count de Buffon...

582
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,650
and by our beloved king.

583
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,350
I follow his orders, sir,
but believe me, this is not a wolf.

584
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,800
I've already read your memoir.

585
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,730
Take no more pains
over this beast, my friend.

586
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,270
I'll handle it.

587
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,900
You are dismissed.

588
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,580
Come here. Come.

589
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,610
Come!

590
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,820
<i>It's a woman from Lorcieres. </i>

591
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,520
<i>She was coming back from the fair</i>
<i>when the beast attacked her on the road. </i>

592
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,890
<i>We lost sight of it</i>
<i>at the foot of Mont Mouchet... </i>

593
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,730
<i>as if it vanished into the woods. </i>

594
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,290
<i>Fronsac, the beast</i>
<i>has attacked a girl near St. Alban. </i>

595
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,770
<i>God has punished me. My children</i>
<i>have vanished at Mont Mouchet. </i>

596
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,410
<i>I don't believe in dragons</i>
<i>any more than you do. </i>

597
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:05,320
<i>Is there much talk of the beast</i>
<i>in Paris? </i>

598
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,680
<i>My only certainty concerning the beast</i>
<i>is that it's not a wolf. </i>

599
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,820
<i>A rabid wolf would attack anyone. </i>

600
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,290
<i>I am pleased that you admit</i>...

601
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,420
<i>No animal has fangs of steel. </i>

602
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,760
Sir, you must come.
Please hurry.

603
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,770
I saw him!

604
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,070
He was using poison
while reciting satanic incantations.

605
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,710
God only knows for how long.

606
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,160
Let him go.

607
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,760
It's an Indian remedy, Father.

608
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,800
Only our prayers may save her.

609
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,860
But... She was...

610
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,090
A miracle!

611
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,730
Tell me:
What happened to your brother?

612
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,850
- A man with the beast?
- Come now.

613
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,790
The child knows not
what she's saying.

614
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,380
Yes, sir, the beast is dead.

615
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,390
Ten bullets.
It never had a chance.

616
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,590
We have brought you
the necessary equipment.

617
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,650
Begin your work at once.

618
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,270
That!

619
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,170
Get to work.
Lord Beauterne is on his way.

620
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,210
- Ridiculous. This is not the beast!
- You must wait for Lord Beauterne!

621
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,010
I don't like your tone, braggart.

622
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,570
Hello, sir.

623
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,020
Leave us.

624
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,880
So, Fronsac,
my beast doesn't please you?

625
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,020
What does all this mean, Beauterne?

626
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,180
That animal is not the beast
and you know it.

627
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,890
Good God! His jaws are two times
the size of these.

628
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,490
- You have all you need here to fix that.
- What do you mean?

629
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,930
As you know, I must bring
the beast back to Paris...

630
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,300
and I have only this wolf,
so you're gonna make me a beast.

631
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,130
- And you hope to make the king...
- No, Fronsac.

632
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,380
I'm carrying out his wishes.

633
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:18,240
You would be wise to do the same.

634
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:22,810
- You threaten me, sir.
- At my age? Come now.

635
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,680
You know who I am...

636
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,310
and you are far too intelligent
to be threatened.

637
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,190
If you do your duty,
the king will be very grateful.

638
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,020
If not, he will be
very disappointed.

639
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,760
You have everything you need.
I'm counting on you.

640
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,200
Good-bye for now.

641
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,090
<i>On this historic day... </i>

642
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,960
<i>I would first like to thank</i>
<i>Sir Gregoire de Fronsac... </i>

643
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,230
<i>of His Majesty's Royal Gardens. </i>

644
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,500
<i>The beast of Gevaudan is dead, </i>
<i>thanks to him. </i>

645
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,700
But it is, above all,
thanks to Your Majesty.

646
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,240
Let it be said...

647
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:38,470
it is you alone who possesses
the sovereign power.

648
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,580
Only an animal can ignore that...

649
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,140
but that animal is no more.

650
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:50,410
I am deserving of little merit,
in all truth.

651
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,990
Invested with your power...

652
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,960
I had only to appear in Gevaudan...

653
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,360
for the beast
to surrender its life.

654
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,970
Monsieur Laffont,
what is this masquerade?

655
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,100
Beauterne carried out
the orders he received.

656
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,200
We must all do the same,
mustn't we?

657
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,180
- What orders?
- Mine.

658
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,620
Fronsac, may I present
Monsieur Mercier...

659
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:23,620
special counsel to His Majesty
in charge of affairs of the interior.

660
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:28,150
It was his idea to send
Antoine de Beauterne to Gevaudan.

661
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,530
So it is to you, sir, that we owe
this prompt victory over the beast.

662
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,000
Your scruples do you honor, Fronsac,
but this is an affair of state.

663
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,300
Have you read this?

664
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:42,100
You will no longer find this book
for sale, but keep it as a souvenir.

665
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,730
Did you have it censored?

666
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,610
Disguised as a novel, this book
undermines the king's authority.

667
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,050
If we had waited too long, this affair
would have been troublesome.

668
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,950
People are so gullible.

669
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,040
If I understand you, sir...

670
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,890
it is better to lie
than to let lies be spread.

671
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,350
The truth is very complicated.

672
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:02,160
To govern,
you must make things simple.

673
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,330
The beast was causing a problem.
No more beast... no more problem.

674
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,330
- It will continue to kill.
- No one will hear of the beast again.

675
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,200
That's what counts.

676
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,000
Ah, I'd forgotten.

677
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,840
His Majesty would like
to thank you for all you've done.

678
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,400
It is said you would like
to explore Africa.

679
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,380
In six months a schooner will sail
from Nantes destined for Senegal.

680
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:25,350
If you so desire,
you may make the voyage.

681
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,080
Of course, we'll never speak again
of Gevaudan, will we, Fronsac?

682
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,720
Well, Fronsac?

683
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,890
<i>Officially, the beast was dead. </i>

684
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:18,850
<i>What truly happened</i>
<i>cannot be found in history books. </i>

685
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,690
<i>The affair was kept very quiet. </i>

686
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,800
Is he bidding us welcome?

687
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,070
He wants to help us.

688
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,970
Go to the castle.

689
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,100
I'll join you there later.

690
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,220
<i>Fronsac left Mani</i>
<i>to prepare for the hunt. </i>

691
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:53,760
<i>The beast was not his only reason</i>
<i>for returning to Gevaudan. </i>

692
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,370
What is it?

693
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,950
Where is the home
ofJeanne and Pierre Roulier?

694
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,510
Go straight on.
It's the last house in the village.

695
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,500
Calm down.

696
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:29,220
This is Jeanne.

697
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,660
My nanny.

698
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:36,260
Pierre, go fetch some wine.

699
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,110
My mother is having me watched.
Perhaps they know you've returned.

700
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,670
To hell with your family.
I'll tear you away from them.

701
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,230
I can't stand my mother anymore.
NorJean-Franqois.

702
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:15,900
I want to go far away from here.

703
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,440
In one week
I'll bring you to Paris.

704
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,130
Why wait?

705
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:22,200
I'm leaving again for the hunt.

706
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,540
- I promised the marquis.
- I thought you had returned for me.

707
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,350
Marianne, leave... slowly!

708
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,850
Look at me!

709
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,990
Come on!

710
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,510
What's going on here?

711
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:18,850
My God!

712
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,310
Tell me, Fronsac:

713
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,530
Do you really think
we'll find the beast?

714
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:10,740
- I thought we would have more men.
- Mani knows what he's doing.

715
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,640
I'm hunting a man.

716
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,240
- A man?
- The beast is only an instrument.

717
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,310
A weapon in the hands
of a sick mind.

718
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:25,260
- An assassin would be more secretive.
- Quite right, Marquis.

719
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:28,230
The first mystery of the beast
is its celebrity.

720
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,890
Its master wants people to talk.

721
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,940
- He wants to make noise and frighten us.
- What do you mean?

722
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,790
This book is sold
throughout the kingdom.

723
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,330
The author maintains
that the beast has come...

724
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:45,570
to punish the king for his indulgence
of the philosophers.

725
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,940
- Just gossip. Who's the author?
- That I don't know.

726
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,010
But the beast has a master,
and it's him that I want.

727
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:14,370
Perhaps your weapon
will be useful...

728
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:17,370
but only in your hands, Marquis.

729
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,510
And you, Mani?

730
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,510
Which will you choose?

731
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,340
Mani doesn't like firearms.

732
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,080
Too much noise,
too much smoke...

733
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,550
very bad smell.

734
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,610
Everything will be fine,
Grandfather.

735
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,710
Don't you worry.

736
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,010
We're well prepared.

737
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,550
Tell me about the Americas.

738
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,420
The Americas?

739
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,350
Will you ever return?

740
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,290
Bad memories.

741
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,560
And Mani?
Does he not miss his tribe?

742
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:28,160
His tribe no longer exists.

743
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,240
Before our attack, the pox
had already decimated his village.

744
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:36,470
We'd received orders
to execute all the survivors.

745
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,670
The women and the children.

746
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:40,750
Only Mani escaped.

747
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,650
How?

748
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,910
My captain wanted
a Mohawk interpreter.

749
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:47,320
I was to teach him our language...

750
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:50,050
and three weeks later I find him
slitting the captain's throat.

751
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:53,160
Why didn't you turn him in?

752
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,550
You know how that man
fought his battles.

753
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:00,060
He gave his scouts the infected sheets
from a hospital in Quebec.

754
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,470
The Iroquois bought them
and fell sick.

755
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,400
Three weeks later
we finished off the job.

756
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:07,340
Is that how war is fought?

757
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:10,400
In any case,
that's how we lost.

758
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,310
Where did Mani go?

759
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,910
- To speak to the trees.
- To the trees?

760
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,650
The trees speak.

761
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:26,930
White man does not know
how to listen... or to see.

762
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,220
See what, Mani?

763
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,200
You want to learn?

764
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,540
- What's that?
- An Indian sacrament.

765
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,870
At your own risk, Marquis.

766
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:50,210
- What does it do?
- It depends on the person.

767
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,790
The Indians say you see
what cannot be seen.

768
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,810
Well, Mani?

769
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:00,450
The beast is in the forest.

770
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,650
- The wolves will help us.
- I don't see anything.

771
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:07,630
Tonight we will dance
the dance of blood...

772
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,230
and the beast will come to us
with the sun.

773
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,440
I feel nothing.

774
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:17,600
It's not doing anyth...

775
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:25,720
<i>That night, Mani called forth</i>
<i>the spirits of the forest... </i>

776
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:29,320
<i>in a language that even the knight</i>
<i>himself did not understand... </i>

777
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:32,150
<i>and the wolves brought them</i>
<i>to the beast. </i>

778
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,840
Don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

779
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,570
It's all right, Pretty.

780
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,970
I'll heal you.

781
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,810
I'll take care of you.

782
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:07,160
Thomas is asleep.

783
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,870
He very nearly died.

784
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,230
I'm so sorry for the Indian.

785
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:14,070
What is over there?

786
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,540
Tell me: What is that house?
I need to know.

787
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:21,340
It's a domain, a hunting domain.

788
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,610
Monsieur, you are in need of rest.

789
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,180
<i>Fronsac returned to Mani's body. </i>

790
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:07,910
<i>His vengeance was</i>
<i>far from being exacted. </i>

791
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:12,250
<i>But according to Indian custom, </i>
<i>it was at the first light of dawn... </i>

792
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:15,850
<i>that he could best help his friend</i>
<i>join his ancestors. </i>

793
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:23,700
What do you want?

794
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,440
Far too much blood has been shed.

795
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:30,510
You're in great peril if you don't
leave the province immediately.

796
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,170
I have no intention of leaving.
I have a matter to settle.

797
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,780
Is it worth risking your life?

798
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,110
How long have you known?

799
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,910
I don't know
what you're talking about.

800
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:45,150
You're lying, Sardis.
Come on.

801
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:49,290
How could you have let this happen?

802
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,630
No one will believe you.

803
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:57,070
Leave here at once.

804
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:00,840
God bless you.

805
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,440
And may the devil take your soul.

806
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:27,030
Sir, you're under arrest.

807
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:30,230
By virtue of the powers invested
in me by Monsieur Laffont...

808
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,960
I must ask you to follow us
without resistance.

809
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,530
This is ridiculous, Lieut...

810
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:13,600
- Chief, there's a lady here to see you.
- Later. Tonight.

811
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:26,320
- Get up. You have a visitor.
- I'm no longer a secret?

812
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:28,380
Depend's from whom, my friend.

813
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,230
So sorry.

814
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:45,680
Bring some dinner to your guest.

815
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,240
How did you...

816
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,320
Many owe me favors.

817
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:56,580
You must help me. I must
write to the king. You have no idea.

818
01:43:58,390 --> 01:44:01,420
Even if I help you, you'll be hanged
before your letter arrives.

819
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,890
That can't be.
I haven't yet been judged.

820
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:06,720
Here.

821
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:16,300
- What do you know of the beast?
- It's a trained animal.

822
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,000
Covered in armor.

823
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,670
I wounded him.

824
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,880
Since when does this interest you?

825
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:29,390
Two years ago,
a confidential letter from Sardis...

826
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:31,450
was given to the pope.

827
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:35,290
It announced the creation
of a secret society...

828
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,020
whose goal, let's say...

829
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,030
was to spread and defend
the word of the church...

830
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,900
by all possible means.

831
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:44,530
The Brotherhood.

832
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,900
Sardis!

833
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:50,800
He will use the beast.

834
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:56,310
The beast is a warning to the king.

835
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:01,320
"Respect the power of God
or risk the apocalypse."

836
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,920
The members call themselves
the Wolves of God.

837
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:10,260
The brotherhood works
for the church?

838
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:17,230
Sardis works for himself.

839
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:19,770
Enlightenment has driven him mad...

840
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,900
and Rome has no control
over his organization.

841
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:29,240
And who do you work for?

842
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,770
Those who employ me also pay me
to keep that information silent.

843
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:43,730
And you know enough already.

844
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:57,640
Mademoiselle de Morangias,
to what do I owe this honor?

845
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,200
How fares your mother,
Madame the Countess?

846
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,680
I pray you, please sit down.

847
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,980
And your father?
Still taking the cure?

848
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:10,450
That man loves his rich food.

849
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,860
Sir Laffont, you have arrested
Gregoire de Fronsac.

850
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:16,530
Yes.

851
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,090
Who would have thought
that he could have fallen so low?

852
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:22,190
- He is neither thief nor assassin.
- Oh, really?

853
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,130
I must say...

854
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,800
Sir de Fronsac
surely had his reasons.

855
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:29,570
Perhaps those men killed
the Indian that accompanied him.

856
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,110
Mademoiselle,
that has nothing to do with it.

857
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,840
And even so...

858
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:37,610
one does not seek vengeance for
a savage by spilling Christian blood.

859
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,250
I want to visit him.

860
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,160
That's impossible.

861
01:46:54,670 --> 01:46:56,160
Very well.

862
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,790
We will see what they think
of all this in Paris.

863
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,810
Marianne, you don't understand.

864
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:03,870
Fronsac died.

865
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,140
During the night.

866
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,150
In any case,
he would have been hanged.

867
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,350
On reflection, he was lucky.

868
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:28,790
You were responsible
for that man's life.

869
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,330
Perhaps he suffocated...

870
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,960
or perhaps he caught the plague
from his mattress.

871
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:38,640
You're lying. You're all lying.

872
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:43,270
Have courage, my child.
It is the will of God.

873
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:45,210
Father.

874
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:49,210
Come. I'll escort you home.

875
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:51,550
Mademoiselle would do well
to get some rest.

876
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,390
Come.

877
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:57,560
- Leave me here.
- You can do nothing for him now.

878
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,500
He's beginning to smell.

879
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:07,440
Let us bury him quickly
in an unmarked grave.

880
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:10,870
She has threatened to speak
to the king this time.

881
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:13,800
She's dangerous.

882
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,850
<i>They buried Gregoire de Fronsac</i>
<i>that very night... </i>

883
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:26,420
<i>long before the news of his death</i>
<i>had reached Paris. </i>

884
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:31,330
<i>No one really knew what secrets</i>
<i>the knight took with him to his grave. </i>

885
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:36,730
<i>For several days, </i>
<i>the beast ceased to kill. </i>

886
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:41,410
<i>But the sudden disappearance</i>
<i>of its most relentless adversary... </i>

887
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:44,470
<i>seemed to be a dark omen. </i>

888
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,190
Quickly.

889
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:18,270
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

890
01:49:18,910 --> 01:49:20,640
Forgive me.

891
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:24,170
Marianne...
day and night I think of her.

892
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:28,120
Her heart beats in my breast
every moment.

893
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,850
I want her by our side, Sardis.

894
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:34,290
The Lord is testing you.

895
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,790
But you know not what I endure.

896
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:42,200
Those visions.

897
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:47,370
Those damn visions
torment me incessantly.

898
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:52,870
Deliver me, Father.

899
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,780
Deliver me from evil, I beg you.

900
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:00,010
For the evil within you
there is only one remedy.

901
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,770
No.

902
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:06,110
Don't drink that, little sister.

903
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,420
They want to kill you...

904
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:13,560
but I will stop them.

905
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:16,860
But who, Jean-Franqois?

906
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,530
Who?

907
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:24,900
We're going to leave,
just you and me.

908
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:28,330
Would you like to see America?

909
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:33,200
You made me suffer, you know,
but I forgive you.

910
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:41,580
Please, what are you doing?

911
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:43,450
Where are you going?

912
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,010
Stay.

913
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,360
Do you think I would harm you?

914
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:53,960
Don't come any closer, please.

915
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:57,000
Marianne, I need you.

916
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:01,270
It was you who saved me
when I was ill and no one else.

917
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:05,040
It was your face I saw
when I woke from my nightmares.

918
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:07,600
It was your hand on my forehead
that chased away the demons.

919
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,950
You cannot imagine what I have done
to keep you close to me.

920
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:14,080
I beg you, don't push me away.

921
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,860
Tell me why.

922
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:28,930
Do I disgust you?

923
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:31,470
You don't frighten me.
Leave me alone.

924
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:36,670
Is it because of this?

925
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,940
Don't worry.

926
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:47,620
From now on,
I will take care of you.

927
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:50,040
Look.

928
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:53,790
No one knows...

929
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:56,290
but Sardis and I.

930
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:13,640
Leave. Get out of here!

931
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:16,680
But why?

932
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:20,980
You are not my brother.

933
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:24,050
It was another
who returned from Africa.

934
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:27,820
Yes, that's true, but it was
because of you that I left.

935
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:32,000
Marianne, without you,
none of this would have happened.

936
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:33,560
None of this!

937
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,080
It's your smell.

938
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,910
It's your damned blood
that the beast smelled on me!

939
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:50,780
Yes.

940
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:54,780
We have the same blood, Marianne.

941
01:53:57,990 --> 01:54:00,550
When Father comes home...

942
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,930
he'll kill you.

943
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:08,160
And what if I kill him?
He's come between us for so long.

944
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,790
Go on, do it! Go on.

945
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,390
Why didn't you do it?

946
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:42,530
It isn't as difficult as all that.
Look.

947
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,570
- Stop.
- So do you love me?

948
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,770
Marianne, I love you!

949
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,940
<i>Brothers, the Lord</i>
<i>has made it known to me... </i>

950
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:04,750
<i>the beast will return... </i>

951
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:08,760
<i>to herald the rebirth of our morality</i>
<i>in this kingdom of decadence... </i>

952
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:12,300
and a new France shall be born.

953
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:15,300
We shall be the invisible princes...

954
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:17,200
for God is with us.

955
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:20,860
<i>Dominus nobiscum. </i>

956
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,320
<i>The people have yet to see</i>
<i>the true wrath of God. </i>

957
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:37,180
The unjust censure of the king...

958
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,950
cannot withstand
the rage of the population...

959
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:43,960
and when that rage is at its peak...

960
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:47,120
we may then bargain with the king.

961
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,190
If he has failed
to dominate the beast...

962
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:53,300
imagine, brothers, what shall happen
if all the provinces in the kingdom...

963
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,400
were then attacked
by other beasts.

964
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,000
The hour approaches
when we shall reap what we have sown.

965
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:08,250
Let us read the Book of Malachi.

966
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:12,020
"The lips of the priest shall be
the depository of science...

967
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:16,690
and from His mouth he shall gain
the knowledge of the law...

968
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:21,260
for he is the angel of God."

969
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:23,860
"If one among you worships
the beast or its image...

970
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,900
he shall drink the wine
of God's wrath...

971
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:30,370
and he shall be tormented in fire...

972
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:34,240
and brimstone before the angels...

973
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:38,750
and the smoke of his torment
shall rise to the century of centuries."

974
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,750
I have returned
to name you before God.

975
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,380
Pierre-Jean Laffont.

976
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,720
Genevieve de Morangias.

977
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:48,230
Maxime des Forets.

978
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:50,190
Gontrand de Moncan.

979
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:52,630
Henri Sardis.

980
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:55,390
Jean-Franqois de Morangias.

981
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,230
Amen.

982
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:01,180
You damn sons of whores,
you're all under arrest!

983
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:53,710
You may be a ghost...

984
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:58,380
but I will cut you in two.

985
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,520
You see?
You no longer need to hold back.

986
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:14,760
I have no intention of doing so.

987
02:00:14,930 --> 02:00:17,960
Too late, Fronsac.
The beast is immortal now.

988
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:20,440
It, perhaps... but not you.

989
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:13,450
Sardis has trained you
as you have trained the beast.

990
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:15,790
How did you find out?

991
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:18,490
You sign your crimes
with a silver bullet!

992
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:16,010
Marianne, look!

993
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,360
Marianne's not here, you madman.

994
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,700
You have united us forever, Fronsac.

995
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:06,940
Bind these bastards up
one by one, men.

996
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:11,940
Will you look at them, huh?

997
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:16,280
You're not so high and mighty now,
are you? Where are you going?

998
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:39,430
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.

999
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:43,730
And Sardis?

1000
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:46,240
Wherever he goes,
we will find him...

1001
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:48,610
or the mountains
will take care of him.

1002
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,980
Shall we celebrate
our success properly?

1003
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:57,750
You've already killed me once.

1004
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:00,180
The better to revive you.

1005
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:04,660
I could present you to the pope.

1006
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:07,460
Will you come with me?

1007
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,870
Too late.

1008
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,500
I like you, Fronsac.

1009
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:18,270
You helped me forget my duties.

1010
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:32,320
Leave here before I change my mind.

1011
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:05,770
Marquis!

1012
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:08,350
What is it?

1013
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:11,080
It's Marianne.
I've had her brought home.

1014
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:13,250
She's dying.

1015
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:16,190
No!

1016
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,490
Leave! Get out!

1017
02:06:19,630 --> 02:06:21,660
Go on, all of you!

1018
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:37,180
Marianne, wake up.

1019
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:44,850
Forgive me.

1020
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,220
I love you.

1021
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:21,650
<i>Many years have passed... </i>

1022
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,550
<i>but I have never forgotten... </i>

1023
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:26,610
<i>Gregoire de Fronsac</i>
<i>and Marianne de Morangias. </i>

1024
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:31,290
<i>The world that created the beast</i>
<i>is no more... </i>

1025
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,900
<i>and I must hasten, </i>
<i>for my story is also ending. </i>

1026
02:08:47,050 --> 02:08:49,670
<i>I can still remember</i>
<i>accompanying Fronsac... </i>

1027
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:52,840
<i>to the secret lair</i>
<i>ofJean</i>-<i>Franqois de Morangias... </i>

1028
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:55,920
<i>where the beast awaited its fate. </i>

1029
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:40,790
<i>The old healer told us all he knew. </i>

1030
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:45,090
<i>Jean</i>-<i>Franqois had brought</i>
<i>a strange beast back from Africa... </i>

1031
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:46,860
<i>who had cubs. </i>

1032
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,490
<i>He kept only one</i>... <i>the strongest... </i>

1033
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:55,360
<i>and with patience and cruelty... </i>

1034
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:58,270
<i>he trained the beast</i>
<i>to be vicious. </i>

1035
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,250
<i>Thus died the beast of Gevaudan... </i>

1036
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:16,420
<i>and I, Thomas d'Apcher... </i>

1037
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:19,920
<i>I am the last to know the truth. </i>

1038
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,500
Off with his head!

1039
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:57,660
<i>Fronsac invited me</i>
<i>to follow him to Africa... </i>

1040
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:59,630
<i>but the province needed rebuilding. </i>

1041
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:02,700
<i>I was beholden to my people, </i>
<i>to my lands. </i>

1042
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:06,780
<i>I have often thought</i>
<i>of Gregoire and Marianne... </i>

1043
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,800
<i>throughout all these peaceful years</i>
<i>that have been my life. </i>

1044
02:12:13,690 --> 02:12:16,180
<i>I never saw them again... </i>

1045
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:19,980
<i>but it pleases me to think</i>
<i>they lived their lives happily... </i>

1046
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:22,350
<i>far away from here. </i>

1047
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:01,090
THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF
