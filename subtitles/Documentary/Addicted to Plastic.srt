1
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,749
How it started shouldn't matter.

2
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,374
How things end,
that's what's important.

3
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,915
Well, that's the theory.

4
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,249
Sorry to keep you,
Mr. Barker.

5
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,415
That's not a problem.

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,915
l just need to run you through
a quick security check.

7
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,040
could you please tell
me your mother's maiden name.

8
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,707
- Tilly.
- And your date of birth.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,832
6th of July, 1962.

10
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,874
Excellent, Mr Barker.
You've passed the security test.

11
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,332
If I could just confirm your order with you
before I put it through the system.

12
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,207
The number.

13
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:24,249
So, you've placed an order for
6 limited edition 18-karat gold rings

14
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,040
and 4 pendant
white gold necklaces.

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,582
Delivery will have to be made

16
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,290
to the address that
the card is registered to,

17
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,457
so you'll have to be
home to sign for the items.

18
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,040
Of course. lf you could deliver at
8:00 a.m. tomorrow that would be great.

19
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,790
lf you could actually grow stubble,
you wouldn't have to wear that thing?

20
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,165
You think that pubestache you grew
for Movember counts as facial hair?

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,457
Don't make me laugh.

22
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,707
Right, do l have to tell you
to drive carefully?

23
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,915
Only if you value your paintwork on this thing.
Go learn something.

24
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,290
Go make some money.

25
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,207
65 million years ago,
a comet hit this planet

26
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:11,207
with the power of a million Hiroshima bombs.

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,874
lt wiped out the dinosaurs,

28
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,999
and from the ashes rose
a whole new world order.

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,790
A fitting metaphor

30
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,540
for the global recession
we still find ourselves in.

31
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,707
When demand is so low
for a prolonged period,

32
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,999
a whole generation of
educated and trained suppliers,

33
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,999
that's you guys by the way,

34
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,624
may never work.

35
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:37,790
Many of you will achieve good degrees
but never actually get the careers you want.

36
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,874
Can l try these on?

37
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,415
No.

38
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,457
Well, how am l supposed to know
if they're going to fit?

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,332
You can look at the label or buy 'em.
l'm not bothered.

40
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,165
How much for the iPod dock?

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,499
They're 100.

42
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,665
Wait one second, Daniel,
you're third year business studies.

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,790
So what?

44
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,082
So fucking haggle, brother, that's what.

45
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,415
Yeah, yeah.
So, what do l get for 60?

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,749
Not one of those.

47
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,290
Come on, that's a good offer.

48
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,249
So was 100 before he stepped in.

49
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,874
70 pounds and l'll take the jeans as well.

50
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,999
80, you buy the dock
and he buys the jeans.

51
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,540
Can l try them on first?

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,832
Well, mate, yeah, if you must.

53
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,415
Jesus Christ, has your mate got
an aversion to underwear?

54
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:38,665
All dirty, l'm afraid.
Mum's not down till the weekend

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,040
and l'll be fucked if l'm doing
my own laundry.

56
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,207
How goes it, Mr. Yates?

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,457
Good thanks, Dion. How about you?

58
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,165
Busy. Always busy.

59
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,165
What d'you need?

60
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,540
l'll go for 3.

61
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:05,749
Listen, you know l spoke to my boss.
Told him l got much respect for you.

62
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,207
Man reckons he might be able
to put you to work.

63
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,707
Always looking for people
to open up new markets.

64
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,707
The guy two rungs above me
is pulling in like half a million a week.

65
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,957
Cash. ln hand.

66
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,290
Your boss. . .
Tell him l'll think about it.

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,499
Thank you.

68
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,915
Rafa, Rafa, quickly!
The toilet's overflowing again.

69
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,665
Get a mop and a plastic bag.
lt's like Baghdad in there.

70
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,249
We got a customer.

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,707
So?

72
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,957
So you don't know how to use
the new till system yet, do you?

73
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,832
l keep saying it.

74
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,957
Until you can be bothered to learn this stuff,

75
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,707
l serve the customers and
you clean up what they leave behind.

76
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,624
All right. Good.

77
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,582
That'll be 65 pounds exactly, boss.
Anything else?

78
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,999
Condoms.

79
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,707
Ribbed.

80
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,165
Lucky girl.

81
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,624
l see you like Ferraris.

82
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,457
Take another look.

83
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,290
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to one.

84
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,707
See that girl out there
that you're gonna be using these on?

85
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,040
She like personality and looks,
or just money?

86
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,915
What do you think?
She's all about the money, dickhead.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,999
Then why is it she's chatting up
the guy without the Ferrari?

88
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,165
You showed him, eh, boss?

89
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,040
D'you want me to come back round there
and fuck your face?

90
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,124
Swipe the card.

91
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,582
You gotta, actually.

92
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,332
Chip and pin now.

93
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,082
And that's you done, then.

94
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,040
Thank you so much.

95
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:29,915
Good shift?

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,457
Usual. Shit. While you guys are out
having fun l smell petrol fumes

97
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,290
and deal with fucking wankers.

98
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,665
Feel like taking it out
on someone else?

99
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,249
What the. . . Christ!

100
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,624
Evening chief.
Good performance for a guy your age.

101
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,165
Budget not stretch
to a hotel room?

102
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,749
Off you get, love.

103
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,124
Can l leave now?

104
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,499
Don't wanna finish up here?

105
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,499
- You've seen the state of him.
- Yeah, l have.

106
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,499
Now give me your wallet.

107
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,290
Fuck you.

108
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,124
You getting all this?

109
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,749
ln high definition, mate.

110
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:18,290
Now, here's what you do.
Write down your mother's maiden name,

111
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,499
pin number and date of birth.

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,957
Go fuck yourself.

113
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,499
This is 4G enabled, mate.

114
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,540
l can have this on the lnternet in 30 seconds

115
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,124
and send it to your wife,
see what she's got to say about it.

116
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,332
"Go fuck yourself", sounds about right.
Probably followed by,

117
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,957
"l want a divorce," and
"You've never made me come."

118
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,999
Well done.

119
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,457
Now, all we ask is that you don't report
the cards stolen for 24 hours

120
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,374
whilst we do a spot of shopping.

121
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,540
Just relax and let
the insurance foot the bill.

122
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,040
And we'll take that briefcase
if it's all the same with you.

123
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,124
You can take the wallet,
you can take the cards.

124
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,707
But l can't give you the case.

125
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,874
Don't act like l'm giving you a choice.

126
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,374
Grab it.

127
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,707
- No!
- Yatesey, fuck!

128
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,832
Shit. ls he fucking dead?

129
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,874
He'll live. Come on.

130
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,374
Holy shit. Look at this!

131
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,332
Nice.

132
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,165
What's this?

133
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,040
Always wanted one of those.

134
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,499
That's mine, that is.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,999
All right.

136
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,165
There's like fucking 5 grand in here.
What's that, 1,250 each?

137
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,957
Only if we split it 4 ways.

138
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,374
Cards go into the pot, that's standard,
but the money's ours man.

139
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,957
l don't know, mate.
We're supposed to split everything.

140
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,165
You think they'd do the same for us?

141
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,249
They got you stuck in a petrol
garage 5 nights a week.

142
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,707
You need to start looking out
for yourself, mate.

143
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,457
Stop letting people take
the piss out of you.

144
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
Yeah.

145
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:25,082
Marcel, it's Harry.
We've got a serious problem.

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,082
All right, lads?
5 cards cloned from the garage.

147
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,582
And we rolled a mark.

148
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,874
Picked up another two cards
with pin numbers for both.

149
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,624
You should watch the video, mate.
lt's fucking hilarious. . .

150
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,540
- Shit!
- What?

151
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,332
l lost a life. Game over.

152
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,332
Gents.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,415
Someone please tell me
why's he wearing that.

154
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,499
lt's fancy dress tonight.

155
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,415
Wait, don't tell me you lot forgot.

156
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,582
We're still going to that?

157
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,832
Surprisingly epic.

158
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,874
l'm going to the bar.

159
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,707
She the one in your class, isn't she?

160
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,790
Yeah.

161
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,415
The one you said's been checking
you out, which of course l don't believe.

162
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,499
Yeah.

163
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,207
Then what you doing extra talking to me?

164
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,790
Stop staring at her like a serial killer
and down talk to her.

165
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,374
l'm working up to it.

166
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,249
She's nice, mate.
Almost as fit as Fordy's sister.

167
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,457
My sister's 15, you fucking paedo.

168
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,915
Give her my number and
tell her to call me in a year.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,249
Yeah, will do. Cheers, Rafa.
She's been dreaming about meeting

170
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,915
a bell-end that works in a petrol station
since she was a little girl.

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,040
All right.

172
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,540
Oh, for fuck's sake.

173
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,999
You snooze, you lose.

174
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,707
l swear my man's an apex predator.
Watch him go.

175
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,415
Look, hang on, hang on.
New world record!

176
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,249
Arm touch in under 5 seconds.

177
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,374
She touched his arm? Big deal.

178
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,082
May as well have been his cock, mate.
Yatesey won't fuck this up.

179
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,915
What the fuck?

180
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,665
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

181
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,290
Leaving a girl like that at the bar, mate?

182
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,374
You should have taken that shit down.
You're a fuckin' predator man.

183
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,665
That right there is a 5 date shag, Raf.

184
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,665
3 hours chat for
a kiss good night at her front door.

185
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,374
l'm not looking for a girlfriend right now.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,457
l like her, don't get me wrong.
She'll get done, just not tonight.

187
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,832
Charming. Right.

188
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,165
You going in?

189
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,040
This'll be good viewing.

190
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,624
Sam, good costume.

191
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,165
Thank you. Where's yours?

192
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,540
l didn't have time to change.

193
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,540
And watch it l had to come straight from work.

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,915
- You got a job.
- l know. Grown up, right?

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,624
Nice up.
What do you do?

196
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,415
lt's pretty wild, l'm a data processor
for a credit card company.

197
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,582
- Which one?
- X-Cred.

198
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,249
Any chance you can increase
my student limit?

199
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,540
Yeah, you're the third person
to crack that joke tonight.

200
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,874
- Was it funny the first time?
- No.

201
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,957
All right. OK.

202
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,499
Note to self, gotta work on my chat.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,915
Pathetic. lt's like watching a little boy.

204
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,957
Come on, let's fuck off.

205
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,707
Want a hit, boys?

206
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,832
Let's do it.

207
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,374
Sausage fest, mate.

208
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,040
You'll just get stoned and
talk shit with a bunch of crusties.

209
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,082
Girls out here. Dick soup in here.

210
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,165
So my cousin, he graduated
from Newcastle with a first.

211
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,582
He applied to every law firm in the country
with roughly 6,000 applicants per job.

212
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,249
He now works in a bar.

213
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,582
Fuckin' same story everywhere.
So how did you land the X-Cred gig?

214
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,957
My dad used to work there.

215
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,957
Anyway, what about you?

216
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,499
l've seen you and your friends around uni,
with your designer clothes and your cash.

217
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,749
One of my friends said she bought a stereo
from one of your housemates

218
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,082
and there was boxes piled high.

219
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,915
You're very suspicious.

220
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,540
What do you guys do?

221
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,040
We're entrepreneurs.

222
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,207
What kind?

223
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,374
Trade secret.

224
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,790
You're a lucky fucker, Yatesey.

225
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,999
Luck's got nothing to do with it, Daniel.

226
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,540
What kind of a twat goes all in on two pair?

227
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,957
Who wants to come and share this with me?
You're not invited, cunty.

228
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,207
l'm crying on the inside. Honestly.

229
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,999
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

230
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:00,957
Fiona.

231
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,082
Nice one.

232
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,999
Whoa, better.

233
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,207
Can 3 people play?

234
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,832
Frankie, we're leaving.

235
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,290
OK, one minute.

236
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,415
- That's me.
- Then l'd better get your number.

237
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,249
l'd like to see you again.

238
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,540
You better just give me your phone, then.

239
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,415
This is your email address.

240
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,999
l don't want to make it
too easy for you.

241
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,957
Good night, Sam.

242
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,749
Did you get what's-her-name's
number last night?

243
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,207
She gave me her email address.

244
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,457
That's a bit gay.

245
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,124
Yeah. You know where she works?

246
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,832
No, l wasn't the one talking to her all night.

247
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,249
X-Cred.

248
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,290
She's a data processor.

249
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,124
Fuck.

250
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,915
Mate, she could be a gold mine.

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,957
Probably, but l'm not interested
in her for that.

252
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,332
l like her.

253
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,124
There's just something about her.
Quality.

254
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,249
l think it's that she's fucking fit.

255
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,707
- Right.
- Break a leg.

256
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,957
- Mr. Barker?
- Yes, mate.

257
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,249
Sign here please, guv,
you've got a package.

258
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,249
Open it up, Mr. Ford.

259
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,040
Looks like it's all here.

260
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,665
Come on in. We've been waiting.

261
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,124
As a statement of intent

262
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,415
there's nothing quite like forced nudity,

263
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,665
gaffer tape and hired thugs.

264
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,374
Cuts out the time-wasting questions

265
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,957
that usually go hand in hand
with these situations.

266
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,415
l don't think you've met
my friend Harry.

267
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,457
They have.

268
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,832
Now Harry here is good with numbers.

269
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,374
A fucking genius.

270
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,082
But like many brilliant men
he has a weakness.

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,540
He loves to pay for women.

272
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,790
l keep telling him,
"Spend some money, get a nice girl".

273
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,290
But he never listens.
He likes them cheap.

274
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,665
Fucks them on street corners
or in the back of his car.

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,457
Now l'm not here to cast judgement.
His cock, his business.

276
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:59,415
What does concern me is that last
night he was carrying something

277
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,082
that belonged to me.

278
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,749
Something sensitive.

279
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,707
There are files on here,
business accounts,

280
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,290
that l can't risk falling
into the wrong hands.

281
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,707
l keep telling Harry to be careful.

282
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,374
l shouldn't have to but l still do.

283
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,915
But l know he is weak
so l take precautions.

284
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,499
His phones, his laptop, this tablet here,
all infected with spyware.

285
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:35,374
l can locate them whenever l choose,
operate cameras via remote,

286
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,540
listen to what is being said. . .

287
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,707
Tariq, take over.

288
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,207
English, fuckhead!
How many times do l have to say it?

289
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,707
Speak English.

290
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,915
Sorry, boss.

291
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,707
My builder, my cleaner,
now even my fucking heavies are Polish.

292
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,207
Half the price, twice the nuisance.

293
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,582
That's enough.
Any more and you'll kill him.

294
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,790
So?

295
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,540
So l don't need a dead body,
l need an accountant.

296
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,915
l value profit over corpses.

297
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,540
l had to cut short my daughter's
birthday party to deal with this.

298
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,499
l'm a busy man and l value time
with my family above all else.

299
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,332
So you four are going to have to
make it up to me.

300
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,957
While we've been waiting,
l've had a chance to look over your operation.

301
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,457
Credit cards, blackmail, identity fraud.
Quite impressive.

302
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,040
l'll make you a deal.

303
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,665
This is a list of things l want.

304
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,415
Things you are going to get for me.

305
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,999
You complete this list by, let's say, 5:00 p.m.,

306
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,540
and deliver the goods to me.

307
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,915
lt's a lot.

308
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,415
There's no way you can. . .

309
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:24,707
Think of it as a challenge.
lf you succeed, maybe l forgive you.

310
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,457
lf you fail, you get a visit from these two.

311
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,082
Pick him up, let's go.

312
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,040
They were here when we got back.
They came out of nowhere.

313
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,957
Sorry, what the fuck did you guys do?

314
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,332
Nothing you haven't done
a hundred times yourself!

315
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,874
l kind of doubt that.

316
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,999
lt's a long list. We're gonna need
nearly all the plastic we've got stockpiled.

317
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,665
So we're doing this, then?

318
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,290
We collect the list, we get him off our back.
There's no other play.

319
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,249
Yeah.

320
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,915
Speak.

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,332
We've got the gear. Where do you want it?

322
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,540
All of it in one day. Very enterprising.

323
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,707
How much do you think it's worth?

324
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,249
l've no idea.

325
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,207
Take a guess.

326
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,540
50,000? 60,000? grand.

327
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,957
So,

328
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:53,582
if l said you owe me
200,000 a week every week

329
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,874
that would be fair?

330
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,207
Gives them time off for the weekends.

331
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:06,207
Look. . . You asked us to do something.
We did it. End of story.

332
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,499
For someone that knows
credit card companies that well,

333
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,624
l'm surprised you don't know how
they make their money.

334
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:19,832
You have a debt. lnterest is incurred.
You've paid the interest. The debt still stands.

335
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,415
But this'll happen every time
we make a delivery right.

336
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,290
Debt never touched.
Doesn't seem very reasonable.

337
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:32,624
Everything you've seen of me up until now
is reasonable.

338
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,124
Out there in the darkness,
that's unreasonable.

339
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:47,249
You pay me my money, every week for
as long as you can. The day you can't. . .

340
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,832
Now, l am prepared to make it easy for you.

341
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,749
lf you can't convert plastic to cash,
l can take merchandise off your hands.

342
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,624
Jewellery, electronics, drugs. . .

343
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,290
How much?

344
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,790
To pay off the debt and make you walk away?

345
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,124
- You won't like it.
- Probably not.

346
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:29,707
2 million pays off your debt,
buys my forgiveness.

347
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,415
OK.

348
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,624
One condition, you pay in 2 weeks.
All of it. No exceptions.

349
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,624
2 million. 2 weeks.

350
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:51,290
And that time frame is inflexible.
l must be clear about that.

351
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,665
Personally, if l was you,
l'd stick with the weekly payment plan.

352
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,707
The balls on this one! Doesn't give an inch.

353
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:06,540
Well, good luck. See you in 2 weeks.

354
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,040
l'm rooting for you!

355
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,165
Keys.

356
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,540
What?

357
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,999
The keys to your van.
How else do we transport goods?

358
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,665
Fuck's sake.

359
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,457
Congratulations, you're all walking home.

360
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,499
I'm gonna say.
You should have consulted us.

361
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,332
He did. You lot
didn't have the balls to make a decision.

362
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,874
What,
and like he made a good one?

363
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,749
lt was the only option. You know that.

364
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,999
Sooner or later we would have fallen behind.

365
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,040
At least this way there's a finish line.

366
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,499
2 weeks and he's out of our lives.

367
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,582
- Or we'll be dead.
- Either way, it'll be over.

368
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,457
What? Doesn't make it any better!

369
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,499
This way we've got room to manoeuvre.

370
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,790
Surely it's impossible to make
2,000,000 pounds in 2 weeks.

371
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,832
We need more cards. Bigger spenders.

372
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,582
How do we build up the spending profiles
when we're flying blind for this long?

373
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,499
There's only one way to do it.

374
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,165
We need an inside man.

375
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,999
l know who we need.

376
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,415
No.

377
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,665
Look, l don't want to do it either man.
We don't have a choice.

378
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:22,874
Are you two gonna tell me
what the fuck you're talking about?

379
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,582
Make a decision.

380
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,999
Thank you.

381
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:41,415
OK, remember Frankie?
She's a data processor with X-Cred.

382
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,832
So, what are you doing?

383
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,749
l'll start by hacking her email.

384
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,624
Can you do that?

385
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,290
lt's Webmail. Please.

386
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,624
All right, mate. So, what's the point?

387
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,874
Most people have something in life they want
bad enough that they'd break the law to get it.

388
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:02,082
We just need to find out
what it is and exploit it.

389
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,540
- This is bollocks.
- Worked on you.

390
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,290
What's that supposed to mean,
it worked on me?

391
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,040
You hacked my fucking email?

392
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,207
Yep. And Rafa's.

393
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,290
What?

394
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,540
You knew about this?

395
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,999
l picked you both out.

396
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,749
What gives you the right
to go through our personal shit?

397
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,915
You work part time for The News of the World,
or something!

398
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,790
l haven't heard too many complaints
over the last year. lt made you rich.

399
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,457
You doubled my student loan, mate.
lt ain't exactly buying me a Ferrari, is it?

400
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,999
How things started shouldn't matter.

401
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,040
How they end, that's what's important, right?

402
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,874
To be continued.

403
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,624
Fucking right.

404
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,499
Find anything?

405
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,707
Think so, yeah.

406
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:46,040
Reckon you can make that work?

407
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:47,999
Really?

408
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,999
Hey, Dad.

409
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,790
How you feeling?

410
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,499
X-Cred has said
he's in breach of contract.

411
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,082
They say he should have
informed them sooner about his illness.

412
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,665
They're refusing to pay medical costs.
We can't afford the hospice.

413
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,832
He'll have to go back on the ward.

414
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,415
So he can die with people
around him, coughing and snoring.

415
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,915
Mum, doesn't he deserve some dignity?

416
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,957
No way. . . Frankie?

417
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,582
Sam. What are you doing here?

418
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:25,457
Stalking you of course.
l've been in that bush for the last 2 hours.

419
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,999
Bloody hell. Doesn't look very comfortable.

420
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,957
Yeah, tell me about it. l was just trying
to walk off the cramp. Busted.

421
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,249
Nah, l'm just passing through.
Tell me you're not on your way home.

422
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,165
Home.

423
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,874
What would l have to do to get you
to come out for a drink?

424
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,457
Cheer me up.

425
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,165
l needed that.

426
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,540
l'm glad l bumped into you.

427
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,915
Do you believe in fate?

428
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,665
And now you've ruined it.

429
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,749
lt was only a matter of time.

430
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,207
Yeah.

431
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,790
Thank you.

432
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,415
l'll get this.

433
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,207
- We can split it, if you like.
- No, no. lt's on me.

434
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,832
- Thanks.
- One condition.

435
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,165
You forget about that fate line.

436
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,165
Deal.

437
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,124
You got a secret trust fund or something?

438
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,790
- l wish.
- Well, how'd you get a black card, then?

439
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,082
You asked me how l make money.

440
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,915
Take a look.

441
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,790
lt says Charles Burnett on this.

442
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,582
And tomorrow it'll be someone else.

443
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,290
You're a thief?

444
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,874
An opportunist.

445
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,582
Don't you want to know why l do it?

446
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,332
No, not really.

447
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,249
Medical bills. That's how it started. . .

448
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:10,874
My brother. He got sick.
About as bad as it gets.

449
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:15,415
The doctor said he was terminal.

450
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,832
l didn't agree.

451
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,915
Private treatments, mostly in America.

452
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,707
And the costs soon stacked up.

453
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:27,040
l couldn't afford to pay the bills
so l had to figure out a way that l could.

454
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,957
l knew it wasn't right

455
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:36,249
but if me risking everything gave my brother
another week, shit, another day,

456
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,540
of course l was gonna do it.

457
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,999
Fuck whoever told me otherwise.

458
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,749
lt turned out the first doctor was right.

459
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,624
Dad's not even
a human being to them.

460
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,999
He's a statistic.

461
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,290
A set of figures that no longer work
in their favour.

462
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,749
l can't do this, Sam.

463
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,915
Why not?

464
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,957
Because stealing from
the company which you work for,

465
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,749
whatever way you look at it, is wrong.

466
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,707
There's no such thing
as victimless crime.

467
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,249
Someone always has to suffer.

468
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,207
The best way to justify it to yourself
is to find someone that deserves to.

469
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,790
And it seems to me that your company
deserve it more than most.

470
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,665
How does it work?

471
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,624
l'm sure l'm telling you
what you already know,

472
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,707
but credit cards operate
on smart neural networks

473
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,832
so they can spot spending patterns.

474
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:39,165
That's why we try to build up
a profile for each cardholder.

475
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,665
We can access the electoral register,
hack their computer, steal their mail.

476
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,749
Then we buy expensive items
with the cloned cards and sell it on.

477
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,790
How much can we make?

478
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,582
With you on the inside? No limit.

479
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,332
These are good.

480
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,665
With Frankie on board we'll
have access to the personal details

481
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,165
of every client in the X-Cred database.

482
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,582
l'm gonna help get everything
you need to clone some big-hitting cards.

483
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,749
Frankie's finding us overseas customers,

484
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,374
So we'll be go where they spend
and staying within spending patterns.

485
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,040
Why abroad? Why not in London?

486
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,040
Because the customers l deal with
are based here, in the UK.

487
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,832
Right. So use another country's accounts
to avoid being suspected. That's smart.

488
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,415
Got to cover my tracks.

489
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,582
So where we going?

490
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:33,665
5 cards. All linked to big spenders
who hit Miami at least 3 times a year.

491
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,165
Combined credit on the cards
is 3 and a half million dollars.

492
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,624
Fucking hell. Who are these people?

493
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:42,790
But if you boys wanna go out, hit the town?
That's fine by me, but stick to cash.

494
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,957
These cards are strictly for the job in hand.

495
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,207
My personal advice would be
to keep a low profile.

496
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,374
First up, Yannick Kieffer.

497
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,915
A banker from Luxembourg
in town selling bearer bonds.

498
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,749
credit card limit, $500,000.

499
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,915
And we are aiming to take him
for every penny.

500
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,999
What if he's out shopping
at the same time as us?

501
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,749
Won't they notice
two different card transactions?

502
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,332
Of course they will.
That's why we've got to keep an eye on him.

503
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,499
Could you hold the doors, please?

504
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,207
Thank you, sir. l appreciate it.

505
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,499
Y'all having a good day?

506
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,582
Couldn't press 9 for me, could you?

507
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,832
Thank you, sir.

508
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,332
We've got him on GPS.
He's heading for his suite now.

509
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,999
Let's get spending.

510
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,499
ls that the top of your range?

511
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:45,957
lt's a difficult choice.

512
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,790
What'd he say to you?

513
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,249
What?

514
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,540
Sam.

515
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:02,249
When he first made contact.
How'd he get you to join the team?

516
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,415
He promised me a Ferrari inside a year.

517
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,790
Oh, yeah?

518
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,915
And how'd he know
that's what you wanted?

519
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,124
You reckon that's the laptop
they used to hack your email?

520
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,124
These aren't your friends, Raf.

521
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,874
Yeah.

522
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,457
Group's getting bigger.
Our shares are getting smaller.

523
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:31,582
This whole Marcel thing doesn't really inspire
long term prospects for this crew, does it?

524
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,457
What are you saying?

525
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,332
l'm saying everyone has a price.
A magic number.

526
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,707
When you've figured out what yours is,
you let me know.

527
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,374
Thanks.

528
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,665
Cheers.

529
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,165
You think they're going to be OK?

530
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,165
They're good at looking out for themselves.

531
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,957
How long have you known Sam?

532
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,582
About a year.

533
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:13,207
He came to me like he came to you,
"Join up and l'll make you rich."

534
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:18,332
Yeah, he makes
a convincing argument, right?

535
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:21,707
He likes you. Do you know that?

536
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,249
Yeah.

537
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,415
Yeah, l think so.

538
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,457
And how about you?

539
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,915
Not sure.

540
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,582
Come here. l want to tell you a secret.

541
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:42,207
What do you mean "a secret"?
A secret about what?

542
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,457
l can't, actually. lt's really bad.

543
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:47,999
What do you mean "bad"?
Oh, come on. You have to tell me now.

544
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,665
Come here, then, and l'll tell you.

545
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,082
Go on. What?

546
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,249
You only did that because
l'm right in front of you.

547
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,332
You seemed pretty keen at the party.

548
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,915
Yeah, l was,
until you walked off mid-sentence.

549
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,624
l'm not walking off now.

550
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,457
You think he's all that he seems?

551
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,207
- Sam?
- Hmm.

552
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:27,332
Come off it. We've all got dirt on us, Yatesey.
l'm not so naive.

553
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:30,249
You fucking look the part.

554
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,374
l thought we were playing nice.

555
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,624
l don't need your shit, Yatesey.

556
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:41,082
l know exactly what you need, Frankie.

557
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,582
Yeah.

558
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,665
Yeah, l do.

559
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:52,457
But not from you when you're on something?

560
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,832
- Want some?
- Cocaine?

561
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,624
- Yeah.
- No.

562
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,457
He's on the move.

563
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,457
All right. Almost done.

564
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,665
Parfait.

565
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,249
Sir.

566
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,874
We did good today.

567
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,624
Yeah.
Couldn't have done it without you, Frankie.

568
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:52,207
That stuff's like stocking fillers
compared to this outfit. Look.

569
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,874
Gets pretty boring just watching
an orange dot all day long

570
00:39:56,958 --> 00:40:00,915
l searched,
"Miami" and "jewellery" and "exclusive"

571
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,665
and it was the first thing that came up.

572
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,624
And this was before or after you logged out
of Youporn? l'm just trying to work it out.

573
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:10,874
After. Your sister was doing
a private cam show.

574
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,624
Ow.

575
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,082
Ama Dablam jewellers. . .

576
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:18,457
That's a $400,000 brooch, right there.

577
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,957
They've got this new, like,
coloured diamond collection.

578
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:25,040
But none of the cards have a history
of spending there. lt won't fit the profile.

579
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,790
lt's a shame.

580
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,457
Right. lf that's us done, l'm hitting the town.

581
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,540
What?

582
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,249
Uh, l don't think that's a good idea.

583
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,374
You can do what you like.

584
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:37,457
We're in Miami, l'm having a mad one
and that's all there is to it, mate.

585
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,040
What about you, Raf? Champagne
and strippers or mini bar and a wank?

586
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,540
Uh. . . The first one?

587
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,207
Thought so, mate.

588
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,540
Oh, wanker, wanker.

589
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,332
Hold on.

590
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,790
Look. lf they're gonna work hard
you've gotta let 'em play a bit.

591
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,874
l'll make sure they
come back in one piece, yeah?

592
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,374
All right.

593
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,457
Hold on, dickheads!

594
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,749
You know, you should watch out for him.

595
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,165
Who?

596
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,707
You know who.

597
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,374
Yatesey? Most girls love him.

598
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,624
Not this one.

599
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,665
You all right, babe?

600
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,749
Fuck off.

601
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,957
Champagne!
And none of that cheap Krug shit, either.

602
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,165
Something to impress these hookers.

603
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,665
l'm a dancer, not a hooker.

604
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,874
We'll see.

605
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,832
You cold?

606
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,332
Yeah, a little.

607
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,540
l can't believe l'm here. lt's insane.

608
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:24,832
So, would you have given me your number
if you knew you'd be out here doing this?

609
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,665
Well, l didn't actually give you
my number, did l?

610
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,249
All right, your email address.
You know what l mean.

611
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,624
l'd probably have told you to get lost.

612
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,624
l'm glad you didn't.

613
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,457
Yeah, me too.

614
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,749
The funny thing is
l could actually get used to this.

615
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,582
What? Drinking in public places?

616
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,082
This is what homeless people do every day.

617
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:54,665
Frankie, you should
set your sights a little higher.

618
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,415
What are you talking about?

619
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,707
l know, l'm rambling.

620
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:01,290
- You're completely rambling.
- Yeah, l know.

621
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
- Talking shit, a little.
- Total bollocks.

622
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,332
You going to kiss me already?

623
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,749
We need more fizz.

624
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,582
l'm broke.

625
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:49,999
Fordy?

626
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,540
l'm brassic.

627
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,207
Fuck's sake.

628
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,082
Go get us another two bottles of Cristal.

629
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,415
Oi, Yatesey, what are you doing?

630
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,832
Fuck off.

631
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,707
Yates, that's one of the big hitters.

632
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:08,374
Then l'm sure he can afford a bottle
of champagne or two.

633
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,499
l can't believe you took that card off Sam.

634
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:16,624
Sam?
That's his name on the fucking card, is it?

635
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,582
Where's the booze?

636
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:31,249
The card was refused.
They, like, kept it, or whatever.

637
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:33,499
They fucking what?

638
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,249
OK, time to go.

639
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,665
OK, gentlemen.
We need to have a word with you.

640
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,832
Ah, mate. l've forgotten. . .

641
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,374
Come on, you guys!
Out the back, quick!

642
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,457
Oh, fuck!

643
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,540
Go! Go!

644
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,415
Rafa! Rafa!

645
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,582
Don't follow me!

646
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,707
Don't follow me! Fuck off!

647
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,124
Yatesey!

648
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:04,249
Back off!

649
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:05,915
Come back here!

650
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:08,874
l'll get you! You motherfucker!

651
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,624
Fuck!

652
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,207
Fuck you!

653
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,207
Fuck me!

654
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,707
Let's go! Let's go!

655
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,374
Hello?

656
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,915
Sam, it's me.
We need to talk.

657
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,332
Well? What is it?

658
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,749
There's been a. . .

659
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,082
There's been an incident, mate.

660
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,832
OK?

661
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:00,624
Yatesey took one of the cards.

662
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,874
Which one?

663
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,540
l thought it would be OK.

664
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:09,040
No, Yatesey, you didn't think at all.

665
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,457
Come on. Give it back.

666
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,749
They kept it. lt got declined.

667
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:16,207
What did l say? What did l fucking say?

668
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,790
These cards were strictly for the job in hand.

669
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,499
No, no, no. For fuck's sake!

670
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:29,832
What is it?

671
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,457
We've lost Max de Beer.

672
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,082
How much?

673
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,124
That card was worth one and a half million.

674
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,540
Where the hell were you?

675
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,207
- Strip club.
- Clearly you haven't read the fucking brief!

676
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,040
Max de Beer is gay. He doesn't do strip clubs.

677
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,124
Not much of a tits and ass man,
if you catch my drift.

678
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,915
Kind of half is, surely?

679
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,624
Not so much the tits.

680
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:02,540
That's really clever, Rafa.
That's really fucking clever.

681
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:05,499
lf you're so fucking clever,
why do l have to break it down for you?

682
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,832
3 and a half million
minus one and a half, equals two!

683
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,665
$2,000,000.
We owe Marcel 2,000,000 fucking pounds.

684
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,249
Maybe now you can see the fucking problem!

685
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,332
What do we tell Frankie?

686
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,374
You're asking the wrong question, Fordy.

687
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,040
"What are we gonna tell Marcel?"

688
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,124
That should be the only thing
on your mind right now.

689
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,665
You look stressed?

690
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,832
- Rafa's got an idea, mate.
- Here we go.

691
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:52,040
You might think l only rate a petrol station,
but l'm smarter than you know.

692
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,957
OK, let's hear it.

693
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,457
We hunt the big fish.

694
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,749
Order up what we owe Marcel and much more.

695
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,290
We go after Ama Dablam.

696
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,540
Something like this could set us up for life.

697
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:10,124
Except none of the cards we've got
have any history spending there.

698
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,207
We don't need a credit card
to get what we want.

699
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,499
We need this guy.

700
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:14,874
Right?

701
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,999
What am l looking at?

702
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:18,749
Prince Zafran of Brunei.

703
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:22,290
lt's not a bad match, mate.
l reckon we can pull it off.

704
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:26,290
OK, so you get me out to Miami,
you lose our biggest card

705
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:29,124
now you want me to help you
rob the most exclusive jewellers in town?

706
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,665
That sounds like a great idea.

707
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,457
Yeah, it sounds bad
when you put it like that.

708
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:37,499
l just don't see the point. You know, we have
plenty of money on the remaining cards,

709
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:38,790
why bother with this?

710
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:42,540
We don't even need you. You know.
You're lucky we even agreed to cut you in.

711
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:46,124
Lucky? Any day l wake up and
l'm not you, believe me, l feel lucky.

712
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,249
Oh, shut up.

713
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,957
Look, this is once in a lifetime shit
we're talking about.

714
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,957
We get this right, there's no jobs
at companies we despise,

715
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,540
no 8% unemployment,

716
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,749
no carpet-bombing CVs for postgraduate jobs
that don't even fucking exist.

717
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,999
This could be all of us set up for life.

718
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,832
What l'm asking for is you listen to the plan.

719
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,082
OK.

720
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,165
Prince Zafran's young and uber-rich.

721
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,707
lt says here he's about to pop the question

722
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,832
to some French super-model called
Natascha Claudet.

723
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,540
Now what do you reckon Ama Dablam
are gonna think

724
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,707
if he starts enquiring about jewellery?

725
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,790
That they might get
the engagement ring contract.

726
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:27,457
We get them on the hook
and we get them over to London.

727
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,124
We're gonna take them for $20 million
without even using a gun.

728
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,540
How much is it gonna cost to set up?

729
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,915
lt's big money.

730
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,457
So let the plastic take the hit.

731
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,957
OK, so this is the room you wanted.

732
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,624
Yep.

733
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:50,124
lt's not much, but it's mine,
so don't fuck it up. Comprende?

734
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,707
Mustafa Riald, the prince's private secretary.

735
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,290
You got a number?

736
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,040
Right here.

737
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,332
What are we waiting for?

738
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,707
Hello, Mr. Riald's office?

739
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,832
Hello.
l'm calling from Ama Dablam jewellers

740
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:14,165
in Miami, Florida.

741
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,957
May I speak with Mr. Riald?

742
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,665
I'm afraid
Mr. Riald is travelling at the moment.

743
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,165
As you know, we're one of
the world's leading jewellers,

744
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,665
and as the imminent engagement
of Prince Zafran...

745
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,165
I should stop you
right there, sir.

746
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,790
The engagement is pure speculation.

747
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,707
It's a secret, I get it.

748
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,582
But we would like to arrange a private viewing

749
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,665
of our latest coloured diamond
collection for the prince.

750
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,832
Sorry, did you say you that

751
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,457
you were one of
the world's leading jewellers?

752
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,457
That's correct. Clients such as...

753
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,624
Sir, if there is to be
a royal wedding,

754
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,207
only the best jeweller would be required.

755
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,499
Well perhaps Mr. Riald is in a better position
to make that decision.

756
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,040
When's he back?

757
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,874
Possibly this Saturday, but he could...

758
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,290
l'll call back then, thank you.

759
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:54,665
Right, Riald's not in Brunei and his P.A.
won't connect anyone to him.

760
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,332
- And that's good?
- That is good.

761
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,374
Have you an image?

762
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,499
Yeah, picture's up.

763
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,915
All right, Yatesey, do the fan.

764
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:15,207
Good morning, Ama DabIam.
How may I direct your call?

765
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:16,999
l would like to speak to

766
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,374
Head of lnternational Sales.

767
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,165
Certainly, sir. Your name?

768
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,874
Mustafa Riald, private secretary to
His Excellency, Prince Zafran of Brunei.

769
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,957
Just putting you
through now, sir.

770
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,332
This is Steve Dawson.

771
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:44,332
Mr. Dawson, l wonder if you could
be of assistance.

772
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,207
Sir, l can barely hear you.

773
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:50,249
Apologies. l am speaking from
satellite phone on the Royal Jet.

774
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,374
How can l help you, sir?

775
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:57,249
Do you know that Prince Zafran will be
announcing his engagement shortly?

776
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:01,207
- No, no. l did not know that.
- Good.

777
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:05,374
It is confidentiaI.
I assume your discretion is assured?

778
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,457
Our business is built on trust, sir.

779
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,374
That is why we have chosen Ama Dablam

780
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,665
for His Royal Highness to consider
an engagement gift

781
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,165
and perhaps even the wedding rings.

782
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,999
Sir, it would be an honour.
Any piece in particular?

783
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,165
We expect a private viewing of your recent
coloured diamond collection.

784
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,749
Of course. Are you in Miami?

785
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:30,040
No. We will shortly be in London
for a 2 day visit.

786
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,124
We would like to arrange
a private viewing there.

787
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:35,874
The Royal Jet and staff will be
at your disposal.

788
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,582
Well, the thing is, Mr. Riald. . .

789
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:43,082
Of course if it's a problem we would reluctantly
consider another jeweller.

790
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:44,957
With this with me.
l'll make it happen.

791
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:51,332
Very good. l will call you tomorrow morning
at 8:00 a.m. and arrange everything.

792
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,290
- Hi there.
- Can l help you?

793
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,999
ls this baby available for charter to London?

794
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,207
She can go to lraq if the money's right.

795
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,749
Right we promised him
the Royal Jet. We'll need staff.

796
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:28,915
So, find them.

797
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,665
And do us aII a favour.
This is the modelling capital of America.

798
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,749
So?

799
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,999
So make sure they're not dogs.

800
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,124
l, uh, like what l see.

801
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,957
And you like what you touch.

802
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:47,582
l guarantee they give happy ending!

803
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,290
Yeah.

804
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:55,124
Uh, l just need them to be hostesses.
You know, polite, smile, not say too much.

805
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,290
And, uh,

806
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:03,040
it's quite important they don't do
happy endings.

807
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,582
OK, we got his jet and the staff.

808
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,874
Now we need authentic costumes and decor.

809
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,249
Uh, I should probably do that guys.

810
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:16,582
I'm writing my dissertation
on MiddIe Eastern cuIture.

811
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:19,749
Middle Eastern?
Brunei's next to Malaysia, you bell end.

812
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,707
We'll need transport
back in London.

813
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,790
- Needs to be fit for a prince.
- l'm on it.

814
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:45,624
Looks like l'm in line for a big commish
from the Brunei royal family.

815
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,124
Doing a showing in London shortly.

816
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:50,999
London? Wow, l'd love to go there.

817
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,082
Well, maybe we could arrange an extra seat?

818
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,457
Get you out of accounts and onto
the front line with the big dogs.

819
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,707
You can do that for me?

820
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:04,999
Yeah. A pretty face never hurt a sale.

821
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,207
Sam, how's Miami?

822
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:36,332
How'd you get this number?

823
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:39,040
You think l wouldn't keep an eye
on my investment?

824
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,290
So what are you doing out there?

825
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,165
l hope you're not thinking of running
away from your responsibilities.

826
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,957
l'm working on a way to get your money.

827
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,957
How is the water?

828
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,749
Well, make sure you work hard.

829
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:59,207
l'd hate for anything to happen
to your new girlfriend.

830
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,790
Tariq tells me she is quite beautiful.

831
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,957
Did she enjoy her swim?

832
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,915
Sam, hey! This is Tariq. Tariq, this is Sam.

833
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:24,124
You OK?

834
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,040
Yeah, fine. Tariq's over from London.
He wanted to know what's good to eat.

835
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,915
l was telling him about that burger place.

836
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:33,040
l want to know where is best place
in Miami to find a good restaurant.

837
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:38,165
l could ask anyone on the beach,
but l choose her.

838
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,540
She is a very beautiful lady.

839
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:47,457
lf l cut her face, maybe not so much, huh?

840
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,624
Doesn't bother me,
l can fuck her from behind.

841
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,415
This is best position for me anyway.

842
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,207
Put the fucking razor down.

843
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,457
Fuck you !

844
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:01,207
l want you to give my friend Sam
a reminder from his friend Marcel.

845
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,499
Tell Sam if he doesn't get Marcel
his money in 3 days,

846
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,499
very bad things will happen.

847
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,249
Not just to him,

848
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,582
but to the people he cares about.

849
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,915
Can you remember all that? Huh?

850
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,915
l see you soon. Huh?

851
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,749
You fucking scumbag.

852
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,665
- Frankie. . .
- Don't touch me!

853
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,665
- Where are you going?
- To get some answers.

854
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,790
So how much do you owe him?

855
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,082
- What?
- Marcel.

856
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,957
How much money do you owe him?

857
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,165
Sam's told me everything,
but l want to hear it from you.

858
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,540
How much money do you owe to him?

859
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:50,082
- lt's a couple of hundred. . .
- 2 million.

860
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:56,624
Who is he?

861
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,832
Who the fuck is he?

862
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,290
Frankie, we don't know.

863
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:04,415
OK, that's the truth.

864
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,499
All we know is he's dangerous
and he wants his money.

865
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,374
Why do you owe him money?

866
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,582
Because we fucked up.

867
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,249
You told her about Marcel?

868
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,040
l haven't said anything.

869
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,499
She said you did.

870
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,082
You fell for that?

871
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,915
You recruited me to pay off your debt?

872
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,249
ls that what l am to you, Sam?

873
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,124
That's all anyone is to him, Frankie.

874
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:37,082
Don't feel special.
He did the same to me and Raf.

875
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:42,040
Did what?

876
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,207
Ever wondered why Prince Charming

877
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,832
always seems to know
exactly what you're thinking?

878
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:51,290
"Oh, he's so sensitive. He just gets me."

879
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,374
They hacked your email.

880
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:57,832
That's what they do.

881
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,207
How did you put it, Sam?

882
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,707
You needed to find something
you could exploit?

883
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,207
l'm guessing it was something juicy.

884
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,790
You gonna tell us what it was, Frankie?

885
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,582
Maybe he's just got a really big cock.

886
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:20,540
- Frankie?
- Fuck off, Sam!

887
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,415
Aw, the one that got away.

888
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,582
Come here, you fucking prick!

889
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,790
Sam!

890
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,790
You dug your own fucking hole, Sam!

891
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,415
Back it up.

892
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:37,415
Calm the fuck down!

893
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,874
- This isn't over.
- Yeah, count on it.

894
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,665
Cunt.

895
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:44,457
Fucking nice one!

896
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,290
Frankie, come on.

897
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,332
Please, l just want to talk to you.
Let me explain.

898
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,499
Frankie, wait. Where are you going?

899
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,040
- To catch a flight.
- Please, don't go.

900
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,749
He said you needed something to exploit.

901
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,707
What did you find?

902
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:09,582
My dad, wasn't it?

903
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,915
And that story about your brother. . .

904
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,874
l made it up. Fuck.

905
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,457
What kind of a person does that, Sam?

906
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,082
Frankie, l liked you way before
any of this stuff ever happened. . .

907
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,749
Fuck you!

908
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,874
Frankie, for what it's worth, l'm sorry.

909
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:31,457
No, it's not worth anything.

910
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,999
Yatesey!

911
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,582
Sam, calm down.

912
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:36,832
- Where is he?
- Calm the fuck down.

913
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:39,790
- Where the fuck is he?
- Calm down! OK? Calm.

914
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:43,707
OK, look, l'm sorry. OK?
Really fucking sorry.

915
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,040
l am, about all of this.

916
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,124
But we've got a bigger problems
right now. Yeah?

917
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,624
Yatesey's a prick. OK?

918
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,290
Shown his true colours and after this,
we drop him like a stone.

919
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:56,124
But right now, we need him.

920
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,499
OK, Frankie can wait, mate.

921
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:01,999
Marcel won't.

922
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,665
OK?

923
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,165
Hello, Mr. Riald's office.

924
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,124
Hi, there, this is Steve Dawson
from Ama Dablam.

925
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,124
I'm afraid
he's very busy at the moment.

926
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:35,874
l'll bet he's real busy
with the engagement of the prince, right?

927
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,957
As you say, sir. l'll have him call you back.

928
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,249
Really?

929
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:45,874
Well, it would be an honour
to be invited to the wedding.

930
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,957
Well, yes, l do have someone
l'd like to bring along.

931
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,707
Yeah. Well, thank you.

932
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,749
Listen, he can call me back. OK? Yeah.

933
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,874
You're invited to the wedding?

934
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:01,790
Wanna come?

935
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,374
l wanna come.

936
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:07,790
Right. Hurry up before he shags her.

937
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,915
I have Mr. Riald on the line for you.

938
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,499
Riald? Yeah, put him through.

939
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,957
Mr. Riald, thank you so much for calling back.

940
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,040
Good afternoon.

941
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:24,040
As you know, I am very busy,
so I must be brief.

942
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:28,749
I am just letting you know that the Royal Jet is
waiting to take you to London.

943
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:32,624
We're grateful that the Brunei
security services will be present,

944
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:37,290
but our insurers insist on our own
team accompanying us.

945
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:42,040
We'll be bringing some beautiful
additions to the current collection,

946
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:45,874
including a choke necklace and bracelet
made from yellow and black diamonds.

947
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:47,832
Truly spectacular.

948
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:03,124
Excuse me, do you have any nuts?

949
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,499
You know, nuts? Nuts.

950
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:07,874
You understand?

951
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:20,249
OK. Let's roll.

952
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:29,082
They're at the hotel. There's one steel
case strapped to a security guy.

953
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:32,665
I'll put in my
call now before they can relax.

954
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:36,749
Hey, we've got a couple of hours
before the meeting.

955
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,290
Do you wanna grab a drink?

956
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,082
Well, l was gonna have a shower but. . .

957
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,499
- A drink sounds good.
- A shower sounds better.

958
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,249
Yeah, it does.

959
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:55,207
What? Are you playing games?

960
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,124
l just said l was gonna have a shower.

961
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:01,249
Which means l'll be naked.

962
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,165
Who's playing games?

963
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,040
That's great.

964
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,999
Hello?

965
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,415
Mr. Dawson?

966
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,499
Mr. Riald.

967
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,082
l trust your flight was acceptable?

968
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,790
Uh, yeah. Yeah, the flight was great.
Thank you.

969
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,749
Thank you so much for laying on
the special entertainment.

970
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,457
lt was really appreciated.

971
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,374
OK.

972
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:35,499
His Royal Highness' diary has
dramatically changed,

973
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:36,915
so we need to bring forward the schedule.

974
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,124
Meet you in the foyer in 30 minutes.

975
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,124
30 minutes. Game face.

976
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,915
Mr. Riald?

977
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,457
Mr. Dawson. Good to meet you.

978
01:06:56,708 --> 01:07:00,165
You too. This is Beth Johnson, my assistant.

979
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,915
And this is my security attachment.

980
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,999
Very good.

981
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,124
His Excellency is on a tight schedule today.

982
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,999
So, can l speed things up
and get the viewing under way?

983
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:25,457
Your Excellency,
the Ama Dablam team is here.

984
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,290
This is Steve Dawson.

985
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,582
Your Royal Highness. . .

986
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,207
lt's a real privilege to meet you, sir.

987
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:42,040
l should like to view the collection
on the way to my next meeting.

988
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,749
His Excellency would appreciate
a private, advance viewing.

989
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,499
ln the limo?

990
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:54,332
l say "appreciate",
it's more that he insists on it.

991
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,332
Of course, not a problem.

992
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,749
Give His Royal Highness the case, please.

993
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,874
l will be riding up front,
you and your team can ride in car two.

994
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,415
You're handing over the collection
without an escort?

995
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,999
Thank you, Miss Johnson. That will be all.

996
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,290
- But that goes against. . .
- Beth, go to your room.

997
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,832
Steve, you can't do this.

998
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,499
Don't ever question me in front of
my client again, OK?

999
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,165
This is the way the prince likes it.

1000
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:29,374
That's why l'm head of lnternational Sales
and you're just a glorified secretary.

1001
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,165
Fucking prick.

1002
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,957
We will return the case at
the prince's next appointment.

1003
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:45,040
l'm going to be late.

1004
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:52,957
Wait for it, Fordy. Now!

1005
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:04,999
- What the hell? Stay with the limo!
- l can't, sir. lt's a red light.

1006
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,290
Get out! Come on, move, move.

1007
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,707
Hello.

1008
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:21,749
Rafa in limo one's left us.
Limo two, where are you?

1009
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,165
Yatesey?

1010
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,790
Limo two
with you in 5 seconds.

1011
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,999
Come on!

1012
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,874
Come on, come on.

1013
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:40,999
- We're good to go.
- OK, let's go. Come on!

1014
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,457
- Looks like they bought it.
- Keep it nice and slow.

1015
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,290
For a minute there l thought
we were being robbed.

1016
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,999
Time?

1017
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:25,957
Time.

1018
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,457
Ta-ta, fuckers.

1019
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,999
Where the hell is Riald going?

1020
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,290
Which way do you want me to go, sir?

1021
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,957
- With the diamonds!
- Sir?

1022
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,957
The fucking limo, idiot!

1023
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,290
Oh, no. Bollocks.

1024
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,790
ls there a problem, sir?

1025
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,832
No. l need you to pull over.

1026
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,290
ls there anything l can do, sir?

1027
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,124
Can l borrow your
phone please, mate?

1028
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,457
You what?

1029
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:07,707
l command that you
surrender your mobile phone.

1030
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:11,332
- l need to make urgent call. Royal business.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,624
- lt's a UK call, right?
- Yes.

1032
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:16,832
Yes. And private.

1033
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:31,207
- Hello?
- lt's me. My battery died.

1034
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,874
- l worked it out.
- What?

1035
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,707
Your magic number.
How does 10 million sound?

1036
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,707
- What are you talking about?
- Two way split.

1037
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,165
Got a guy waiting to take this stuff
off our hands. lt's all been arranged.

1038
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,249
l don't think l can, mate.

1039
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,957
What did l tell you about letting
people take the piss out of you?

1040
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,040
lt's time to step up, Rafa.

1041
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,374
l'm ready to give you what you're worth.

1042
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:02,249
Yatesey. . .

1043
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:17,999
l have decided to walk to my next meeting.
This is yours.

1044
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,082
- Shall l drive those cases to. . .
- No, no. Not necessary.

1045
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:23,290
You are finished for the day.

1046
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,165
The fuck. . .

1047
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,207
Jesus, what the hell?

1048
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,582
Come on! Move.
Get out of the car!

1049
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,082
Get out of the fucking. . .

1050
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,832
Come on, move.
Come on, come on, please.

1051
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:06,124
OK, what the fuck is this?
Look again!

1052
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:08,415
Look the fuck again.

1053
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,832
Oh, God damn it!

1054
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:19,374
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1055
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,290
Oh, here we go.

1056
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,874
- Yatesey, everything all right?
- All good.

1057
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,207
- Where's Rafa?
- He's with me.

1058
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,790
- l thought we supposed were meeting up after. . .
- Yeah well, you know what thought did.

1059
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,124
We're just calling to say goodbye.

1060
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,957
- You've got the diamonds?
- Not for long.

1061
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,540
l've got a buyer lined up and ready to go.

1062
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:50,124
- What is going on?
- What about Marcel?

1063
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,499
Your problem. Goodbye, Sam.

1064
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:54,624
He's done it, hasn't he?

1065
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,499
Fuck!

1066
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:02,415
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

1067
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,582
Our statement from you,
"A prince and his royal secretary

1068
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:14,082
"just stole $20 million worth of jewels

1069
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:15,332
"without using any force."

1070
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,790
Did you gift-wrap it for them?

1071
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:21,749
- Excuse me?
- The jewellery. Did you have it gift-wrapped?

1072
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:22,999
Cos you might as well have done.

1073
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,040
- Are we suspects?
- Of course not, Beth.

1074
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,707
We're in charge now, thank you,
Mr. Dawson.

1075
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,665
What do we tell Marcel?

1076
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,915
Maybe he'll give us an extension.

1077
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,999
Not if we're talking about
the same bloke, we're not.

1078
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:56,874
What's that?

1079
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,124
Do you think l'd trust Rafa with $20 million?

1080
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,832
How else do we keep
an eye on them?

1081
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,999
Good call.

1082
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:16,249
Right, he's heading east.

1083
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,749
Marie de Guise Hotel, Park Lane.

1084
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,082
OK, well that's 10 minutes away
from here.

1085
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,082
Yatesey reckons he's already
found a buyer.

1086
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,707
Mate, with that amount of money at stake

1087
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:41,707
he'll have to bring some serious
muscle to the table.

1088
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:45,040
Right. l know just the guy.

1089
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,249
Sam, we were just talking about you.

1090
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:53,749
- Yeah, what?
- Do you have my money in your hands?

1091
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:58,040
Yeah, well about that. . .
We might need an extension.

1092
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,457
- Speak.
- Sam? Sam, it's me. . .

1093
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:01,582
Frankie?

1094
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,499
lt was Tariq's idea to pick her up.

1095
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,165
l think he's got a bit of a crush on her.

1096
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,582
lf you consider that he got his last
two girlfriend's hooked on drugs

1097
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:14,790
and working as prostitutes,
you might realise this isn't

1098
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,790
the ideal relationship for her to be in.

1099
01:17:18,541 --> 01:17:21,249
l want my money. Today.

1100
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,707
Any later, l give Frankie to Tariq.

1101
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:28,207
And when he's done with her, he comes
looking for you and for your friends.

1102
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,582
We'll get you your money.

1103
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:36,624
lt's amazing what a little extra
motivation can do, isn't it?

1104
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:38,874
Now, tell me, where can I collect my money?

1105
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:44,540
Obviously you checked into
the validity of this Riald character?

1106
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,374
Yeah.

1107
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,957
Well, yeah. Kind of.

1108
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:53,249
What he's asking is, did you ever call
Brunei and speak directly to Riald?

1109
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:56,457
Of course he did.
We were invited to the wedding.

1110
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,165
Busted.

1111
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,415
- You're pathetic.
- He knows.

1112
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,040
Am l going to lose my job?

1113
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,290
- What?
- The prince used my phone.

1114
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,999
"Royal business," he said.

1115
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,915
Do you have any idea
who it could have been?

1116
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,624
No, but the number is still here.

1117
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,290
- You sure about this?
- These guys respect me, Rafa.

1118
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,457
They run a cash business. lt's perfect.

1119
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,999
Hello, you're talking to a millionaire.

1120
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:01,832
You reckon I won't find you?

1121
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:05,249
- l'm counting on it.
- You're not as clever as you think.

1122
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,832
Sit down with the stuff.
Sit down.

1123
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,124
Mr. Yates. Meet my boss.

1124
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:25,582
- Only name he goes by is Mr. X.
- Good to finally meet you. Come in.

1125
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,374
They're here.

1126
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:51,332
Any problem, you call me.

1127
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:04,874
What the. . .

1128
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:08,165
Come here!

1129
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,915
- Where is she? Where is she?
- She. . .

1130
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,290
She's in the boot.

1131
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:20,374
Stay there.

1132
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:36,124
lt's OK.

1133
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:37,832
lt's OK.

1134
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,915
l just want to get the fuck out of here.

1135
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:43,999
Please. l'm only an accountant.

1136
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,249
Give me your phone.

1137
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:49,832
And your jacket, now.

1138
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:02,457
All right, go. Go.

1139
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,749
Frankie, we have to finish this.

1140
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:11,290
l can't protect you. l'm sorry.

1141
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,499
Frankie, run.

1142
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:21,540
Go!

1143
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:34,999
Nice. Very nice.

1144
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,874
That's just the tip of
the iceberg, bruv.

1145
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,374
Dion tells me you're pulling in
half a million cash a week.

1146
01:21:40,416 --> 01:21:42,374
That means l've got enough stuff at least
for 3 month's wages.

1147
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:45,790
- l'd like to see it.
- l see the money, you see the stuff.

1148
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,082
He wasn't asking.

1149
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:52,040
What the fuck?

1150
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,290
You're out of your depth, Mr. Yates.
There's no shame in it.

1151
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,915
Should l remind you that there are
cameras in the lobby and the lifts?

1152
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:03,540
Only if you want me to tell you we came
in the back and took the stairs.

1153
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,749
Fuck!

1154
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,082
Don't worry, it's a .22.
Only little.

1155
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:16,040
Fuck's sake, Yatesey,
just give them what they want!

1156
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:19,415
- Shut up, Rafa.
- My fucking leg!

1157
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:26,249
Last chance.

1158
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:29,624
Stop.

1159
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,207
He's not going to tell us anything.

1160
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,582
Not with a gun in that idiot's mouth.

1161
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,957
Now you and me, we're kindred spirits.

1162
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,374
You know what l see in your eyes?

1163
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:04,665
Nothing. lt's like looking in the mirror.

1164
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,749
You expecting someone?

1165
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,915
Well, then answer the door.

1166
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,540
And if it's anyone other than an old lady
wanting to change the sheets,

1167
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,874
l'm gonna ventilate your head.

1168
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,249
You gonna invite us in?

1169
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,165
Yatesey!

1170
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,249
Triangulation puts them at
Marie de Guise Hotel, Park Lane.

1171
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,707
Call for backup.

1172
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:07,040
Yeah?

1173
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:54,082
DCl Hartley, ambulance required at
the Marie de Guise Hotel now.

1174
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,457
Shots are being fired.

1175
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:59,165
Clear everybody out! Get out, go, go!

1176
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,624
We've got to wait for backup.

1177
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,207
Yatesey!

1178
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:51,249
Where's the backup?

1179
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,707
Stop right there!

1180
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:27,207
Right, he's on the move. Let's go.

1181
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:32,915
Yeah. Marcel's here now.
Get down.

1182
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:41,332
Get us the fuck out of here now!

1183
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:18,915
Fuck you!

1184
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:22,207
Armed police!
Drop the gun, right fucking now!

1185
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,290
Hey, fuck you!

1186
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:31,082
He set me up!

1187
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:36,124
Soon as we find somewhere quiet,
l want you to pull over.

1188
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,415
l'm going to cut that fucking
bitch's throat.

1189
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:44,040
You sure you know how to use that thing?

1190
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,415
Looks like one of those
point and shoot models to me.

1191
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,999
Get out of the fucking car!

1192
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,249
Get out of the fucking car!

1193
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:00,165
What are you doing?

1194
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,207
Yatesey, you prick!

1195
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,165
Ow!

1196
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:13,707
Get off me!

1197
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:23,665
Yatesey!

1198
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:39,540
Yatesey! Yatesey!

1199
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:55,957
Sam?

1200
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,707
Sam! Sam!

1201
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:04,665
Sam!

1202
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:07,332
Sam.

1203
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:10,749
Sam, Sam we need to go.

1204
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,999
- Sam, we've got to get you out of here.
- Yatesey's here.

1205
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:16,207
- What?
- He's here, he's got the fucking diamonds!

1206
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,540
- Check the other car.
- The fucking door's jammed.

1207
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:20,999
- Fucking check the other car!
- l'm not fucking leaving you here.

1208
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,082
You have to try and get out.

1209
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,415
Fordy, l'm not gonna fucking make it, mate.
Go!

1210
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,290
Go, go!

1211
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:29,207
Fuck. Fuck!

1212
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,207
Go!

1213
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:33,874
Fuck!

1214
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:49,999
Sam! l'm sorry. . .

1215
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,999
Call an ambulance!

1216
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,040
One casualty. . .

1217
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:25,582
Back behind the tape, please!

1218
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:33,707
l backed the wrong horse.

1219
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:39,832
Sorry.

1220
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,749
l didn't get that.
Say that again please, over.

1221
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,249
Fuck it.

1222
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,915
Look alive, Rafa.

1223
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:39,832
Someone's made a dirty protest
in the gent's again.

1224
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:42,957
lt's like a cluster bomb's gone off in there.

1225
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:47,124
- Gimme a break. lt's your turn.
- No, no, no, my friend.

1226
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:50,165
l serve the customers,
you clean up what they leave behind.

1227
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:53,874
You don't like it, l call your parole officer
and tell him you've been stealing.

1228
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:54,957
Aw.

1229
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,457
- Wanker.
- Oh.

1230
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,290
lt just doesn't stop.
l didn't get out of here until 2:00 last night.

1231
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:13,457
- Before or after you went to the bar?
- l came back.

1232
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:15,124
- Oh, really?
- You need a little. . .

1233
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,290
- And Jeremy, how is he?
- Telephone call for you, sir.

1234
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:19,415
- For me?
- Yes.

1235
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:22,082
Back in a minute.

1236
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,582
Hey, l didn't ask for. . .

1237
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:06,165
Double glazing salesman.
Calls me in a restaurant.

1238
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,124
How does that even happen?

1239
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,624
Did you buy any?

1240
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,999
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1241
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:21,707
l think so.

1242
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,207
Yeah, you done right by her.
That's got to count for something.

1243
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,999
Let's go.
