1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,436
<i>Ancient Rome.</i>

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,590
<i>From here, an empire sent out armies
which mastered the known world.</i>

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,316
<i>A superpower unrivalled in its ingenuity</i>

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,638
<i>and its savagery.</i>

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,796
<i>This was the glorious civilisation
that shaped our own.</i>

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,911
<i>For 500 years, Rome ruled supreme.</i>

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,116
<i>The Empire, they said, would last forever.</i>

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,316
<i>But then, it was all Just ripped apart.</i>

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,513
<i>This is the story of how Rome fell.</i>

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,309
<i>It's a tale of a weak emperor
who tried to be strong.</i>

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,474
Barbarians are all beasts.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,194
Animals.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,275
<i>A tale of a barbarian king
who wanted Justice.</i>

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,388
The Emperor has betrayed us again.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,955
<i>This is the extraordinary story
of how treachery and greed</i>

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>brought down the greatest city
of the ancient world,</i>

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,109
<i>and why it should never have happened at all.</i>

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,395
We will win what was promised us.
Either that, or Rome itself will fall!

19
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,712
<i>At the start of the fifth century AD,
Rome was under siege,</i>

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,432
<i>threatened by a vast army of barbarian Goths.</i>

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,309
<i>40,000 of them were poised at the city's gates.</i>

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,398
The men are ready.

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,431
Rome is at your mercy.

24
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,675
<i>Rome was defenceless.</i>

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,588
<i>Even the remnants of its garrison
abandoned their posts.</i>

26
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,036
We stand our ground and fight to the last man.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,632
Alaric, come on!

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,799
Give the order!

29
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,635
There can be no turning back.

30
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,710
When we take Rome, it will not be a victory.

31
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,115
We will have failed our people.

32
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,398
I will have failed.

33
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,358
<i>The events that brought Rome
to the brink of disaster</i>

34
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,678
<i>had their origins in an act of betrayal
two years earlier.</i>

35
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,236
<i>At the beginning of the fifth century AD,
the Roman Empire was under assault,</i>

36
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,555
<i>its armies at breaking point.</i>

37
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,113
<i>It battled hordes of outsiders.
Barbarians, as the Romans called them.</i>

38
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,316
<i>These tribes, with names
like the Huns and the Vandals,</i>

39
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,271
<i>had swept all before them.</i>

40
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,470
<i>Even other barbarians.</i>

41
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,274
<i>One such smaller tribe, the Goths, had been
forced from their lands near the Black Sea.</i>

42
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,479
<i>They had fled westward
until they crossed into the Roman Empire.</i>

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,839
<i>The Goths now wandered the Empire,
a refugee nation.</i>

44
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,194
<i>Their leaders, Alaric
and his brother-in-law, Athaulf,</i>

45
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,912
<i>were desperate to find a new homeland
for their people.</i>

46
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,713
<i>Somewhere safe within Roman borders.</i>

47
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,473
# From the grass of the steppe,
they have made a scourge

48
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,749
# From the grass of the steppe... #

49
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,438
Can you hear it?

50
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,633
What is it?

51
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,152
# Spirit of the wind, carry me

52
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,511
# Spirit of the wind, carry me home #

53
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,188
Come on.

54
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,799
# From the grass of the steppe
they have made a scourge

55
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,110
# From the grass of the steppe
they have made a scourge

56
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,797
# Spirit of the wind, carry me home #

57
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,399
How long do we have to live like this?

58
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,799
I swear to you, this will soon be over.

59
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,839
I have the word of the Emperor Honorius.
He will grant us land.

60
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,119
Good land. To settle in.

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,353
Be patient.

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,674
You're promising them too much.

63
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,268
I'm promising what I can deliver.

64
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,396
- And you really trust the Emperor?
- I trust Stilicho, and he holds the real power.

65
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,069
<i>The man in whom Alaric had
put his faith was Flavius Stilicho,</i>

66
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,758
<i>the Emperor's chief advisor.</i>

67
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,359
<i>They had made a deal.</i>

68
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,553
<i>Goth military muscle would serve
the Empire in return for land.</i>

69
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,554
<i>But Stilicho had fallen out with his Emperor,
and taken refuge in a church.</i>

70
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,912
Flavius Stilicho.

71
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,237
If you continue to remain within
the sanctuary of this church,

72
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,397
the Emperor will take it
as an admission of your guilt.

73
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,512
That you wilfully conspired
with the barbarian enemies of...

74
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,517
I have not conspired.

75
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,036
I've negotiated,
for the sake of the Empire's security.

76
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,638
Then make your case to the Emperor himself.

77
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,834
This letter guarantees your safety.

78
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,319
I understand.

79
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,273
Flavius Stilicho, I have another letter.

80
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,513
A later command from the Emperor.
It orders your immediate execution.

81
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,876
<i>The order for Stilicho's murder
had come not from Rome,</i>

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,073
<i>but from the Emperor's new headquarters
in Ravenna, Northern Italy.</i>

83
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,949
<i>The Emperor Honorius had been
on the throne since childhood.</i>

84
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,071
<i>His character would prove critical
in Rome's eventual fate.</i>

85
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,238
Close the doors.

86
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,350
- What are the people saying about me, Olympius?
- That you did the right thing, my Lord.

87
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,152
The right thing?

88
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,635
Stilicho was like a father to me.

89
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,556
- He taught me.
- He deceived you, my Lord.

90
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,959
His policy of appeasing the barbarians would have
dismantled your empire, piece by piece.

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,793
I feel...

92
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,394
horrible.

93
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,868
You may feel pain. But you should also be proud.

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,673
You put loyalty to the Empire
over your own personal feelings.

95
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
What you did was strong and decisive.

96
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,195
Yes.

97
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,353
Yes, it was strong. And I will protect the Empire.

98
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,398
- With your help, Olympius.
- Of course, my Lord.

99
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,557
But your work is not finished.

100
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,119
Stilicho had many barbarian supporters
within the Empire.

101
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,034
Now they could organise against us.

102
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,678
We need to find a solution to this problem.

103
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,954
Brother!

104
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,673
Stilicho's been killed. Executed by the Emperor.

105
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,470
And our deal's dead with him.

106
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,594
Thank you. We'll train again tomorrow.

107
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,637
Our deal is with the Emperor, not with Stilicho.

108
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,273
- The Romans must still honour it.
- They won't.

109
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,311
We'll never get our land, Alaric.

110
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,075
What will you tell the people?

111
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,839
I don't know.

112
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,839
I don't know.

113
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,274
<i>A few days after Stilicho's death,</i>

114
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,712
<i>Olympius' solution to the barbarian problem
was revealed.</i>

115
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,191
<i>In Roman cities, the families of any barbarians</i>

116
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,596
<i>who might have supported Stilicho,
were slaughtered.</i>

117
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,632
Every barbarian is a potential threat.

118
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,309
The Empire has been tainted
ever since they crossed our borders.

119
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,230
<i>And now they live among us,
in our homes.</i>

120
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,435
Please.

121
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,475
<i>You know the teachings.</i>

122
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,589
We have reason. They are irrational.

123
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,234
We are controlled by intellect.

124
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,033
<i>They are ruled by base instinct.</i>

125
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,594
Please, not my son, please!

126
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,032
<i>Throughout our history,</i>

127
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,073
<i>whenever Rome has stood up to the barbarian,
we have flourished.</i>

128
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,275
Death to all barbarians!

129
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,115
<i>The massacre of barbarian families
was brutal even by Roman standards.</i>

130
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,598
<i>The survivors fled.</i>

131
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,989
<i>Among them, thousands of barbarian soldiers
who had deserted the Roman Army.</i>

132
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,594
<i>They all sought the same sanctuary.</i>

133
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,678
You're safe now.

134
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,477
He was just a boy.

135
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,548
My boy.

136
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,198
What can I do?

137
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,637
Make Rome suffer

138
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,832
as I have suffered.

139
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,194
- This cannot be about simple vengeance.
- We've 30,000 men now.

140
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,640
Let's march on Ravenna, capture the Emperor
and force him to honour the deal he made with us.

141
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,035
We'll never trap him in Ravenna.

142
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,358
There's water on three sides, marsh on the other.

143
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,393
That's why he squats there.
He'll see us coming and be long gone.

144
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,154
We need a target that can't escape us.

145
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,519
Something that Honorius really values.

146
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,797
We'll march on Rome.

147
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,474
- You want to take Rome?
- No, Berig.

148
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,470
I want to hold Rome hostage.

149
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,391
We threaten to take it.

150
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,915
The city's the heart of their Empire.

151
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,874
No emperor could survive the shame of losing it.
He'll honour his promise first.

152
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,230
They'll fight hard to defend it.

153
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,679
They can't.

154
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,070
That's the beauty of it.
Their armies are scattered across the Empire.

155
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,317
Rome's more vulnerable now than it's ever been.

156
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,958
Let's see if Honorius wants to be
the first Emperor to preside over the city's fall.

157
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,355
We were promised a new homeland.

158
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,354
The Emperor has broken that promise.

159
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,195
So today we march against him.
Today we march against Rome.

160
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,233
Their armies are scattered far and wide,

161
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,713
defending their borders, fighting usurpers.

162
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,110
The way is open to us, but it will not be easy.

163
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,028
I swear to you I will lead us to victory.

164
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,349
We will win what was promised us.
Either that, or Rome itself will fall!

165
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,277
<i>The Goth war machine
swept through Italy.</i>

166
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,470
<i>It met with little opposition.</i>

167
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,068
<i>Honorius's armies were already fully occupied,</i>

168
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,193
<i>countering rebellion in Gaul
and attacks from across the Rhine.</i>

169
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,034
<i>So, Just three months after leaving
their camp in Noricum,</i>

170
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,392
<i>the Goths arrived outside the walls of Rome.</i>

171
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,155
Block every route into the city.

172
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,754
Nothing gets in. Nothing.

173
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,790
Our people are hungry.

174
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,718
Now the Romans will find out how it feels.

175
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,350
<i>And so it was that Rome,
for the first time in 800 years,</i>

176
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,479
<i>began to suffer the miseries of siege.</i>

177
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,755
<i>Amongst those trapped in the city,</i>

178
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,077
<i>the Emperor's younger sister, Galla Placidia.</i>

179
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,356
Petronius, the truth.

180
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,313
- How much food do we have left?
- Enough for ten days. No more.

181
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,954
All the grain merchants are closed.
There's nothing.

182
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,358
- Even for the Emperor's sister?
- My lady, the city is starving.

183
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,636
People are dying. If your brother doesn't act...

184
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,593
It's not my brother who's besieging Rome.

185
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,079
- This is absurd.
- I'm sorry, my lady. We're doing our best.

186
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,272
I know you're trying.

187
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,508
From today, we're all on the same rations.
Myself included.

188
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,312
Do you understand?

189
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,595
My brother won't let Rome starve.

190
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,431
Now Alaric's asking for four provinces.
Noricum, Dalmatia and the two Venetias.

191
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,471
My Lord, he may as well demand
your whole empire.

192
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,910
And what do you suggest we do, Olympius?
Our troops are stretched as it is.

193
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,191
His Majesty is right.
We do not have the forces to contend with Alaric.

194
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,790
So we negotiate with the barbarian?
Is that what you're saying, Jovius?

195
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,639
- We give in to his threats?
- At least keep him talking.

196
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,320
Jovius, you cannot go around
giving land to barbarians

197
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,908
just because they show their teeth and bark for it.

198
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,473
That way, we lose everything.

199
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,990
Perhaps if I give them land,
they'll think me generous.

200
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,032
If only that were true,
but, my Lord, you cannot afford it.

201
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,631
These provinces pay us a great deal in taxes.
Give them away and they won't.

202
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,796
Our financial situation is already critical.

203
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,037
Nevertheless, your Majesty's instinct is right.

204
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,114
Go on, Jovius, I'm listening.

205
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,596
By negotiating with Alaric, we are buying time.
That is what we need.

206
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,951
So that when we have dealt with
the rebellions elsewhere, our forces...

207
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,312
What forces? If you give Alaric what he wants,
there won't be any forces.

208
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,396
No taxes, no army.

209
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,114
No army, no Empire. Simple logic, my Lord.

210
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,230
We will reject his demands.

211
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,628
Dressers.

212
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,028
Get the boot.

213
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,551
Their garrison is pathetic.
A handful, at best.

214
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,468
- We could sack this city any time we like.
- And what then?

215
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,637
If we sack Rome,
we'll have nothing to bargain with.

216
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,149
The Emperor must believe our threat.

217
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,989
But if I ever lead our men through those gates,
we've lost.

218
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,193
It's not as complicated as that for the men.
Or for me.

219
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,390
The Empire is too strong.

220
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,756
In the end, they'll come after us.

221
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,759
- We'll be hunted and homeless forever.
- Our men need paying.

222
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,592
They see a city full of gold and treasures
and they can't understand

223
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,190
- why you don't just take it.
- No. We continue the siege.

224
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,869
If my plan works we'll get the gold,
and our promised land.

225
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,993
<i>As the siege wore on,</i>

226
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,874
<i>Rome's desperate citizens
turned to the Senate for leadership.</i>

227
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,554
<i>It was the nearest thing they had to a parliament,
but no longer the force it once was.</i>

228
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,433
Our great city. A million hungry people
and the Emperor does nothing.

229
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,431
He's safe in Ravenna.

230
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,150
- Rome means nothing to him.
- His sister lives here.

231
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,276
How many times has he visited our city, Festus?

232
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,358
Three. And one of those as a baby.

233
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,474
No, we the Senate
must take control of the situation.

234
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,551
- We can't make a move without the Emperor's...
- Forget the Emperor.

235
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,036
We must negotiate with Alaric ourselves directly.

236
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,950
Negotiate with him?

237
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,710
I, for one, am not about to meekly
present my arse to that barbarian.

238
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,555
I said I'd win us gold and land. Today, the gold.

239
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,036
And you are?

240
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,517
We represent the great Senate of Rome.

241
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,916
We speak for the people
and the glorious city itself.

242
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,508
Well, a simple name would have done.

243
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,919
Tell me, great Senate.
Is your Emperor going to help you?

244
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,517
Our Emperor knows we can defend ourselves.

245
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,871
And he won't negotiate with a savage.

246
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,233
But you will.

247
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,995
I'm not here to negotiate with you.

248
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,111
I'm here to tell you

249
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,439
that we have 100,000 armed citizens
ready to defend Rome,

250
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,030
ready to attack your camp
if you don't withdraw immediately.

251
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,831
Then come out and fight.

252
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,153
The thicker the hay, the easier it's cut.

253
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,236
Just how much of a stupid savage
do you think I am?

254
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,951
I know how many soldiers you have in your city.

255
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,516
I know how many soldiers you have
on every single gate.

256
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,794
Now, shall we start this again?

257
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,236
What do you want?

258
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,798
What will it take for you to lift this siege?

259
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,352
I want your gold. Your silver.

260
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,712
Every treasure. All of it.

261
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,629
You would leave us with nothing?

262
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,636
No. I'll leave you your souls.

263
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,554
<i>The Senate did what Alaric wanted.</i>

264
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,031
<i>To its citizens' dismay, Rome's public and state
buildings were stripped of much of their wealth.</i>

265
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,314
All Rome's riches without spilling
a single drop of blood.

266
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,715
You were always the clever one.

267
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,157
And now for the land.

268
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,669
And you're telling me this is all Rome's treasure?

269
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,634
- All the riches of the glorious city itself?
- Yes.

270
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,549
5,000 pounds of gold. 30,000 pounds of silver.

271
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,596
The finest silks and spices.

272
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,674
Not such a great city, after all.

273
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,917
We've stripped every house and public building.

274
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,195
Ah.

275
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,152
And what about your own personal hoards?
Cleaned them out too?

276
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,390
I don't think so. And I'm disappointed.

277
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,396
I think we'd better come
and have a look for ourselves.

278
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,355
See what our swords turn up,
hidden in little nooks and crannies.

279
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,749
Yes?

280
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,711
This is all we have.

281
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,868
Really?

282
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,112
This gold. Not enough.

283
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,198
Not nearly enough.

284
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,515
It doesn't buy you your freedom.

285
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,149
It buys you... three days.

286
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,553
I'll let food in for three days.

287
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,150
And I suggest you use the time wisely.

288
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,516
I suggest you go to your Emperor and tell him

289
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,394
that if he gives me what he once promised,
I'll leave Rome.

290
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,034
If you can persuade him to do that,

291
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,313
you, Senator Attalus,

292
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,876
will have saved your city.

293
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,754
<i>Alaric was true to his word.</i>

294
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,316
<i>Within a few days,
food was allowed back into Rome.</i>

295
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,679
<i>But the fate of the city
now depended on Senator Attalus' mission</i>

296
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,836
<i>to the Emperor in Ravenna.</i>

297
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,077
<i>Attalus took with him a new proposal from Alaric.</i>

298
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,558
Do you know how I got here?
Escorted by barbarians through my own country.

299
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,438
We're all delighted to see you alive, Attalus.

300
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,515
Please, won't you eat something first?

301
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,359
You must be starving after your journey.

302
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,629
He's only asking for one province now.
Just Noricum.

303
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,150
That's not the actions of a looting thug.
He wants a settlement.

304
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,068
He won't keep his side of any bargain,
we can be sure of that.

305
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,389
General Sarus, you were born a Goth.
What's your opinion?

306
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,116
Can we trust Alaric?

307
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,073
He has no honour. He's a killer.

308
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,590
- Greedy for anything he can get his hands on.
- Precisely.

309
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,669
He will destroy Rome
if you don't give him what he wants.

310
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,118
General Sarus, tell me,
before you joined the Roman Army,

311
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,838
weren't you and Alaric rivals
for the leadership of the Goths?

312
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,998
He tricked me out of it. That's his nature.

313
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,831
- Why he can't be trusted.
- I see.

314
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,916
A barbarian blood feud.

315
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,915
My Lord, we can't be influenced like this,
by personal grievances.

316
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,110
Rome's survival is at stake.

317
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,755
Your sister is there.
If that matters to you, my Lord.

318
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,316
I haven't forgotten.

319
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,671
And you're wrong to think
I don't care about Rome.

320
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,234
- Tell Alaric...
- My Lord...

321
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,918
No more, Olympius.

322
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,439
He can have what he wants.
I don't want any more Romans to die.

323
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,919
For the moment, our treasury
will just have to do without Noricum.

324
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,315
It's mostly mountains, anyway.

325
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,636
<i>Senator Attalus
returned to Rome a hero.</i>

326
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,755
<i>Everyone believed that
there would soon be a peace treaty.</i>

327
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,518
<i>Even the Goths.</i>

328
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,472
You will tell the Emperor we accept his terms.

329
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,149
We'll withdraw to Tuscia.
Give the order to strike camp.

330
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,476
<i>As a sign of goodwill
before final negotiations,</i>

331
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,160
<i>Alaric agreed to pull back from Rome.</i>

332
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,389
I can see what you're doing, my Lord.
And it's brilliant.

333
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,235
Is it?

334
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,918
What am I doing, Olympius?

335
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,919
Well, now Alaric thinks he's won,
now he's withdrawn from Rome,

336
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,589
we can get more troops
into the city to defend it properly.

337
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,076
But is that a good idea, Olympius?

338
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,039
- Breaking the agreement?
- It's an idea of genius, my Lord.

339
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,478
It will give us the upper hand.
That's what you intended, isn't it?

340
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,398
Yes. Yes, it was.

341
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,031
- But will it work?
- Of course, my Lord, I assure you.

342
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,958
Everyone will see it as your masterstroke.

343
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,955
So, how many troops can we send?

344
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,915
<i>6,000 soldiers were gathered
to reinforce Rome's garrison in secret.</i>

345
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,112
<i>But their commander made the mistake
of taking his troops by open road.</i>

346
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,674
Silence. I said, shut up!

347
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,000
The Emperor's sending troops to Rome.

348
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,318
Trying to sneak them in.

349
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,517
He's double-crossed us.

350
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,111
We'll head them off.

351
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,556
I'll kill every one of them.

352
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,074
<i>Honorius's relief force
never reached Rome.</i>

353
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,988
<i>Athaulf intercepted them
with the full might of the Goth army.</i>

354
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,556
<i>Only 100 Roman soldiers survived.</i>

355
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,436
I asked you again and again,

356
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,676
"Are 6,000 troops enough?"

357
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,836
And you said, "Yes. "

358
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,951
I thought it would be sufficient.

359
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,675
- I never thought Alaric would discover...
- You were wrong!

360
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,477
Say you were wrong.

361
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,989
- Please, my Lord...
- Say it. Say it!

362
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,473
I was wrong.

363
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,793
So, my brilliant...

364
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,232
My stroke of genius

365
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,519
didn't work.

366
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,197
And it's all your fault.

367
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,470
I should never have listened to you!

368
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,275
Everything that you have suggested
has been a disaster.

369
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,635
Look at what has happened. Get out of my sight.

370
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,918
Get out of my city. Now!

371
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,876
Please, my Lord. Please, I've always tried to help.

372
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,078
What do I do now?

373
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,954
Athaulf.

374
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,156
I was told you were wounded.

375
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,595
This is not my blood.

376
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,239
This is the blood of our soldiers.

377
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,075
The Emperor's word means nothing.

378
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,473
I say we go back to Rome and we destroy it.

379
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,433
No. We already have their gold.

380
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,350
Alaric. They have more gold back there,
much more, and the men want revenge.

381
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,392
You know this is about land. Not vengeance.

382
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,200
Without Roman recognition,
we will never be secure.

383
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,072
It's too late for that.

384
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,909
These are Romans, Alaric.
We are dirt under their feet.

385
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,600
They will never treat us as equals.
Why can't you see it?

386
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,633
The Emperor has betrayed us twice.
He cannot be allowed to get away with it.

387
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,035
You cannot allow it.

388
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,671
Otherwise our people will suspect you're weak.

389
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,555
That it's time for a new leader.

390
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,430
I'm their leader, Berig.

391
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,516
Then lead us.

392
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,950
There's another way to do this.

393
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,352
We will go back to Rome, but not to sack it.

394
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,353
We have to be clever, especially now.

395
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,269
If the Emperor doesn't value Rome,

396
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,833
let's see if Rome values its Emperor.

397
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,317
Why the truce?

398
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,399
What's he doing? Why doesn't he just
take what he wants and get it over with?

399
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,149
He's come to gloat. Size us up, like cuts of meat.

400
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,476
I want to talk to all of you inside now.

401
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,356
Your Emperor broke his word!

402
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,071
Tell me why I shouldn't burn this city
and kill every single person in it!

403
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,514
My men are begging for your blood!

404
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,595
But...

405
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,556
unlike your Emperor, I'm an honourable man.

406
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,396
How have you become so weak?

407
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,750
It's time to show this Emperor
what you think of him.

408
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,672
It's time for Rome to take control
of its own destiny again.

409
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,558
Choose from amongst yourselves a new leader.

410
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,479
A new emperor I can negotiate with.

411
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,356
An emperor who will enforce the promise
that was made to my people.

412
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,712
This is the man I suggest you choose.

413
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,633
<i>In the winter of 409 AD,</i>

414
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,355
<i>one of the most bizarre events
in Rome's history occurred.</i>

415
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,950
<i>The Senate turned against their own Emperor
and chose Attalus in his place.</i>

416
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,239
<i>All at the behest of a barbarian.</i>

417
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,469
Purple suits him, don't you think?

418
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,993
He's a fool.

419
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,071
He'll never have the authority to give us our land.

420
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,513
Attalus will deliver it without even trying.

421
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,872
All Honorius cares about is his own authority.

422
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,514
And a rival emperor? It weakens him.

423
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,317
Honorius will give us anything we ask for
to be rid of our new friend.

424
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,956
It's men like him who stood by and watched
while our people were murdered.

425
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,193
- Killed on these streets.
- I know.

426
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,469
But this is how we get what we want, Athaulf.
Trust me.

427
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,909
Is this what you always wanted?
To replace my brother?

428
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,918
I had no idea you were so happy
with your brother's policies.

429
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,828
- You enjoy watching people starve?
- You don't see it, do you?

430
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,151
- He's using you against my brother.
- No. You don't see it.

431
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,351
Alaric has agreed to remain outside the city
and his army's at my service.

432
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,839
Unlike your hopeless brother,
I will restore greatness to Rome.

433
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,030
- I cannot have you undermining me.
- What are you saying?

434
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,513
I shall issue my first Imperial command.

435
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,117
You are to be confined under guard to your villa.

436
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,355
I know it looks bleak, my Lord,
but this could be Alaric's first mistake.

437
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,519
How can it be a mistake?
Attalus and Rome have allied with the Goths.

438
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,033
Exactly. And as soon as the people see Attalus
for what he is, they'll turn against him.

439
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,477
I suggest we use Alaric's own tactic against them.

440
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,074
- What do you mean?
- I mean, my Lord,

441
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,078
that we may have to think the unthinkable.

442
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,318
Starve Rome.

443
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,079
- I've just tried to save them from starvation.
- I know that, my Lord, I know that.

444
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,398
We all have family there.
But this is a test of wills, my Lord.

445
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,991
Think. Who will follow Attalus
if he can't even feed his own people?

446
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,319
<i>Jovius' strategy was simple.
By the fifth century AD,</i>

447
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,514
<i>Rome had become almost entirely
dependant on grain shipped from North Africa.</i>

448
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,553
<i>So Honorius ordered those supplies
to be cut at source.</i>

449
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,271
<i>Within weeks, Romans once again began to starve.</i>

450
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,474
<i>Attalus'popularity collapsed.</i>

451
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,559
<i>In Rome's streets,
the rule of law started to crumble.</i>

452
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,036
Honorius is better advised than I expected.

453
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,150
Your plan's not working.

454
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,148
We're worse off than we were before.

455
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,917
Honorius will never recognise our claims now.

456
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,554
It's time to take this city.

457
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,556
We should have done it months ago
when we first saw it.

458
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,679
No one believes in your tactics anymore.

459
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,152
The voices against you are becoming deafening.

460
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,159
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
fighting and running.

461
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,753
Fighting and moving,
always looking over my shoulder. Do you?

462
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,348
What else can we do?

463
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,075
Our people want an end to this,
one way or another!

464
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,712
Let's take what we can from Rome.

465
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,070
Carve out a new homeland for ourselves
with our swords and their gold.

466
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,311
Alaric, the people chose you for your strength.

467
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,874
They're talking about Berig... as a leader.

468
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,558
Deal with it.

469
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,908
Now.

470
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,116
I've done nothing. Alaric is not fit to lead us!

471
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,273
You know that!

472
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,719
You know that.

473
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,749
If you give me 20,000 of your men,
under Roman command,

474
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,189
I can put together a fleet, sail to Africa

475
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,869
- and force the governor to reopen the trade...
- Shut up!

476
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,760
Stop trying to be clever.

477
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,358
I assure you, General,
I am trying to resolve this situation.

478
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,711
You! You're the most pathetic worm
I've ever encountered!

479
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,877
Just be quiet. You're no use!

480
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,672
I am the Emperor.

481
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,033
Get him out of here before I kick him to death!

482
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,673
Get off me!

483
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,435
You.

484
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,839
Take this to Honorius.

485
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,112
Tell him I grew tired of Attalus.

486
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,988
Tell him...

487
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,476
I will meet with him to discuss a fair settlement.

488
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,390
He can propose the terms.

489
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,158
But remind him...

490
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,113
my army remains at the gates of Rome.

491
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,276
If we don't come to an arrangement,
I'll sack the city.

492
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,273
I swear it.

493
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,275
Now go.

494
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,916
- So Alaric has had enough.
- Congratulations, my Lord.

495
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,591
Tell him I'll meet him.
He can come to us in Ravenna.

496
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,191
You cannot do that, my Lord.

497
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,676
Oh, really, Sarus? And what gives you the right?

498
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,032
I'm sorry, but I strongly advise against this.
Alaric is not to be trusted.

499
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,674
And why are you so certain of that?

500
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,749
He killed my family. Before.

501
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,593
Well, I'm afraid your past rivalries
are nothing to do with us, General.

502
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,995
And you serve the Emperor now.

503
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,675
My Lord, Alaric's Goths are still outside Rome.

504
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,349
We must give them some land,
but the least they'll accept. Not an inch more.

505
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,439
Yes. I want this over and done with.

506
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,119
Thank you.

507
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,038
<i>In the summer of 410 AD,</i>

508
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,948
<i>Alaric and a small bodyguard
set off to sign a final treaty.</i>

509
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,636
<i>After two years of conflict,
it seemed at last the King of the Goths</i>

510
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,228
<i>and the Emperor would meet in peace.</i>

511
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,068
Sarus.

512
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,551
That bastard, Sarus.

513
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,074
The Emperor has betrayed us again.

514
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,716
<i>And so it was, nearly two years
after their arrival at the gates of Rome,</i>

515
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,674
<i>Alaric's barbarian army finally fell upon the city.</i>

516
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,956
God have mercy on our souls.

517
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>What we know from sources</i>

518
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,360
<i>suggest that the gates were opened to the Goths
by some of Rome's own citizens.</i>

519
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,199
<i>They wished to be spared further agony.</i>

520
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,477
<i>It was a forlorn hope.</i>

521
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,990
Don't burn the churches! Leave the churches!

522
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,078
Leave her.

523
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,917
I said, leave her!

524
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,116
She's a valuable hostage.

525
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,073
My apologies.

526
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,556
You'll be treated with respect, I give you my word.

527
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,192
It's over, Alaric. You've won.

528
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,670
Is this what we set out for?

529
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,953
No. But this is better than nothing.

530
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,072
We'll get our land.

531
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,472
And we still have something to bargain with.

532
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,076
Let's get going. Tell the men we head south.

533
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,472
What have I done?

534
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,236
You've done nothing, my Lord. It wasn't your fault.

535
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,039
Done nothing.

536
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,157
That's right, isn't it?

537
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,674
Nothing.

538
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,915
We were betrayed. Sarus sent his troops.
They ambushed Alaric.

539
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,752
Sarus couldn't stand us negotiating with him.

540
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,031
Olympius was right.

541
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,754
Barbarians are all beasts.

542
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,594
Animals.

543
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,955
Find Sarus. I want Sarus!

544
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,879
He's disappeared, my Lord. I'm sorry.

545
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,033
I wanted peace.

546
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,356
I was ready for peace.

547
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,030
How will I be remembered now?

548
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,589
<i>Honorius remained Emperor
for a further 13 years.</i>

549
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,158
<i>He died childless and vilified
for his role in Rome's decline.</i>

550
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,196
<i>Alaric died Just four months
after the sack of Rome.</i>

551
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,433
<i>He went to his death tormented by his failure
to find a safe haven for his people.</i>

552
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:53,035
<i>Athaulf succeeded Alaric and four years later,
he married Galla Placidia.</i>

553
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,194
<i>It was an astonishing alliance,</i>

554
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,071
<i>but there is no evidence that it wasn't for love.</i>

555
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,193
<i>After eight further years of wandering,</i>

556
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,471
<i>Alaric's successors finally achieved his dream.</i>

557
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,431
<i>A secure new homeland
in what is now western France.</i>

558
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,473
<i>The kingdom of the Visigoths.</i>

559
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,319
<i>Alaric's sack of Rome
was not the end of the Roman Empire,</i>

560
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,908
<i>but it was the beginning of the end.</i>

561
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,669
<i>The same factors that weakened Honorius,</i>

562
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,591
<i>poor leadership, the loss of territory and revenue,
finally overwhelmed it.</i>

563
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,358
<i>In 476 A D, the last Roman emperor
in the west was deposed.</i>

564
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,311
<i>In the east,
the Empire continued in a different form.</i>

565
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,715
<i>Its capital, Constantinople.</i>

566
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,428
<i>But the glory that was ancient Rome,</i>

567
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,952
<i>a superpower legendary for its brilliance,</i>

568
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,758
<i>and its brutality,</i>

569
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,518
<i>for its madness,</i>

570
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,957
<i>and for its beliefs,</i>

571
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,834
<i>that was finished.</i>
