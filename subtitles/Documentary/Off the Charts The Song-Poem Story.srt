1
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,640
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

2
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Hey, look, what is this, a picnic?
Come on. Let's go, man.
We got ten minutes to go.

3
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,280
- Punch me out, man.
- You got it.

4
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Any word from the LAPD intelligence,
if there is such a thing?

5
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,720
- Not yet, sir.
- Of course not.

6
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,560
Because we're a covert
anti-terrorism team that is so secret...

7
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,560
that when we snap our fingers
nothin' happens!

8
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,840
Sheriff's department?
Airport police?

9
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Still waiting. But lnterpol
insists he's in Tripoli.

10
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,160
Yeah, well, you-you trust-- You trust
that billion-dollar satellite, okay?

11
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
l'll trust a ten-dollar snitch
at this point.

12
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,400
- Sean, look--
- What?

13
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Why don't you just give 'em
a little break, okay?

14
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,880
We'll take a break
when the case breaks, okay?

15
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Hallelujah

16
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,480
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

17
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,400
Hallelujah

18
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,000
Hallelujah, hallelujah

19
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,080
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

20
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelujah

21
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,920
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

22
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelu-- Hallelu-- Hallelujah

23
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,440
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

24
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Hallelujah

25
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,440
- And he shall reign for ever and ever
- l never really enjoyed The Messiah.

26
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
- ln fact, l think it's fucking boring.
- And he shall reign for ever and ever

27
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,480
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

28
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,120
Hallelujah, hallelujah

29
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Hallelujah, hallelujah

30
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,480
Hallelujah

31
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Hallelujah, hallelujah

32
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Hallelujah

33
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,880
Victor-- When we--
When we put this thing to bed,

34
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,320
y-you can brand
the Fourth Amendment on my butt.

35
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,840
- Thank you.
- Sir, excuse me.
Your wife is on line one.

36
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Sean! A jet was just chartered.
Anderson Airfield.

37
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Guess who paid the bill in cash?
Pollux Troy.

38
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,960
- Put one of our people on that plane.
- Wait! We still got no sign of Castor!

39
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,920
Pollux doesn't fly without
Big Brother. Now come on!

40
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,680
You're 26 minutes late.
The casing didn't fit, right?

41
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,560
Yeah, l told you goddam Dietrich
would try to pawn off some...

42
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,680
cheap-shit North Korean plastic.

43
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
Casing fit like a condom.

44
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
You didn't deviate
from the plan, did you, Pollux?

45
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
Well, how long did you want me
to sit here twiddling my thumbs?

46
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,480
l paid for the jet.
Save us some time.

47
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,880
That's what the boys are for,
to hide our famous faces.

48
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
lf l didn't love you so damn
much, l'd have to kill you, bro.

49
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,080
l hate it when you
call me bro.

50
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,680
You guys are paid
to protect him from everybody,

51
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,960
including himself.

52
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,480
And stay away from downtown on the 18th.
lt's gonna be a little, um, smoggy.

53
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay, my passengers are here.
l gotta go.

54
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,280
Let's go. Let's go.
l'm bored. Let's go.

55
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
- Here you go.
- Bravo.

56
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Would you like anything else
once we're airborne?

57
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
Oh, a peach.

58
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Sit. Come here.

59
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,360
You know, l can, uh,
eat a peach for hours.

60
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,480
Um, come here.

61
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,000
lf l were to send you flowers,
where would l, uh--

62
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,520
No, wait. Let me rephrase.

63
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,840
lf l were to let you
suck my tongue,

64
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,840
would you be grateful?

65
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
There's someone on the runway.

66
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Get off of me!

67
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,200
- Archer.
- FBl!

68
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,520
This is a very big gun.
Fly the fuckin' plane!

69
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,600
Come on. That's it.

70
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,880
- Come on. Let's go!
- Goddam it. Don't play chicken
with a goddam jet!

71
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
Come on.

72
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,240
- He's got Winters! Goddam it!
- Damn it, Sean!

73
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,840
All units, pin 'em in!

74
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,720
Close in on 'em!

75
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,080
One of yours, Sean?

76
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
Shit!

77
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,880
Out. Come on. Go, go!

78
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Goddam it, Sean!

79
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,360
Take off now.

80
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,200
- Fly!
- l can't!

81
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
Fly, bitch!

82
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,120
All units, locked and ready.
Follow Archer's lead.

83
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,560
What the fuck are you doing?

84
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
There's an engine out.
We gotta stop.

85
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
- Move, move, move!
- Get back! Back up!

86
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,680
Pollux!

87
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
- Cas!
- Get over here.

88
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,480
Back him to me.
Back him to me. He's mine!

89
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
Cas.

90
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,000
Secure the hangar.

91
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Berkley, down!

92
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Down!

93
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,400
Give up, Castor. Your time's up.

94
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,800
Well, you better hit me, Sean,
'cause you only got one bullet left.

95
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,520
So do you.

96
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,120
Wow. We've got
something in common.

97
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,440
We both know our guns.

98
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,160
What we don't have in common is that
l don't care if l live, and you do.

99
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,000
Sean, that hurts.

100
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,560
You're not having
any fun, are you, Sean?

101
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,280
Why don't you come with us?
Try terrorism for hire?

102
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,840
- We'll blow some shit up.
lt's more fun.
- Shut the fuck up.

103
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,440
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

104
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,600
l'm about to unleash
the biblical plague "Hell-A" deserves,

105
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,200
but l'll give this shithole
a break if my brother and l walk.

106
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,400
- Bullshit.
- Oh-Oh no, l-l see, l see.
Y-You think l'm bluffing.

107
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Maybe l am.
But, then, maybe l'm not.

108
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,120
More importantly, what would
you do with me locked up?

109
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,400
You'd drive your wife
and kid crazy.

110
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Say, how is your daughter,
anyway? ls she ripening by now?

111
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Your-- Your darling Janie,
your little peach?

112
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
ls she ripe?

113
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay.

114
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,520
O-Okay.

115
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,760
Policeman, don't shoot me.

116
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,480
l'm scared, Seanie!

117
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
Well, l think you better pull
the trigger,

118
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
because l don't give a fuck!

119
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,760
l'm ready

120
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,520
Ready for the big ride, baby

121
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,560
Well, Sean, looks like
Elvis done left the buildin'.

122
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,280
lt wasn't my fault.
Why won't you ever be on my side?

123
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,520
l am always on your side,
but you have to give me a chance--

124
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,840
Now what?

125
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,840
She was suspended again. Some kid
made a crack about her clothes--

126
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
- She started a fight.
- That's right, Dad.
Don't even ask me what happened.

127
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,560
Okay. What happened?

128
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,040
- Ah, l see.
- Not like you would believe me anyway.

129
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
Jamie, look,
it-it-it's not easy, okay?

130
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
l mean, loo-- You change the way
you look every week.

131
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
And-And the way you act.
Who are you supposed to be now?

132
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
l'm supposed to be me.

133
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,960
Not like you have a clue
who l am anyway.

134
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,840
l have to work tonight.

135
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,680
l called to tell you,
but l was on hold for ten minutes,
and l couldn't wait any longer.

136
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,840
l got him, Eve.

137
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,920
lt's over.

138
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,920
lt's over.

139
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
Oh, Sean.

140
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,640
l'll make it up to you
and Jamie. l promise.

141
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
l'll put in for a desk job--
Well, l'll-- l'll do counselling,
sit down, talk about Mike--

142
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,000
l'll do it, anything you want.

143
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,640
l just want you.

144
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,400
Well, good, 'cause that's
what you're gonna get.

145
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,320
You happy?

146
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,560
Yes. Yeah.

147
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,640
What is all this?

148
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,480
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

149
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,600
l didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

150
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
No, wait.

151
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,080
How about, uh--

152
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,800
What about to Anderson,
Montgomery,

153
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,000
Berkley,

154
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,080
Pincus, Gianelli, Winters--

155
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
How's Loomis?

156
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,120
Uh, he's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh,

157
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,960
he'll be okay.

158
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,960
- What's up?
- Special ops. They want a word.

159
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Aw, forget it.
l don't have the time.

160
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,040
Better make time, Sean.

161
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,360
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

162
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

163
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,160
Porcelain casing.

164
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,080
Thermal cloak.

165
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,080
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

166
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
lt's enough to flatten
a square mile.

167
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,880
Then depending on
the prevailing winds,

168
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,760
the fallout'll be a tad worse
than Gulf War syndrome.

169
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,200
A biblical--
A biblical plague to LA.

170
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,360
Where is he?
Where is Pollux Troy?

171
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,640
Why draw the schematic if you're
not gonna build the bomb?

172
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,520
What, is it now a crime
in this country to exercise the mind?

173
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,600
- l'm interested in bomb--
- l won't say another word
until l see my brother.

174
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,680
Any progress?

175
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
- l need about ten minutes alone
with this guy.
- Ah, give it a rest.

176
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,720
You got Castor. Just go home.

177
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,040
Look, we're not gonna evacuate
the city on your hunch.

178
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,040
Look, l know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

179
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,960
You know what, just-just run
the goddam bureau any way you like.

180
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,280
l could put an agent in his cell.
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

181
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

182
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,400
The only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is his brother, and he's dead.

183
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,320
There is one other possibility.

184
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, God.
You're keeping him alive.

185
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Relax, Archer. He's a turnip.

186
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,720
Oh.

187
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,040
What if you could walk
into Erewhon Prison...

188
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,240
and give Pollux a nice, big
brotherly hug as Castor Troy?

189
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,040
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

190
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,360
Let me try. Malcolm Walsh.

191
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,960
- l run the bio-cover unit
for special ops.
- l know who you are.

192
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,400
- But you don't know what l can do.
- Uh--

193
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,360
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

194
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,440
Dr Walsh can alter the likeness,
even the voice of a government witness.

195
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,440
l think you'll recognize
this patient.

196
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,120
We had to build your friend Loomis
a whole new ear from scratch.

197
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,480
What we're suggesting for you, Archer,
isn't a permanent transplant like that,

198
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
just a temporary trade.

199
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,320
Come here.

200
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,720
With the new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

201
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,960
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

202
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,840
Height difference is negligible.

203
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,160
Skin pigment, eye pigment:
both almost identical.

204
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,400
We'll use laser shears for the hairline,
microplugs for body hair.

205
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,160
We'll do an abdominoplasti--
take care of those, uh, love handles.

206
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,040
But all that's the easy part.
Here's the real science.

207
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,440
This is a state-of-the-art,
morphogenetic template.

208
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
The inside is modeled
on your skull,

209
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,040
the outside exactly like Troy's.

210
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,880
Then we fit his face on top.
Not a replica, but the real thing.

211
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,640
Then we simply connect the muscles,
tear ducts and nerve endings.

212
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,640
- So, you wanna take his face and mine--
- Borrow.

213
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
The procedure's
completely reversible.

214
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
Y-You think that l want
to do this?

215
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,160
- No. No.
- There's no one else, Sean.

216
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,560
- No!
- You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

217
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,640
l'll get his gang to talk.
That's what l do.

218
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,560
What if you can't? The bomb will blow,
and Castor Troy will win.

219
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,840
Get out. Go ahead.
Wipe your ass.

220
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,840
Damn, what the hell is
that smell?

221
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,560
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

222
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,360
Hello, Sasha. When was the last
time you saw Castor Troy?

223
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
- Who cares? He's dead.
- Answer the question.

224
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,200
l know my rights. l don't have
to answer shit.

225
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
You're right, but know this:

226
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,640
You're a convicted felon on probation
for harbouring Castor Troy.

227
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,160
One phone call from me, and your son
will end up in a foster home.

228
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,200
l understand why
you would use such a threat.

229
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,920
But you try to take him away
from me, l swear to you--

230
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,120
l haven't seen him for years.

231
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,920
This reeks of you. lt's got
your signature all over it.

232
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,560
Maybe, but you ain't got nothin'
on me and you know it.

233
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,560
Maybe so, but l can keep you
within city limits,

234
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
or l can talk
to your sister again.

235
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,440
She's right outside.

236
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
Only this time l'll be nice.

237
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,640
Hey, Sean,

238
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,960
how's your dead son?

239
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,800
l don't know any--
Okay, okay, l heard somethin'
about the 18th, but that's all l know.

240
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Great. So we got a date.
Now where the hell's the damn bomb?

241
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,320
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

242
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,800
lt's your call, Sean.

243
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,920
- Does Lazarro know your plan?
- No, this is a black bag operation.

244
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,600
Strictly off the books. You can't tell
Lazarro, and you can't tell your wife.

245
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,080
Oh, God.

246
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,720
What are you asking me to do?
Okay, let's see.

247
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,320
You're asking me to--
to break the law,

248
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,080
risk my neck.

249
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,160
And you're asking me to put
in the dark all the people...

250
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
that love me...

251
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
and trust me.

252
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,160
l'll do it.

253
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,160
Sean.

254
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,040
Sorry l woke you.

255
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,520
l'm glad it's you that woke me.

256
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,320
And not a phone call telling me
you won't be coming home.

257
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,600
But that's a fear l can
finally let go of, huh?

258
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,520
Oh, it's all right, Sean.
lt's okay.

259
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,800
l keep--

260
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,880
l keep wanting to move this...

261
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
over here, you know?

262
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,840
lf it had only been an--
an inch to the left,

263
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,280
Mikey'd be alive.

264
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,720
And you wouldn't be.

265
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
Sean, things are gonna get
better now that you're home.

266
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,960
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

267
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,320
Everything will be better
now that he is forever out of our lives.

268
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,720
Eve, if l told you
that l realize that--

269
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
that this thing
won't fully end...

270
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,160
u-until l did one last thing--

271
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,120
Eve, something vital.

272
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,360
Okay-- l-- You're going
back on assignment again.

273
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
This one last time.

274
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,240
Come on, Eve.

275
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,600
"l'm going anywhere,"
that's what you told me.

276
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh.

277
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,440
You don't need me to tell you
what to do, Sean. You never have. So go.

278
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,680
But go now.

279
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,200
Sean, l changed my mind.
This is a suicide mission.

280
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
Yeah, l know, l know.

281
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,600
You know, maybe this, uh--
this doctor-- if he-- if he--

282
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,000
lf he can do even half
of what he says he can do,

283
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,000
maybe it'll work, l don't know.

284
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,560
l'd become Castor Troy,
be in control.

285
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,960
That's the part that scares me.

286
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,120
Doctor, l have, uh, something--

287
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
l have this scar-- that-- that--

288
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,080
that if you can p-put this back
after, after all this is over--

289
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,360
lt-- lt's important to me.
lt's-- lt's like a reminder.

290
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,840
Sure.

291
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,760
Tito, please,
hold this for me. Please.

292
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,400
Okay. Let's go.

293
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,160
Oh, G--

294
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,200
Oh, my God.

295
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Hey, you okay? Come on.
Talk to me, Sean.

296
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,960
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

297
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
- Sean! Sean!
- Fuck you!

298
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,840
Sean, come on. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Sean! Sean! Archer!

300
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,960
You're Sean Archer.

301
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,920
Sean Archer. Sean Archer.

302
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,200
When this is over,
l want you to take this face...

303
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,520
and burn it.

304
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,440
Hey. l still
sound like me.

305
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,480
l've implanted a microchip
on your larynx. lt's fantastic,
but you'll have to be careful.

306
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,280
Pressure, sharp blow,
even a violent sneeze could dislodge it.

307
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,240
- Just repeat what you hear.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

308
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,520
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

309
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
There's a scratchy tickle.

310
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,680
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

311
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,560
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

312
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,080
- Once again.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

313
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,480
- Perfect.
- Now, Sean, six days until the 18th.

314
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,600
The clock's ticking,
and so is the bomb.

315
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,240
You got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

316
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,920
Either way, Miller comes in,
pulls you out. You got me?

317
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,840
- What's the matter?
- Face itches.

318
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,880
You all right?
Come on. Let's go.

319
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,240
Archer's gonna be pissed when he comes
back from his training op and finds out.

320
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

321
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
You are now the property
of Erewhon Prison,

322
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,920
a citizen of nowhere.

323
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,000
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

324
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,160
Amnesty lnternational
doesn't know we exist.

325
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,440
When l say
your ass belongs to me,

326
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,800
l mean exactly that.

327
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,880
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

328
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
The boots tell us where you are.

329
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,480
621 to Population!

330
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,920
H-H-Hey, what's the matter, pal?
Don't you remember the little people?

331
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,320
- Burke Hicks.
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,320
l bust--

333
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,320
believe Sean Archer busted you
for stalkin' the UN Secretary General.

334
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,120
Oh, no. Archer framed me.
l ain't had nothin' to do with that.

335
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,400
No-- Word was you got wasted.

336
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,280
You wanna see what wasted
looks like, little man?

337
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,240
Pollux.

338
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,040
Yeah!

339
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,240
Out of the way. Central,
there's a disturbance in the population.

340
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,960
- Go to lockdown.
- Hold that lockdown.

341
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,120
Come on, you pussy!

342
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,600
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

343
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,400
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

344
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,320
'Cause l'm Castor Troy! Yeah!

345
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,560
l'm Castor Troy!

346
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,760
- Castor! Castor!
- l'm Castor Troy!

347
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Yeah! Yeah!

348
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,640
Yeah!

349
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,120
Lock 'em down.

350
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,920
l stop the fights, not you.

351
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,920
That's two strikes for you, Dubov.
One more, you know where you're goin'.

352
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,880
- When l get out of here--
- lf you get out of here--

353
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,520
l'm gonna have you fired.

354
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,040
Lars, it's me.

355
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Believe it.

356
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,640
Someone--

357
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,360
They took-- switched my-- wh--

358
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,560
F-- Some fucking--

359
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,000
But it's cool.
We're gonna deal with it.

360
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, yes, we're gonna deal
with it.

361
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,480
- What's this about?
- Dr Walsh.

362
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,680
l was just, uh, enjoying some
of your greatest hits here.

363
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,600
Oh-Oh, l hope you don't mind.
l-l, uh, l partook...

364
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,480
of your groovy, uh--
your groovy painkillers.

365
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,360
You know, this is fabulous work.
This is-- This is-- Oh, bravo.

366
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,520
Bra-fucking-vo.

367
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,520
Oh, God. This is excellent.
Bravo.

368
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,000
- Bravo.
- What do you want?

369
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,240
Take one goddam guess.

370
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,480
l wish they'd play some of those
salmon spawning scenes again.
l found them intensely erotic.

371
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,040
Fuckin' nature channel.

372
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,680
One more waterfall,
l'm gonna foam at the mouth.

373
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,960
lt's like
they're begging us to riot.

374
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,880
Excuse me.

375
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,320
Not feeling very coordinated
lately, are you?

376
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,280
Look, bro, you gotta help me.

377
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,160
l am so fried.

378
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,520
lf the psychos in here
find out l'm misfiring,
we're both gonna be dead meat.

379
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,840
Shock treatment?
What's the matter with you?

380
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Did they operate?

381
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,640
l was in a coma. Jesus, you're
still so fuckin' paranoid.

382
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,560
Aren't they giving you
your medication in here?

383
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,120
What was my medication?

384
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,560
Pollux, l hand-fed you
those pills for years.

385
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,520
Vivex. l haven't forgotten that.

386
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,360
lt's just everything else.
lt's--

387
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,240
senses, my reflexes, my memory.

388
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,880
lt's like a tab of bad Quantrex.

389
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,200
l don't even know why that fucking Yeti
jumped me yesterday.

390
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,440
Dubov?

391
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,520
You had a sex sandwich with his wife and
his sister the night he was sent here.

392
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,400
l guess that explains
why he's so upset.

393
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,400
Wow.

394
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,920
We're gonna blow up LA, bro.
Ain't it cool?

395
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,480
Oh, right. Rub my nose
in it, why don't you?

396
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,840
$10 million design, and now those
militia nutjobs get to keep their cash.

397
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
lt's so fucking unfair.

398
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,080
That bomb you built
does deserve an audience.

399
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
lt's a work of art.

400
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,800
lt belongs in the Louvre.

401
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,720
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

402
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,880
l guess the LA Convention
Centre'll have to do.

403
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,560
- What?
- Thank you.

404
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
For what?

405
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,280
You are so fucking pathetic.

406
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,440
You got a visitor.

407
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,720
Ooh-wee, you good-lookin'.
You're hot!

408
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,680
lt's like looking
in a mirror, only not.

409
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,360
- Troy?
- Now that is between us, okay?

410
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,880
- But you were--
- ln a coma?

411
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,320
Nothing like having your face
cut off to disturb your sleep.
Read the newspaper lately?

412
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,560
- You killed them?
- Well, beats paying the bill, huh?

413
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,200
Come on. l mean, uh, if
a face-lift costs five grand--

414
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,880
See anything you like?

415
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,960
Tito.

416
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,320
l torched all the evidence
that proves you're you, okay?

417
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,080
So, wow, looks like you're gonna be
in here for the next hundred years!

418
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,800
Now, l have got to go.

419
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,120
l've got a government job to
abuse and a lonely wife to fuck.

420
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,680
Oh, did l say that?
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't say that.

421
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,880
Make love to.

422
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,600
Oh, God, l miss that face.

423
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,000
Die!

424
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,040
Die!

425
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,680
- Sorry, Agent Archer.
- No, don't you worry about it,
Mr Walton.

426
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,960
Clearly he's, uh, had
a traumatic childhood,

427
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,440
and, uh, thank you.

428
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,040
What's givin' you the will
to live is lookin' for revenge

429
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,360
Look at this place. l'm in hell.

430
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,080
l may never get
a hard-on again.

431
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,520
Don't lose your head

432
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,720
Oh, yes.

433
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,920
There we go.

434
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,960
Well, l suppose it was only a matter of
time before you forgot where we lived.

435
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,280
Come on. Give me a break.

436
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,400
Every house in this block looks
the same. Then l spotted you.

437
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,480
Eve.

438
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,160
My one and only Eve.

439
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,840
So how was your
vital assignment?

440
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,480
Which one was that?

441
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,480
How should l know, Sean?

442
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,560
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yes. The, um--
the out of body experience.

443
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,760
Yes. That one.

444
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,840
- Where you goin'?
- To the hospital.

445
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,200
- No. No. What's the matter?
- Sean, come on.

446
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,240
- Oh, what?
- Quit teasing me. Stop it.
l'm still really hurt, okay?

447
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,360
- There are leftovers in the fridge.
- No, no.

448
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,000
l want to stay hungry
for you, my peach.

449
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,240
- Give me that tongue.
- Sean, come on.

450
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,000
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What does Evie want?

451
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,440
Eve, l hate to see you go,
but l love to watch you leave.

452
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,920
"Date night fizzled again.

453
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,680
We haven't made love
in two months."

454
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,560
What a loser.

455
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,680
Come here, sister

456
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,280
- Papa's in the swing
- Got your E-mail, Karl.

457
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,360
- The poem you sent me was pretty kinky.
- He ain't too hip

458
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,000
About that new-breed babe

459
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,640
- The plot thickens.
- He ain't no drag

460
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,200
- Papa's got a brand new bag
- Hang on a second.

461
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,920
- Come here, Mama
- l'll have to call you back.

462
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,320
- And dig this crazy scene
- You're not respecting my boundaries.

463
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,120
- l'm coming in, Janie.
- He's not too fancy
- Janie?

464
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,200
- But this line is pretty clean
- l don't think you heard me, Jamie.

465
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,240
- He ain't no drag
- You got something that l crave.

466
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,960
Papa's got a brand new bag

467
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,160
He's doin' the jerk
He's doin' the fly

468
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,560
- Don't play him cheap
'cause you know he ain't shy
- Clarissa left those here.

469
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,400
- Well, l won't tell Mom
if you don't.
- He's doin' the Monkey

470
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,360
- The Mashed Potato, Jump-back Jack
- When did you start smoking?

471
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,920
- See you later, alligator
- You'll be seeing a lot
of changes around here.

472
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,160
- Papa's in the swing
- Papa's got a brand new bag. Ow!

473
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,080
He ain't too hip now

474
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,120
- But l can dig that new breed
- l can do the j-- do the s--

475
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,560
He's doin' the twist
just like this

476
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,240
Bye, bro.
Drop me a line sometime.

477
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,800
Gonna be kind of lonely
with Pollux gone, huh?

478
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,880
Po-- Pollux what?

479
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,040
That big-shit cop, Archer, cut him
a deal for turnin' state's evidence.

480
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,960
Your brother's been released.

481
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,680
l'm Sean Archer. There is a bomb
at the LA Convention Centre.

482
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,160
l'm Sean Archer and-- Ow!

483
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,400
Tiramisu, tiramisu

484
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,520
- Sir, we just wanted you to know--
- We're all really sorry about Tito.

485
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,240
Oh, hey, shit happens, you know?

486
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,960
So is our star witness talking?

487
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,800
Yeah. About what kind of mustard
he likes on his tongue sandwiches.

488
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,640
lf that bomb is out there,
we're almost out of time.

489
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,680
Archer!

490
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,760
You made the deal with Pollux Troy.
That isn't like you.

491
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,360
Well, when all else fails,
fresh tactics.

492
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,320
Fresh? Well, let me tell you
my fresh tactic.

493
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,960
From now on everything to do with
this case goes through me, understood?

494
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,400
Good. Thanks.

495
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,560
You're supposed to be snitching
and making me look good.

496
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,760
- Look good?
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,160
Seeing that face on you makes me afraid
my tiramisu might come back up.

498
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,160
Well, think about me. This nose.
This hair. This ridiculous chin.

499
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,880
Brother, we're going straight.

500
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,840
Oh, my goodness. Did you
exchange brains as well?

501
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,800
The first thing l need you to confess to
is the location of the bomb.

502
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,760
What about our $10 million?

503
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,720
What about when l become
an American hero for defusing
the bomb? What's that worth?

504
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,120
Know that. Thank you.
Next question.

505
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,360
- You're not the only one
in the family with brains.
- No.

506
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,160
- Although now l am
the only one with the looks.
- Touche.

507
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,560
This is an emergency evacuation.

508
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,440
This is an emergency evacuation.

509
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,160
Let's go. Police. Go! Go!

510
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,680
- Any ideas?
- Yeah, run.

511
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,040
Sir, it's protected by a tamper switch,
and it'll take us hours to bypass.

512
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,760
- Evacuate your team, Captain.
- No, but, sir, we can't--
we can't disarm.

513
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,680
Leave.

514
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,280
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

515
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,520
Hallelujah

516
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,640
Ha-Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

517
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,880
Oh, baby. Oh--

518
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,040
That was the scene
at the LA Convention Centre,

519
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,080
where an FBl agent became
a city saviour.

520
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,720
Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just
one second before it was set to blow.

521
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,320
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices
scheduled to speak here today...

522
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,400
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

523
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,080
We asked Agent Archer if the FBl had
any leads on who planted the device.

524
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,720
Well, that is, uh,
classified information.

525
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,800
But if he-- lf he's listening,
l wouldn't mind giving him a message:

526
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,960
lnterception. Now our side's got
the ball. Sorry.

527
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,920
Wanda? Everybody.

528
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:11,600
Hey, look, l--
l wanna thank you for, uh,

529
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:17,000
enduring all these years
that l was an insufferable bore.

530
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,720
Sir, did you just have
a surgical procedure?

531
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,240
- What do you mean?
- Well, was the stick...

532
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,040
successfully removed
from your ass?

533
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,280
Sir. The White House on one.

534
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,880
lt's the president.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

535
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,400
- Well, you tell the president to hold.
- Okay.

536
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,160
- l got it.
- Sean, you scared the hell out of me.

537
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,000
- lt's date night.
- Oh, my God.

538
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,480
Oh, congratulations.

539
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,840
Oh, big deal.

540
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,280
Okay, l said, uh,
"Mr President,

541
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,000
"l want the authority...

542
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,400
"and l want the funds
and the personnel...

543
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,520
to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism," right?

544
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,960
And he said, "The next name
on my calling list is Lazarro,

545
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,400
and l'm telling him that Sean Archer
writes his own ticket," okay?

546
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,240
What's the matter?

547
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,360
l-- l don't know, Sean.
You just--

548
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,240
You just seem so different.
l mean, what is th-- all this about?

549
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,720
What-- This intimate
candlelight dinner? Huh?

550
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,000
And l'm supposed to forget
all the promises 'cause
you're going back into the fray?

551
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,120
lf the top cop in this country
can't come home...

552
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,000
every night to his wife,
then the hell with the country.

553
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,000
Because the only place
l'm going is upstairs with you.

554
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,960
Exercise. One hour.

555
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,120
How can l get out of here?

556
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,160
You can't.

557
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,040
How can l get these boots off?

558
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,320
They only take 'em off
in the clinic.

559
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,640
Right before
they fry your skull.

560
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,880
Hey.

561
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,080
- l'm out of cigarettes.
- Get back in line, Troy.

562
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,000
l said l'm out of cigarettes.

563
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,480
Kick his ass!

564
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,880
Hey, what the hell!
That's not right!

565
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,720
l need a light! l need a light!

566
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
- Anybody got a light?
- All right!

567
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,320
Anybody got a light?
Got a light?

568
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,040
You better bring the bastard down
before he chokes himself to death.

569
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,920
Well, happy day,
it's Castor Troy.

570
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,600
Wait. H-Hold it, hold it.
Can l, uh-- Can l have a light?

571
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,800
You know, those things'll kill you.

572
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,560
Get his boots, Walton.

573
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,240
Dubov, l didn't touch your wife.

574
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,600
And l didn't touch your sister.

575
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,240
But l know your wife loves you,
is waiting for you.

576
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,560
So let's get out of here.

577
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
You're more brain-dead than Dubov.

578
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,720
- Out.
- Out.

579
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,360
- Get him!
- Grab his arms!

580
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Look out!

581
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,840
Shots have been fired.
We have men down in C-4.

582
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,360
- l got 'em.
- Throw 'em down!

583
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,720
Move!

584
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,280
Get down!

585
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,960
Dubov! No!

586
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,440
Get out.

587
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,000
Dubov!

588
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,200
Now, give me your hand.

589
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,480
Come on.

590
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,000
You can do it.

591
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,760
No!

592
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,000
No. No.

593
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,880
No!

594
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,360
Sean! Wait!

595
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,200
- What are you doing?
- Uh, l'm sorry.

596
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,400
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day?

597
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,800
What is with you? ls this your way
of just not dealing with this morning?

598
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,840
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

599
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,520
Sean! Sean!

600
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,400
l know it's hard for you, but it's hard
for me too, and we still have to go.

601
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,200
Happy birthday, Mikey.

602
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,400
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.

603
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,440
You turned your beeper off.

604
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,120
Yes, well-- my son's birthday.

605
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,520
Well, uh, here's
some poetic justice, sir.

606
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,360
- Castor Troy is dead.
- He got killed trying to escape
from Erewhon.

607
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,680
Where's his body?
l-l wanna see his body.

608
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,400
- lt hasn't been recovered yet.
- lt hasn't been recovered yet?

609
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,040
Get the LAPD on this!

610
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,360
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't
stupid enough to come back to the city.

611
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,440
You must-- You must trust me.
He's already here.

612
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,680
County General.
How may l direct your call?

613

Dr Archer, please.
lt's an emergency.

614
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,120
- May l say who's calling?
- Her husband.

615
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,920
Dr Archer, call on line three.

616
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,680

but-- Shit!

617
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,680
- Sean?
- Eve, listen carefully.

618
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,160
The man you think is
your husband isn't.

619
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,440
- Who is this?
- Please, just listen.

620
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,680
Take Jamie. Go to your mother's. Don't
tell him where you're going, just go.

621
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,640
Uh, whoever you are,
don't call again.

622
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,360
- Operations.
- l need Victor Lazarro immediately.

623
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,120
- Regarding?
- l have information about Castor Troy.

624
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,600
l'll transfer you, sir.

625
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,280
Sean Archer here. Who's calling?

626
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,040
Well, if you're Sean Archer,
l guess l'm Castor Troy.

627
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,440
Ah, yes.

628
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,760
This escaped convict is
considered extremely dangerous.

629
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,720
lf you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of Castor Troy--

630
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,120
You goddam right. Yeah!

631
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,240
This shit's so good,
gonna make your dick hard.

632
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,200
Huh? Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.

633
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,280
Dietrich.

634
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,960
So you're still selling hops
and drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy.

635
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,480
Castor fucking Troy!

636
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,120
Aw, man. You scared me, man!

637
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,920
All right. All right.

638
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,160
You know, l never should've sold
you those bombs. lt's my curse.
l can't say no to a friend.

639
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,200
- You can't say no to money.
- Yeah, that's my other curse.

640
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,440
- You drug dealer.
- What's the matter?

641
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,440
- What?
- You look like you just fucked
your mother. Come on.

642
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,240
Let's go relax, huh?

643
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,640
Hey!

644
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,920
- Hey, Castor.
- Oh, Castor Troy!

645
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,720
l don't believe this.
Castor Troy!

646
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,920
What are you doing?

647
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,360
Wanna hit?

648
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,280
Hey, baby. Remember me?
l'm your favourite peach.

649
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,240
Oh, l thought
l was your favourite.

650
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,560
- You make me crazy
- Look at this guy.

651
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,040
You know, you look pretty good
for a dead guy.

652
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,320
Hey!

653
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,200
- Mescal.
- Two?
- Yeah.

654
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,560
So what do you wanna do?

655
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,560
You wanna get out
of the country?

656
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,520
l'm not going anywhere.
l'm gonna get Sean Archer.

657
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,080
With your help.

658
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,440
Okay.

659
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,200
Welcome home, baby.

660
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,600
How we supposed to do that?

661
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,600
He's vulnerable at home.

662
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,640
No. l mean, this is
Sean Archer we're talkin' about.

663
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,200
- This isn't just some Boy Scout.
- Fitch.

664
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,560
No. Besides, his house is
probably alarmed up the wazoo.

665
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,720
The code is 10-19-86.

666
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,280
That's his dead son's birthday.

667
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,880
Don't it just break your heart?

668
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,880
- That's brilliant.
- That's sick.

669
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,120
How is it that you know
so much about Sean Archer?

670
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,640
Uh-- l, uh--

671
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,160
sleep with his wife.

672
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,280
Well.

673
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,520
This is gra-- This is great.

674
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,920
So, once we kidnap supercop,
then what?

675
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,760
Tiny...

676
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,040
surgery.

677
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,160
l'd like to take his--
his face--

678
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,840
off.

679
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,560
Yes.

680
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Now, if you'll excuse me,

681
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,800
l have to use
the little boy's wee-wee room.

682
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,320
Cas.

683
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,720
You wanna take his face--

684
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,280
Yes. His face off.

685
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,520
Eyes.

686
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,080
Nose. Skin.

687
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,600
lt's coming off.

688
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,680
The face...

689
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,840
off.

690
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,960
No more drugs
for that man.

691
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,160
l'm not me.

692
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,320
l'm me.

693
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,640
Not me.
Me.

694
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,920
Castor Archer.

695
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,240
Castor Archer.

696
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,480
l thought you were dead.

697
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,240
l'm not dead.
l'm me.

698
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,200
No, no, no. Look. What l-- What
l'm trying to tell you, brother,

699
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,400
Pollux, is once we get the
full protection and resources...

700
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,800
of the government to help us
get rid of our rivals, right?

701
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,080
Then we'll be set.

702
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,080
Then maybe, just maybe, l'll
get my frickin' face back.

703
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,480
Then l'll just have one jag-off
to take care of.

704
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,920
- Hey, where ya goin'? Where ya goin'?
- Karl, stop it.

705
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,880
- Maybe two. Hold on.
- Karl, stop it!

706
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,880
- Calm down, would ya? Calm down.
- Karl!

707
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,880
Karl, my dad's home!
Let go!

708
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,880
- Happy hunting. l'll catch ya later.
- Stop it!

709
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
Yeah, like Mr Fuckin' lnvisible
gives a shit about you anyway.
So fuckin' hold still.

710
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,560
Calm down!

711
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,360
- Okay, say you're sorry.
- l'm sorry.

712
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,880
- l didn't hear it.
- l'm sorry!

713
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,720
- Mean it.
- l'm so sorry!

714
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,960
Dress up like Halloween and
ghouls will try to get in your pants.

715
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Typical, Dad. Some guy tries
to rape me, and l'm to blame?

716
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,120
This isn't you.

717
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,120
Now you haven't been the same
since Mike died.

718
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,960
Hiding behind
someone else's face.

719
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,560
Hoping you wouldn't
feel the pain.

720
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:42,200
While we're talking,
do you have protection?

721
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,960
What? You mean
like condoms?

722
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,160
Protection.

723
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,360
Next time, let Karl
take his pants down.

724
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,920
Slip this in his thigh, twist
it so the wound won't close.

725
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,600
Now go on.
Get outta here.

726
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,880
l am the king.

727
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,880
Eve.

728
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,080
Jesus, Cas!
lt's me!

729
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,640
lt's me.

730
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,400
Cas. Shh.

731
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,600
Come on.
lt's me. Jesus.

732
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,480
Come on.

733
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,560
- Don't you wanna talk?
- The only talk l ever heard
from you is...

734
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,640
"Suck my tongue," "l love
your ass," and "See ya,"

735
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,760
and "Take the filthy shit off,"
"Put this on and get outta here."

736
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,800
- No, l'm not goin' anywhere.
- Oh, really?

737
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,640
What do you-- What do you
expect me, after all this time--

738
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,600
Just to-- Just to
jump on you?

739
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,680
- That's not what l--
- ls that what you expect?

740
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,520
- That's not what l meant.
- What did you mean?

741
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,960
- l meant--
- Huh? ls this what you meant?

742
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,440
That? That? How about this?
ls that good? Huh?

743
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,640
- Sean Archer.
- Bro.

744
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,680
Well, l figured he might drop in
on some of our old friends.

745
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,880
And if my eyes don't deceive,
l think this fellow's
beginning to enjoy being you.

746
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,800
Good.

747
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,720
Look, look, look. Okay.
L-Look, Sasha.

748
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,680
What l meant is, uh, that
l'm not going anywhere...

749
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,440
until your brother
helps me, uh, first.

750
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,160
Cas. lf the FBl finds out
that you were here,

751
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,840
l'll lose my son.

752
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,760
Please, Cas,
you just gotta go.

753
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,960
l've said and done some things
that have made your life harder.

754
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,560
- l know.
- How would you?

755
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,960
When you left,
you never looked back.

756
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,880
l-- l just know.

757
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,240
Look, Sasha, l'm not
the same person you remember.

758
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,680
And for what it's worth,
l'm sorry.

759
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,320
- They're nice-looking clothes.
- Yeah, of course. They're yours.

760
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,120
Look, l know, l--

761
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,280
just like 'em.

762
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,040
That's a nice-lookin' kid too.

763
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,440
Yeah. Of course.

764
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,440
He's yours too.

765
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,160
- How old is he?
- Five.

766
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,240
Nobody knows he's yours.
l was...

767
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,680
scared someone would try
to hurt him just to hurt you.

768
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,360
Adam. Adam.

769
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,680
Don't want you playing with those
things. They are very, very dangerous.

770
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,880
Okay? Now come on, sweetie.

771
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,760
l want you to meet
your father.

772
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,080
Look at him.
lt's okay. Say hi.

773
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,000
Hi.

774
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,080
Hi.

775
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,280
Michael.

776
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,280
- Michael. Michael?
- Cas.

777
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,360
- Cas. Cas, you're scaring him.
- Michael?

778
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,240
Let him go.

779
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,000
What is the matter
with you?

780
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,280
Get down!

781
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,600
Okay, Red Team!
Red Team, break off!

782
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,000
How'd you get to be so brave?
How'd you get to be so brave?

783
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,520
- Come out now with your hands up!
- Put these on.

784
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,680
Okay. That's a good idea,
baby. Listen to your music.

785
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,320
- Come on.
- Come out now!

786
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,760
Somewhere

787
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,480
- Go! Go! Go!
- We have a warrant for your arrest!

788
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,680
Cops.

789
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,560
l hate cops.

790
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,040
Come on, kid.

791
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,360
- Move! Move!
- Go left, left!
First door to the right!

792
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,000
Go! Go! Go!

793
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,680
Go! Go!

794
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,840
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

795
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,840
- And wake up--
- Let's get outta here! Come on.

796
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,520
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

797
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,240
Damn, my place
is gettin' fucked up.

798
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,680
Take him.

799
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,560
Cas! Cas,
give me the boy!

800
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,480
Really? Really?
Come on! Shit!

801
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,680
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

802
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,720
Cas, be careful
with him!

803
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,800
- Don't be scared, All right? All right?
- Somewhere

804
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:14,560
Over the rainbow

805
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:20,360
Skies are blue

806
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,960
And the dreams

807
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,000
That you dared to dream

808
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,080
Really do come true

809
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,880
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

810
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,800
And wake up
where the clouds

811
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,440
- Are far behind
- Adam!

812
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,920
Me

813
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:57,760
Birds fly over the rainbow

814
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,840
Why then, oh, why

815
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:05,000
Can't l

816
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,600
Adam! Adam!

817
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,480
Get him out back!
Go, go, go!

818
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,680
Put the boy down.

819
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,400
Honey, sweetie,
don't touch that.

820
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,000
lt isn't nice!

821
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,080
l don't ever
wanna see you do that.

822
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,640
They're like cockroaches!

823
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,600
Hey. Drop it.

824
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,880
That's it.

825
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,720
Buzz.

826
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,240
Hey!

827
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,120
Told him
not to fuck with me.

828
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,480
Take the boy
and get outta here.

829
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,400
- Are you all right?
- Go!

830
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,240
Hurry up.

831
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,280
Hey, man.

832
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,920
We had some good times,
didn't we?

833
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,600
l don't know what l hate
wearing worse:

834
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,840
your face or your body.

835
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,320
l mean, l enjoy
boning your wife,

836
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,280
but, uh, well,
let's face it.

837
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,480
We both like it better
the other way, yes?

838
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,520
So why don't we just
trade back.

839
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,880
You can't give back
what you've taken from me.

840
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:52,800
Oh, well.
Plan "B."

841
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,880
Let's just kill each other.

842
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,520
Sir, why are you
so upset?

843
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,000
lt's just Pollux Troy.

844
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,200
Sir, look. You're
on the cover of Time.

845
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,360
Listen. "ln a single week,
Agent Sean Archer...

846
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,560
"has ordered a stunning series
of blitzkrieg-style raids...

847
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:38,160
"on the hideouts, staging grounds and
safe houses of our nation's assassins.

848
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,200
Car bombs--"

849
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,400
Sean. Look we're friends,
so l'm gonna tell you face to face.

850
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,120
l don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.

851
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,360
After last night's bloodbath,
l'm terminatin' your war on terrorists.

852
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,720
ls that, uh, because l'm getting
all the kudos and you're not?

853
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,280
Jesus Christ. l don't know where
you're gettin' your intelligence.

854
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,360
lt's not from field agents.
Sometimes l think you know too much.

855
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,440
Washington's
starting to worry.

856
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,680
Justice wants a hearing.
Shoot.

857
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:19,640
They're concerned
about the constitutionality
of your gestapo tactics!

858
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,040
And frankly,
so am l! l'm--

859
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,320
Uh, okay, Victor,

860
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:30,120
l'll give the, uh,
taxpayers a break.

861
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,120
But, um,

862
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,480
l have something, uh,
l want to confess.

863
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,640
And l don't think
you're gonna like it.

864
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,040
l am Castor Troy.

865
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,640
- Kimmy. Kim?
- Yes, sir.

866
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,920
Call the paramedics. Victor
Lazarro's had a heart attack.

867
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,120
- Oh, God. Right away.
- Thank you.

868
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,760
Home.

869
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,160
Eve.

870
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,240
Eve.

871
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,880
No. Honey, please,
please don't scream.

872
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,800
Don't scream.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

873
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,400
Okay, just don't,
don't, don't, don't.

874
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,520
Just don't--
don't look at my face.

875
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,680
And the voice.
Don't listen.

876
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,840
- Just--
- l know who you are!
You killed our son!

877
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,480
l did not kill our son.

878
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,400
l'm Sean.

879
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,040
The last time l saw you...

880
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,040
was in this room.

881
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,640
We had a fight when l said
l had to go away again.

882
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,680
And l spent the night
in Mike's old bed.

883
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,800
l'm tired, Eve.

884
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,320
The assignment was to enter
a federal prison as Castor Troy.

885
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,280
lt's just fucking insane.

886
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:00,280
And it's-- A special ops
surgeon, uh, gave me, uh,

887
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,320
Castor's face!

888
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,480
Then, uh-- And then, somehow,
Castor came out of his, uh,

889
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:14,680
his-his coma, and
he killed everybody...

890
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,920
who knew about the mission.

891
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,640
But, but not before
transforming into me.

892
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,440
l know you don't believe a word
l'm saying. Well, here's proof, Doctor.

893
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:49,240
Your husband, me, my,
Sean's blood type is O-negative.

894
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,960
Castor's is AB.

895
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,400
And l love you.

896
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,640
Get some backup.

897
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,520
What a day.

898
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,440
You look tense.

899
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,800
l know l've been acting
different lately. Strange.

900
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,800
l've got a confession
to make, Eve.

901
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,800
You're not gonna like it.

902
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:51,200
Oh, Eve. l feel--
l feel so close to you.

903
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,920
l read your diary. l know
l shouldn't have. l'm ashamed.

904
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
But l did.

905
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,600
l just wanna be the man
that you deserve--

906
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,200
passionate, tender.

907
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:10,760
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

908
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,600
My mentor, gone.

909
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,280
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

910
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,600
l hope this doesn't mean
l'm losing you.

911
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,520
Of course not.

912
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,640
You're the only family
l've got.

913
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,760
Oh, God.

914
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:33,040
- Oh, God.
- l was hoping you'd come here.

915
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,760
Thank you for trusting me.

916
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:43,280
Right now,
l don't trust anyone.

917
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,320
Eve, wh-where'd
you get that gun?

918
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,520
l took it
from my fake husband.

919
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,760
Put it down.
You know l'm Sean.

920
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,360
Do l? Maybe Sean's
already dead, huh?

921
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,280
l'm moving very slowly.

922
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,720
l was thinking
the other day, l--

923
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,640
l remember...

924
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,760
l once took a date out...

925
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,880
for surf and turf,

926
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,800
not knowing she was
a vegetarian.

927
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,240
So she ate bread.

928
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,440
And, uh, and broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

929
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,080
And we, we drove around
all night,

930
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,040
uh, looking for a--
for a all-night dentist.

931
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,520
And, and he, uh--
He was so drunk,

932
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:59,080
he fixed the wrong tooth.

933
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,280
And it-- When l
finally brought her home--

934
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:16,520
Even though it must have
hurt like hell,

935
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:20,080
you, you, you kissed me.

936
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:34,920
Sean,

937
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,720
that man--

938
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,000
You know we've been living
together as man and wife for a week.

939
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,800
Yeah, l--

940
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:49,360
l know.
Eve. Eve.

941
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,280
l put you
in that position and, and--

942
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:55,000
l-l-l can never
make it up to you.

943
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,160
Well, you're damn well
gonna try.

944
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,000
Let me take a look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

945
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:16,440
With Lazarro out of the way,

946
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,480
Castor's the new acting director
of the Bureau.

947
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,680
- He's untouchable.
- Not tomorrow.

948
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,880
Tomorrow he'll
be at Victor's service.

949
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,440
Tomorrow.

950
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,840
That will be the day.

951
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,840
l want you and Jamie away from
there. Give him a good excuse.

952
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,760
l can cover for Jamie,

953
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,920
but if l'm not coming he's
gonna know that something's up.

954
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,360
And besides, l'm the only one
who can try and explain the truth.

955
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,120
Excuse me, Mr Archer.
May l help you?

956
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,280
Dr Levine to X Ray.

957
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,240
Sean, what are you
doing here?

958
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,080
Sorry, darling, it--

959
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,520
l just get so,
so jealous, l--

960
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,200
l mean, wh-wh-what is a guy
to think when his, uh,

961
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,120
his wife runs off
in the middle of the night?

962
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,320
That l'm a doctor that's on call,
so please let me get back to work, okay?

963
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,240
Sorry.

964
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:34,520
Lies, distrust,
mixed messages.

965
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,480
This is turning
into a real marriage.

966
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,000
How's Adam?

967
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:03,320
l took him over to my cousin's
until this whole thing blows over.

968
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,840
- Where's Jamie?
- That's what l'd like to know.

969
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,600
She stole $50 from my purse
and took off.

970
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,800
- So what's the next move?
- This isn't your fight.

971
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,320
Oh, come on. You're surprised?
Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

972
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,760
You think she gives a damn
about your boss?

973
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:30,160
He killed my brother. l'm not
gonna let him take you too.

974
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:48,880
Whatever happens,
l promise...

975
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,560
Sean Archer is
off your back for good.

976
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:08,480
My dear friends, we are here
to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.

977
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,960
Somebody back there asked me
to give this to you.

978
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,800
ln peace now, let us take
our brother Victor...

979
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,920
to his place of rest.

980
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,640
lsn't this religious?

981
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:59,160
Ah, yes. The eternal battle
between good and evil,

982
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,080
saint and sinner.

983
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:03,560
But you're still
not having any fun!

984
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,720
Honey? Honey?

985
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:19,200
Come here.

986
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:26,160
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.

987
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,640
History repeats itself.

988
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:37,840
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.

989
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,400
No, you should've
left them out of it.

990
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:45,880
Your son was an accident.
l wanted to kill you.

991
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,560
But you took it
so personally.

992
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,080
Why didn't you just
kill yourself or let it go?

993
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:58,120
- No father could.
- No brother could either.

994
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,080
Neither could a sister.

995
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,120
Hey, baby.

996
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:09,200
Sasha, what the fuck
are you doing here?

997
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,240
Gee, Archer, l guess
l'm crashing.

998
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:15,720
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. Thanks.

999
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,840
Sasha, baby.

1000
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:20,480
l'm Castor.
That's Archer.

1001
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,400
And l'm bored.

1002
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:27,040
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Why don't you put your guns down?

1003
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,040
What a predicament!

1004
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,120
Take care of our boy.

1005
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,680
You love him so much.

1006
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,000
Don't let him grow up
to be like us, promise?

1007
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,040
- Yeah.
- Say yeah.

1008
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,960
Mom?

1009
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,920
Jamie!

1010
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,720
Jamie, don't!

1011
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,520
Hello, Wanda?
Wanda, this is Eve Archer.

1012
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,200
l have something
crazy to tell you.

1013
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,680
lt's a capital crime to try to kill
the next big boss of the FBl, yes?

1014
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,760
- Yes.
- Ah, yes.

1015
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,880
- The penalty--
- What?

1016
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,960
The penalty is death!

1017
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,920
Die. Please, God, die.

1018
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,280
Hold it!

1019
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,480
Good girl, Jamie!
Shoot him!

1020
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:43,000
Honey, don't listen to him,
honey! He's not your father!
Hear my voice. l'm your father!

1021
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,120
Use your eyes, Jamie.
Shoot him!

1022
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:47,880
Don't listen to him!
Don't shoot! Just, just--

1023
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,760
This scumbag-- This scumbag shot
your brother, Jamie! Kill him!

1024
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,880
Clod.

1025
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,840
No daughter of mine
would shoot so wide.

1026
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,800
Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.

1027
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:08,880
Dad, put it down.

1028
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,200
Now we're gonna find out
what's in Papa's bag. Peaches.

1029
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,200
Say goodbye to Papa.

1030
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,960
Jamie!

1031
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:33,640
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie,
are you all right? Oh, my God.

1032
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,480
Sir, are you okay?

1033
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Please, someone please tell me
what planet l'm on?

1034
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,880
Get down!

1035
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,520
Stop! This is the police!

1036
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:20,760
Stop immediately or we'll
be forced to open fire!

1037
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,120
Fire! Fire!

1038
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:43,960
You're right, Sean.
l've misbehaved.

1039
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,720
l need to be punished.

1040
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,360
But remember,
every time...

1041
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:56,760
you look in the mirror,
you'll see my face.

1042
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:15,360
Die!

1043
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,560
Ready

1044
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:39,120
Ready for the big ride

1045
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:41,760
Baby

1046
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,320
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

1047
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,400
You okay, Archer?

1048
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,600
- What did you call me?
- He called you Archer, sir.

1049
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:23,080
Sean, they're bringing in
their top surgical team from DC.
You're going to be okay.

1050
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,760
When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

1051
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:13,440
just the way it was.

1052
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:20,240
My scar.
The one near my heart.

1053
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:23,040
This old bullet wound.

1054
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:25,480
- l won't need it any more.
- Okay.

1055
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:24,440
Dad?

1056
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,600
Dad?

1057
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:42,040
l'm sorry l shot you.

1058
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:53,240
l've got something
l have to ask both of you.

1059
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:06,080
This is, um, Adam.

1060
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:10,080
And he needs
a place to live.

1061
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:14,800
Hi. My name's Jamie.

1062
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:18,560
l'm Adam.

1063
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,920
Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

1064
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,120
Come on.

1065
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,040
Okay.
