1
00:00:13,766 --> 00:01:16,249
The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas

2
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,140
Move! Move it!

3
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,727
Move!

4
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,061
Now!

5
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,009
It's me home.

6
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,886
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

7
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:07,790
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

8
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,709
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

9
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,711
Your father's been given a promotion.

10
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:15,756
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

11
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,716
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

12
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,177
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

13
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,098
Yes, my love.
Yes, just a more important one now.

14
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,017
There's some even more exciting news...

15
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:30,562
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

16
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:35,818
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

17
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,572
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

18
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,074
Sweetheart, I know it's hard...

19
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:45,744
but we're all having to say good-bye
to our friends for the time being.

20
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,414
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

21
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,750
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

22
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,672
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

23
00:04:56,756 --> 00:05:00,175
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

24
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,512
But this is the best house ever.

25
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,766
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

26
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,018
Dad says it's got a garden.

27
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,941
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier...

28
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,236
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty...

29
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,239
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you'll go.

30
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,784
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier...

31
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,788
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

32
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,959
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

33
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,253
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

34
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,256
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

35
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,676
So, you two...

36
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,930
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

37
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,766
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing, so I suppose it must be.

38
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:38,565
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

39
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,532
Heil Hitler!

40
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,443
Congratulations.

41
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:28,323
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

42
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,493
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

43
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:36,415
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

44
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,377
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

45
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:44,590
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie.

46
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,634
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

47
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,597
The uniform and what it stands for?

48
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:55,183
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

49
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,853
Me, spoil things?

50
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,356
You should be careful.

51
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,610
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

52
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,153
You know that.

53
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,617
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

54
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:16,747
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

55
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,775
Bruno!

56
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,534
All right, Bruno. Time to say good-bye.

57
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,063
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

58
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,935
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

59
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,439
Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

60
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,942
Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

61
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:54,529
And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same"

62
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:55,655
Amen.

63
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:44,496
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

64
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,215
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

65
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,067
Well, what do we think?

66
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,072
Come on. It's lovely.

67
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:04,618
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come...

68
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,163
and help you unpack.

69
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:25,847
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

70
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,936
It's not for me to say.

71
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:37,192
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

72
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,533
Is he already up?

73
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,040
Who was that?

74
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,709
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

75
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:59,214
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

76
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:07,222
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

77
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,428
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

78
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,514
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

79
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,933
You can only see it from my room.

80
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,352
And are some children there?

81
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,230
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

82
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:01,109
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

83
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,447
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like...

84
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,783
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

85
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,245
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

86
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm sorry.

87
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,795
Vegetables.

88
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,798
There.

89
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,596
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

90
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,682
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

91
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,437
Thank you, ma'am.

92
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,817
Bruno.

93
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,695
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

94
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,448
The farmers. They wear pajamas.

95
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,635
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

96
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,262
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

97
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:15,016
- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, Herr Kommandant.

98
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,476
Come in.

99
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,690
Sit down, sit down.

100
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,860
Well, what do you think?

101
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,197
Oh, dear.

102
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,533
I want to go home.

103
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,288
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

104
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:39,040
Isn't that right?

105
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:45,255
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

106
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,965
I promise you,
it won't be long before you-

107
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:52,095
Why do the farmers wear pajamas?
I can see them from my window.

108
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:05,066
The thing is, Bruno, those people-

109
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,028
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

110
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,910
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

111
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,745
- Was it Maria?
- No.

112
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,039
It is a farm, isn't it?

113
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:22,750
Yes.

114
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,797
Is it to do with your new job?

115
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,633
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno...

116
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:34,471
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

117
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,682
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place...

118
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,766
for you to grow up in.

119
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,603
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

120
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,315
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

121
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,277
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

122
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,530
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

123
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:56,159
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit—

124
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,203
Well, they're different.

125
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,456
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends...

126
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,250
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

127
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:05,835
Ralf, you promised.

128
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,087
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

129
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,882
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

130
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,551
There was one of them in our kitchen.

131
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,637
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

132
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:02,016
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

133
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,103
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

134
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,356
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

135
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:14,571
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

136
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,863
One thing's for sure...

137
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:19,701
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

138
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,839
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

139
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,134
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

140
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,179
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

141
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,057
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

142
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,186
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

143
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,341
So, children,
what are you doing today?

144
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,718
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

145
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:04,263
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

146
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,184
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

147
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,105
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

148
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,523
The back garden?

149
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,150
Well, God forbid.

150
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,486
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

151
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,946
I even miss school.

152
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,867
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

153
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,869
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

154
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,039
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

155
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,668
A Herr Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.

156
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:37,255
So we're not going to school?

157
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,342
School's coming here?

158
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,637
On an old bicycle, I gather.

159
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,116
It's a bird without the-

160
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,644
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

161
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,482
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Well, you can ask.

162
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,486
Are there any spare tires around?

163
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,030
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

164
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,949
Well, the only spare tire
I've seen around here...

165
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,368
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

166
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,586
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

167
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,340
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

168
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,927
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

169
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,972
What do you want a tire for, anyway?

170
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:13,017
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

171
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,102
That does sound exciting.

172
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,652
You!

173
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,279
Here, now.

174
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,325
Move!

175
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,331
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

176
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,458
There are some tires in there.
He will select one.

177
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:40,920
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

178
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,134
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

179
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,389
How about this one?

180
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,480
Where's my mum?

181
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,566
She's out.

182
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,986
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

183
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,906
But don't worry.

184
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:37,203
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

185
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:49,256
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

186
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,428
Come on. It's not that bad.

187
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,641
There, all better.

188
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:14,323
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

189
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,495
Now, you better sit still
for a few minutes...

190
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,581
before you start
walking around on that again.

191
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,750
Will you tell my mum what happened?

192
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,130
I think she's going to see it for herself.

193
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,675
She'll probably want to take me
to a doctor.

194
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,678
I don't think so.

195
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,056
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

196
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,019
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

197
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:50,484
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

198
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,861
You peel potatoes.

199
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,823
I practiced as a doctor.

200
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,659
Before I-

201
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,411
Before I came here.

202
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,791
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practice.

203
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:18,971
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

204
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:23,184
I know. An explorer.

205
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,144
How do you know that?

206
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,191
Is it nice on the farm?

207
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,411
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

208
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:46,248
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

209
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,960
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

210
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,178
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says l—

211
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,430
Don't argue. Go to your room.

212
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,918
Thank you.

213
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,987
It's not fair, you having this view.

214
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,947
Well, I'm not swapping.

215
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,996
I think school's here.

216
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,000
No, I mean more recent history.

217
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:14,837
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

218
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:18,674
So, you'll be aware of the situation...

219
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,676
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

220
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:25,556
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men...

221
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,641
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

222
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:32,313
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

223
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,776
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

224
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,906
Good. What sort of books?

225
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,866
Adventure books, mainly.

226
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:49,038
You know, knights in shining armor,
exploring strange lands and stuff...

227
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,790
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

228
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,295
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

229
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,381
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books...

230
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,550
and start learning about fact.

231
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:05,596
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world...

232
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,349
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

233
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:45,821
Die, die!

234
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,043
Die, die.

235
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,847
Hello.

236
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,438
I'm exploring.

237
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:11,198
- What are you doing?
- We're- We're building a new hut.

238
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,665
Have you got lots of friends over there?

239
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,669
A few. But we fight a lot.

240
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:28,382
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

241
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,595
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

242
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,223
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

243
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,687
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

244
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,981
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

245
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:48,026
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

246
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,243
I live in the house, back there.

247
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:02,249
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

248
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,210
Are you hungry?

249
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,054
How old are you?

250
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,141
- Eight.
- Me, too!

251
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,109
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own...

252
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,695
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

253
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,990
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

254
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:38,744
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

255
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:41,205
Everyone gets given
a different number.

256
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,290
Right. Then what happens?

257
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,213
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

258
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,339
Yeah.

259
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:53,884
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

260
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,261
And you, Bruno.

261
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,148
Bye.

262
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,162
Mum, I can't find my football.

263
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,456
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

264
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,375
It isn't. I've looked.

265
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,461
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

266
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,588
A piece. Yes.

267
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,055
Bruno?

268
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:44,142
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

269
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,228
For your football.

270
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,685
Damn.

271
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:56,256
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

272
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,552
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

273
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:04,556
Dolls are for little girls.

274
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:07,309
It's not right to be playing
with silly toys...

275
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:11,313
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

276
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:56,191
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

277
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:02,447
"Its struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

278
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:06,159
I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

279
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,829
The history of my people
is great and glorious."

280
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,414
And it's 12:00.

281
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,795
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

282
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,882
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno...

283
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,885
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue?

284
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,944
Bruno, there you are.

285
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:45,282
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

286
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,786
You be careful on that thing.

287
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,329
Thank you.

288
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,808
Can I ask you something?

289
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,603
Why do you people
wear pajamas all day?

290
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,940
- They're not pajamas.
- Well, those.

291
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,527
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

292
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,446
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

293
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,198
The soldiers? Why?

294
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:32,204
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

295
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,999
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier...

296
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,252
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

297
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,630
What sort, then?

298
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,176
Well, he's the important sort.

299
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,721
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

300
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:55,685
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

301
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:01,525
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

302
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,613
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up...

303
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,783
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

304
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,327
Do you know him? Lives over there.

305
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:18,500
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

306
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,678
Can I ask you another question?

307
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:32,347
What do you burn in those chimneys?

308
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,101
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

309
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:39,229
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

310
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,981
Mama says it's old clothes.

311
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,150
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

312
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,823
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

313
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:51,533
Yes, I'm sorry.

314
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,369
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

315
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:57,247
I can't, can I? Because of this.

316
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,500
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

317
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:04,087
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

318
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,339
Are you not allowed out?

319
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,386
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

320
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:25,692
I think I should go now.

321
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,491
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

322
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,244
- Good-bye, then!
- Bye.

323
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,792
Little present, sweetheart.

324
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,048
Thank you, Mummy.

325
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:59,392
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

326
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,660
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

327
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,912
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

328
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:23,625
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

329
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,628
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

330
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,590
The day I fell off the swing.

331
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,052
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

332
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,512
Mum.

333
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,015
Let me speak to her.

334
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,017
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

335
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,773
Yes. We look forward to it. Good-bye.

336
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,948
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

337
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:58,952
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

338
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:03,248
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

339
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:06,835
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

340
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,882
I think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes.

341
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,676
- Look.
- What?

342
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,264
- Hey!
- Gretel.

343
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:22,434
Hey, that's not fair!

344
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:23,977
- Gretel.
- What?

345
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,521
It's only a game.

346
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,279
Ralf, this tutor you brought in...

347
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:38,241
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

348
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,493
I believe so. Why?

349
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,495
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

350
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,414
Gretel seems to have become so-

351
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:47,042
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

352
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:48,877
They mustn't get left behind.

353
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,504
Come on.

354
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,133
Let's get to bed.

355
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:08,563
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

356
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:11,024
The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

357
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,109
He mocked
our literature and our music.

358
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,612
Everywhere, his influence
was destructive...

359
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:18,865
the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse...

360
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,533
- and then—"
- Yes, Bruno?

361
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:23,536
I don't understand.

362
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,164
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

363
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:30,210
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

364
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:32,253
If it had been just one man...

365
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,006
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

366
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:40,220
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

367
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:44,057
I think, Bruno,
if you ever found a nice Jew...

368
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:48,269
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

369
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:54,109
Continue, Gretel.

370
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,155
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

371
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,908
The Jew is not creative,
but destructive.

372
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:04,410
He is the enemy of culture.

373
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:07,831
Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

374
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:22,679
Master Bruno.

375
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,267
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

376
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:31,187
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

377
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,274
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

378
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:38,653
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

379
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,446
Bruno, what is it?

380
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,741
What are you doing with your satchel?

381
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:48,454
Herr Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.

382
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,041
- Let me see.
- What?

383
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:54,836
- The books.
- No.

384
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,131
Bruno, I just want to see
what books Herr Liszt has given you.

385
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,926
- I told a lie.
- What?

386
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:04,804
I've just got...

387
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,017
adventure books.

388
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,319
Go on. Off you go, then.

389
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:25,575
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

390
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:26,826
The Kommandant's father will be here...

391
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:29,245
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

392
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,228
Here.

393
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,366
What's the matter?

394
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,579
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

395
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,416
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

396
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,085
It's just a ball. Come on.

397
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:22,382
Do you not like playing?

398
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:29,389
- J Just not ball games?
- Not here.

399
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:38,439
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

400
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:40,358
We just all have numbers.

401
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,574
Shmuel!

402
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:04,424
Bruno! What are you doing?

403
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:09,304
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

404
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:21,983
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

405
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,151
What?

406
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,794
But, surely you-

407
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:00,021
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

408
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:02,315
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

409
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:10,782
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

410
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:16,162
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

411
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:21,167
- You want this country to be strong-
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

412
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,340
How can you-

413
00:49:27,424 --> 00:49:29,050
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you—

414
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,886
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

415
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,680
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

416
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:40,186
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included...

417
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,147
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

418
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:51,239
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

419
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,619
Grandpa's here.

420
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,497
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

421
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,378
We'll be through in a moment.

422
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,098
Who told you about this?

423
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,965
How's Grandma?

424
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:53,509
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

425
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:57,680
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

426
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:01,225
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

427
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:12,695
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

428
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:16,365
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

429
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,618
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

430
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:29,170
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

431
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,672
Yes. He's nice.

432
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:35,218
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

433
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,637
All we do is boring, old history.

434
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:40,181
Let me tell you something, young man.

435
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:44,769
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

436
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:47,480
The work your father is doing here...

437
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,691
history in the making.

438
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:04,539
When I was your age, history was
my favorite subject by miles...

439
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:07,250
which obviously
didn't please my father.

440
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,668
Why not?

441
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:11,712
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

442
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:15,675
Really, does he still teach?

443
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:21,639
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

444
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:29,272
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

445
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,526
Really, when?

446
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:38,990
About four years ago,
Herr Kommandant.

447
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:46,998
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

448
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:48,916
Where did he go?

449
00:52:57,467 --> 00:52:59,176
Lieutenant Kotler...

450
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:04,056
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

451
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,940
I believe it was Switzerland,
Herr Kommandant.

452
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:16,652
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland...

453
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:18,237
at the very moment it needed him most.

454
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:21,115
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

455
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,575
More wine!

456
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:27,747
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

457
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,293
Did he go there to take the air?

458
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:36,714
I'm afraid I really don't know,
Herr Kommandant.

459
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,758
You'd have to ask him.

460
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:41,552
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

461
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,763
With him being in Switzerland.

462
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:45,640
Come on!

463
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:49,602
What's the matter with you tonight?

464
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:02,782
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

465
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:07,119
 Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

466
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:12,833
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

467
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:17,630
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

468
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:21,384
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

469
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:25,721
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father...

470
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:29,517
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

471
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:32,853
Lieutenant Kotler!

472
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:37,316
You cretin Jew! Filth!

473
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:50,871
Ralf!

474
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:56,752
Jew!

475
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:01,757
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

476
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:03,008
The Jew deserved it.

477
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:16,522
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

478
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,525
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

479
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:42,256
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

480
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,842
ForJews, obviously.

481
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,179
 Just Jews?

482
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:51,891
Because they're the best workers?

483
00:55:51,975 --> 00:55:53,642
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

484
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:55,895
They're no good at anything.

485
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,563
They're in there because they're evil.

486
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,982
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

487
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,401
- But I thought we were fighting-
- They're evil, Bruno.

488
00:56:02,486 --> 00:56:04,403
Evil, dangerous vermin.

489
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,781
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

490
00:56:07,908 --> 00:56:11,869
Haven't you been listening to anything
Herr Liszt has been telling us?

491
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,370
No. Not really.

492
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:19,460
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

493
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:24,131
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

494
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:26,842
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

495
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:29,428
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

496
00:56:29,513 --> 00:56:32,139
He's making the country great again.

497
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:27,528
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

498
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:28,654
Well, they're different.

499
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,739
They're the enemy, Bruno.

500
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:32,533
Evil, dangerous vermin.

501
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:35,828
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

502
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:02,271
What are you doing here?

503
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:06,525
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

504
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:22,458
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

505
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:25,502
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

506
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,219
Do you want some?

507
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:47,358
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

508
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:49,485
Is he a good man?

509
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:54,198
You've never thought he wasn't?

510
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:59,411
And you're proud of him?

511
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,790
Aren't you proud of yours?

512
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,380
Is it really horrible in the camp?

513
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:12,257
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

514
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:14,593
How dare you!

515
00:59:17,097 --> 00:59:18,639
Are you eating?

516
00:59:21,226 --> 00:59:23,394
Have you been stealing food?

517
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:31,026
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

518
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,113
He's my friend.

519
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,449
What?

520
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:40,953
Little man...

521
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,457
do you know this Jew?

522
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:47,167
Do you know this Jew?

523
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:50,129
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

524
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,590
I've never seen him before in my life.

525
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:04,768
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

526
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:07,771
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat...

527
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:11,692
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

528
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:55,838
New arrivals here are happy
to discover that life in the camp...

529
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:57,047
is not all work.

530
01:01:57,132 --> 01:02:00,425
And that there's
ample opportunity for leisure also.

531
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,886
At the end of their day
at the ironmongery...

532
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:05,514
or the build or boot factory,
the workers can enjoy...

533
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:08,934
the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer.

534
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:12,563
Organized sport is very popular.

535
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:15,732
Those that don't play
certainly enjoy watching.

536
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:19,236
At the end of the working day...

537
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,697
the centrally located cafe
is the ideal place...

538
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:26,368
for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal.

539
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:31,248
The children, in particular,
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.

540
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:39,298
In the evenings,
the occasional music concerts...

541
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:42,384
either by visiting orchestras
or, indeed, by talented musicians...

542
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:45,304
from within the camp itself,
are always well attended.

543
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,058
Other recreations include
reading in the library...

544
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:56,023
pottery, cookery, art and horticulture
for adult and child alike.

545
01:02:56,107 --> 01:03:00,277
Almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp.

546
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:07,159
Splendid.

547
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,671
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

548
01:04:06,386 --> 01:04:08,220
Good-bye, little man.

549
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,768
Shmuel! Shmuel!

550
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,038
I don't understand.

551
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:18,623
I saw a film about the camp...

552
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,877
and it looked so nice.

553
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:31,303
I don't know why I did it.

554
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:34,473
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things...

555
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:36,725
and that soldier's so scary.

556
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:45,650
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

557
01:05:45,735 --> 01:05:50,572
I thought maybe
we weren't friends anymore.

558
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:03,377
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

559
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:38,412
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

560
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:43,708
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

561
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,712
He's been moved to the front.

562
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:49,673
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm...

563
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:51,508
would be put to better use there.

564
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:53,718
Herr Kommandant, telephone.

565
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:57,139
I n actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there...

566
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:58,974
because he failed
to inform the authorities...

567
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:01,309
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

568
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:03,353
Which was his duty, I might add.

569
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:05,522
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

570
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:09,693
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

571
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:12,612
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

572
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:21,163
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

573
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:25,876
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

574
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,091
It's Father. They've been bombed.

575
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:40,182
Grandmother's dead.

576
01:08:25,436 --> 01:08:28,104
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us...

577
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:30,482
and for all who sleep in Him...

578
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:34,152
keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship...

579
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:36,238
with all that wait for Thee on earth...

580
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:39,074
and with all that are around Thee
in heaven...

581
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,451
in union with Him
who is the resurrection...

582
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:45,247
and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost...

583
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,416
ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

584
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:52,003
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

585
01:08:53,256 --> 01:08:55,006
He does.

586
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:24,035
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

587
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,495
Have you ever been to a funeral?

588
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:30,834
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here...

589
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:33,211
but there weren't any funerals.

590
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:37,799
That one there to there.

591
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:43,388
They both died at the same time?

592
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:45,098
What of?

593
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:47,684
I don't know.

594
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:50,729
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

595
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:54,107
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

596
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:56,985
We didn't see them again.

597
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:02,574
This is fun.

598
01:10:03,618 --> 01:10:07,120
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

599
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,586
- That one there to there.
- This one?

600
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:18,381
- This one?
- No, that one.

601
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:22,177
- This one to here?
- No, there!

602
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,387
- To here?
- No.

603
01:10:24,472 --> 01:10:26,598
- Here?
- No.

604
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:39,277
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

605
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:09,641
You can't behave like this!

606
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:13,645
- You're questioning my behavior?
- It can't continue!

607
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:16,648
I know.
I can't stand this anymore, Ralf.

608
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:18,817
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

609
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,945
Don't you think there will be questions?

610
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,446
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say...

611
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:28,243
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

612
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,246
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

613
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,081
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

614
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:36,876
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

615
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:39,838
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

616
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:51,349
Are you happy here?

617
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,519
Yes. Very.

618
01:11:57,732 --> 01:11:59,357
And you, Gretel?

619
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:06,865
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

620
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:12,203
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

621
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:16,040
No. Not anymore, really.

622
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:33,308
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose...

623
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:37,020
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

624
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:40,982
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

625
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:46,613
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

626
01:12:47,907 --> 01:12:50,033
All of us? You as well?

627
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:54,496
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

628
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,165
I must stay
and complete my work here.

629
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:03,254
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it-

630
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:09,677
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

631
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:11,596
Would you like that?

632
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:27,070
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

633
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,864
The important thing is
your mother does not feel...

634
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:32,784
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood...

635
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:36,538
and the more I think about it, the more
I realize she's very probably right.

636
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,331
- But, Dad-
- No!

637
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,465
It's time for you to move away.

638
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:14,617
Is everything all right?

639
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,455
We can't find Papa.

640
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,166
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men...

641
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:24,294
and they haven't come back.

642
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:37,181
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

643
01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:40,852
How long for this time?

644
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:44,856
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

645
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:50,278
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

646
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:53,948
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

647
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:59,871
So, I won't ever see you again?

648
01:15:01,749 --> 01:15:05,835
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like...

649
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,339
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

650
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:16,429
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

651
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:20,934
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

652
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,020
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

653
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:26,940
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

654
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,156
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

655
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,910
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

656
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:44,082
Look.

657
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:54,008
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

658
01:15:54,093 --> 01:15:56,928
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

659
01:15:57,513 --> 01:16:01,516
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

660
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,476
I don't look like you.

661
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:09,273
You could look like me, though.

662
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:11,693
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

663
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,861
I'm not shaving my hair off.

664
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:18,366
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pajamas are a different color.

665
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,995
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them...

666
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,831
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

667
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,333
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

668
01:16:27,418 --> 01:16:29,877
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

669
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:33,381
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

670
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,633
And don't forget the pajamas!

671
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:39,822
Bruno?

672
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:44,368
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

673
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:48,498
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

674
01:17:50,918 --> 01:17:52,543
All right. Go on then.

675
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:28,079
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

676
01:18:28,205 --> 01:18:31,874
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pajamas!

677
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,879
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

678
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,989
Shmuel.

679
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:12,915
Here.

680
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:30,183
How do I look?

681
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,483
Right. Let's get going.

682
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:56,959
Bruno?

683
01:19:58,337 --> 01:19:59,837
That's enough.

684
01:20:30,077 --> 01:20:31,869
Let's go and find your dad.

685
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:38,834
Come on!

686
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:40,920
Master Bruno?

687
01:21:25,716 --> 01:21:26,924
Shmuel.

688
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:31,053
- Can we go to the cafe or something?
- Cafe?

689
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:37,393
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

690
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:48,070
Yeah.

691
01:21:51,575 --> 01:21:53,784
We'll check our hut first.

692
01:21:57,456 --> 01:21:58,998
Bruno?

693
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:07,631
Come on.

694
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:21,771
Papa?

695
01:22:24,483 --> 01:22:26,609
Up! Up! Get up!

696
01:22:26,693 --> 01:22:28,736
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

697
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,571
We go on marches sometimes.

698
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:32,656
Move! Up, up!

699
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:36,619
Move, move!

700
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:49,006
Bruno!

701
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:53,010
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

702
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,526
Bruno!

703
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:12,530
Bruno?

704
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:26,168
- Move!
- Quickly!

705
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:30,548
Get up!

706
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:34,885
Get up. You must!

707
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:37,513
Move them out!

708
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,444
...which means that
our weekly capabilities...

709
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:53,028
would be almost tripled...

710
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:55,364
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

711
01:23:55,449 --> 01:23:58,576
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

712
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:00,244
Bruno's missing.

713
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:07,877
Come on!

714
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,218
Wait here!

715
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:28,397
Come on!

716
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:32,610
Move! Move!

717
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:42,244
Join the queue!

718
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,962
Come on, you!

719
01:25:00,972 --> 01:25:02,515
Bruno!

720
01:25:03,183 --> 01:25:04,808
Move it!

721
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:08,979
Go on.

722
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:12,107
Bruno!

723
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:26,580
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

724
01:25:26,665 --> 01:25:28,040
Clothes off!

725
01:25:36,216 --> 01:25:38,217
Where are we going?

726
01:25:42,806 --> 01:25:44,390
No, it's just a shower.

727
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:48,060
A shower?

728
01:26:36,735 --> 01:26:39,403
Open the gates! Open the gates!

729
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:44,199
Move!

730
01:28:02,404 --> 01:28:04,113
Bruno!

731
01:30:10,548 --> 01:34:26,750
The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas
