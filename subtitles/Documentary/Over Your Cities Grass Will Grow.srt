1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,650
Deanie, please.

2
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,960
Bud, I'm afraid.

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
Oh, Bud.

4
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,330
Don't, Bud.

5
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,130
No.

6
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,170
We mustn't, Bud.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,900
No. No.

8
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,480
Bud, don't be mad.

9
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,890
I'd better take you home.

10
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,960
We've had enough kissing for tonight.

11
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,390
Has Bud left?

12
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,950
Yes, Mom.

13
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
There's wonderful news tonight.

14
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,660
The Stamper Oil stocks, drink your milk,
went up 14 points today.

15
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,040
Think of it, honey.

16
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,010
That means if we sold those stocks,
we'd make $15,000.

17
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,010
Maybe we can even send you away
to college next year.

18
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,610
Well, we're not going to sell.

19
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,320
Your father says that everyone
at the Elks says...

20
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,880
...that the stocks are going up even higher.

21
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,830
Didn't Bud say anything about it tonight?

22
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,800
He doesn't know anything
about his father's business, Mom.

23
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,470
He doesn't care about that.

24
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,110
What were you and Bud doing all this time,
for heaven's sake?

25
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,600
We were studying together.

26
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm going to bed, Mom. I'm awfully tired.

27
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,560
Now, Wilma Dean....

28
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,070
I want to talk to you.

29
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,710
Now, Wilma Dean, Bud Stamper could
get you into a whole lot of trouble.

30
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,870
And you know how I mean.

31
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,410
Boys don't respect a girl
they can go all the way with.

32
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,650
Boys want a nice girl for a wife.

33
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,790
Wilma Dean, you and Bud haven't gone
too far already, have you?

34
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,330
No, Mother.

35
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean!

36
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,970
No, Mom, we haven't gone too far.

37
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,370
That's a relief.

38
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,710
Mom?

39
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,510
Is it so terrible to have those feelings
about a boy?

40
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,280
No nice girl does.

41
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,450
Doesn't she?

42
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,790
No. No nice girl.

43
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,730
But, Mom...

44
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,330
...didn't you ever....

45
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,910
Didn't you ever feel that way about Dad?

46
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,210
Your father never laid a hand on me
until we were married.

47
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,480
And then...

48
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,010
...I just gave in because a wife has to.

49
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,590
A woman doesn't enjoy those things
the way a man does.

50
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,260
She just lets her husband...

51
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,870
...come near her in order to have children.

52
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,180
Deanie, what's troubling you?

53
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,250
Oh, nothing, Mom.

54
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,690
I'm just tired.

55
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,080
I want to go to bed now.

56
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,580
Now, Deanie...

57
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,730
...you tell Bud Stamper to bring you home
earlier after this...

58
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,170
...especially on school nights.

59
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,740
"Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite."

60
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,870
'Night.

61
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,670
"Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name...."

62
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,250
Something wrong?

63
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,300
Wilma Dean and the Stamper boy
are in love.

64
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,860
They're in love, I tell you, Del!

65
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,870
Go back to sleep, Mama.

66
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,500
He'd be the catch of a lifetime, Del.

67
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,420
I hope we bring in a gusher
every day, Boss!

68
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,900
Hold it! Hold it!

69
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,060
Boss, Bud's here. Here's Bud!

70
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,190
Come on in here, my boy.

71
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,170
Your old man will get us in trouble
with our wives...

72
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,870
...'cause we'll go home smelling
like home brew and they'll wonder why.

73
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,960
They'll want some, too.

74
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,840
-Get something to eat, Son.
-I gotta go up to bed now.

75
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,210
Wait a minute, Son. I want to talk to you.

76
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,810
You go on entertaining yourselves.
I'll have a few words with my boy here.

77
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,890
Have more of this venison.
You don't get meat like that anymore.

78
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,480
They don't make home brew
like that anymore.

79
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,290
It's pretty late for a boy
keeping football training, isn't it?

80
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,730
Come here. I want to talk to you, Son.

81
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,840
You're the captain of the team, Son.
Those other boys look up to you.

82
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,400
You gotta run with the ball.

83
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,880
I wasn't much older than you, Bud,
when I fell off that crown block...

84
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,270
...and I hit that rig floor.

85
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,570
And my running days was long gone.

86
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,620
So, you're doing the running
for both of us now, boy.

87
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,190
Listen, I brought in a well today.

88
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,960
She's flowing over 100 barrels an hour,
and our stocks are going way up.

89
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,160
Those big Eastern companies are beginning
to take notice of us.

90
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,830
Them people really beginning
to take notice of us.

91
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,270
-That's great.
-You been out with the Loomis girl?

92
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,170
-Yes, sir.
-Are you watching yourself with her?

93
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,540
You're not doing anything
you'll be ashamed of, are you?

94
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,670
No, sir.

95
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,120
She's a nice kid, Son. She's a good looker.

96
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,280
I've known her folks ever since
old Del and I were boys together.

97
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,880
I got nothing against them
'cause they're poor.

98
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm not a snob or anything like that.

99
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,330
The only difference between me and Del
is that I got ambition.

100
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,760
Hey, Dad, l--

101
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,360
But if anything was to happen,
you'd have to marry her.

102
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,810
You'd have to marry her, Son.
You realize that, don't you?

103
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,070
You get a girl in trouble
and you gotta take the consequences.

104
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
-Dad, I'm not--
-Sit down.

105
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,580
-I want to talk to you--
-Sit down.

106
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,910
-I want to talk to you about that.
-All right.

107
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,210
All right, lay it on me. Come on.

108
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,620
Lay it on me. That a boy.
There we go, lay it on me.

109
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Lay it on now. Lick like a bear.

110
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,390
We got a future, boy.
You and me, we got a future.

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,830
First, we'll get you an education.

112
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,700
The best. Four years at Yale.

113
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,170
Did I tell you a secret?

114
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,830
-I'll tell you a secret.
-What?

115
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,960
Come here.

116
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,010
My company is gonna merge
with one of those big Eastern companies.

117
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,010
I'm gonna put you in there, boy.

118
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm lining up a future for you, boy.

119
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,050
I've been thinking about--

120
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,880
There ain't nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for you, boy.

121
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,710
I know.

122
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,310
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if you do right.

123
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,050
If you do right, Bud!

124
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,120
Now, don't disappoint me, Son.

125
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,730
Don't disappoint me, boy.

126
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,630
God knows I've had
one disappointment already.

127
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,900
-She asleep?
-Yes, finally.

128
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,570
-Is Sis back?
-Hello, Bud, darling.

129
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,370
Mother brought her home
from Chicago a little while ago.

130
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,540
Welcome home, Mom.

131
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,770
It was a miserable trip, just miserable.
How's Deanie?

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,440
I don't know.

133
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,250
I'm gonna go to bed, Dad.

134
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm going to bed, too,
but I'm afraid I won't sleep a wink.

135
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah, you go to bed, Son.

136
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,790
You got a football game to win tomorrow.

137
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,190
I got all my hopes pinned on you now.

138
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,310
How're you men getting on in there?

139
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,710
Well, you certainly spoiled that girl.

140
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,520
First you send her off to finishing school.

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,220
She breaks all the rules
and they kick her out.

142
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,190
Then you send her off to university.

143
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,490
She goes hog wild
and flunks all her courses.

144
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,930
Then you had to learn your lesson
all over again, didn't you?

145
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,030
Let her go off to art school
in a wild place like Chicago.

146
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,270
She gets tied up with some cake-eater who
gets her into trouble so he can marry her.

147
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,710
Your lawyer got it annulled.

148
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
Damn right I got it annulled.

149
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,610
When I made it clear to "Mr. Cake-Eater"
that I'd cut off her allowance...

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
...he backed out in a hurry.

151
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,610
She's just a headstrong little flapper...

152
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,780
...but I'll keep her home
and teach her a little discipline.

153
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes, sir.

154
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,790
I'm gonna keep that young lady home,
teach her a little discipline.

155
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,490
If you think I'll stay
in this God-forsaken town...

156
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,040
...and have people gossip about me,
you've got another think coming.

157
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,470
I'll really give them something
to gossip about.

158
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,370
Why, Sister, you're up so early!

159
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,440
I can't sleep in this house.

160
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm going to California and live
with Aunt Blossom and study art.

161
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,250
Art who?

162
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,720
Welcome home, Miss Virginia.

163
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,010
Phoebe.

164
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,320
I hate it here. I'm a freak in this town.

165
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,330
Everybody stares at me
like I'm something out of a carnival.

166
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,520
'Cause you peroxide your hair
and paint your face like an Indian.

167
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,030
Good morning, everybody.

168
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,960
-Hey, how are you?
-Just great.

169
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,830
He's gonna make me stay home
a whole year just to punish me.

170
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,870
There aren't any more schools left
that'll have you.

171
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,040
There's nothing so distasteful--

172
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,340
This is the ugliest place
in the whole world.

173
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,140
Everywhere you look is an oil well,
even on the front lawn.

174
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,510
I'll bet you'd drill right here
in the dining room.

175
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,450
Damn right I would, if I thought
there was any oil in there.

176
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,550
I'll see you later.

177
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,360
How do you want your eggs, Bud darling?

178
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,350
Come back here
and eat a decent breakfast!

179
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,620
I'm late.

180
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,530
Come back! You can't play a football game
on a breakfast like that!

181
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,540
Neither of my children gets
any real nourishment.

182
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,950
Hey, you want a peach?

183
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,050
What?

184
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
Don't! Bud, don't!

185
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,970
Pardonnez-moi.

186
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,730
Wilma Dean, hereafter,
I shall count you tardy...

187
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,240
...if you are not in your seat
when the bell rings.

188
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,140
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

189
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,150
Alan, please.

190
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,310
All right.

191
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,210
For the first few weeks,
we've been reading...

192
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,260
...the stories of King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.

193
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,690
The literature of the age
was characterized by....

194
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,260
All right, Alan?

195
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,770
"By high ideals."

196
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,410
True. And by what else?

197
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,770
You going with us to the football game?

198
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,740
All right, Carolyn?

199
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,720
They were very religious.

200
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,450
Religion was an important part of the lives
of the Knights and their fair ladies.

201
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,350
What else?

202
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,790
I'm going with you, but I'm waiting
for Bud after the game.

203
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,360
We knew that, crazy.

204
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,670
The Knights of the Round Table....

205
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,210
-Just because his father's got money--
-That's not true.

206
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,740
Well, they were very brave
and things like that.

207
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,340
Bud Stamper isn't stuck on himself at all.

208
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,380
What in the world do you mean
by "things like that" exactly?

209
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,060
Well, I don't know exactly.

210
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,790
Let us learn to express ourselves
with as much precision as possible.

211
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,670
Juanita, you had your hand up?

212
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,410
The Knights of the Round Table
had a very high regard for women.

213
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,250
In what way, Juanita?

214
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,780
They looked on women as very pure.

215
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,720
They wouldn't look on her as very pure.

216
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,060
All right now, I want it quiet
in this classroom!

217
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,960
The next time there is talking
while this class is in session...

218
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,590
...I am going to send the culprit
to the principal's office.

219
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes, Juanita, you're quite right.

220
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,070
The Knights did have a very high regard
for womanhood.

221
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,840
In fact, they put women on a pedestal.

222
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,550
Some people say that chivalry is not dead.

223
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,580
Well, how about it, girls?

224
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,590
Do any of you feel
that you're on a pedestal?

225
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,490
That's unnecessary roughness.

226
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,660
Fifteen yards.

227
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,900
Come on, you've been on me all day!

228
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,010
You're out! You're out of the game!

229
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
Who you taking out, Toots?

230
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,220
Never mind who.

231
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,720
Okay, okay, what's so funny about that?

232
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,590
She's the only girl who knows
what it's all about.

233
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,990
You can say that again.

234
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,330
I'll never look twice at those other girls.

235
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,000
They expect you to be satisfied
if they even kiss you good night.

236
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,950
Hi, Bud.

237
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,950
Hi, Juanita.

238
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,040
Did you see Toots in there?

239
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah, yeah. He should be right out.

240
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,250
You played a wonderful game.

241
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,050
Thank you.

242
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,160
He should be right out.

243
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,610
Hi, sweetheart.

244
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,910
I suppose you wish I were more
like Juanita Howard, don't you?

245
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,950
What?

246
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,720
I saw the way you were looking at her.
I think she's disgraceful.

247
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,680
The way she stands
waiting for one of the players--

248
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,020
Wait a minute.

249
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,090
There isn't any reason in the world
why I shouldn't speak to her.

250
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
You were more than speaking to her.

251
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm supposed to not notice her?
Is that what you expect out of me?

252
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm not even supposed to know
girls like that exist, huh?

253
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,110
Bud, I'm sorry.

254
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,210
-I'm sorry, Bud, honest.
-All right, you're sorry.

255
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,550
Mr. Loomis, a customer for meat.

256
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,120
Bud, please don't be mad.

257
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm not mad, Deanie.

258
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,590
Hi, Bud. Deanie.

259
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,390
-Hi, Mr. Loomis.
-Hi, Dad.

260
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,400
I just can't stand it
when you're mad at me.

261
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,110
I don't know what's the matter
with me lately.

262
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm always losing my temper.

263
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,220
You're the only girl in the world for me,
you know that?

264
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,680
I want to be.

265
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,290
If it weren't for you....

266
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,260
If it weren't for you, Deanie, I'd....

267
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,230
I don't know!

268
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,310
Bud, it's broad daylight.

269
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,540
-Who cares?
-Stop it. Stop it.

270
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,150
Come on now. Bud! People can see us.

271
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,450
I don't care.

272
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,820
Bud, stop it. Come on now.

273
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,230
Mom?

274
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,000
Mom?

275
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,300
She's not here.

276
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,980
-Mom?
-"Mom? "

277
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,910
Nobody's here.

278
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,670
Stop that.

279
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,050
Yes, Mrs. Harper, here's your change.

280
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,290
Stop it. I have to pull down
the shade to the store.

281
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,700
Bud, stop it.

282
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,180
You're nuts about me, aren't you?

283
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,850
You're nuts about me.

284
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,090
I've got your ten-pound sack
in the back of the store, Mrs. Thatcher.

285
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,610
At my feet, slave!

286
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,750
-Bud, don't.
-Tell me you love me.

287
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,280
-You're hurting me.
-Say you can't live without me.

288
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,350
-Say it!
-I do.

289
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,750
-Do what?
-I do love you.

290
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,550
And you can't live without me.
You'd be everything I ever ask you to be.

291
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,490
I'd do anything for you.

292
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,060
Deanie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

293
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
Deanie, I was just kidding.

294
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,140
I'm the one; I should go down
on my knees to you.

295
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,920
I was just kidding.
I thought you knew that.

296
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,420
I can't kid about these things...

297
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,360
...because I am nuts about you.

298
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,400
And I would go down on my knees
to worship you if you really wanted me to.

299
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,600
Bud, I can't get along without you.

300
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,840
And I would do anything you'd ask me to.

301
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,800
I would.

302
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,180
I would.

303
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,510
Anything.

304
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,530
-Let's speak of it at the next meeting.
-I certainly will, if you will.

305
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm going in to fix supper now.

306
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,800
-Bye-bye, Nell.
-'Bye, Frieda.

307
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,800
Hi, Mom.

308
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,980
The coast is clear.

309
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,110
Are we going to the victory dance?

310
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,050
I can think of things I'd rather do.

311
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,330
I'll be ready.

312
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,310
I'll pick you up right after dinner then.

313
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,250
Did he tell you about his sister Ginny?

314
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,190
No.

315
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,590
Ginny Stamper is too low
for the dogs to bite.

316
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,750
Come here.

317
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,930
She met some man in Chicago,
put her in the family way.

318
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,930
Mrs. Stamper had to go out there
and get her, take her to a doctor.

319
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,630
Store's all locked up.

320
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,340
Good.

321
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,110
To have one of those
awful operations performed.

322
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
Mom, that's gossip.

323
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,080
Every word is true.

324
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,090
I was at the DAR and heard all about it.

325
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,020
Mrs. Whitcomb lives across the street
from the Stampers...

326
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,620
...and she knows everything
that goes on in their house.

327
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,120
That's what happens to girls
who go wild and boy-crazy.

328
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,310
Well, congratulations, Son!

329
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,790
The game, boy, the game.

330
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,450
Thank you.

331
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,700
I'll run along upstairs and....

332
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,030
Dad, I have to talk to you.

333
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,910
I've just about had all the nonsense
I intend to take out of you.

334
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,950
Get out of here, young lady.
I'm gonna have a talk with my boy.

335
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,690
All right, Son.

336
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,830
All right, go ahead.

337
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,120
Dad, I'm gonna marry Deanie.

338
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,360
Whoa now, Son.

339
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,330
You see, I don't really wanna go to Yale.

340
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,170
I'm not a very good student.

341
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,210
What do you mean
you're not a good student?

342
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,440
Boy, you can do anything
you set your mind to do.

343
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,210
I'd like to go to a good agricultural college
for a couple of years.

344
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,380
I'd really like to do that.
I could come right back here...

345
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,790
...and take over your ranch
just south of town.

346
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,260
Ranching's no life.

347
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,790
I could marry Deanie,
take her to college with me.

348
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,300
That's what I really want.
She'd be a big help to me, Dad.

349
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,960
I spent my life trying to create a place
of importance for you in this world...

350
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,870
...then you come home telling me
you want to marry some little girl!

351
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,510
It's what I want that counts.

352
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,540
Son, a boy your age doesn't even know
what he wants.

353
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,950
After you've had a college education,
you might change your mind.

354
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,180
A college education
will take me four years.

355
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,850
-Trust me.
-I do trust you, but--

356
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,320
-Trust me this time, Son.
-I trust you, Dad.

357
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,720
I do trust you, but four years--

358
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,030
Listen to me now.

359
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,860
But, Dad....

360
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,730
Son, all I'm asking you to do is
to finish Yale.

361
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,830
Then if you still want to marry her,
return and marry her with my blessing.

362
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,910
I'll send you both off to Europe
for a honeymoon.

363
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,500
Bud, please wait, Son.

364
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,770
I just don't know if I can, Dad.

365
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,020
I feel like I'm going nuts sometimes.

366
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,980
I understand, Son.

367
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,590
Your old man understands, Son.

368
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,960
What you need for the time being is...

369
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,340
...a different kind of girl.

370
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,030
When I was a boy, Son,
there was always two kinds of girls.

371
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,770
Us boys, we'd never even mention them
in the same breath...

372
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,680
...but every now and then one of us boys
would sneak off with a girl...

373
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,720
...and we'd get a little steam
out of our system.

374
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,950
No girl looks good to me except Deanie.

375
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,720
I know, Son.

376
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,820
I know.

377
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,990
I love her, Dad.

378
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,030
I know, Son, I know.

379
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,600
See, I don't want to do that.

380
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,350
Okay, I'll go to Yale.

381
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,000
But I want to tell you now,
I'll marry her as soon as I get out.

382
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,120
That's a promise.

383
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,790
-I want you to remember that.
-It's a promise.

384
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,230
It's a promise, Son. I'll send you both
off to Europe on a honeymoon.

385
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,000
-That's a promise.
-Okay.

386
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,440
Bud, I'll wait for you.

387
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,980
I'll wait for you forever.

388
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,080
I'll do anything you want, Bud.

389
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,900
Yes, it's a time of great prosperity
for us all, and we must give thanks.

390
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,640
But let us not forget Christ's warning
to the multitude.

391
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,300
"Lay not up treasures for yourselves
on earth...

392
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,910
"...where moth and rust doth corrupt...

393
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,780
"...and where thieves break through
and steal:

394
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,150
"But lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven...

395
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,980
"...where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt...

396
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,760
"...and where thieves do not
break through and steal:

397
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,130
"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also."

398
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,000
Fine sermon. Fine sermon.

399
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,550
Let us pray.

400
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,460
Take my advice, Del.
Hang onto those stocks of yours.

401
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,220
This comedian said,
"You ain't seen nothing yet."

402
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,730
We're hanging on.

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,190
Fine sermon, Reverend, fine sermon.

404
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,090
Wonderful passage.

405
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,610
Don't light a cigarette
in front of all these church people!

406
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,940
Do you want me to be a hypocrite?

407
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,450
Who would've thought that one day
our kids would be, well, engaged sort of?

408
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,550
I'm mighty proud
of my son's choice, Frieda.

409
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,590
I'm mighty proud of your boy, too.

410
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,790
Excuse us, honey.

411
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,420
I'll see you at dinner tonight. Don't forget.

412
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Dad, I'm no spy.

413
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,940
All I'm asking you to do is keep an eye
on her while I'm in New York.

414
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,750
She likes you, Son. She won't do
anything crazy when you're around.

415
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,330
Virginia, I told you, your father has
the key to that cabinet...

416
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,600
...and he's on the train to New York.

417
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
That's him all over. He keeps it locked.

418
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,470
He doesn't think
anybody should drink but him.

419
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,340
You may be shocking Glenn.

420
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,070
Virginia, after all,
we do have prohibition, you know.

421
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,740
Maybe Glenn doesn't approve of drinking.

422
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,550
Quick, Henry, the flit.

423
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,250
Has your family lived long in town?

424
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,920
They just moved here from Oklahoma.

425
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,890
Oh, I see.

426
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,660
Is your father engaged
in some business in town?

427
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,810
His father is looking for work
and Glenn works at the filling station...

428
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,370
...on the corner of Sycamore and Main.
Anything else you'd like to know?

429
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,810
Ginny, I see no reason at all
for your bad nature.

430
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,180
Bud, you're not eating a thing.

431
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,580
I'm bored!

432
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,620
Come on, let's go.

433
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,820
There's a lovely dessert coming.

434
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,290
I don't want a lovely dessert.
Glenn and I are going for a ride.

435
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,490
Come on.

436
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,760
Deanie and I'll go with you and Glenn.

437
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,140
Wake up.

438
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,310
Hey, Buddy boy, you're a Boy Scout.
Run in and build us a nice, hot fire.

439
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,750
My hair's a mess.

440
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,990
Where?

441
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,250
Here.

442
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,520
Stop it. Stop it.

443
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,690
"Everybody's wild about Mabel

444
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,090
"She's the talk of the town

445
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,390
"Mabel's willing and able

446
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,730
"To show a guy around

447
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,070
"She's a tease, she's a flirt

448
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,870
"You better watch out or you'll get hurt"

449
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,940
Good, Buddy boy.
Now, how about a drink?

450
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,880
I forgot, Buddy boy's in training.

451
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,650
What about you, Deanie girl?
You want a drink?

452
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,280
Come on, Deanie.

453
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,320
Come on, have a little drink. Come on.
Or is Deanie girl in training, too?

454
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,190
Lay off, Ginny.

455
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,990
Why don't you relax?

456
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,760
You're just standing around
like a chaperone.

457
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,570
Is that what you came out here for,
just to chaperone Glenn and me?

458
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,040
Ain't he pretty, Deanie, huh?

459
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,440
My handsome filling-station attendant.

460
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,650
Fill me up, please, I'm empty.

461
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,520
Come on, honey, let's go for a walk.

462
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,590
All right.

463
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,460
Yeah, why don't you go
for a walk upstairs?

464
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,500
Why don't you quit trying to pretend
you're so pure and righteous?

465
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,070
If you weren't my sister--

466
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,930
If I weren't your sister,
you wouldn't do anything.

467
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,530
You never do anything
except what Dad tells you.

468
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,240
Isn't that right, Deanie?
You been finding that out, haven't you?

469
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,940
He just lets things torment him inside
and make him miserable...

470
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,510
...and he never does anything about them.

471
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,520
He never does anything.

472
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,390
'Bye.

473
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,970
All this is gonna be ours someday.

474
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,540
This is the most wonderful Christmas
I've ever had.

475
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,450
Isn't it beautiful? Oh, Dad,
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

476
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,920
I wonder what Bud paid for it?

477
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,080
Why do you always think about the cost?

478
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,220
If you want to know,
I wish it was a lot less and was a ring.

479
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,060
-Don't, Mom, don't.
-Four years, you'll be....

480
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,820
All right, all right.

481
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,590
I just wish that Bud Stamper
had a little more gumption.

482
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,670
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

483
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,910
Still.

484
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,230
Still.

485
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,500
One, two. There.

486
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,050
Thank you.

487
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,540
One more, please.

488
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,310
I don't know why I couldn't have had a car.

489
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,040
Why should I buy you a car?
You got your mother's coupe.

490
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,640
That coupe is a wreck.

491
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,210
-What have you done with your hair?
-I just put a henna rinse in it.

492
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,120
Still.

493
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,480
Still.

494
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll get it.

495
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,630
One. Two. There.

496
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,730
Thank God that's over.

497
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,240
-Hi, Ginny.
-Oh, Brian.

498
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,440
My parents are in there.

499
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,680
-Perfume?
-Arpege.

500
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,270
It's my favorite.
I just have to slip on my dress.

501
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,380
Come meet the folks. Come on.

502
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,660
They're kind of dull,
but you can stand them for a few minutes.

503
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,980
Go on!

504
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,330
-Hello. I'm Ace Stamper.
-I'm Brian Stacey.

505
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,730
-What can I do for you?
-I'm waiting for Ginny.

506
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,040
She may take forever. Come on in.
This is my son, Bud.

507
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,770
Come here, Son.

508
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,380
The boy's captain of the football team.
You heard about him?

509
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,970
I don't get to many games.

510
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,570
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

511
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,670
This is my wife, Mrs. Stamper.

512
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,750
Won't you come in?

513
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,710
Ginny, I want to talk to you.

514
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,080
Come on in.

515
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,760
Ginny, I know who that guy is.

516
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,960
That guy's a bootlegger.

517
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,660
Is he? Here, do me up.

518
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,460
He's married. Do you know that?

519
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,270
How do you know so much about him,
sweetie-pie?

520
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,170
-You're not going out with him.
-Is that so?

521
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,400
-Try to stop me.
-This is Christmas Day.

522
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,480
You'll stay home and you'll be decent
to your mother.

523
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,910
-You're not leaving!
-Get out of my way!

524
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,170
If you want to listen to Dad, go ahead.

525
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,470
One of these days you'll find out.

526
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,910
You'll find out and then God help you.

527
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,180
All right, calm down, everybody.
Come on now, just calm down!

528
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,520
All right, boys, give me a fanfare.
Give me a fanfare.

529
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,490
You people, shut up in there!

530
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,390
Let's crowd around here,
crowd around here.

531
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,540
We'll bring this New Year in right.

532
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,410
For Joe!

533
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,160
Happy New Year!

534
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,790
You look lovely, boy!

535
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,020
You're the prettiest baby here!

536
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,640
Shake that jelly.

537
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,000
Look, Daddy. Happy New Year!

538
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,980
Shake that jelly. Shake it! Shake it!

539
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,550
Daddy, look at us.

540
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,080
Daddy, look!

541
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,590
Come on, move aside.
Hey, let me through there.

542
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,990
Hey, Smokey boy,
let me ring your doorbell.

543
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,360
Happy New Year, Daddy.

544
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,670
You cut that out!

545
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,900
You behave yourself.
You behave yourself, you hear me?

546
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,570
Mr. Stamper, the perfume is coming in.

547
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,670
Yeah, perfume for all the ladies.

548
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,340
Line up, ladies.
Line up to get your perfume.

549
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,150
Come on, get your perfume,
all you ladies.

550
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,250
Happy New Year, Son.
Go on, get in line. There's some for you.

551
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,350
It will be a great year for both of us.

552
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,560
-Dance with me, Dick?
-No thanks, Ginny.

553
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,170
Boy, oh boy, she's really plastered.

554
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,580
Hello, Bill.

555
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,720
She's disgraceful.

556
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,220
It's all she can do to walk.

557
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,750
Why don't her folks
do something about her?

558
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,620
What did she do to her hair?

559
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,690
Charley, will you dance with me?

560
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,090
Not right now, Ginny.

561
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,020
I didn't know you were married.

562
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,450
Hey, look out!

563
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,320
What do you think you're doing?

564
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,400
Happy New Year, Joe!

565
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,160
Go get your sister, Son,
and take her on home.

566
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,300
-Hey, Sis.
-Happy New Year.

567
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,740
Happy New Year.

568
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,900
-Happy New Year.
-What's happy about it?

569
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,380
You want to dance?

570
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,150
Where are you taking me?

571
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,250
-Where are you taking me?
-Sis, let me take you home.

572
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,990
No!

573
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,100
No, I'm not going home.

574
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,890
-Can I do your dress up?
-No.

575
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,370
You're all unsnapped here.

576
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:31,070
Get away. I'm not going home.
And you don't have to dance with me.

577
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,640
Ginny, I like to dance
with a good-looking girl once in a while.

578
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,340
If you weren't my brother
you wouldn't even come near me.

579
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,440
You're a nice boy! You're nice!

580
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,980
I know what you nice boys are like.

581
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,110
I know, you only talk to me in the dark!

582
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,380
In the dark!

583
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,250
You talk to me then, don't you?

584
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,890
You talk to me in the dark, in automobiles!
You talk to me!

585
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,520
You're very familiar then, aren't you?

586
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,830
Get away from me!

587
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,680
Joe, where have you been?

588
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,960
-Where's Joe?
-Here I am.

589
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,780
Come on, Joe. Let's go.

590
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,210
Where?

591
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,580
Anywhere!

592
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,050
Let's go, honey.

593
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,820
Happy New Year!

594
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,220
Hey, come on.

595
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,790
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

596
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,210
I'm dizzy.

597
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,400
No!

598
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,170
Did you see where Arnold went?

599
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,740
-You get stood up, Kay?
-It looks like it.

600
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,860
Bud, would you be an angel, huh?

601
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,580
-I'll love you for the rest of my life.
-I'll go look for him.

602
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,160
Cut it out, it's his sister!

603
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,870
Now lay off, Bill!

604
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,370
Cut it out, I tell you, she's his sister.
He's gone mad.

605
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,180
Stop this fight! Stop this fight!

606
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,540
It wasn't his fault. No one's to blame.

607
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,680
Let's go.

608
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,740
Come on inside a minute. Okay?

609
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,280
-Do you wanna come inside?
-No.

610
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,760
We gotta stop all this kissing
and fooling around, Deanie.

611
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,070
Tell me what's happened.

612
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,760
I just don't think we'd better
see each other for a while.

613
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,970
I have to go. Goodbye.

614
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,320
We planned the whole play around you.

615
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,020
You're supposed to be there.
What's the matter?

616
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,390
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, my foot!

617
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,330
-You keep training?
-Yes, sir.

618
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,160
-Hours? Diet?
-Yes, sir.

619
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,200
All right, let's try it again.

620
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,100
I said, let's try it again.

621
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,970
I want very much to say this:

622
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,770
I want to give most of you
a high compliment on your term paper.

623
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,100
They're the best set of papers
I've ever received.

624
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Bud?

625
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,760
Just a minute.

626
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,740
There's something I've got to tell you.

627
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,140
Your term paper was not very good.

628
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,410
Well, I guess so.

629
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,920
Remember, you've got to do much better...

630
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,780
...if you're going to get into Yale in the fall.

631
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,930
Hi.

632
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,900
I miss you, Bud.

633
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,870
I just wanted to wish you good luck
on the game.

634
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,440
Thanks.

635
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,370
Dr. Smiley.

636
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,520
-Doc?
-Yes, Bud.

637
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,680
-What happened?
-You tell me.

638
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,820
What do you want? What is it?

639
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,260
What's wrong with him?

640
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,390
He just had a fall.
There's nothing to worry about at all.

641
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,660
104°. I recommend the hospital.
There's a lot of pneumonia around.

642
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,530
-Pneumonia?
-My God!

643
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,230
Yes, I know.

644
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,750
I've signed my name to this check.

645
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,780
Pull my boy through
and I'm willing to give you a bonus.

646
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,290
You just fill out the amount,
$5,000, $10,000--

647
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,190
I'm doing everything that can be done.

648
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,820
You just fill out the amount.

649
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,300
I think the boy's going to be all right,
but if he isn't....

650
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,600
What do you mean, "if he isn't"?

651
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,660
Ace, I'm not a very religious man,
but I know what every doctor knows.

652
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,310
You can't reckon with the will of God.

653
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,150
Just say whatever is in your heart,
Wilma Dean.

654
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,450
All I can think of is, "Dear God,
make him well, make him well."

655
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,290
Then that's your prayer.

656
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,730
But aren't there some words I should say
out of the Bible?

657
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,000
I can't think of any that would be better
than your own.

658
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, please, God, make him well.

659
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,020
Make him well.

660
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,270
Well, Bud, in another week or so
you'll be feeling yourself again.

661
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,510
Then spring will be here.

662
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,880
You know what happens
to a young man's fancy in the springtime.

663
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,850
-You go with Del Loomis' girl, don't you?
-Yeah.

664
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,520
Mighty attractive girl.

665
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,550
She sure is.

666
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,600
-I'm pretty nuts about Deanie Loomis.
-I don't blame you.

667
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,330
I mean, I love her.

668
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,270
And she loves me.

669
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,000
But it's no fun to be in love. It hurts.

670
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,710
Every time that we're together...

671
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,710
...I have to...

672
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,950
...remember things.
You know what I mean?

673
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,960
Oh, yes.

674
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,720
I just can't go back to seeing her again.

675
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,960
Not like the way we were doing.
We'd go out every night and...

676
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,870
...I'd hold her and I'd kiss her and...

677
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,230
...I'd just go home.

678
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,710
I mean, a guy can go nuts that way.

679
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,450
I don't know how to advise you, Bud.

680
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,960
My dad said...

681
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,360
...that I should get another kind of a girl.

682
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,470
No.

683
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,840
But when you don't really want
another girl....

684
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,670
No.

685
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,280
I don't know.

686
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,020
Come in again Friday, Bud.
I'll give you another shot of iron...

687
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,020
...and another sun-lamp treatment.

688
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,260
Okay, Doc.

689
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,160
So long.

690
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,610
Hi, Deanie.

691
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,350
And that was the surest way to lose him.

692
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,790
What did you say?

693
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,960
-He's an animal.
-He is not.

694
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,560
-Yes, he is. I met him.
-You don't know him.

695
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,190
Who's an animal?

696
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,630
-You're out.
-I am not.

697
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,800
Yes, you are.

698
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,970
-I hurt my finger.
-I'll kiss it and make it better.

699
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,780
"What though the radiance
which was once so bright

700
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,050
"Is now for ever taken from my sight...

701
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,230
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...

702
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,230
"...of glory in the flower;

703
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,700
"We will grieve not, rather find

704
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,860
"Strength in what remains behind...."

705
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,010
What do you suppose the poet means
by these lines?

706
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,730
Deanie Loomis?

707
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,760
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

708
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,340
I didn't hear the question.

709
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,770
I know it's spring but I must ask you
to pay more attention.

710
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,800
I'm sorry.

711
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,680
I quoted some lines from Wordsworth's
Ode on Intimations of Immortality.

712
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,840
Did you hear them?

713
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,720
I'm afraid not, Miss Metcalf.

714
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,550
Then I must ask you to turn your text
to Page 380.

715
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,690
Yes, l....

716
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,630
You read the lines to me.

717
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,340
Yes.

718
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,840
Stand please.

719
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,020
"Though nothing can bring back the hour

720
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,030
"Of splendor in the grass...

721
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,130
"...of glory in the flower;

722
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,170
"We will grieve not, rather find

723
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,440
"Strength in what remains behind...."

724
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,100
Perhaps you can tell me
exactly what the poet means...

725
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,700
...by such expressions as
"splendor in the grass"...

726
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,750
...and "glory in the flower."

727
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,620
I think it has some....

728
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,530
Yes?

729
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,060
Well, when we're young...

730
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,870
...we look at things very idealistically,
I guess.

731
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,970
And I think Wordsworth means...

732
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,350
...that when we grow up...

733
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:29,420
...that we have to forget
the ideals of youth...

734
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,200
...and find strength....

735
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,840
Miss Metcalf...

736
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,210
...may I please be....

737
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,490
Children!

738
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,820
I'll go see what's the matter.

739
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,980
-Hi, June.
-Hi.

740
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,550
I just gave her a sedative.

741
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,380
-I'm not sick.
-She'll be all right in a little while.

742
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,610
Now lie down.

743
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,210
I'm all right. I'm perfectly all right.

744
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,590
Stop that.

745
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,060
I'm all right.

746
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:45,130
I don't care if his father is making
my folks rich. I hate Bud Stamper.

747
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,710
-You'd take a date if he asked you.
-I would not.

748
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,330
-You know you would.
-I absolutely would not.

749
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,710
Here he comes.

750
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,750
Hi.

751
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,980
All right.

752
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,170
Why aren't you going out
for track this year?

753
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,710
Got all that work to make up
from when I was sick.

754
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,910
You going to Yale? You going to Yale?

755
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,310
Yeah, if my grades are good enough.

756
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,220
How come you're not dating Deanie
anymore?

757
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,520
I'm just not.

758
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,560
I guess I'll just go to cow college.
I'm only a farmer and I know it.

759
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,630
Hot dog! Now it's my chance.

760
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,190
Any objections?

761
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,300
I can't stop you.

762
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,980
Deanie! Come on, honey, supper's ready.

763
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,330
Deanie! Come on, honey.

764
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,090
Deanie, come on! Supper's getting cold!

765
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:32,240
Veal roast, mashed potatoes
and succotash for my girl.

766
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,110
Eat a good meal, Deanie.
Make you feel better.

767
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,950
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

768
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,200
Eat your dinner.

769
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,640
Seventy-six and three-eighths!
What do you know about that, huh?

770
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,240
Seventy-six and three-eighths! Oh, Del!
Did you hear that, Deanie?

771
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,380
We are rich! We are rich!

772
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,280
I'll bet the Stampers are feeling good
these days.

773
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:20,730
Honey, we'll send you to college.
We'll get a new car. That I promise.

774
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,260
Saw young Stamper driving this afternoon.

775
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,200
Crowd of boys in the car.
Brand new car his father got him.

776
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,740
Deanie, stop it! Stop carrying on this way!

777
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,890
Mom, I can't eat. I can't study.

778
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,390
I can't even face my friends anymore.

779
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:53,450
I wanna die. I wanna die.

780
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,570
Do you feel better, dear?

781
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,570
Oh, yes.

782
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,210
Oh, yes.

783
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,450
Nothing like a good soak.

784
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,980
Deanie, tell me,
what's been the matter the past few days?

785
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,260
I'm sorry I've troubled you.

786
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,830
I don't want to worry you.

787
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,170
I don't want to worry anyone.

788
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,340
Is it all on account of...because of Bud?

789
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,660
Because he doesn't call for you anymore?

790
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,240
I don't know.

791
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,640
I don't know, Mom.

792
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:48,650
I want to call him and tell him--

793
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:52,910
Don't you dare! Don't you dare, Mom!
Don't you dare!

794
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:53,990
I won't!

795
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:03,260
Mother, you do something like that,
I'll do something desperate!

796
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:06,830
I will! I will, Mom! I will!

797
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,330
Deanie, how serious have
you and Bud become?

798
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,330
I mean....

799
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,910
You know what I mean.

800
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,790
Had anything serious happened?

801
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,180
Did he spoil you?

802
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,600
Spoil?

803
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:37,600
Did he spoil me? No!

804
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,100
No, Mom! I'm not spoiled!

805
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,030
I'm not spoiled, Mom!

806
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:54,450
I'm just as fresh and virginal
like the day I was born, Mom!

807
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,610
Stop it! Stop it!

808
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,280
I'm a virgin who wouldn't think
of being spoiled!

809
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,550
-Stop it, please!
-I've been a good little girl!

810
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,590
A good little, good little girl!

811
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:05,020
I've always done everything
Daddy and Mommy told me!

812
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,420
I've obeyed every word!

813
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,890
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

814
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,400
-Help me.
-What's wrong? People can hear her.

815
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,560
What will we do?

816
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,240
Leave me alone!

817
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,140
What'll we do with her?

818
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,070
Give her some of that medicine.

819
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,940
I hate to give it to her so often.

820
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,540
I'm not spoiled! I'm not spoiled!

821
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,480
What else can we do?

822
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,780
Open this door, dear.
Deanie, open the door.

823
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,530
What are you doing?

824
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,200
Maybe we should take her to Wichita
like Doc Smiley suggested.

825
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:53,770
A psychiatrist?

826
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,810
It'll take money,
but I'll sell the stocks if I must.

827
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,480
I can't believe it's that serious.
She's bound to get over it in time.

828
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:07,040
There's never been any mental trouble
in either of our families.

829
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:18,820
Who's this?

830
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,730
Probably one of her school friends.

831
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,800
How do you do, folks?
My name is Alan Tuttle.

832
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,270
They call me Toots.

833
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,740
Yes, I've heard Deanie speak of you.

834
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:31,810
How do you do?

835
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,680
I thought I'd drop in
and say hello to Deanie.

836
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,350
Hi, Deanie.

837
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,980
Hi, Toots.

838
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,190
How are you feeling, Deanie?

839
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,260
I feel all right.

840
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,290
If you two young folks will pardon us....
It's almost time for supper.

841
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,170
Very nice to have met you, folks.

842
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,640
What have you done to your hair?

843
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:06,040
Enjoyed meeting you, too, Toots.

844
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,640
I've been meaning to come for a long time
to see how you were getting along.

845
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,320
Thanks, Toots.

846
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,360
You look fine.

847
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,450
But she's out there in her robe.

848
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,760
Thank you, Toots.

849
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,310
So I was wondering if maybe...

850
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,370
...you would like to go to the dance.

851
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,080
I'd probably be an awful drip
at the dance, Toots.

852
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,820
Why don't you say you'll go?

853
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:51,520
And if anything happens, you change
your mind or you don't feel like it....

854
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,670
Have a wonderful time.

855
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,800
-I'll take good care of her, Mrs. Loomis.
-Thank you.

856
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:14,310
Good night, Deanie.

857
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,610
Good night.

858
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,450
I'll leave the door open.

859
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,920
And, Deanie, don't stay out too late.

860
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,260
"Don't stay out too late."
Did you hear her?

861
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,790
She's been saying that
ever since I was knee high.

862
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,090
I used to think it meant something,
but it doesn't. Doesn't mean a thing.

863
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,170
Hello, Deanie. Glad to see you.

864
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,720
-Hello, Toots.
-Hello, Coach.

865
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,260
You look just beautiful. Look at your hair.

866
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,270
-Your dress is beautiful.
-You look gorgeous.

867
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,460
He's here. And guess who with? Kay.

868
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,400
Would you dance with me, Toots?

869
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,240
All right with you, Deanie?

870
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,300
Sure.

871
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:55,380
Sure, go ahead.

872
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,780
Come on.

873
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,860
How are you, Deanie?

874
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,570
All right, I guess. I don't know.

875
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,760
How are you?

876
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,270
All right, I guess.

877
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,200
You like?

878
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,410
Come on outside for a cigarette.

879
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,520
Okay.

880
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,060
When did you start smoking?

881
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:43,720
The past few weeks.
I had to do something.

882
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,390
Mom had a fit, but she doesn't
say anything anymore.

883
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,680
I know why you quit coming by.

884
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,680
-Let's not talk about it.
-I've got to talk about it.

885
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:05,120
All I've done the past couple of months
is just sit home...

886
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,550
...and think about it.

887
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,250
Hey, get out of there.

888
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,850
You said you wouldn't see him anymore,
and here you are in his car.

889
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,190
Deanie, I want to tell you something.

890
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,000
Every night after dinner I force myself
from going to the telephone and calling.

891
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,870
Deanie, I think about you all the time.

892
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,140
Where's your car?

893
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,220
Come on.

894
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,720
Please, Bud. Please.

895
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,420
Deanie, cut it out.

896
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,620
Now, Bud.

897
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,930
Deanie, you're a nice girl.

898
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,130
I'm not.

899
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,400
I'm not a nice girl.

900
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:00,140
Come on, cut it out.

901
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,940
I just can't go on like this anymore.

902
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,980
Now come on, we're gonna go back inside.

903
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,080
No, I don't want to go back inside.

904
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,810
I want to stay here with you. I want you!

905
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,050
-This isn't the way it should be.
-Why not?

906
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,990
-Why not? Why don't you want it?
-You're not yourself.

907
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,720
Deanie, where's your pride?

908
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,450
My pride? My pride?

909
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,760
-I don't care about my pride!
-Deanie, stop it!

910
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,230
Stop it, Deanie! Deanie, stop!

911
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,500
Go on, go on! I haven't any pride!

912
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,030
I haven't any pride!

913
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,010
Oh, God! What am I gonna do with you?

914
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,570
I don't care what you do.

915
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,180
I don't care what happens!

916
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,150
I haven't any pride!

917
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,350
I just want to die! I just want to die!

918
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:08,130
Take me away from here. Take me away.

919
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,620
It's okay. Come on.

920
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,750
I put some bread on to set.
We'll have homemade bread for a few days.

921
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,060
What are you thinking about, Del?

922
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,060
I'm worrying about our little girl.

923
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:44,000
She's all right now. She's at the dance.
I'll bet you she's having the time of her life.

924
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,400
Drink your milk.

925
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,700
Stop it!

926
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,270
Stop it!

927
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,410
Don't, Bud, don't!

928
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,680
Bud?

929
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,520
Deanie, come back here!
Where are you going?

930
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,770
Deanie, come back!

931
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,100
Stop it!

932
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,650
Deanie, come back here!

933
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,670
Hey, you can't go up there!

934
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,210
Hey, you, come back here!

935
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,340
Hey, you, come back here!

936
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,850
Isn't that Deanie Loomis?

937
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,850
What's the matter with you? Come here!

938
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,590
What's the matter with you? Come here!

939
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,440
She dove in. What's wrong with that girl?

940
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,870
Get away! Leave me alone!

941
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:51,150
She hasn't spoken a word of sense
since they brought her in here.

942
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,790
Stay close to her.

943
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:00,960
-Any word?
-No, not yet.

944
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,090
Not yet.

945
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,910
Not yet.

946
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,140
My baby. Why did she do it?

947
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,450
I don't want to see you ever again.

948
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,850
Mama, quit talking like that.

949
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:24,320
I don't care. He's the cause
of all her trouble.

950
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,580
He's the cause.

951
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,160
-What did you do to her tonight?
-No, Mama!

952
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,520
I want him to answer me.

953
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,360
She doesn't mean what she says.

954
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:36,700
I do, too.

955
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,010
My little girl. I want my little girl.

956
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,270
Mama, quit getting all worked up.

957
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,540
How can I help getting worked up...

958
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:51,210
...when my baby, my baby lies there
fighting for her life?

959
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,980
Frieda, I'm sorry.

960
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,390
By george, Del,
I'm sorry to hear about this.

961
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:12,200
-Is she all right?
-They don't know what's the matter yet.

962
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:19,210
Your daughter is
in a very nervous condition.

963
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:22,210
-Can I see my baby?
-No, not now. Perhaps tomorrow.

964
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,240
Have you thought about
what I suggested to you?

965
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,720
Yes. I'm going through with it.

966
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,750
I'll sell those stocks and send her off
to Wichita as soon as she's ready to leave.

967
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,350
Good. I'll make the arrangements for you.

968
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,990
It's time you and I were home in bed.

969
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:45,570
I'm gonna marry Deanie.
I don't care what he says, Doc.

970
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,130
-Good night, Bud.
-Good night, Mr. Loomis.

971
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,970
I'm of legal age. I don't care what he says,
I'm gonna marry her.

972
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,670
Bud, do you want to help Deanie?
Then stay away from her.

973
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,690
-For how long?
-I don't know.

974
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,760
I don't know now. No one does.

975
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,350
Who's that?

976
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,250
Who's there? Who's there?

977
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,390
There's nobody. Nobody.

978
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,290
There was somebody here.
Somebody was here.

979
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,360
Somebody was here.

980
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,210
You have another letter from your father.

981
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,470
I'm beginning to think you want
to be thrown out of school.

982
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,950
Angelina, do you think I could have...

983
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:49,720
...another one of these home brew?

984
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,290
Mister, you drink! You're gonna get sick.

985
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:58,920
Let me bring you some food.
Would you like something to eat?

986
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,470
My mother's making some pizza.
Would you like some pizza?

987
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,960
What is pizza?

988
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:09,170
You don't know what pizza is?
Where are you from?

989
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:11,800
From Kansas.

990
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:15,600
Where is that?

991
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,050
It's right in the middle of the USA.

992
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,490
So that's where your home is.

993
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,530
Is it nice out there in Kansas?

994
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,170
Yep.

995
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,970
It's very friendly.

996
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,640
That's what it's like, it's friendly.

997
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,770
Everybody knows your name
and they know who you are and....

998
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:54,280
Why don't you go back?

999
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,960
You must have a sweetheart out there.

1000
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:01,320
I did.

1001
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,070
Come in the kitchen with me.

1002
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,600
Mama will give you some pizza.

1003
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:22,110
Have some pizza.

1004
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,570
Come on.

1005
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:33,220
That's fine, you're up.

1006
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:35,920
You all right?

1007
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,460
What?

1008
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:45,170
Are you all right, mister?

1009
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:46,970
Sure you are.

1010
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,640
Sit on that bench.
I'll be right with you. All right?

1011
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,740
No, that's for Mr. Mangialomino.

1012
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,060
What do you think about that?

1013
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:14,260
Squint your eyes a bit.
What would Cézanne say to that?

1014
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:15,630
That's swell, Deanie.

1015
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,740
I never thought I could do this well, really.

1016
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,170
It looks better with one eye closed.

1017
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,150
Oh, you!

1018
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:33,850
I like metalwork, though. You can
get rid of a lot of hostilities this way.

1019
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:34,920
Watch.

1020
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:39,950
Every time I pound,
I tell myself it's my old man.

1021
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,130
My old man had his heart set on
my being a surgeon.

1022
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:51,840
Well, not just a surgeon
but the greatest surgeon who ever lived.

1023
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,110
So, anyway, I couldn't make that first cut.

1024
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:04,150
That first cut into the flesh
of another man's body.

1025
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:07,820
I shook. I couldn't keep my hands steady.

1026
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,450
You can still be an M.D.
when you get out, though.

1027
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,190
If I ever get out.

1028
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:15,930
Johnny, don't talk like that.

1029
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:17,760
I'm kidding, I hope.

1030
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:20,530
Deanie, your parents are
in the waiting room.

1031
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,430
Mother and Dad are here?

1032
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,680
My folks are here. I haven't seen them
for six months. Not since I've been here.

1033
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,580
I hope these people know
what they're doing.

1034
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,660
How much longer are they going
to keep her here?

1035
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,330
Here she comes.

1036
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,370
Don't let Deanie see you looking this way.

1037
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:17,210
-My baby! My little baby!
-Hi, Mother. It's good to see you.

1038
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,790
Daddy! It's so good to see you.

1039
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:23,660
Doesn't she look just fine, Del?

1040
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:27,160
They can't tell me there's anything wrong
with my little baby.

1041
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:29,860
She's just as sound and normal
as the next one--

1042
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:32,060
I brought our little girl a box of candy.

1043
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,470
Thank you, Daddy.

1044
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:37,270
All the girls in your old gang
wanted to tell you hello.

1045
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:40,170
Your father had to go
and tell everyone where you are.

1046
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,040
I'm not ashamed, Mom.

1047
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,240
Sit down.

1048
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,080
Well, now lets see.

1049
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,590
Kay's gone off to Miss Finch's school.
Very elegant.

1050
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:55,560
Her folks are very wealthy now, you know.

1051
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,950
And June. June calls about you
every week or so.

1052
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,500
-I guess you know she married Bob.
-Yes.

1053
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:08,130
Carolyn and June are off at the university.
Now Carolyn pledged Pi Phi.

1054
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:11,640
Hazel pledged Kappa. Which is better?

1055
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,310
-I don't know.
-The university isn't far from here.

1056
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,790
Maybe you'd like them to come
and see you some Saturday.

1057
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:33,160
I don't think so, Mom.

1058
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:38,370
No, no, I guess not.

1059
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,730
I guess it wouldn't be...suitable.

1060
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,340
There's nothing the matter with you,
you just remember that.

1061
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:54,180
You are perfectly all right.

1062
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:00,190
Just as well off as Kay or June or Hazel
or any of those girls.

1063
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,670
Maybe....

1064
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:30,780
Deanie, would you like to have dinner
with us tonight down at the hotel?

1065
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:39,630
Deanie's had a very trying day,
she's too tired.

1066
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:41,560
Yes, I'm awfully....

1067
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,700
We're not gonna see any more of you?

1068
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,870
This is all we get to see of you?

1069
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,480
Mom, I'm sorry.

1070
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:05,660
We drove all the way up here
just to be with our baby.

1071
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,960
Now they tell us we can't be
with her tonight.

1072
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,620
You want what's best for your daughter,
don't you, Mrs. Loomis?

1073
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,120
Yes.

1074
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:19,370
Yes, I want what's best for my daughter.

1075
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,900
We'll take our little girl out to dinner...

1076
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:24,200
I'm sorry.

1077
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,350
...the next time we come up, Mama.

1078
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,520
Mom kept calling me her baby...

1079
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,390
...and Dad kept calling me his little girl.

1080
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,390
Dr. Judd, don't they realize I'm me?

1081
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:54,700
You're the one that's got to change.
They can't.

1082
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:58,040
I don't think I could ever go
back home again.

1083
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,840
I don't think I can feel the same way
I used to feel about them.

1084
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,540
You'll just have to accept them as people,
with a lot of faults maybe...

1085
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,550
...but not as Mama and Papa.

1086
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,750
As people?

1087
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:17,700
You know, we blame our parents
for everything these days.

1088
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:21,790
You've gotta remember
they had parents, too.

1089
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,990
I suppose.

1090
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,640
You had a mama and a papa, too?

1091
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,810
Oh, yes, most assuredly.

1092
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:35,980
That'll be all, Deanie. You can go now.

1093
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,280
I'll see you tomorrow.

1094
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,790
Have you heard from that young man?

1095
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,600
What was his name?

1096
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,860
Bud?

1097
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:01,140
No.

1098
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,730
No, we've given up writing.

1099
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:08,940
I guess he's probably away at school.

1100
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:14,450
I don't know. No one ever writes me
anything about him.

1101
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:20,180
I guess they're afraid it would upset me.

1102
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,030
Would it?

1103
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:32,100
Maybe you'll feel a little stronger
about it in time.

1104
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:34,800
I hope so.

1105
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:57,790
I'll bet they've been practicing
some of that Freud on her.

1106
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,530
I've read about him.
All he's concerned about is sex.

1107
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:05,260
And it's costing us every blessed penny
we made on our stocks.

1108
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,600
If we could've held onto those stocks,
we would've made a fortune.

1109
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:13,040
I don't think it's very polite of you to turn
on the radio when I'm talking to you.

1110
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:14,910
Stock prices crashed today...

1111
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:18,610
...in the most disastrous trading ever
on the New York Stock Exchange.

1112
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,050
$14 billion was lost
in the nation-wide attempt to unload.

1113
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:26,620
Sell out? What do you mean, sell out?
You're getting panicky like everybody else.

1114
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:28,630
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1115
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:32,930
Now just don't get panicky, Jack.
Don't lose your courage.

1116
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:34,920
Come in.

1117
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,300
Hang on, Jack, just hang on.
Just hang in there.

1118
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,870
No, I can't go on with this right now, Jack.

1119
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:44,600
Sit down, friend, I'll be right with you.

1120
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:46,380
I'm in New Haven.

1121
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,870
My kid's in school up here.

1122
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:54,250
Oh, hell, he's doing just fine.
Flunking every course, but otherwise fine.

1123
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:59,020
He'll be all right.
I got an idea what's wrong with him.

1124
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:02,420
Yeah, I'll be calling you.

1125
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,300
-What'd you find out?
-You were right.

1126
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,160
-Who is she?
-She's a waitress.

1127
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:10,360
Waitress?

1128
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:12,800
In a pizza place. It's all right here.

1129
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,110
Do you want a drink?

1130
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,200
Bud, suppose you tell us--

1131
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,680
He hasn't been applying himself.
I know my boy.

1132
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:25,680
He could pass any course you offer here.
Flying colors, straight A's.

1133
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:26,840
Thank you.

1134
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,090
Suppose you tell us
what you think is the matter, Bud.

1135
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,430
Have you really been interested
in your work here at Yale?

1136
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:46,000
What difference does that make?
I sent you here to graduate.

1137
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:49,470
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but--

1138
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:52,200
Now why don't we just talk turkey, Son?

1139
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,440
Tell us what's been on your mind.
What's been eating your time and energy?

1140
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,140
A long-distance call from New York
for Mr. Stamper.

1141
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:02,480
-Where can I take it?
-Urgent. Right this way, sir.

1142
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,200
Is there anything you'd rather
be doing now than going to school here?

1143
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:20,040
To tell you the truth, Dean Pollard,
I never wanted to do a thing but ranch.

1144
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:21,640
But, Dad....

1145
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:24,970
I've never had the belief
that everybody should go to college.

1146
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:27,840
Well, maybe you could talk to him.

1147
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:32,070
He isn't a very good listener really, is he?

1148
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:41,860
I gotta get back to New York right away.

1149
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,830
Bud, suppose you let me talk
to your father.

1150
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,300
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

1151
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:51,600
I'll see you back in your room, Son.

1152
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,710
Dean Pollard, what's the matter
with people?

1153
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,400
What do you mean?

1154
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,710
The whole town of New York
is jumping out of windows.

1155
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:05,040
I mean, they're quitting.

1156
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:08,590
And things are gonna get back to normal
in a couple of days.

1157
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:10,880
-You really think so?
-I know so! I know so!

1158
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:12,920
They've got to! They've got to!

1159
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:15,890
Now, about the boy....

1160
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:20,530
I'm gonna take him to New York with me.

1161
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:25,870
I'll have him back here Monday morning
ready to settle down and go to work.

1162
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:31,600
I must say, Mr. Stamper, I do not feel
that the boy should remain in school here.

1163
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:34,410
Please don't give up on him.

1164
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:37,510
Don't give up on him, Dean Pollard.

1165
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:43,190
I had to go through something like this
with him once before.

1166
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:48,050
He falls for some little girl
and then that's all he can think about.

1167
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:52,650
-I don't think that's it, Mr. Stamper.
-I think that's it! I think that's it!

1168
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:57,500
I think I've known him a little bit longer
and a little bit better than you have!

1169
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,830
I had to break something like this before!
I'll break it up again!

1170
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:03,970
I'll have him Monday morning
ready to go to work!

1171
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:16,820
Kewpie dolls.

1172
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,920
Kewpie dolls.

1173
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,920
Would you like a Kewpie doll
for your cutie-pie?

1174
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:24,090
-Yeah. How much are they?
-$50.

1175
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,220
All right, you fish $50 out of there
and you give me the rest back.

1176
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:33,270
Thank you.

1177
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,540
Thank you.

1178
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,710
'Bye.

1179
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:37,770
'Bye.

1180
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:51,790
They all look the same in this town.

1181
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,830
The newlyweds. Stand up.
Give the little girl a hand.

1182
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:11,740
Hello, suckers.

1183
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,410
I think I smell fresh money tonight.

1184
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:22,580
I'm glad the stock market crash
didn't keep you from coming out tonight.

1185
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:28,460
Tonight as I was walking
down Park Avenue to get a taxi...

1186
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:33,130
...I had to dodge the bodies
jumping out of the windows.

1187
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:36,430
But let's not be morbid.

1188
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,230
-Same all around?
-No, no more for me.

1189
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,670
Same all around.

1190
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,120
Lay one on me. Lay one on.

1191
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:53,810
Doggone.

1192
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:55,520
Dad, let's go.

1193
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:57,420
Wait, Bud, wait a minute.

1194
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,420
The point I'm trying to make, Bud....

1195
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:03,690
I never have been able to make
this one point with you, Son.

1196
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,300
Bud, listen....

1197
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:16,470
I may not be around
too much longer and....

1198
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:19,180
What are you talking about?

1199
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,210
Wait now. Don't act so worried.
I got no intention of kicking off for a while.

1200
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,150
What are you leading up to?

1201
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,950
It may be that I haven't always done
the right thing by you, boy...

1202
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:36,360
...and I'm sorry.

1203
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:39,790
There may be things
I might have taken away.

1204
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:44,400
I'd like to make it up to you.

1205
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,010
Forget it, Dad.

1206
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:15,920
Look up there.
Look up there on that stage.

1207
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:17,730
Deanie.

1208
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:24,240
Yeah, she does look a little like Deanie.

1209
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:28,340
Little, hell! Hell, a little! Exactly!
Same damn thing! Exactly!

1210
01:43:28,650 --> 01:43:31,910
Same damn thing! Just as pretty!
Just as pretty!

1211
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:35,590
You never been fair to me on that.
I did that for your own good.

1212
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:39,060
How'd you like to be married to her now?
Did you ever think about that?

1213
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:43,220
Ever think of how you'd like to be married
to Deanie with her in that institute?

1214
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:45,730
Did you ever think about it?
How'd you like that?

1215
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:48,600
How'd you like that?
Her in that institution?

1216
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,660
What the hell difference does it make?

1217
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:55,640
That's the same thing!
That's the same thing exactly!

1218
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:59,800
And just as pretty! Just as pretty!
You look up there, just as pretty!

1219
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:03,710
You want that? Do you want it, Son?
Son, you want it, you can have it!

1220
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:07,550
You can have it, boy. I'll get it for you.
You can have anything you want.

1221
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:10,680
Anything you want, boy!
This world is your oyster!

1222
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:13,660
You sit here, I'll show you.
You sit there, I'll show you.

1223
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,280
You sit there, I'll show you.

1224
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,720
Yeah?

1225
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,730
Are you Bud?

1226
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,540
Yes, ma'am.

1227
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:08,610
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

1228
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:18,490
I'm sorry, but...

1229
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:22,030
...I think you must've got the wrong room.

1230
01:45:58,530 --> 01:45:59,660
Mr. Stamper?

1231
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,000
Mr. Stamper!

1232
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:36,190
That's him.

1233
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:38,300
What do you want to do with...?

1234
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:42,140
I'll take him home.

1235
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:04,530
I'll be home in a few hours.

1236
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,890
The first time in....

1237
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,400
Two years and six months
almost to the day.

1238
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,230
How do you feel about going home?

1239
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:14,340
Like going to a foreign country.

1240
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,510
John has asked me to marry him.

1241
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,410
You waited until now to tell me?

1242
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,360
Well.

1243
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:34,730
Are you going to accept?

1244
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:36,460
I don't know.

1245
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,450
Do you love John?

1246
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,000
I think so.

1247
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,960
It's different from the way
that I felt about...

1248
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,340
...Bud.

1249
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,270
But, l...

1250
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:57,940
...I love him.

1251
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:02,550
Well, I see no reason why both of you
shouldn't have a very happy future.

1252
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:07,450
John's back in Cincinnati now,
practicing medicine, doing very well.

1253
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,320
I know.

1254
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,990
I hear from him every day.

1255
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:18,300
My taxi.

1256
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:25,010
Taxi's here.

1257
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:30,370
Will you see Bud when you're home?

1258
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:32,410
I don't know.

1259
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:35,120
Do you think you'll be happy
married to John if...

1260
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:38,950
...you still don't know how you feel
about the other young man?

1261
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:44,220
When we face these fears
they sometimes turn into nothing.

1262
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,970
All right, Dr. Judd.

1263
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,910
I'll see him.

1264
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,480
I'll write to you.

1265
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:23,500
Bye-bye.

1266
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,120
Why couldn't you marry a boy from here?

1267
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:52,030
You won't be much company for me,
living back East in Cincinnati.

1268
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:54,720
What do you know about
this young man you're marrying?

1269
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:58,390
After all, you met him in a mental hospital.
Are you sure he's all right?

1270
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,940
I was in the hospital, too.

1271
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,060
Well, with you it was different.
You were just run down.

1272
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,910
That was the only thing
the matter with you.

1273
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:09,270
Is he a New Dealer?

1274
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,710
I don't know.

1275
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:16,380
I could cry, just cry, when I think
I'm going to lose my little girl.

1276
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:19,490
How much did this cost?

1277
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,450
I don't know, Mother.

1278
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:34,030
Did those doctors at the hospital...

1279
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:37,370
...say your mother had raised you wrong
or something?

1280
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:41,410
Did they blame your father...

1281
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:45,480
...and me in any way?

1282
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:52,650
I don't blame anyone, Mother.

1283
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:57,360
I raised you the only way I knew how.
The only way I knew how.

1284
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:59,760
The way my mother raised me...

1285
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,400
...and I suppose the way
her mother raised her.

1286
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:09,140
If I brought you up wrong, Deanie,
I don't think you should hate me.

1287
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,900
I know I used to hate my mother at times...

1288
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:19,480
...but I always believed she was right
about things. Maybe she wasn't...

1289
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,820
...but I loved her.

1290
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,350
I love you, Mother.

1291
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,130
I hope so, Deanie.

1292
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:53,650
You know it would be nice if children
could be born into this world...

1293
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:58,750
...with an absolute guarantee they'd have
just the right kind of bringing up...

1294
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:01,480
...and all lead happy, normal lives, but....

1295
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:07,400
Well, I guess when we get born
we just all have to take our chances.

1296
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,730
Mom?

1297
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:14,270
Is he married?

1298
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,410
Who?

1299
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:22,000
To tell you the truth, Deanie,
I don't really know.

1300
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:26,480
Don't be afraid of running into him.
Maybe he's living with his mother in Tulsa.

1301
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:29,610
She joined her folks there
after old Ace killed himself.

1302
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:33,250
They say she's as poor as a church mouse.
And that girl Ginny?

1303
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:35,390
Got killed in a car accident.

1304
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:39,490
We all knew something like that
would happen the way she carried on.

1305
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:44,900
Now the Stampers are almost extinct
in this town.

1306
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:50,210
You know their home's been turned
into a funeral parlor?

1307
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:54,680
Some of the old gang's here
to see you, Deanie.

1308
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,610
-I can't wait to see her.
-It seems simply ages.

1309
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,440
How is she, Mr. Loomis?

1310
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:04,350
She's fine.

1311
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:29,170
Come on, come for a ride with us.

1312
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:32,550
All right, but give me two minutes
to wash the train off.

1313
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,430
Just one thing:

1314
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,930
Keep her away from Bud Stamper.

1315
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,830
Mrs. Loomis, she's forgotten about all that.

1316
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:50,370
No, she hasn't. Have some fudge.

1317
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,330
The very first thing she did
was ask about him.

1318
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:57,100
And then she laid on the bed
and cried and cried.

1319
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:01,100
I thought that the years away
she'd forget about him but....

1320
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,710
Now I want you to promise me.

1321
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:14,790
The doctors say she's perfectly all right,
but there's no use in asking for trouble.

1322
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,750
Keep her away from him.

1323
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:26,870
Well, here's our girl.

1324
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,270
I want to see Bud now.

1325
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:39,280
Now, honey, you just forget about him.

1326
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,080
I'm not even sure where he is now, Deanie.

1327
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,810
I mean, no one ever sees him.
Do you know where he is, Hazel?

1328
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:48,950
He's staying out at his father's old ranch.

1329
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:23,490
-It's a long way out there.
-I want to go, please.

1330
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:36,360
Clear out of there!

1331
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:42,510
You want me to go looking for Bud?

1332
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,340
Oh, Hazel, would you?

1333
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,800
He's around back.

1334
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:17,520
I know.

1335
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,490
Hi, Bud. Jeepers, you're a mess.

1336
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:30,290
Yeah, I've been working.
We have 40 head of cattle now.

1337
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,120
Bud, Deanie's out there in the car.

1338
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:45,410
-I hate to see Deanie when I'm so dirty.
-She won't mind, Bud.

1339
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:54,080
How is she?

1340
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:56,150
She seems just fine.

1341
01:56:58,290 --> 01:56:59,760
Well, I'm glad.

1342
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:06,890
Hi, Bud.

1343
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:27,650
Long time no see.

1344
01:57:28,990 --> 01:57:30,180
Long time.

1345
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,450
It's good to see you.

1346
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:34,650
Thanks, Bud.

1347
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,540
You want to meet my family?

1348
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,440
Of course.

1349
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:58,780
Come on.

1350
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,010
She didn't even know he was married.

1351
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,250
You're her best friend.
Why didn't you tell her?

1352
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,520
I just couldn't.

1353
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,560
Come here, honey,
I want you to meet somebody.

1354
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,230
Hello.

1355
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:25,600
Angelina, this is Deanie,
an old friend of mine.

1356
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,940
How do you do?

1357
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,210
How do you do, Angelina?

1358
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:37,550
Would you like to come in?

1359
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:39,110
Please.

1360
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:42,690
Come in.

1361
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:48,230
Hungry?

1362
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:52,630
The house, it doesn't look like much.

1363
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,940
-Maybe I can offer you some wine.
-Thank you, but I really can't stay.

1364
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,040
This is Bud Junior.

1365
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:02,980
The one without the feathers.

1366
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,750
Oh, sure.

1367
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,690
Hello, Bud Junior. Hello.

1368
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:18,730
What a fine boy you are!

1369
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:32,710
So now we're expecting another child.
I hope it's a girl this time.

1370
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:35,840
You're a fine boy.

1371
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:45,250
Well, I have to go now.

1372
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:50,760
You will come back again sometime?
Will you come back for dinner?

1373
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,330
Thank you, Angelina.

1374
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,490
I married Angie when I left New Haven.

1375
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:24,390
You know I didn't even finish
my first year there?

1376
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,990
She's real nice.

1377
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,930
She was wonderful to me
when things started to go wrong.

1378
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:32,100
You're happy, Bud?

1379
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:37,330
I guess so.

1380
02:00:39,210 --> 02:00:42,110
I don't ask myself that question
very often now.

1381
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,880
How about you?

1382
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,780
I'm getting married next month.

1383
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:51,220
Are you, Deanie?

1384
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,750
A boy from Cincinnati.

1385
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,560
I think you might like him.

1386
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:10,000
Things work out awful funny sometimes,
don't they?

1387
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,970
Yes, they do.

1388
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:19,140
Hope you're gonna be awful happy.

1389
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:23,980
Like you, Bud, I don't think too much
about happiness either.

1390
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:30,150
What's the point?
You gotta take what comes.

1391
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,220
Yes.

1392
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:00,180
I'm awful glad to see you again.

1393
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,220
Thanks, Bud.

1394
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:07,690
Goodbye.

1395
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:10,930
'Bye.

1396
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,760
So long, Bud.

1397
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:16,130
Hello.

1398
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:19,800
-You girls have to come again sometime.
-You might ask us.

1399
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:23,640
I will. I promise. Angie and I got
a little more money coming in now.

1400
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,940
We'll have a big beer party. She'll call you.

1401
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:27,210
-It's a date.
-Great.

1402
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,910
Goodbye.

1403
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:55,680
When do we eat?

1404
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:11,090
Deanie, honey, do you think
you still love him?

1405
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:23,830
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...

1406
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:27,340
"...of glory in the flower;

Strength in what remains behind.... "
