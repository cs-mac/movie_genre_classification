1
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,777
Four to shack.
Container 14 ready to winch.

2
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,504
Six to shack.
Silver extraction completed.

3
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,981
Tha's good eating.
Burritos, enchiladas...

4
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:24,762
Black beans and rice, man.
That's Puerto Rican. I gotta take you...

5
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,990
I hate to break up
the great Latino gourmet debate...

6
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,872
but we ain't off the clock yet.

7
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:35,091
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

8
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,972
please tell me who the hook is?

9
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,458
Fifteen, is that you?

10
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:43,432
You got a hook on box 22?

11
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,286
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, dumb shit.

12
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,620
Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

13
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,726
This is Jones.
I ain't the hook.

14
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,652
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

15
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:55,432
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

16
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,432
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit
or something? We're all waitin' on ya.

17
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,999
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

18
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,754
Seven to shack.
Ready to winch.

19
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,087
There we go.
Winch on.

20
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,485
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

21
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,305
You heard the man.
Let's get movin'.

22
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,477
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

23
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,401
I hear that.

24
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:36,430
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

25
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,787
Well, Doc,
not so as you'd notice...

26
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:01,221
but the sun has set
on yet another day...

27
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:04,481
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

28
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:09,118
Sixteen tons
and what do you get

29
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,868
Another day older
and deeper in debt

30
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,390
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

31
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:17,625
I owe my soul to the company store

32
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:29,362
Jonesy! Help!

33
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,706
Cobb!

34
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:32,660
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

35
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,058
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

36
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:37,740
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus.
You look fine from in here.

37
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,013
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

38
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,665
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

39
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,438
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

40
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:49,671
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

41
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,171
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose...

42
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,312
and out through your mouth.

43
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,291
I think you're hyperventilating.

44
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:02,463
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

45
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,385
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

46
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,799
Doc, come on!

47
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,170
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

48
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:16,953
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

49
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,247
Help!

50
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,646
Damn!

51
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,650
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

52
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:31,788
Right. Hook him to the RV...

53
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,608
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

54
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,291
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

55
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:40,076
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

56
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:43,044
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

57
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,578
I'm gonna die!

58
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:46,855
You ain't gonna die.

59
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,228
Just keep him moving.

60
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,248
Take it easy. We'll make it.

61
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,645
Open the damn door.

62
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,498
Come on! Get him inside!

63
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,252
Keep him moving.

64
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,343
Come on, lift lock. Go.

65
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,357
Come on, lift lock. Up.

66
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:39,429
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

67
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,353
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
It's Beck.

68
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:44,712
It's not his fault.
Doc shoulïve been there.

69
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,847
If he was a real shack boss,
Doc would have been there.

70
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,479
He got real lucky.

71
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:51,844
Hey, Wall Street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

72
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,681
Shit. There goes my bonus.

73
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,064
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

74
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:01,753
He was in the Indian Ocean.

75
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,156
- That is not a pretty sight.
- Leave Hazy alone, man.

76
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:07,732
One tiny little hole
in the fucking toe of his suit.

77
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:10,038
No bigger than your dick.

78
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,342
Yeah, that ocean came in.

79
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:16,301
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

80
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,229
We just buried his helmet.

81
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:24,176
- That woulïve been you, DeJesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

82
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:27,623
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

83
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:30,694
- Knock it off, Sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

84
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,667
We've been stuck down in this hole
for a hell of a long time.

85
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,449
We had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

86
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:40,263
The doc is my responsibility.

87
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,268
Bullshit.

88
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:05,783
It would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under...

89
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,086
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

90
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,007
Anyone check weather up top?

91
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,788
It's raining, but it's
supposed to be clear for pickup.

92
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,741
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

93
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:18,830
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

94
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,808
Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.

95
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:24,458
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Wherever I can find it.

96
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,382
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

97
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,129
Be watching news on TV that's so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

98
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:32,295
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air...

99
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,435
and after five minutes,
you realize...

100
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:37,504
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

101
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:41,121
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

102
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,710
that looks the same
as everybody else's...

103
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:46,780
you find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

104
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,956
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs...

105
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:51,927
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs...

106
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:55,163
which screw 'em up even more,
and that's just the good part.

107
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,368
You people don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

108
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,837
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- That's all right. I was just finished.

109
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:06,167
- How are you feeling there?
- I'm okay.

110
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,598
- See the doc yet?
- No.

111
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:10,996
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

112
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,428
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

113
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,793
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

114
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,193
Makes me feel better already.

115
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,956
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

116
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:25,259
I see where this is going.

117
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:29,796
All of us owe some shack maintenance
time. Tonight would be a good time.

118
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,583
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

119
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,747
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

120
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,670
That's a union violation.
It's in the contract.

121
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:41,082
Right on, Cobb.
Let's hear it for the shop steward.

122
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,971
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

123
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,100
I know about the contract.
You can follow the letter...

124
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,558
of the contract to the law and spend
an extra workday gettin' it done...

125
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:52,020
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

126
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:55,093
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

127
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,139
What about our quota?

128
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,960
You're only 25 tons off quota.

129
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:02,392
You're bound to go way over that
by the last day.

130
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:05,936
Look, folks, it's just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

131
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,394
It's just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

132
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,608
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

133
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:14,897
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop stewarïs three.

134
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:18,767
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

135
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,936
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

136
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,962
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct somewhere.

137
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,891
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

138
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,856
Williams, run a diagnostic
on DeJesus's suit.

139
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,896
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

140
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,934
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

141
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,727
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

142
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,023
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the orchestra, please.

143
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,976
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, Doc?

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,894
No, I'll be on the golf course
in the morning.

145
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,933
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver...

146
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,306
I could stop by after lunch.

147
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,633
We almost had an accident today.
DeJesus's suit.

148
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,544
You have something
to say to me?

149
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,812
Yeah. Section 1412...

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,267
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires...

151
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:08,050
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room...

152
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:10,287
during all exterior operations.

153
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,874
I just wanna make real damn sure
that's clear.

154
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,646
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

155
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,334
Thank you, sir, for taking care
of that situation.

156
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,897
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake.
- It's just gettin' old, that's all.

157
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:18,275
You don't see Doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

158
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:21,381
As long as it's recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

159
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,264
Ten to one it's a short.

160
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,225
Piece of cake.

161
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,718
Great.

162
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:14,633
Oh, mama! What a pair.

163
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:17,378
What'd you say?

164
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,543
I said, "What a pair."

165
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:25,220
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

166
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:28,002
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

167
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:35,613
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

168
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,166
Compliments of Bowman.

169
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,031
Yeah.

170
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:58,347
How in the hell did you do that?

171
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,582
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

172
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,169
All right? Let's go.

173
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:07,403
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

174
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,579
That's clean.

175
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,321
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my God!

176
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,640
Come here, Kuki.

177
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,971
Sixpack, you shit!

178
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,696
Surprise!

179
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,206
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

180
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,092
Well, Martin, I think you've got
an honest-to-God bonanza on your hands.

181
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,970
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

182
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,456
When I told the Director
of Atlantic Operations...

183
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,717
that we had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

184
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:53,458
I had no idea that you were going
to prove me a genius.

185
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,371
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm ecstatic.

186
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,442
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

187
00:16:58,514 --> 00:16:59,888
What?

188
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:03,530
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

189
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,453
I miss the research, and...

190
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:08,931
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

191
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,752
He has a few incidences
of insubordination...

192
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,462
but his credentials
are very impressive.

193
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:18,626
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

194
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,734
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic.
How'd he get down here?

195
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,901
A serum he developed
killed several people.

196
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,069
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

197
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,479
Now, look.

198
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:30,878
Things are beginning to move
very fast now.

199
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:33,790
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

200
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,958
just say the word.

201
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,536
No, I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

202
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:41,846
Good.

203
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:47,190
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

204
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,327
Not yet.

205
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:53,901
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow?
- Got money in this tub?

206
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,319
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

207
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:59,759
Last year when they lost a tanker,
the bottom fell out of their stock.

208
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,765
I lost a bloody fortune.

209
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,693
You take your money too seriously.

210
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:22,722
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

211
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,982
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

212
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,531
Look at those white legs!

213
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,794
Hey, Willie, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

214
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,537
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

215
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,408
Hey, watch it!

216
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:42,099
No hard feelings?

217
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,784
Nope. Sweet dreams.

218
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:52,017
I got a date with an angel.

219
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,875
Come on, baby.

220
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,802
Sit on my face.

221
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:19,168
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

222
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,681
Look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

223
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,119
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think it's funny?

224
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,517
You're gonna think it's funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

225
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,331
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

226
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:32,981
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

227
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,352
- How do you know it was her?
- It was her!

228
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,264
- Are you calling me a liar?
- That may be the size of it, Bubba.

229
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:41,872
- You two just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Bullshit!

230
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,178
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

231
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,819
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

232
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,775
Ready to drill.

233
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,787
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

234
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,706
- Let's blow it.
- Blow this.

235
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,663
Charge activated.

236
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:09,116
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

237
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,961
Oh, yeah!

238
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,756
It looks like the mother lode, guys.

239
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,609
I need more light on that, seven.

240
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:36,145
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

241
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,902
All right, look.

242
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,281
My cable's stuck.

243
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:55,148
Sixpack, What's happened?

244
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,863
We've lost him.

245
00:20:57,932 --> 00:21:00,712
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there?

246
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,632
Beck, I'm looking for him.

247
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,871
Shack to seven.
What's going on out there?

248
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,511
He's gone.

249
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:19,391
Williams, speak to me.
What's happening out there?

250
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,538
Sixpack, answer.

251
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:26,262
Oh, my God!

252
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,991
Come on, Williams.
What's the alternate?

253
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,910
Try 35.

254
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,829
Williams? There she is.

255
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,777
Williams, you hear me?
What's going on out there?

256
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,696
He's gone over the South Ridge.

257
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,792
I'm going down after him.

258
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:53,381
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is over that ridge.

259
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:55,785
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

260
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,800
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

261
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:02,726
- I don't know!
- They're supposed to be tied.

262
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,156
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it!

263
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,075
Oh, God!

264
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:15,447
What've we got?

265
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,272
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out?

266
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,094
Bowman, What's the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

267
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,013
Thirty minutes.

268
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,104
This is six to shack.

269
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:48,008
For Goïs sakes, why doesn't
Sixpack have his blinkers on?

270
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:50,760
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

271
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,174
What?

272
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,093
What is this?

273
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,602
A ship?

274
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,913
That's Russian.

275
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,418
Are you picking this up?

276
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,617
Yeah, we got it. Can you open up
that picture a little for us?

277
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:48,802
Leviathan.

278
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:51,940
- What?
- Leviathan.

279
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,864
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

280
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,073
- Williams, What's your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

281
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:01,693
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

282
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,617
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

283
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,652
I'm going inside.

284
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:27,538
Sixpack, answer me!

285
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,989
Baltic Sea?

286
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,216
What have you got there, Bowman?

287
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,792
The Leviathan. Currently with
the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

288
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:56,927
Currently horseshit. Currently it's
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

289
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,811
Well, it's gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

290
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:02,936
It's right here.
The Baltic Sea.

291
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,074
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice it's missing.

292
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,678
Williams, you got one minute to find
Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

293
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:20,145
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does Sixpack have?

294
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,371
The infirmary.

295
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm rich, honey!

296
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:27,408
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

297
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:30,026
How can I be on report?
Ain't that right, Cobby?

298
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:32,713
Don't Cobby me.
You're on your own this time.

299
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,637
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

300
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:38,248
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

301
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:41,478
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

302
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:44,261
Here's something for you, Bow.

303
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:48,997
Hey, Sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

304
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,818
- What's that?
- "Kitty Does Kiev."

305
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,512
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

306
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,337
It's in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

307
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:08,534
- May I see it, please?
- It's not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

308
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:14,769
- It's the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

309
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,838
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish...

310
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,330
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of Hindi.

311
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,086
- It's part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

312
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:25,258
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

313
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:27,881
That I believe.

314
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:31,594
- What's this?
- Personal effects. Can you read that?

315
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:33,995
Deceased.

316
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,313
What's all this?

317
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,207
Deceased.

318
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,353
Deceased. All of them.

319
00:27:54,177 --> 00:27:56,631
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

320
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,558
DeJesus, dump this last box.

321
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:06,231
That's nice.
What is this? Vodka.

322
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,112
Stresnavga.
Hey, that's good stuff.

323
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:11,216
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

324
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,653
If I'm on report,
I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

325
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:15,822
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

326
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:19,819
But it's pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence...

327
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,508
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing...

328
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,202
restricted material.

329
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:26,376
- All this gets impounded.
- It's done.

330
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,491
And one more thing.

331
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:36,231
I think if I hear you
call me "Becky" one more time...

332
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,558
I'm gonna pop your tops...
all six of 'em.

333
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,761
My infirmary's filled.

334
00:28:57,726 --> 00:29:00,245
The doctors on board tell me
it's like a tropical infection.

335
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:05,586
But it's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

336
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:10,265
And there's something else
I don't understand.

337
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:12,724
And then it goes off.

338
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:16,335
So what do you want me to say?
It all sounds mysterious?

339
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:21,032
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

340
00:29:21,105 --> 00:29:23,492
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

341
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,697
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

342
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,764
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship...

343
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,933
that's sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

344
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,066
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

345
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:50,846
That's the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

346
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,917
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

347
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:57,592
Now how the hell do you know
that's a torpedo hit?

348
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,601
A collision with another boat
can produce that hole.

349
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,583
I don't agree with you.

350
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:03,512
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

351
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,910
So what if they scuttle
their own boat?

352
00:30:05,975 --> 00:30:08,559
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people...

353
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,240
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

354
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:16,528
I know about rocks. I know about stones.
I don't know about Russian boats.

355
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:20,423
Plus, I bet you five dollars
it's a clerical error.

356
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:24,072
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

357
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,856
I gotta fix the lift lock.

358
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:29,736
Okay, two more days.

359
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,873
Let's have no waves.

360
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:35,554
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

361
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:38,882
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

362
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,606
waves.

363
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:46,042
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

364
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:48,980
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

365
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,541
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

366
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:54,099
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

367
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:58,578
warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

368
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,834
If you're gonna do that, you should
wear what you wear to the beach.

369
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:07,250
I hate the beach.

370
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:10,162
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

371
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:12,331
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

372
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,298
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

373
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,828
Watch. You'll see.

374
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:21,698
Four, zero, five, four...

375
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:23,201
eight, six.

376
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,437
You guys are so full of shit.
How stupid do you think he is?

377
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:28,479
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

378
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,951
Bingo!

379
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,363
That bottle's mine.

380
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,744
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups?
- Loosen up, Bow.

381
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:41,949
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

382
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:44,088
All you do is exercise.
You gotta live a little.

383
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,014
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

384
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,216
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

385
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,579
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

386
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,261
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

387
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,467
Smart lad.

388
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:57,998
Cheers.

389
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,180
- It's water.
- Beck switched it.

390
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,107
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

391
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,593
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

392
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,902
- There goes our party.
- It's not bad.

393
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,303
- It's not bad at all.
- It's water.

394
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,458
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

395
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:15,531
That was a pretty big one, huh?

396
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,832
You'd think we'd get
used to it by now.

397
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,279
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

398
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:28,284
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

399
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:32,989
It's going well.

400
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:35,424
I think I've got a good shot.

401
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:38,073
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

402
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:40,663
Yeah, I know what you mean.

403
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,547
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

404
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,044
- Push D.L.
- What?

405
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,967
D.L.

406
00:33:56,982 --> 00:33:58,257
Oh, man.

407
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,304
What are you doing down here?

408
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:07,084
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

409
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:09,255
What are you doing down here?

410
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:11,496
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

411
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,506
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

412
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,649
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea...

413
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:19,331
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

414
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:21,505
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell...

415
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:23,429
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

416
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,737
Do you?

417
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,378
You tell me.

418
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,520
I think you handled
DeJesus pretty well.

419
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:34,072
Yeah?

420
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:37,492
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

421
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,829
What about Sixpack?

422
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,961
What about him?

423
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:46,386
Did you bust him because of me?

424
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,490
Maybe.

425
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:55,277
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

426
00:34:57,363 --> 00:34:59,402
Yeah, I know.

427
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:03,625
Good.

428
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,549
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

429
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:17,255
Hell, that's what I woulïve done.

430
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,669
Maybe you're more one of us
than you think.

431
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:39,418
Good morning.

432
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,247
Sorry.

433
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:47,062
Okay. That's good.

434
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:50,768
Just look at my forehead.

435
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:52,691
That's it.

436
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,471
Let me see your tongue.

437
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:05,442
Good morning, gentlemen.
What's wrong, Doc?

438
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:10,118
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

439
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:12,324
- Take off your shirt.
- It ain't no hangover.

440
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:14,726
Feels about 1000 times worse.

441
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,795
How long did you have these spots?

442
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,714
- What?
- Don't touch it.

443
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,349
Well, as First Officer of the shack,
it's your call.

444
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,582
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

445
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,056
I don't get it.

446
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:44,821
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup...

447
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:48,234
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

448
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,177
But like I said, it's your call.

449
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,357
Well, as bad as he is,
there's no way...

450
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,298
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

451
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:06,436
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

452
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:09,374
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

453
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:12,480
The company will consider that
when they look at our numbers.

454
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:16,161
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

455
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,115
The contract says,
if we miss our quota...

456
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,633
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

457
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,560
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

458
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,144
The bastarïs
definitely tanking on us.

459
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,735
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

460
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:29,661
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

461
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:31,634
- Williams, take her down.
- That's terrific.

462
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,154
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

463
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:38,389
So, what, are you taking inventory?

464
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,172
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

465
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,021
I'm goin' to work.
You got a problem with that?

466
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:48,814
- Work?
- Work.

467
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:03,621
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it?

468
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,078
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

469
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,094
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

470
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:11,461
Try to do it as quick as I can.
That's it. I got it.

471
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:14,426
Steady, steady. Easy.

472
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:20,287
It's all right.
Keep your hands off it.

473
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,207
Here. Hold that.

474
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:26,901
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

475
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,624
Container 22 is full, sir.

476
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:05,183
This one's full, so let's run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

477
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:06,978
You got it.

478
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,627
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

479
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,155
Tell me something I don't know.

480
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:35,789
Goddamn it, take a guess.

481
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:41,353
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

482
00:40:41,425 --> 00:40:43,279
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

483
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,083
No harm done.

484
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,004
Just don't call me cracker.

485
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,940
Perk up, sport.

486
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:56,101
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

487
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,863
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

488
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:03,867
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

489
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,395
Oh, Lord.

490
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:36,814
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

491
00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:38,736
I don't know if it is
or it isn't.

492
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,450
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

493
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,235
I've been going back and forth
with Narragansett Naval all day...

494
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,155
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

495
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:48,074
the best people in virology.

496
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,407
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

497
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,961
Their best guess,
and that's all it is...

498
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,333
is that before Sixpack died,
he was undergoing...

499
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:57,253
some form of genetic alteration.

500
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,389
Genetic alteration from what?

501
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:01,315
It could be a million things.

502
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,161
Something in the food, the air.

503
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:07,803
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

504
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:11,070
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

505
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,948
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers...

506
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:15,867
I don't think we should tell them
that Sixpack is dead.

507
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:23,506
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

508
00:42:23,576 --> 00:42:25,550
It's a little difficult
to describe.

509
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:27,629
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing...

510
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:29,904
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

511
00:42:29,972 --> 00:42:32,840
My wife would never
understand that at all.

512
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:35,952
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

513
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,870
She wouldn't understand that at all.

514
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:40,203
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

515
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:41,764
Put on your shirt.

516
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,445
- It's all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

517
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,790
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

518
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:53,757
The only skin problem
I can see is white people.

519
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:58,851
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

520
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,119
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

521
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:04,447
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

522
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:06,650
That's all.

523
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,427
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

524
00:43:10,493 --> 00:43:12,499
Well, it's a possibility.
But if that was the case...

525
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:14,676
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

526
00:43:14,747 --> 00:43:17,745
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

527
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:19,671
No, really, you're fine.

528
00:43:19,736 --> 00:43:22,516
Great. Thanks, Doc.

529
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,134
What do you mean, a skin problem?

530
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:27,211
Your skin changes?

531
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:31,177
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

532
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:38,347
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was just joking, Doc.

533
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:45,257
You can finish
gettin' dressed out there.

534
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:51,134
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

535
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:01,401
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

536
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,766
Whatever. But you think it's
restricted to this one crew member?

537
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,684
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

538
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:08,603
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

539
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,707
What are you talking about?
It's already killed one man!

540
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,284
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

541
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,741
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

542
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:22,958
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

543
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:25,394
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

544
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,313
And it's no day at the beach.

545
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:29,962
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual...

546
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:32,900
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation...

547
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:34,829
of all the personnel
on the shack.

548
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:36,900
It's your call,
but unfortunately...

549
00:44:36,973 --> 00:44:39,492
we can't pick you up so soon.

550
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:42,726
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba...

551
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:44,648
possibly coming your way.

552
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:47,940
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

553
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:50,907
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

554
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,867
It shouldn't be a long delay.

555
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:55,265
Well, What's a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

556
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,645
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

557
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,890
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

558
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:03,930
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

559
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:05,884
I promise.

560
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:22,130
Bow, are you okay?

561
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:24,169
Oh, my God. Come on.

562
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:28,015
Can you help us here?

563
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,825
- Let's put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

564
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:39,784
It's all right.

565
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:45,789
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

566
00:45:45,862 --> 00:45:48,065
Hey, Doc?
Maybe he's with Sixpack.

567
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:54,104
Doc? Hey, you in here?

568
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:59,930
Hey, man, how you doin'?

569
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:04,567
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

570
00:46:04,635 --> 00:46:07,383
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

571
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,295
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

572
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:12,214
She don't look too good.

573
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,093
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

574
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:18,702
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

575
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:21,585
You go on back to sleep, okay?

576
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,463
I'll talk to you later, all right?

577
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:34,911
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

578
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:37,887
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Please don't go!

579
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,275
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

580
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:44,797
You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

581
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:38,629
My hair's coming out.

582
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,344
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

583
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:08,363
I don't understand.
I just left her here.

584
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,221
It's Doc.

585
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:36,708
Oh, man.

586
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,438
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

587
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,034
except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

588
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:23,239
And this disease, it killed Bow?

589
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:27,650
No, she killed herself.

590
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:32,387
Hey, we're getting outta here
just in time.

591
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:34,559
That's a whole 'nother problem.

592
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:38,271
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

593
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,403
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

594
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:45,333
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

595
00:49:47,262 --> 00:49:50,675
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

596
00:49:50,748 --> 00:49:52,121
Okay.

597
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:13,358
Oh, my God.

598
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:15,277
What is this?

599
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:17,163
What's goin' on?

600
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:47,067
- Okay, get the door.
- Got it.

601
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:55,093
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

602
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,809
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

603
00:50:57,878 --> 00:51:00,332
Section C of the Health and Safety Code.
Watch it.

604
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:04,649
Program that lock.

605
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,814
Hey, I feel something.

606
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,766
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

607
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,968
Wait a minute. I feel something too.

608
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:15,753
- Let's go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

609
00:51:15,821 --> 00:51:17,729
- Come on.
- Let's flush it.

610
00:51:17,803 --> 00:51:20,965
- "Flush it?" They're human beings!
- What if one's alive?

611
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:22,974
- How about a moment of silence?
- Let's do it.

612
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:25,948
- My God, they're alive!
- Let's have a look.

613
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:32,889
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

614
00:51:32,962 --> 00:51:34,488
Hit the button!

615
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:37,942
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

616
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:40,087
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

617
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:45,370
Come on!

618
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:16,519
Oh, God!

619
00:53:21,446 --> 00:53:25,666
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. That's it.

620
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:29,504
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

621
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:33,815
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

622
00:53:35,261 --> 00:53:38,576
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

623
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:40,789
- There's something about it. It's...
- Bigger.

624
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:54,160
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

625
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:57,259
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

626
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:01,575
why stop with the base model?

627
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:04,711
Why not try to alter the human form?

628
00:54:04,781 --> 00:54:09,056
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

629
00:54:09,131 --> 00:54:10,985
Regeneration.

630
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,397
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure...

631
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:17,372
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

632
00:54:17,446 --> 00:54:20,259
So What's next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

633
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:23,868
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

634
00:54:28,928 --> 00:54:32,025
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

635
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:52,528
I better let the company know.

636
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,980
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

637
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,245
Yeah. I thought about that.

638
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:02,156
I think they got some kind
of commitment to their people.

639
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,521
Save that speech for your ad campaign.

640
00:55:04,587 --> 00:55:07,520
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

641
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:11,170
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic...

642
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,784
is gonna risk exposing themself
to potential market loss to save us...

643
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,154
you're in for
an eye-opening experience.

644
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,594
Maybe.

645
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:23,577
Maybe so. And I know your life's gone
a couple of bad rounds.

646
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:27,705
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

647
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:51,600
I think we got something here.

648
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:56,045
Son of a bitch.

649
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:02,826
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

650
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:07,166
Because it was an experiment, man.
They put the drug in the vodka!

651
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,094
They meant to trick them
into takin' it.

652
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:11,841
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

653
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:15,224
I mean, with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

654
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,535
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on.

655
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:21,397
You know how mothers put the castor oil
in with orange juice?

656
00:56:21,472 --> 00:56:24,340
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

657
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:27,642
That's the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

658
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,595
Fool. He coulïve got us all killed.

659
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:33,520
You weren't holy when you were shooting
that vodka. It coulïve been anyone.

660
00:56:33,593 --> 00:56:36,592
Well, Miss High and Mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

661
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,572
Yeah, it bothers me.

662
00:56:38,647 --> 00:56:41,133
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

663
00:56:41,205 --> 00:56:45,458
You know that in Gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

664
00:56:45,523 --> 00:56:48,075
Sixty-four square miles.

665
00:56:49,936 --> 00:56:53,763
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

666
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,000
And another thing. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin'.

667
00:56:57,068 --> 00:57:01,027
You don't know shit about skiin'.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

668
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:02,951
What about what we just saw?

669
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:07,040
Like Willie said, you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

670
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:11,199
- Doesn't anybody care what happened?
- What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

671
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,074
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

672
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,628
I can't help what happened. Can you?

673
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:26,969
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

674
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:31,059
Eat? After what we just went through?

675
00:57:49,518 --> 00:57:51,688
The storm's still holding its course.

676
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:55,236
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

677
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:57,695
No change. Still just the one.

678
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:28,371
Everybody's jumpy. What are you doin'?

679
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,294
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

680
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:34,797
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

681
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:37,867
I should.
You know how long that took me?

682
00:58:37,939 --> 00:58:40,109
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

683
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,253
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

684
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:30,671
Holy shit!

685
00:59:31,797 --> 00:59:35,886
Please, God, help me!
Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

686
00:59:37,362 --> 00:59:40,208
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

687
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:42,540
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

688
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,106
- Please.
- I'll be back.

689
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:56,416
Look! It's got Hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

690
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:59,300
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

691
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,093
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

692
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,546
I listened to Martin, and my mind said,
"She's full of shit."

693
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:16,475
It's got DeJesus! Come on!

694
01:00:45,547 --> 01:00:48,360
Don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

695
01:00:49,481 --> 01:00:51,868
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

696
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,918
I won't watch that thing
without protection.

697
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,161
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

698
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,617
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Let's go find him.

699
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:01,919
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

700
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:04,863
What's happening?

701
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,502
My God, she's out there.

702
01:01:08,574 --> 01:01:10,428
All right. Jones, you come with me.

703
01:01:10,493 --> 01:01:13,786
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Let's go.

704
01:01:52,613 --> 01:01:54,401
It's her scarf.

705
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:57,501
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

706
01:01:57,571 --> 01:02:00,885
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

707
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:04,537
- What's going on?
- What got Sixpack and Bowman is here.

708
01:02:04,607 --> 01:02:07,191
- What?
- It just got DeJesus.

709
01:02:33,071 --> 01:02:35,622
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

710
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:44,071
Oh, my God.

711
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,819
The blood supply.

712
01:02:52,037 --> 01:02:54,337
Oh, my God.

713
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,671
It got the blood supply.

714
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,127
It's growing. It's had a meal.

715
01:03:48,196 --> 01:03:50,616
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

716
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:54,464
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

717
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:57,429
That's why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

718
01:03:57,503 --> 01:04:01,047
- What one on that ship?
- Tell the rank-and-file the secret.

719
01:04:01,118 --> 01:04:04,247
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

720
01:04:04,315 --> 01:04:07,826
- No shit.
- What're you trying to tell us?

721
01:04:07,897 --> 01:04:13,328
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

722
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:18,315
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

723
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,201
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored...

724
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:24,843
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

725
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:27,812
- What?
- It absorbs its victim's intelligence.

726
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:30,154
Intelligence may not be the right word.

727
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:34,375
The hell with semantics. Are you saying
it's part DeJesus, Sixpack and Bowman?

728
01:04:34,443 --> 01:04:38,499
I don't know. I'd just be guessing.

729
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:43,322
But I do know the Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

730
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:48,060
Maybe to protect us all.

731
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:52,733
Then I say we protect ourselves. Let's
escape into the air bubbles and get out.

732
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,027
And hit the surface in a hurricane?
The storm'd rip those bubbles to pieces.

733
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:59,573
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a chance.

734
01:05:02,651 --> 01:05:05,551
- What are we gonna do?
- I think we got one shot.

735
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:09,878
Just one shot. We lure it to the swamp,
flush it out just like the other.

736
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:11,884
How're we gonna do that?

737
01:05:19,057 --> 01:05:21,674
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

738
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:24,710
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

739
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:28,806
Mark. Got it?
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

740
01:05:28,876 --> 01:05:32,006
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess...

741
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:34,887
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

742
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:38,431
- Let's do it.
- Be careful with this.

743
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:41,021
- Don't worry. I don't want to give more.
- Take care.

744
01:05:41,093 --> 01:05:43,231
I'll do my best.

745
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,153
Okay, let's go.

746
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:32,549
You know, I was quite good once.

747
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:37,029
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

748
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,320
I developed drugs and techniques...

749
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:47,198
that're used every day
by doctors all over the world.

750
01:06:49,534 --> 01:06:52,467
- Made a difference.
- It still does.

751
01:06:56,443 --> 01:06:58,297
This itches like hell.

752
01:07:02,903 --> 01:07:04,757
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

753
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:06,676
It really itches.

754
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:11,792
That's because it's healing.

755
01:07:13,073 --> 01:07:15,276
I'm gonna change that dressing
to make you more comfortable.

756
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,731
- Where are you going?
- The infirmary.

757
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:19,235
Without protection?

758
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,643
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

759
01:09:12,206 --> 01:09:15,270
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

760
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,194
Here we go.

761
01:09:42,909 --> 01:09:45,973
- Take off your shirt.
- Sure.

762
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:48,343
I'm cold.

763
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:51,888
Help me, please.

764
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,293
Oh, yeah, sure.

765
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,245
Help me!

766
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,880
What's happening?

767
01:10:07,951 --> 01:10:09,673
Help!

768
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,335
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

769
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:36,253
Get over here!

770
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,313
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's Doc and Cobb?

771
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,457
- It got Doc.
- Wait a minute. It was just here.

772
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:03,310
- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

773
01:11:03,376 --> 01:11:07,335
- It was in Cobb. It was in him.
- Slow down. There's two of them?

774
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,730
- Shit.
- All right.

775
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:13,216
- How are you doin'?
- Okay.

776
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,710
Okay, now what?

777
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,914
How do you feel about big waves?

778
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,837
I love waves.

779
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:57,520
We're trapped.
The escape bubbles are gone.

780
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:59,493
- The door.
- Hey, look at this.

781
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:01,476
"I am fully aware of the finality
of my decision.

782
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:04,616
It is my hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race...

783
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:06,594
will never know this awful mutation."

784
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:10,462
- Our death warrant.
- Signed by the good doctor.

785
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:23,134
Hell with it.

786
01:12:25,794 --> 01:12:29,272
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm gonna find out...

787
01:12:29,343 --> 01:12:31,709
how far up Shit Creek we are.

788
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:44,814
- Thank goodness you're still alive.
- Where you been?

789
01:12:44,886 --> 01:12:47,754
Get your ass out here now
and get us. Right now!

790
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:50,794
Please calm down.
We haven't deserted you.

791
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:54,029
Naturally, after we received Dr.
Thompson's message, we were concerned.

792
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:56,169
But we never would have deserted you.

793
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,995
When are you coming?

794
01:12:58,063 --> 01:13:00,964
- You said 12 hours.
- That's the bad news.

795
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:04,680
The hurricane has turned your way.
Right now, it's on a course of...

796
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:07,364
Just answer the goddamn question.
When are you coming?

797
01:13:07,434 --> 01:13:10,466
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

798
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:12,804
I realize you must have gone
through hell...

799
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,811
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

800
01:13:14,885 --> 01:13:17,698
I can't control the weather.
Rest assured, your SOS...

801
01:13:17,764 --> 01:13:20,445
was received by the coast guard
and the navy...

802
01:13:20,514 --> 01:13:24,058
and we will be responding
at the earliest, safest opportunity.

803
01:13:24,128 --> 01:13:29,144
- Just don't promise us nothin'.
- I realize this must sound ridiculous.

804
01:13:29,214 --> 01:13:32,147
- No shit.
- Now please try and get some rest.

805
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,120
How are we gonna rest?
I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

806
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:37,582
- Get some rest?
- Save your breath.

807
01:13:37,656 --> 01:13:41,396
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way.
- We don't have much choice, do we?

808
01:13:41,462 --> 01:13:44,756
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch.
You all try to get some rest.

809
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:48,529
I ain't gonna never be able
to sleep again. In life. Ever.

810
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:36,305
"Request weather report, July 26."

811
01:14:36,376 --> 01:14:39,887
- "Data not available."
- Come on.

812
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,304
"Files Closed."

813
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:51,149
- Oh, man.
- They know, don't they?

814
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:56,264
Yeah. I think they're just sittin'
up there, decidin' what to do with us.

815
01:14:56,332 --> 01:14:57,706
Maybe they have.

816
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,885
- What're you looking for?
- I'm seeing how my investment's doing.

817
01:15:02,952 --> 01:15:05,634
"The stock of Tri-Oceanic Corp.
Took a bath today...

818
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:08,549
when news of a tragic mining accident
was revealed to investors.

819
01:15:08,613 --> 01:15:12,321
The board of directors was called into
a meeting in New York this afternoon.

820
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:15,615
A spokesperson revealed that
the accident destroyed Shack Seven...

821
01:15:15,681 --> 01:15:17,535
off the coast of Florida.

822
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,454
Eight miners are reported dead.
All bodies are missing.

823
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:22,649
Killed were Steven Beck,
Elizabeth Williams, Justin Jones...

824
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:26,131
Dr. Glen Thompson, Tony Rodero, Bridget
Bowman, G.P. Cobb, Buzz Parrish."

825
01:15:26,204 --> 01:15:28,145
Martin, you bitch.

826
01:15:28,218 --> 01:15:30,192
Welcome to the union, boss.

827
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:32,119
We're all expendable.

828
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:35,885
- Doc, I owe you five dollars.
- Five dollars?

829
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:40,968
- Emergency warning.
- Listen.

830
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:43,530
- Countdown to implosion.
- The air's stopped.

831
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,218
Ten minutes and counting.

832
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:49,385
- They ripped open an air duct.
- Can we fix it?

833
01:15:49,454 --> 01:15:51,940
There are 20 miles of pipe.
They coulïve tapped in anywhere.

834
01:15:52,013 --> 01:15:53,387
That's true.

835
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,588
Cobb. Job security.

836
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:02,044
It's that rattle in Corridor A.

837
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,347
You got it. It's showin' us where it is.

838
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:08,379
- It's drawin' us out.
- It didn't waste any time, did it?

839
01:16:08,452 --> 01:16:11,101
You can't go out there.
That's what it wants.

840
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,463
If we lose enough air in here, the
internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

841
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,054
Implosion, babe.

842
01:16:16,127 --> 01:16:18,679
Wait. You don't think
I'm staying here?

843
01:16:19,582 --> 01:16:21,435
Nine minutes to implosion.

844
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:28,019
- It's over here!
- Is that it?

845
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:29,582
Yeah.

846
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:34,612
- It's going!
- We're losin' air faster than I thought.

847
01:16:38,003 --> 01:16:40,206
- Go! Here.
- Don't spend all day down there.

848
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:42,411
Don't worry. I won't.

849
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,334
Let's do it.

850
01:16:55,146 --> 01:16:57,632
Eight minutes to implosion.

851
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,698
- Oh, no. Damn!
- Can we fix it?

852
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:24,557
- Can we shut it down someplace else?
- Come on.

853
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:28,526
- What do you think? I wanna die?
- We're not gonna die. What do we do?

854
01:17:28,599 --> 01:17:30,452
- How should I know?
- You know this shack!

855
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:33,265
- I don't know!
- Come on! This shack's your home, man!

856
01:17:33,332 --> 01:17:37,126
The swamp. There's a backup air valve
at the swamp. If we...

857
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,730
- What?
- I just saw Doc.

858
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,164
No, Jones. Let's get outta here.

859
01:17:45,229 --> 01:17:46,603
Come on.

860
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:53,319
Seven minutes to implosion.

861
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,980
- Look out!
- Watch out!

862
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:07,608
- Did you get it?
- I think we did it!

863
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,687
- I don't know!
- Hurry!

864
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:12,758
Move it! The door's closing!

865
01:18:20,953 --> 01:18:24,213
The other door's closing!

866
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,105
Willie, get out! Get out!

867
01:18:29,173 --> 01:18:30,732
- Torch it!
- Careful!

868
01:18:30,803 --> 01:18:32,209
It's jammed!

869
01:18:41,326 --> 01:18:44,139
Check that door!
Willie, get outta here!

870
01:18:44,204 --> 01:18:46,439
- The door's closing!
- Get that door!

871
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:51,904
- Go! Go! Go!
- Six minutes to implosion.

872
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:53,600
Come on!

873
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:28,525
Grab my hand!

874
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:33,640
Grab it! Come on!

875
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:37,452
Go! Come on!

876
01:19:37,518 --> 01:19:40,167
You got it.

877
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,996
Come on!

878
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:56,034
Let me help him! Let me go!

879
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:57,822
The handsaw on the table!

880
01:20:05,918 --> 01:20:07,859
- Help him!
- Stay back!

881
01:20:20,758 --> 01:20:22,699
Four minutes to implosion.

882
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,381
There's no air.

883
01:20:38,604 --> 01:20:40,807
The door's jammed!

884
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,733
The air valve! It's too hot!
I can't get to it!

885
01:20:48,805 --> 01:20:51,292
- Forget it! Get the suits!
- The suits? You crazy?

886
01:20:51,365 --> 01:20:54,014
Bring the lift bags!

887
01:20:55,074 --> 01:20:57,855
- How're we gonna get to the surface?
- Like this.

888
01:20:57,921 --> 01:21:02,109
We'll triple the inflation ratio. We'll
float to the top like a balloon. Go!

889
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:07,992
Okay, let's hook 'em up.
Get in the suits.

890
01:21:08,059 --> 01:21:10,130
- What about yours?
- Get in the suit.

891
01:21:11,513 --> 01:21:14,610
Three minutes to implosion.

892
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:32,777
Come on!

893
01:21:40,425 --> 01:21:42,246
Let's go!

894
01:21:42,312 --> 01:21:43,685
See you topside.

895
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:46,846
Get into your suit!

896
01:21:46,918 --> 01:21:49,818
Beck, get into the suit!

897
01:21:52,898 --> 01:21:55,318
Don't be a fool!

898
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,540
Two minutes to implosion.

899
01:22:07,866 --> 01:22:09,239
Kill me.

900
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:11,758
My God. DeJesus.

901
01:22:42,086 --> 01:22:43,460
Shit!

902
01:23:03,002 --> 01:23:05,750
Oh, shit!

903
01:23:08,919 --> 01:23:11,089
One minute to implosion.

904
01:25:53,018 --> 01:25:54,872
You made it!

905
01:25:59,895 --> 01:26:02,577
Base to Coast Guard
Rescue Chopper 1437.

906
01:26:02,646 --> 01:26:05,328
Make one more attempt in search area
and return to base.

907
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:20,672
- So where's the goddamn hurricane?
- You all right?

908
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:22,601
- I made it.
- Yeah?

909
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:26,787
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'll be all right. Okay.

910
01:26:30,342 --> 01:26:34,234
Base to Rescue Chopper 1437.
Any visual contact?

911
01:26:34,308 --> 01:26:36,162
- Negative.
- Return to base.

912
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,785
It's cold.

913
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,290
- Hey!
- Here!

914
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,082
- Over here!
- Give me that last flare.

915
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:00,817
There's a flare straight ahead.

916
01:27:00,884 --> 01:27:04,363
- Jones! Look!
- Chopper.

917
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:09,861
- Sharks!
- Where are they?

918
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:11,429
- Too close!
- Stay close.

919
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,961
Stay close!

920
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,482
Talk about having a bad day.

921
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:36,607
- Help!
- Yes! Come on!

922
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:45,812
- Jesus!
- Willie!

923
01:27:45,883 --> 01:27:47,954
- Get those people up!
- Go!

924
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:51,605
- Grab a hand!
- Get outta here!

925
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,573
It's got Jones!

926
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,109
Come back!

927
01:28:07,183 --> 01:28:09,287
Don't! Save yourself!

928
01:28:18,281 --> 01:28:20,516
Come back!

929
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:26,782
Say "Aah," motherfucker!

930
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,856
Let's get outta here!

931
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:53,169
Helicopter 405 heading back
to platform P.O.C.

932
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:59,079
They don't want anything else
to do with it, you know?

933
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:03,721
You made it!

934
01:30:04,781 --> 01:30:07,649
No one back at Tri-Oceanic
believed me.

935
01:30:07,723 --> 01:30:11,911
But I never gave up on you once.
How do you feel?

936
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,333
Better. A lot better.
