00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,154
We must call a halt
to this so-called permissive society.

306
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,778
The students don't only want a bigger
slice of the cake, they want the whole...

307
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,668
Most students are glad
to be at university

308
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,287
and are willing to do some work

309
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,379
in return for the money
the country pays them.

310
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,844
Many of them foreigners here
at the taxpayers' expense

311
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,837
who are not at university to study,

312
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,932
but to disrupt
and undermine British institutions.

313
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,179
These academic thugs, these window
smashers, these policemen baiters,

314
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,397
we will deal with them very severely.

315
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,440
Those who attack our institutions,
who destroy respect for authority,

316
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,779
who spread discontent and anarchy,

317
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,775
who claim that they should control
the places of education,

318
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,446
they're lucky enough to attend,

319
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,740
as if these pipsqueaks
could run anything,

320
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,912
all of these communist rabble
must be swept out of the universities

321
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,706
and out of the headlines
they love to hog so dearly.

322
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,421
Let's repress
these long-haired sex perverts

323
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,758
and make room for decent,
respectable, clean-living young people

324
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,127
who understand
that politics and education

325
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,505
have nothing whatever
to do with each other.

326
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,597
Send the offenders to labour camps.

327
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,138
They'd soon learn how to work there.

328
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,183
And as for the war in Vietnam
they're always going on about...

329
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,605
'Organise.'

330
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,320
...step by step as this war has gone on,

331
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,735
we've agreed
with what the Americans have done.

332
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,157
'Unite. Unite.'

333
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,450
A magnificent sacrifice
of men and money

334
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,543
in the defence of our freedom.

335
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,207
They want a fight.

336
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,131
So let's give them one.

337
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,717
War's a nasty business.
People are going to be killed.

338
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,508
But I believe we must take this risk.

339
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,382
In this kind of game
it's necessary to shoot and bomb.

340
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,351
Sometimes it is necessary
to burn women and children.

341
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,094
Sometimes to torture people.

342
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,473
Sometimes to slice their stomachs
open and cut women's breasts off.

343
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,225
Let's not kid ourselves,

344
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,694
you fight wars to win them,
by whatever means are necessary.

345
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,691
And we don't like coloured people
and I'll tell you why.

346
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,285
'Organise.'

347
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,661
...money and materials
into their primitive homelands

348
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,660
because they simply
can't handle their own affairs.

349
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,733
If the people of India breed too fast,
it's no concern of ours.

350
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,899
We're supposed to feel sorry for them
because they're starving.

351
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,239
Well, some of us don't feel sorry,
we feel glad.

352
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,984
Let them starve. Let them die.

353
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,781
Let them starve at least or...

354
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,081
'Strike. Strike.'

355
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,623
Built factories,
sent them tanks and tractors,

356
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,041
helped them build
and run their governments.

357
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,961
And in return we don't just take
the raw materials we need,

358
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,676
we buy their shoddy clothes
and trinkets too...

359
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,515
Perhaps in the house next to you,

360
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:42,229
with their laziness,
promiscuity and sordid homes.

361
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,393
Now, we're not racialists,

362
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,189
but the way these people live is filthy,
as you'd see

363
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,779
if you went to look at the backstreets
of Wolverhampton today.

364
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,696
These people just don't accept
our standards of civilisation.

365
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,319
They live in filth and squalor.

366
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,073
They breed like rabbits
and they suck our social services dry.

367
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,375
Unless we put a stop
to the influx of this horde,

368
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,497
our cities will soon be so full of aliens
that we won't recognise them.

369
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,393
...seeing whole areas of our land
transformed into alien territory.

370
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:27,182
'Workers, strike! Strike!'

371
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,060
...people who very often
don't even speak our language,

372
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,653
who are unable
to adapt to our way of life,

373
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,444
who persist
in maintaining their native customs...

374
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,121
The immigrants themselves
suffer from the racial bitterness

375
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,624
that is created when they swamp
our houses and our jobs.

376
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,219
In their interest, as much as ours,
let's send them packing.

377
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,178
Let's sterilise them.

378
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,220
In fact, and this is really
the simplest solution of them all,

379
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,683
let's exterminate them.

380
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,144
Let's kill these people, too,
like the old-age pensioners,

381
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,763
like the Vietnamese,

382
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,642
like anybody who interferes
with the democratic progress

383
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,359
of big business and capital.

384
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,486
Thank you and good night.

385
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,823
'A political film must analyse
what it has discovered,

386
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,194
'just as Lavoisier analysed oxygen,
discovered by Priestley,

387
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,040
'and Marx analysed the theory of value,
discovered by Ricardo.'

388
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,581
We had a system
where, on the moving line...

389
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:34,253
...the quicker you worked,
the more space you had in hand.

390
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,343
The more space you, you had in hand,

391
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,384
the more time
you would have to do your job.

392
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,848
But if you got a bad job,

393
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,514
if you were doing a job where,
we'd say, you had a cross-threaded nut,

394
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,854
it meant you were knocked
straight back down.

395
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,520
In other words, you had a point
where, if you went further than that,

396
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:56,067
it meant that you were in trouble then
because you had to work twice as hard

397
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,362
to get back to the original position
of where you started.

398
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,325
So, consequently, two bad jobs

399
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,944
would knock you
right back down the line,

400
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,040
so it was constantly a question
of advancing or retreating.

401
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,831
Er... the one dread you had
was that if you did get a bad job,

402
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,081
you were going
to be knocked back down the line...

Nobody else could do it
at 30 an hour.

411
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,561
There wasn't a man made.

412
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,231
This bloke had grown up with the job
and he could do it.

413
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,446
But there wasn't a man made
who could, er...

414
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,820
...who could do this job
at 30 an hour.

415
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,660
To this day they've got
about three people doing this job,

416
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,077
which one man used to perform
because they couldn't find another man.

417
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,416
They couldn't slow the line down
to teach him.

418
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,285
They couldn't teach him
at 30 an hour.

419
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,755
There's a perfect example
in the mine itself,

420
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,250

The only way that you can ever
overcome any industrial problems,

433
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,705
indeed, in this country,

434
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:38,048
is the question of the property
relationship of the industries concerned.

435
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,838
I think that management
realises the hardships

436
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,426
that night work puts on workers

437
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,967
because they're prepared
to pay their own staff...

438
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,681

they used to stand about ten feet apart.

00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,824
You can get the effect from a person
actually working on the 1100.

458
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,948
He puts window... window winders on.

459
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,416
He has ten screws
to put in each door.

460
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,584
He makes up 2,200 screws a night
himself and puts them in.

461
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,958
He's got just...
just over... over two minutes

462
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,426
to... to do one car.

463
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,763
And this, this...
Every job, 2,200 screws a night.

464
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,303
That man goes home in the morning,
straight to bed.

465
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,769
Even when gets up that's all he can
think on. He can't do anything else.

466
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,263
He has to use his breaks...

467
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,767
'1888...'
'1888...'

468
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,144
'...Bloody Sunday
in Hyde Park.'

469
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,488
'...Bloody Sunday
in Hyde Park.'

470
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,107
Ah, you're a lazy car worker!

471
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,986
I go off then to the pub,
have a drink.

472
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,740
I don't even bother to change.
I'm too tired for that.

473
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,538
- Your senses are dulled.
- Just dulled, yeah.

474
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,161
'Street demonstrations
lead to a tumult,

475
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,334
'which inevitably affects
the most forlorn

476
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,207
'and timid sections of society.

'Victory today

481
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,017
The point about
the psychological effect

482
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,860
of piecework on human beings,

483
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,356
I mean, can be seen very easily
in the conflict between human beings

484
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,858
when they're on piecework.

485
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,404
I mean, I-I-I know of a case

486
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:16,247
where the mildest,
most non-aggressive man

487
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,788
you'd ever meet in your life,

488
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,663
after having worked
seven hours' piecework,

489
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,632
hit one of his mates over the head
with a pump screwdriver

490
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,967
because he'd tripped over
the air line.

491
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,509
This is the sort of thing that's
continuous and the tension is enormous!

492
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,634
There's one point on the 1100 line
where five men get into a car at once.

493
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,101
Yeah.

494
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,472

514

If the boss wants
to automate it, the workers resist it

515
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,281
because it throws them out of a job.

516
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,123
The boss on the one hand and the
capitalism, this dilemma for the bosses,

517
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,617
if they bring in
completely automated plants

518
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,870
that could release all us
for more productive work

519
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,793
and to spend a better life,

520
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,088
what it means is that they haven't got
any people to sell the cars to.

521
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,383
So you've all got
to be stuck in the blasted places,

522
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,848
hammering on things
and all you do is producing for profit.

523

I mean, you take 1960.

524
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,887
I mean, we were all put
on three days

525
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,891
and in 1966 there were 1,300 sacked

526
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:09,736
and yet I wanted a car and dozens
of other people wanted a car.

527
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:14,824
Yet because we didn't have the money
to buy them and nobody could buy them,

528
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,533
everybody is sacked.

529
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,993
This is capitalism.

530
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,535
As far as I'm concerned,
we've got to have a socialist world.

531
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,454
We've got have a world
where the production is planned

532
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,203
for the benefit of all the people
who live in the world.

533
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,921
Well, this is it.

534
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,258
"The Times" has produced figures,
not so long ago,

535
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:38,347
of the idle rich
and the profits that they're living on.

536
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:42,185
And just purely living off the interest.

537
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,554
They're going
to the racecourses and that

538
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,602
while we're slogging our guts out
in the factories.

539
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:52,695
It's about time that we had a distribution
of the wealth in this country

540
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,314
and there's a fairer share for all.

541
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,820
It's not fair that we should be working
our fingers to the bone

542
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,366
day in and day out

543
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:06,618
while these people
are at the racecourses and elsewhere.

544
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,666
'The basic error
of modern social democracy

545
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,505
'is to suppose that all one has to say

546
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,047
'is that there is a place to speak
for that place to exist.

547
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,762
'Whereas the problem is to create
the conditions for that speech.

548
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,553
'Speech as the expression of a power.

549
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,972
'Everyone may agree
to allow the right to speak,

550
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,266
'but no one, no one,
will allow it to be taken.'

551
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,984
So capitalism surely
is much more even than this.

552
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:35,071
Capitalism is far more
than just the inequality of wealth

553
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,861
within a capitalist nation state.

554
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,325
It's far more than this.

555
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,114
I mean, capitalism is that.

556
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,580
Capitalism to exist
must have millionaires

557
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,950
and it must have people
who are impoverished.

558
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,294
It must have this,
but more than that, more than that,

559
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,666
it must internationally have sections
of the world which are impoverished.

560
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,383
'My sympathy
for the solitary terrorist

'their despair ends and tactics begin.'

565
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,855
The workers thought
that they were putting into power

566
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,771
a socialist government
that would implement...

567
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,276
Yeah, I'd say they did!

568
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:24,405
Every man that voted Labour
is suddenly awake, all of a sudden,

569
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,952
to realise that it is
not a socialist government.

570
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,619
It is a capitalist government!

571
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,290

capitalist government!

577
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:49,562
Ramsay MacDonald done it.
He cut the dole in 1931.

578
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,558
You've got the Tory party
that is swinging rapidly to the right,

579
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,185
which will be under the leadership
of Enoch Powell,

580
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,688
which will be
a right-wing racialist government

581
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,815
of the type that Hitler
had in Germany.

582
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,942
So what's before the working class?

583
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:07,038
Do we carry on supporting
these tired old traitors? No, we can't.

584
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,626
What is needed in this crisis
is the building of a new political party

585
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,119
for the working class.

586
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,624
A political party
that is committed to Marxism,

587
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,341
that is committed to communism,

588
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,756
that is prepared
to lead the working class

589
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,723
in their struggles to overcome
all these other parliamentarians.

590
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,682
'The Vietnamese people's struggle

594
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,821
And without any previous knowledge
of what was going on,

595
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,906
I was tapped
on the shoulder one day.

596
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,910
This, mark you,
was after 18 months

597
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,157
and, as I say, having drawn out
a mortgage on a £4,000 house,

598
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,124
they tapped me
on the shoulder and said,

601
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,052
And I was out on the road,
believe you me,

602
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,011
before you could say
"Jack Robinson".

603
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,223
I didn't know what hit me, actually.

00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,449
'The first task of the anti-imperialist
cinema is to answer that question.'

609
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,287
A word that goes with...
High and low.

610
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,255
Something less specific.

611
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,507
- If you want to replace...
- Stop the record.

612
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,340
If you want to replace...

613
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,468
Look, if you want to replace...

614
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,516
The whole point of the song
is I say "high" and you say "low".

615
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,979
It's two opposites.

616
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,942
So if you want to replace it, you've got
to put it with something that is opposite.

617
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,523
What are you trying
to change it round to anyway, exactly?

618
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,696
Well, from what it is to...

619
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:13,619
You can substitute some very nice
things like "Ho Chi Minh" and "Castro"

620
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,412
and things at the end of the lines.

621
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,035
- Look, it's got to be a...
- Has somebody got a fag?

622
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:24,668
It's got to be opposites all the way
through. "You say US. I say Mao."

623
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,135
"You say..."

624
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,098
Uh-uh. I've got a feeling
this is going to end up in tragedy.

625
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,433
"You say war..."

626
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,929
No, you can even say,
"Say US. I say Mao."

627
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,853
Wait a minute.
Let's think of an opposite.

628
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,481
"You say..." What?

629
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,071
- Let's make it meaningful.
- US...

630
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,864
Yeah, you've got to say, "Look,
I'm a fascist and you're a revolutionary.

631
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,533
"I'm a reactionary
and you're a revolutionary."

632
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,874
So, "You say US, I say Mao.

633
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,085
"You say, you say war..."

634
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,297
I think, actually,
that if I say "ho" instead of "no"...

635
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,259
"You say Vietnam and I say..."
Something that compels.

636
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:11,677
Yeah, but it doesn't fit in
because "stop" is a very short syllable.

637
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,640

No, "You say Nixon, I say Mao."

No. No, that doesn't go.
