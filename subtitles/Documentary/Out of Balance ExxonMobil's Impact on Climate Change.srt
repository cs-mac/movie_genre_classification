Why not hang a sign?

00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,511
Do you have a name?

170
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,911
This is what I get for talking to the press.

171
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,872
I'm selling my soul right now.

172
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,511
I can feel it.
I can feel it.

173
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,271
I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

174
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:31,711
So you do have a name.

175
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,071
Just a first name.

176
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,632
Oh, my God.  I'm going to say it.

00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:40,072
Ellie. Nothing else?

179
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,672
I think the president knows about it, too.

talking to him about her.

Hi.

we're looking for your mom.
Is she around?

187
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:38,712
My mom's sick.
She's not here.

188

Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

189
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:43,433
Yeah.

190
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:48,953
That's exciting.  Looks like a long trip, huh?

191
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,793
So, listen, do you know where you're going?

192
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:53,713
Rittenhouse: She's going back to the house.

193
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,033
Hey, you want to stop that?

194
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,312
Lily, please.

We'd like to talk about your resignation.

My wife is sick.
She's in the hospital.

That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

203

We could talk about your wife,

204

Nobody knows everything.

Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

210
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,795
and the whispered calls to the president

211

and about a secretary of the Treasury

212

who's kept his entire
department in the dark

213
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:53,754
about what he's really doing--

214
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:56,394
about a cover story about his resignation

215
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:59,274
that just fell through.
I mean, sir, You want me to go on?

216
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:02,354
And you're just gonna break it?

Well, congratulations.

You now have

Good luck to you.

Personally...

222
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,714
I think it's a mistake to run the story,

223

Why not?

I wanted to be with my family.

Can you understand that?

231
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:10,596
OK, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

232
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,676

What an ego.

235
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,756
Now, if it was the president--

236
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,195
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

237
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:24,955
The president has a mistress named Ellie,

238
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,836
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

239
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,476
and takes the fall and resigns,

240

People knew about the Manhattan

and they kept it a secret.

I understand you've come

What did I tell you?

272
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,839
We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

273
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,879
was the publication of the budget,

274
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,119
since we've spent more
money than we can hide.

The budget comes out in 2 weeks.

I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for 2 weeks.

No such thing as 2 weeks
in the news business.

And I can't appeal to your sense
of what's in the nation's best interest?

MSNBC has learned that

announced by your administration.

He resigned

Ms Lerner, all of you,

everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

What do we do?

You have a choice.
We have a choice...

1005
00:58:57,564 --> 00:58:58,764
Right now.

1006
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:04,125
Ever since the comet was discovered,
we've been hoping and working for the best,

1007
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:07,005
but we've also been
planning for the worst.

1008
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,005
Our strategy has been twofold.

1009
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:12,365
First, our strategic missile command

1010
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:16,005
<i>is preparing to coordinate with the
Russians a massive strike of Titan missiles</i>

1011
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:18,205
<i>to intercept the comets.</i>

1012
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:21,125
<i>If we can deflect these comets enough,</i>

1013
00:59:21,205 --> 00:59:25,125
<i>they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphere</i>

1014
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:27,885
<i>and head on out into space.</i>

1015
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:33,245
<i>Unfortunately, the Titans cannot be launched
until the comets are only a few hours away.</i>

1016
00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:36,966
<i>And while we are confident
the missile attack will succeed,</i>

1017
00:59:37,045 --> 00:59:39,446
<i>it is only prudent that we
now take cautionary steps</i>

1018
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:42,125
<i>to ensure the continuation
four way of life,</i>

1019

<i>to guarantee that there
will be enough of us left</i>

<i>to rebuild a new world</i>

1021
00:59:47,245 --> 00:59:51,006
<i>in the unlikely event that
the comets do strike the Earth.</i>

1022
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:54,926
So, in the soft limestone of Missouri,

1023
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:57,766
we've been preparing
a network of immense caves,

1024
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:59,686
and they're almost finished.

1025
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,326
And we can put
a million people in them.

1026
01:00:02,405 --> 01:00:04,966
And that million people can
survive there, underground,

1027
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:06,487
for 2 years,

1028
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:10,406
until the air clears
and the dust settles.

1029
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,846
Now, the cave is more
than a dormitory.

It's our new Noah's Ark.

Let's take a look at the big one.

1453
01:28:11,278 --> 01:28:13,998
Now, the outgassing has created a vent

1454
01:28:14,077 --> 01:28:16,478
a half mile wide and
at least 2 miles deep.

1455
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,317
Comet gets closer to the sun,
sun melts the ice,

1456
01:28:18,397 --> 01:28:22,157
ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole, OK?

1457
01:28:22,317 --> 01:28:26,157
So, how many nukes do we
have left in the back?

1458
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:28,398
4.

1459
01:28:28,478 --> 01:28:32,918
If we can get the remaining
bombs in that vent,

1460
01:28:33,038 --> 01:28:36,837
there shouldn't be anything
left bigger than a suitcase.

1461
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,598
We can't do anything about the little one,

1462
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:42,638
but it just might give them a chance.

1463
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,558
Without the arming codes,

1464
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,079
we're going to have to wait
to set the bomb timers

1465
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,279
until we get closer to Earth
to raise Houston.

1466
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:52,159
We may not have enough
life support left

to get back into the
cargo bay for the nukes,

1468
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,238
much less to go down to the comet.

1469
01:28:56,318 --> 01:28:57,998

enough propellant left

back off the surface
