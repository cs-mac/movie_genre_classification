1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My Secret Hotel

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,990
Nam Sang Hyo?

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,170
Well...

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,550
if you came by because you felt bad...

5
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,260
...that's okay.

6
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,370
Oh, wait.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,290
I have a favor to ask you.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,720
Your wedding...

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,550
Leave it to me.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,250
- What?
- I beg you.

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,670
Are you insane?

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,200
Are you out of your mind?

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,720
I know it doesn't make sense at all.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,130
Then don't ask.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,830
I'll do a great job.

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,970
I really will.

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,230
I'll do my best to satisfy you
and Soo Ah with all my sincerity.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,510
With all your sincerity?

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
- Yeah.
- For my wedding?

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,230
Yeah.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,640
Can you really...

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,840
without any feelings...

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,880
...prepare my wedding?

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,480
I can do it.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,990
You and I were...

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,750
over seven years ago anyway.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,510
I have no other feelings for you.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,100
So...

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,740
...leave it to me.

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,150
I'm sorry, but...

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't want to.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,260
I told you.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,760
Whether it's coincident or for any reason,

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,860
I don't want to see you again.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,520
Got it?

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,690
Goo Hae Young.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
Don't...

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,770
...touch me.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,470
We were over seven years ago?

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,950
You have no feelings for me?

41
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,850
Fine, fine. So...

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,870
let's not see each other again.

43
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,570
Let's not.

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,720
That jerk!

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Jerk!

46
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,490
Jerk...

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,570
Miss, do you mind sharing the cab?

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,510
You'll do it anyway even if I didn't like it.

49
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,800
Well, if you really don't want to...

50
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,220
You'll do it anyway...

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,490
It's tough to catch a cab at night.

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,800
What's so difficult about that?

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,230
Excuse me?

54
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,670
That bastard!

55
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,890
Who is it?

56
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,590
You really scared me.

57
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
How did you get here?

58
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,530
I took a taxi.

59
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,520
No...

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,460
How did you know where I lived?

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,770
I saw it on the wedding paperwork.

62
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,660
You know...

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,040
this is clearly invasion of
privacy and private information.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
Leave your wedding to me.

65
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,210
I said I don't want to.

66
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,360
That's too bad. Leave it to me.

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
Am I funny to you?

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,610
Do I look easy?

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,360
You are easy to me.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,740
More than Jung Soo Ah.

71
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,430
I'm sorry, but...

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,120
...you got me wrong.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,450
This is my last request.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,310
I pushed my pride aside.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,050
I ask you for the last time.

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,610
Hae Young.

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,340
Why are you doing this?

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,580
I don't want other people
to suffer because of me.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,060
People at the hotel as well as

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,820
...the General Manager.

81
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,650
And...

82
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,510
...the Managing Director.

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,950
The Managing Director?

84
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,740
Who?

85
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,800
Jo Sung Gyum?

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,470
Jeez!

87
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,230
Forget it.

88
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,440
It has nothing to do with me
whether they suffer or not.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,270
I don't care even if your hotel
goes out of business, understand?

90
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,510
- C'mon, Goo Hae Young.
- I told you not to touch me.

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,150
Hey, you jerk!

92
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,010
What's so great about you?

93
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,430
What's so great about you?

94
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,080
You...

95
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,530
I'll curse you.

96
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,520
I'll curse your wedding day!

97
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,550
I'm sorry I called you a jerk.

98
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,220
I'll take back what I said about cursing you.

99
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,640
Go away.

100
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,920
Goo Hae Young!

101
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,320
I said go away.

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,190
I'm asking you...

103
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,960
I said go away!

104
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,670
I told you to go away.

105
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,450
I told you to stop!

106
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,320
What's going on?

107
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,150
Did someone come by?

108
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,700
What?

109
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,550
Oh, well...

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,530
...a street vendor.

111
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,070
A street vendor?

112
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,670
Yeah.

113
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,160
Let's go inside.

114
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,540
I'm going to spend the night here tonight.

115
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,490
I'll take a shower first.

116
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,520
Oh, oppa!

117
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,720
I said to stay still.

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,440
- What are you doing?
- Animal...

119
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,230
Don't, oppa.

120
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,910
- Oh, oppa...
- Fine.

121
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,530
Oppa...

122
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,830
The street vendor is leaving.

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,900
I said stay still.

124
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,210
Yes, Mother.

125
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,330
Soo Ah is at my place right now.

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,390
Yes.

127
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,760
Really?

128
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,970
I'll send her home right away.

129
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,620
Okay.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,180
What's with this?

131
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,910
Mr. Kim is around here.

132
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,000
He'll come by to pick you up.

133
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,540
We're engaged.

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,810
I hear other men can't stand to wait.

135
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,690
What's wrong with you, oppa?

136
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,800
I just thought you were being
cautious with me all along, but...

137
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,150
do you have another reason?

138
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,280
Am I right?

139
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,980
Soo Ah.

140
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,110
Ugh, I had no idea.

141
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,840
No, no, no. Don't say a word.

142
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,140
Okay.

143
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,200
This is a very important matter.

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,820
Other women will cry and talk
of breaking up the engagement.

145
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,330
But not me.

146
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,540
I'll look into hospitals.

147
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,840
Hospitals?

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,240
I heard there are many men
like you in their thirties.

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,100
With so much competition and stress.

150
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,400
But there are lots of good
medicines nowadays and...

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,860
it's perfectly...

152
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,510
...curable.

153
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,250
That's not it.

154
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,050
Oppa.

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,950
Let's go eat eel tomorrow.

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,090
I told you that's not it.

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,910
Why?

158
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,810
You don't like eel?

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Then...

160
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,370
...raspberry?

161
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,010
Rasp...

162
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:54,890
Never mind.

163
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,670
What can I say to you...

164
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,640
The Madam is waiting for you.

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,510
Please get in.

166
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,780
Is that...

167
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,030
...all you have to say to me?

168
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,170
Oppa.

169
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll leave then.

170
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,550
Sorry for the hassle every time.

171
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,420
No problem.

172
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,680
Alright then.

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,730
I'll get going.

174
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,020
Oppa!

175
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,800
Black garlic is good for you, too.

176
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,260
Be quiet and go.

177
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,790
Alright?

178
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,810
She's gone, right?

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,040
Jerk...

180
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,100
I heard the dead Hwang Dong Bae

181
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,230
making a threat to someone on the phone.

182
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,220
"If you don't listen to me,
I'll talk to your son."

183
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,040
Something like that.

184
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,910
Your son?

185
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,110
Also this isn't that important, but...

186
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,250
I spotted Assistant Manager Yang
from the Wedding Department crying.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,010
Team Leader.

188
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,840
The phone call Hwang Dong Bae
made right before his death...

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,790
He called New York.

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,390
New York?

191
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,110
Are you talking about America?

192
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,680
Yes.

193
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,640
But that number is not in service anymore.

194
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,330
We can't confirm who he
was talking to as of now.

195
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,670
I'm sure he didn't call the New York Bakery.

196
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,720
I requested US assistant for now but

197
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,680
due to privacy information laws and whatnot,

198
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,990
it will take some time.

199
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,490
New York. New York...

200
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,520
"I have a lot to say to your son."

201
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,200
Your son?

202
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,870
You're Jo Min Tae's son?

203
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,560
Yes.

204
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm Jo Sung Gyum.

205
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,440
You don't resemble your father.

206
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,670
Is that so?

207
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,760
You're much more handsome than your father.

208
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,070
Go ahead, sit.

209
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,570
Okay, thank you.

210
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
But...

211
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,520
why did you come see me?

212
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,370
By chance...

213
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,710
I was wondering if you knew
anything about my father's death.

214
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,080
I'd appreciate it if you
would tell me what you know.

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,830
Ah...

216
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,170
And this...

217
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,700
I did think this may offend you, but...

218
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,880
I thought I might disrupt your business and

219
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,640
I didn't know what I should bring.

220
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,880
You didn't have to.

221
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,350
Just...

222
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,760
tell me what you know.

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
Please I ask you.

224
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,020
It's different now, but...

225
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,010
back then...

226
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,430
there used to be a railing
on the second floor lobby.

227
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,460
I heard he fell off of there and

228
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,210
died from that accident.

229
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,170
But you know...

230
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,350
Yes?

231
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,230
It's okay.

232
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,750
Because of your father's triumphant success,

233
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,560
he had many enemies on the inside.

234
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,990
So...

235
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,010
there was much talk of murder...

236
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,230
...not an accident.

237
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,270
Your father was murdered.
Do you know who the killer is?

238
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,150
My father was...

239
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,310
...really murdered?

240
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,970
Come out.

241
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,050
Come out.

242
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,990
Oh, my God!

243
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,560
Right...

244
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,190
She must've come to her senses.

245
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,380
Letter of resignation

246
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,910
You're early.

247
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,220
I just had a lot on my mind.

248
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,310
Goo Hae Young and Jung Soo Ah's wedding?

249
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,320
I guess it didn't work out?

250
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,260
I'll be back.

251
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,330
This isn't good.

252
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,050
Manager Nam is...

253
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,430
...in a pickle.

254
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,410
She'll take care of it just fine.

255
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,730
She's the "future of the hotel."

256
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,550
You can focus on your
purse at a time like this?

257
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,740
Why couldn't I?

258
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,290
With a fake bag...

259
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,150
What do you mean fake?

260
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,810
I bought it at a duty-free shop in Hong Kong.

261
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,790
You were in Hong Kong this time?

262
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,620
Why would I believe that?

263
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,060
It's not like your family is rich
and all you have is your salary.

264
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,420
How do you afford international
trips and brand name purses?

265
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,020
- Don't blow it out of proportion.
- Stop it already.

266
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,000
I really went to Hong Kong.
This is real, too!

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,700
Okay, okay.

268
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,380
What's with you? You want to see a picture?

269
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,930
I told you to stop.

270
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,400
Things are disturbing as is.
Why are we acting this way?

271
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,790
What brings you...

272
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,780
Do you need to ask us more questions?

273
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,370
No.

274
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,530
I'd like to have some coffee...

275
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,030
...with Yang Kyung Hee.

276
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,420
Are you here to see me?

277
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,930
Ah, yes.

278
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,790
Well...

279
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,160
Let's see...

280
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,300
Yes.

281
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,510
Let's see what?

282
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,710
You know...

283
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,950
I was just walking by.

284
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,860
Letter of resignation

285
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,840
I see you're here, too.

286
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
You must have a lot on your mind.

287
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,040
Sit.

288
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,910
Is it too difficult for you?

289
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,910
Of course.

290
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,990
I'm sure they believe you ruined the wedding.

291
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,090
It would be hard to ask them to come back.

292
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
But...

293
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,430
I believe in you whether
things are resolved or not.

294
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,670
I'm sure you'll do your best.

295
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,280
I know...

296
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,910
you always...

297
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,630
...believe in me.

298
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,650
I...

299
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,190
...believe in fate.

300
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,940
The fact that we know each other...

301
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm sure it's not sheer coincidence.

302
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,820
I don't know how you'd take this, but...

303
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,710
if I had a daughter,

304
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,740
I wish...

305
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,990
...she was just like you.

306
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,690
You are like a father...

307
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,320
...to me as well.

308
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,800
I wanted to give up.

309
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,330
But I guess I can't.

310
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,770
Actually today...

311
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,810
I had my letter of resignation...

312
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,910
Where is it?

313
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,990
Where did it go?

314
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,260
Because of your father's triumphant success,

315
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,370
he had many enemies on the inside.

316
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,980
So...

317
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,380
there was much talk...

318
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,580
of murder...

319
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,770
...not an accident.

320
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,140
You're right.

321
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,040
The night Assistant Manager Hwang died,

322
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,180
what I said about being alone at home...

323
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,960
...was a lie.

324
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
Why did you lie about that?

325
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,990
I don't know what my father looked like
because he passed away when I was young.

326
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,800
My mom passed away from cancer
when I was in junior high.

327
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,520
I finished high school with much difficulty.

328
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,510
I've been working at this hotel...

329
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,690
...for twenty two years.

330
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,260
At first,

331
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,750
there were all sorts of incidents.

332
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,180
I had to bear...

333
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,560
...many rude incidents.

334
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,930
There were many times I wanted to cry.

335
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,990
I wanted to quit many times, too.

336
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,740
I had met someone I loved as well.

337
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,300
But I couldn't get married.

338
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,620
And I still live alone.

339
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,660
But now...

340
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,200
I've learned to get along with others and...

341
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,060
I started to believe I was a bit happier.

342
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,530
But just like my mom,

343
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,610
I was diagnosed with cancer.

344
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,570
I was told I have about a year left.

345
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,850
They can't do anything at this point.

346
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,570
I'm so scared and...

347
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,220
...so lonely.

348
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,180
I hate going to an empty
home more than death itself.

349
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,560
I couldn't think of...

350
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,470
...anywhere else but here.

351
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,810
In any case...

352
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,190
it's a place I spent my youth.

353
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,480
It's the only place...

354
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,180
...with fond memories.

355
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,150
I'm sorry for lying.

356
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,770
But...

357
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,690
I don't want it to be known...

358
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,340
...why I came here.

359
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,490
Come hurry!

360
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,170
I know who the killer is.

361
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,780
So the day of Assistant
Manager Hwang's death,

362
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,130
some strangers came and

363
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,400
looked for him?

364
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,090
Yes.

365
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,860
I didn't think it was a
big deal at first, but...

366
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,950
it kept bothering me.

367
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,060
I've been playing poker for 30 years.

368
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,580
I know how to read faces.

369
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,750
Don't think about lying.

370
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,580
Oh, yeah.

371
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,710
The guy with a tattoo on his hand,

372
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:22,970
he was like...

373
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,900
"I've been playing poker for 30 years."

374
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,870
He said something like that.

375
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,020
Hey.

376
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,210
How much longer do we have
to hide out in the country?

377
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,380
I know.

378
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,150
Why did you take us to the hotel?

379
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,680
Should we have left him alone?

380
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,220
I couldn't stand to see him alive.

381
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,090
Jeez...

382
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,710
Thanks to your temper...

383
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,820
look what happened to us.

384
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,620
You!

385
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,990
You'd better behave if you
don't want to end up like that.

386
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,810
Do you know what I went through
that day because of you?

387
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,070
I used initials for your sake.

388
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,610
- Here you go again.
- Hey, hey.

389
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,890
Stop it.

390
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,710
I think she's regretful.

391
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,410
It's not like I made things up.

392
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,580
Again?

393
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,540
It's true there was a corpse.

394
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,600
Joo Jung Eun!

395
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,380
I'll say it clearly.

396
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,420
Write a good article if you
call yourself a reporter, okay?

397
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,390
Not sensational articles like this.

398
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,230
Where are you going?

399
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,780
I'm so pissed off I'm going
to wash my face. Why?

400
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,760
He went through...

401
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,150
quite a bit that day...

402
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,990
...with all the phone calls.

403
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,200
It's Jung Soo Ah.

404
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
Oppa, don't worry too much.

405
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,990
The doctor said you're treatable.

406
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,910
Treatment?

407
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,360
- Is he sick?
- For now...

408
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,600
you need to have a complete physical.

409
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,270
I made an appointment for you.

410
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,090
A complete physical?

411
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,780
At the hospital?

412
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,980
Even if you can't get cured,

413
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,900
I'll never leave your side to the end.

414
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,670
Does he have...

415
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,890
...a terminal disease?

416
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,970
So, don't worry and let's get examined.

417
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,810
On Friday 2pm in Boondang at Wang Gun...

418
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,410
...Urology?

419
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,940
Urology?

420
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,000
Urology?

421
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,240
Restoring impotence.

422
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,160
He's a renowned expert.

423
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,450
Oh, our poor director...

424
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,800
What are they all doing?

425
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,330
It doesn't feel like someone else's problem.

426
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, it's here.

427
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,410
The raspberry juice...

428
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,330
I sent it to your house.

429
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,350
If you drink that,

430
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,910
they say you can crack the piss pot.

431
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,820
Piss pot god.

432
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,650
She says you can crack the piss pot.

433
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,050
Jeez.

434
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,150
Oh...

435
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,760
Don't worry about people
talking. I didn't tell anyone.

436
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,910
Oppa...

437
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,720
Do you...

438
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,520
...trust me?

439
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,420
She says, "Trust me."

440
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,160
"Trust me."

441
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
"Trust me."

442
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,060
She says, "Trust me."

443
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,430
What is it? Something funny?

444
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,380
What is it...

445
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,170
You're still here?

446
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,880
Goo Hae Young.

447
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,550
I think...

448
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,260
I can forget about you.

449
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,500
Thanks.

450
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,870
For reals.

451
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,850
Please.

452
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,590
What's this?

453
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:39,930
What?

454
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,350
Ugh, Jung Soo Ah...

455
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,900
Please give me just one hour.

456
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll brief on how I'll
proceed with your wedding.

457
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,550
At the moment, most hotels in Seoul are

458
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,030
pretty much booked for the next six months.

459
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,080
We'll give you the best time slot
with the best service at our hotel.

460
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,110
Oppa!

461
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,030
Jung Soo Ah!

462
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,250
Did you receive my text?

463
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,420
I texted you because I thought you'd be busy.

464
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,780
Who cares? What's there to hide between us?

465
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,730
Oh, yeah! I made reservation
at an eel restaurant tonight.

466
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,950
What do you mean? You know already why.

467
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,670
Whatever!

468
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,260
Come meet me at the front of the mall at 6pm.

469
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,640
Yeah, yeah. I love you, too.

470
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,230
Soo Ah.

471
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,130
Trust me once more and leave it to
me. What happened was an accident.

472
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,240
Am I almost done?

473
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,450
Yes, you're almost finished.

474
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,810
Where are my shoes?

475
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,620
Oh!

476
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,850
- Over here.
- Ah...

477
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,180
They're over there.

478
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,870
Your shoes.

479
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,670
Here they are.

480
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,890
Soo Ah.

481
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,650
Give me one more chance.
I'm confident I can do a great job.

482
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:33,960
Please?

483
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,860
Welcome.

484
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,890
Well...

485
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,750
This, this and that.

486
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
This, this and that.

487
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,380
Show them to me please.

488
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,870
$2,230.

489
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,980
Your wedding cost and

490
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,880
honeymoon cost.

491
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,550
We'll cover everything.

492
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,250
On your wedding anniversary,

493
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,330
we'll provide you with
the best suite for free.

494
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,930
The hotel pool and

495
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,280
the fitness room...

496
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,990
We'll give you a lifetime membership.

497
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,640
Look, Nam Sang Hyo.

498
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,550
I can get all that stuff with my own money.

499
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,210
Then...

500
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,250
if you tell me what you want...

501
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,080
Excuse me.

502
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,010
Yes?

503
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,910
Give me all of these.

504
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,360
I'll make it a wedding
you've never seen before.

505
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,190
You won't regret it one bit.

506
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,690
Of course, if there's something
you specifically want,

507
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,630
we'll gladly accept your request.

508
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,390
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

509
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,090
Give me everything here.

510
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,200
- Yes?
- Give me...

511
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,960
...all of them.

512
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,230
Okay.

513
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,810
Soo Ah.

514
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,100
Give me just one hour.

515
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,280
After you hear about my plan,

516
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,950
you'll be satisfied.

517
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,970
Just one hour.

518
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,530
You're really tenacious.

519
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,410
I'm begging you.

520
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,850
Fine.

521
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,440
I give up.

522
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,070
I'll think about it.

523
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,560
But in return...

524
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,600
the apology you didn't give me last time...

525
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,490
...give it now.

526
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,260
Excuse me?

527
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,030
Get on your knees and apologize.

528
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,600
What?

529
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,850
You can't do that?

530
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,520
I was going to reconsider
since you seemed so desperate.

531
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,870
But I guess not.

532
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,300
I believe in you whether
things are resolved or not.

533
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,610
I'm sure you'll do your best.

534
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,180
No.

535
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,170
I'll kneel.

536
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,640
Please give me one more chance.

537
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,800
I thought even a hotel
employee had her pride.

538
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,130
But I must've been wrong.

539
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,190
Oh.

540
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,640
I thought about it for a moment.

541
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,620
I don't think I can do it.

542
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,110
Why would I get married there not
knowing what else might fall out?

543
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,330
Jung Soo Ah.

544
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,260
Oppa.

545
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,690
She was bothering me.

546
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,910
Get up, Nam Sang Hyo.

547
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,140
Oppa...

548
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,410
Get up.

549
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,280
I said get up!

550
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,330
Don't kneel just anywhere.

551
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,210
Oppa.

552
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,900
Where are you going, oppa?

553
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,010
Oppa!

554
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,660
Oppa!

555
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,460
Miss.

556
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,080
You're late if you want to get
to the eel restaurant by 6pm.

557
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,840
How can you say that at
a time like this? Huh?

558
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,290
I'll be outside.

559
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,160
Cry as much as you want.

560
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,590
I'm sorry.

561
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
Why don't you take me to my room?

562
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,850
Huh?

563
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,390
Come on.

564
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,590
How about I tip you say, $1,000?

565
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,360
And you'll take care of me tonight, huh?

566
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,840
I don't work in room service. I'm sorry, sir.

567
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,300
Oh, c'mon. Let's go.

568
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,530
I really fantasize about Asian girls.

569
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,160
Ah, c'mon!

570
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,130
I want to see an Asian girl in control.

571
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,580
Hey, what the F***?

572
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,650
Here's $2,000 for you.

573
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,870
Quit immediately.

574
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,300
I told you it rarely happens.

575
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,810
You don't need to worry.

576
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,400
How much do you get paid there?

577
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,540
I'll give you that money.

578
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,440
Quit immediately.

579
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,010
Money?

580
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,220
Does it look like I'm doing this for money?

581
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,930
Then what?

582
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,730
If you want to work,

583
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,840
I can find another job for you.

584
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,530
Becoming a hotelier is my dream.

585
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,730
It's my work.

586
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,250
I want to do this work.

587
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,780
The work you want to do...

588
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,310
The work you want...

589
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,070
is bowing down to a drunken man and

590
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,490
saying "I'm sorry" even if he holds
your hand and drags you to his room?

591
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,030
Don't say it like that.

592
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,400
That hotel won't go bankrupt just
because you quit. Quit immediately.

593
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,820
Are you saying your work is
important but my work isn't?

594
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,660
That type of work can't be important.

595
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,210
Goo Hae Young.

596
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,930
Work in a decent field!

597
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,780
Oh, boy. I'm in a fix.

598
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,540
I have a lot on my mind as well.

599
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,990
You have equity in our hotel.

600
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,600
Please help me.

601
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,730
Money is one thing, but
it's my daughter's wedding.

602
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,250
After what happened...

603
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,790
To hold a wedding...

604
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,410
there again is...

605
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,200
I know it will be hard. But I beg you.

606
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,760
Anyway, I told them to come here.

607
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,900
So, you talk to them.

608
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,470
My daughter is quite stubborn.

609
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,640
I came here for some eel. What do you want?

610
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,450
Come.

611
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,900
I'm Managing Director
Jo Sung Gyum of Secret Hotel.

612
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,230
I've met you before.

613
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,570
You cry so much.

614
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,250
Thanks.

615
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,530
I'll go now.

616
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,030
I'll drive you home.

617
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,210
It's okay.

618
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,460
You cry so much.

619
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,540
Thanks.

620
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,420
I'll go now.

621
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
I'll drive you home.

622
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,060
It's okay.

623
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,870
Listen to me.

624
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,240
As much as you...

625
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,170
...I'm upset.

626
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,930
In any case...

627
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,130
I'll think about it.

628
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,930
But...

629
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,970
I'm not sure about oppa.

630
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,230
If I were Goo Hae Young,
I'd listen to your request.

631
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,150
That is true.

632
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,910
I'll leave it to you.

633
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,180
See you next time.

634
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,150
Oh, yes. Goodnight.

635
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,680
You, too, Soo Ah.

636
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,300
I'll go.

637
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,090
Thanks.

638
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,300
Sang Hyo.

639
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,790
You know...

640
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,670
Must you do that?

641
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,040
What?

642
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,130
To the extent of kneeling and begging...

643
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,870
Must you?

644
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:27,940
Why?

645
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,210
Does my work still look like a joke to you?

646
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,730
That's not what I'm saying.

647
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,330
How can you leave like that earlier?

648
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,440
Did you come because you feel bad?

649
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,320
Alright.

650
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,890
I'll forgive you since
you've come all this way.

651
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:16,860
Soo Ah.

652
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,140
Let's get married at the Secret Hotel.

653
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:21,830
What?

654
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,980
I must get married there.

655
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,260
No matter what you say...

656
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,180
No...

657
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,640
no matter how much you oppose it...

658
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,130
- So...
- Alright.

659
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,430
What?

660
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,360
I'll do it there.

661
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,840
You will?

662
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,910
You will do it there?

663
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,470
So easily?

664
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,380
I can't be selfish.

665
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,190
The hotel has so many employees to feed.

666
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,860
I'll do as you say.

667
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,020
Aren't I kind?

668
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,090
I'm kind, right?

669
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,330
Yeah.

670
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,730
Right.

671
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,090
She's strangely kind.

672
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,330
Nam Sang Hyo.

673
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,990
How did it go?

674
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,340
Goo Hae Young and Jung Soo Ah's wedding.

675
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,700
Don't ask.

676
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,630
It didn't work out?

677
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,900
Gosh...

678
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,450
This is a big problem.

679
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,120
Sang Hyo.

680
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,040
Don't worry too much.

681
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,620
Whatever way I can,

682
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,510
I'll look for a way.

683
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,270
You will?

684
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,820
What's gotten into you?

685
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,170
We have a love-hate relationship.

686
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,200
This is really Hong Kong?

687
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,520
That's right...

688
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,780
you've never been there.

689
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:00,960
Isn't this a photo composite?

690
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,060
How can I compose the photo on my phone?

691
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,710
Is that right?

692
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,360
Anyway, you have skills.

693
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,850
Carrying a brand name purse and
traveling with your salary.

694
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,110
- Here.
- What, don't you want to see more?

695
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,300
That's enough.

696
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,550
The model sucks. I don't want to look.

697
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,810
How did it go?

698
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,510
I don't think it will work.

699
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,370
I can't believe you can't pull
this one off, Manager Nam.

700
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,300
What can you do?

701
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,590
People can slip at times.

702
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:55,980
This is...

703
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,510
Manager Nam.

704
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,220
Jung Soo Ah is here to see you.

705
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,910
What brings you here?

706
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,670
Well?

707
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,590
Why do you think I'm here?

708
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,390
What's this?

709
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,290
I heard Goo Hae Young and Jung Soo Ah's
wedding is unlikely to happen here.

710
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,730
This is a proposal to replace that wedding.

711
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,720
Please review.

712
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,220
The Managing Director of Secret Hotel and...

713
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,320
...a beautiful PR Manager.

714
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,190
A magical wedding for two
people to represent the hotel.

715
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,700
This beautiful PR Manager you speak of...

716
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,290
Are you talking about yourself?

717
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,140
Of course, I am.

718
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,560
Is there another...

719
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,170
PR Manager besides me?

720
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,560
Director Jo Sung Gyum came
to see me last night.

721
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,020
He was begging me so desperately.

722
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,750
I convinced my oppa, too.

723
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,800
Why not?

724
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,590
Why can't we do that?

725
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,260
I don't think it's a good method.

726
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,320
I think it's a good method.

727
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,890
We must revive the hotel.

728
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,900
Worse situations can occur
rather than reviving it.

729
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,860
Worse situations?

730
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,580
You get divorced within three
months of marrying in our hotel.

731
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,710
We can't confirm that rumor.

732
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,850
Why are you so sure we'd get a divorce?

733
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,050
Yeo Eun Joo.

734
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,250
Yes.

735
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,950
You're supposed to marry someone you love.

736
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,360
No goals or benefits can...

737
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,460
...replace that.

738
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,850
Managing Director.

739
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,190
What is it?

740
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,270
Well...

741
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,910
I want to report the wedding of
Goo Hae Young and Jung Soo Ah will happen.

742
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,050
What?

743
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,160
Jung Soo Ah just arrived.

744
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,880
She says she'll get married here.

745
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,450
We won't need this one for sure.

746
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,800
You can go now.

747
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,760
I have something to say to Nam Sang Hyo.

748
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,620
Okay.

749
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,060
I guess I didn't think this through.

750
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,430
What?

751
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,540
What, what, what?

752
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,150
Why are you looking at me?

753
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,950
Oh?

754
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,940
What's with your name, Simon?

755
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,430
Jung Soo Ah.

756
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,590
Did you call me?

757
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,520
It really is...

758
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,090
...you, Jung Soo Ah.

759
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,100
You look just like my friend.

760
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,860
Well...

761
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,980
I was just wondering if...

762
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,620
...it was you.

763
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,440
You have a friend...

764
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,860
...who looks like me?

765
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,610
Yes.

766
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,110
You two look just alike.

767
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,190
Is your friend Kim Tae Hee or something?

768
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,400
No.

769
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,340
She's not Kim Tae Hee.

770
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,240
She looks...

771
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,920
...just like you.

772
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,840
I'll bring a picture to show you tomorrow.

773
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,150
Sure.

774
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,340
Thank you.

775
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,830
Thank you for your help.

776
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,600
I did what I needed to do
as a managing director.

777
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,430
I...

778
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,140
was wondering if you helped me...

779
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,650
...because you were interested in me.

780
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,780
I made you nervous, Managing Director.

781
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,160
I'm just kidding.

782
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:48,800
Oh.

783
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,060
What should I do with this?

784
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,770
Letter of resignation

785
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,980
Oh!

786
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,670
How is that...

787
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,310
You dropped it in front of my office.

788
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,480
No...

789
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,270
That's...

790
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,610
I'll have to process is
since you submitted it.

791
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,410
Well then...

792
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,450
I have a meeting.

793
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,590
Managing Director.

794
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,760
Excuse me.

795
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,610
Managing Director.

796
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,900
What?

797
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,360
Do you want to take it back?

798
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,160
Yes.

799
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,170
Fine.

800
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,480
But not for nothing.

801
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,530
I'll forget about it if you
buy me the dinner I want.

802
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,150
What?

803
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,220
Managing Director.

804
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,280
What would you like to eat?
I'll buy if you tell me.

805
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,860
Well, that's for you to figure out.

806
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,400
Excuse me?

807
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,620
I can't give you much time.

808
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:12,520
Guess while I walk down to the first floor.

809
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,270
Then...

810
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,180
how about steak?

811
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,280
I'm not a fan of western food.

812
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,340
How about this bean paste stew place I know?

813
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,830
I like spicy food.

814
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,390
Ugh, then...

815
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,690
Kimchee stew.

816
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,770
Boodae stew.

817
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,050
I feel like noodles rather than rice today.

818
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,110
Black bean noodles or spicy seafood noodles!

819
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,510
That's too bad.

820
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,090
You have no sense.

821
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,720
Sense?

822
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,290
Managing Director.

823
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,090
Ramen.

824
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,750
Then...

825
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:13,610
would you like...

826
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,730
...some ramen?

827
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,770
Sure.

828
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,190
I was really going to buy you a great
dinner even if it cost me my paycheck.

829
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,640
I enjoyed it.

830
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,660
No way...

831
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,610
I saw you leave more than half uneaten.

832
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,570
Managing Director.

833
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,130
By chance...

834
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,910
instead of ramen...

835
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,900
do you like me?

836
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,740
You're not surprised.

837
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,030
I'm just kidding.

838
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,710
I asked you to eat ramen because
I want to ask you something.

839
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,450
What is it?

840
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,160
In order to realize you're in love,

841
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,540
do you know how many minutes it takes?

842
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,050
Three minutes.

843
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,040
The time it takes for the
ramen to cook was long enough.

844
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,720
Nam Sang Hyo.

845
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,430
What do you say...

846
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,020
...we date officially?

847
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,730
Will you date him?

848
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,670
Will you date Jo Sung Gyum?

849
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:54,390
I...

850
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,770
was married seven years ago.

851
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:57,790
My ex-husband...

852
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,860
You really make me out to be an idiot.

853
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,950
It's a picture I took
in Hong Kong last month.

854
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,300
There were several pictures we took together.

855
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,400
What do you want?

856
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,070
Tell me what type of wedding you want
rather than regretting it later.

857
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,220
How about this?

858
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,000
Instead of an extravagant
dress, the bride wears

859
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,240
a clean and down-to-earth one piece dress.

860
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,680
In her hands, she holds a few flowers
she likes and in their hearts...

861
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,480
Sang Hyo.

862
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,920
I have to tell you something.

863
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,380
I must tell you before this day ends.
