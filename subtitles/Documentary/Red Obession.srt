{890}{1018}By the year 2000, we'd overpopulated,|polluted and poisoned our planet. ..
{1024}{1070}...faster than we could clean it up.
{1076}{1187}We ignored the problem for as long as|we could, but were kidding ourselves.
{1194}{1261}By 2025, we knew we were|in trouble...
{1266}{1375}...and began to desperately search|for a new home: Mars.
{1380}{1473}For the last 20 years, we've sent|unmanned probes with algae...
{1478}{1553}...bioengineered to grow there and|produce oxygen.
{1558}{1630}We'll build ourselves an atmosphere|we can breathe.
{1637}{1752}And for 20 years it seemed to work.|It looked like we'd pulled it off.
{1757}{1849}Then all of a sudden,|oxygen levels started to drop.
{1854}{1897}We don't know why.
{2290}{2383}The international community has thrown|all its resources behind us.
{2388}{2475}It's the greatest undertaking man|has ever attempted.
{2481}{2580}Our ship, Mars-1 , is too massive to|launch from the surface of the planet.
{2585}{2653}We've shuttled here to the high-orbit|space station...
{2659}{2744}...for a low-gravity launch to begin|our six-month trip:
{2782}{2829}The first manned mission to Mars.
{2863}{2936}The hope and survival|of mankind rests on us.
{3113}{3157}But I know we'll solve the problem.
{3163}{3259}Because the best scientific minds are|going there to find the answer.
{3264}{3306}And I'm leading the mission.
{3311}{3380}I'm Bowman, pilot|and mission commander.
{3399}{3492}Chantilas, chief science officer|and the soul of the crew.
{3523}{3613}Santen, a hothead,|but a fine copilot.
{3654}{3736}Gallagher, our mechanical systems|engineer. Maintenance.
{3741}{3787}Frankly, not my first choice.
{3923}{3974}The two civilian members|of the team are:
{3987}{4112}Burchenal, one of the world's leading|bioengineers, his own greatest hero.
{4136}{4159}Pettengil. ..
{4164}{4267}...terraforming expert and last-minute|replacement on the science team.
{4275}{4343}And packed away in her box, AMEE:
{4349}{4414}Autonomous Mapping Exploration|and Evasion.
{4419}{4478}A multi-task robot on loan|from the Marines.
{4484}{4564}In other words,|our Mars surface navigator.
{4574}{4625}We're the first travelers|to another planet.
{4631}{4684}It's another giant leap|for mankind. ..
{4689}{4792}...and if we don't find out what's|wrong on Mars, it could be our last.
{5304}{5342}Alpha Mach indicator.
{5347}{5390}-Clear.|-Confirmed.
{5395}{5471}That concludes the primary systems|checklist, commander.
{5476}{5515}-Thanks, Lucille.|-You're welcome.
{5520}{5552}Gentlemen...
{5559}{5593}...take over.
{5603}{5670}-Can't believe we're doing this.|-Just follow the routine.
{5676}{5766}Secondary systems. OHS/RCS.
{5785}{5816}-Clear.|-RCS, confirmed.
{5821}{5904}-Optical alignment sight.|-Op sight, rate 19.
{5927}{5998}How many hits you get on your website|yesterday, Pettengil?
{6004}{6071}-I got 500.000.|-That's great.
{6080}{6109}How many did you get?
{6119}{6167}ATU, 13.6 degrees.
{6173}{6215}832.
{6254}{6299}All from your mother?
{6543}{6612}You know, it's strange. It's gone.
{6621}{6707}Yesterday I could see it. Today I|looked and I couldn't find it.
{6712}{6787}So what? You think the Earth just|vanished? It's gone forever?
{6792}{6863}-It's weird not being able to see it.|-Yeah, so it's weird.
{6879}{6925}You'll get over it, or you won't.
{6981}{7047}Just something I wasn't expecting,|that's all.
{7163}{7223}Up for a couple of turns|around the campus?
{7380}{7447}My grandfather taught me|to sail when I was a kid.
{7456}{7503}Taught me to read the stars.
{7523}{7619}"Just in case all the GPS satellites|fell out of the sky," he said.
{7636}{7699}He said, "Any man who puts his life...
{7704}{7777}...in the hands of a bunch|of batteries is an idiot."
{7795}{7838}A real Yankee.
{7843}{7907}No, he just wouldn't approve something|he couldn't build with his hands.
{7913}{7990}-He wouldn't have approved of this.|-Going to Mars?
{7997}{8070}He'd say we were headed for trouble.
{8076}{8125}Say we didn't try.
{8148}{8198}We just finished poisoning the Earth...
{8204}{8264}...and everyone was dead in 100 years.
{8269}{8335}Then what was the point of any of it?
{8340}{8379}Art, beauty, all gone.
{8384}{8445}The Greeks. The Constitution.
{8463}{8541}We've been dying for freedom, ideas.
{8556}{8604}None of it meant anything?
{8612}{8716}And what about religion?|Do we give up on God too?
{8728}{8815}You didn't just give up being|a scientist one day, did you?
{8856}{8903}I realized science...
{8908}{9000}...couldn't answer any of the really|interesting questions.
{9006}{9057}So I turned to philosophy.
{9073}{9137}Been searching for God ever since.
{9480}{9575}You're talking to a classroom of|second graders from Iowa. At 14:30.
{9581}{9623}Wait a minute.|It's your turn to do the kiddies.
{9629}{9713}Oh, no. It is your turn,|and you know it. Besides...
{9720}{9798}...I outrank you.|I could order you to do it.
{9805}{9862}Just because they promote faster|in the Navy.
{9876}{9962}Of course they do. You have to when|you deal with the best people.
{9993}{10067}14:30, with a smile on your face.
{10073}{10127}This mean you're pulling rank|for the shower too?
{10132}{10169}No, not rank.
{10177}{10244}Gender. Ladies first.
{10577}{10640}Could you pass me the towel, please?
{10735}{10790}Sure. Sorry.
{10798}{10869}Just pretend I'm your sister.
{10949}{11037}I have two sisters.|They don't look like you.
{11049}{11121}This only works if we both believe|it doesn't matter.
{11143}{11242}-So I should pretend you're Burchenal.|-It could matter more than that.
{11275}{11335}Why don't we practice? You can get|back in the shower naked...
{11340}{11430}...and come out, and I'll pretend it|doesn't matter.
{11539}{11604}Why don't you go fix something?
{11635}{11679}Yes, sir. Ma'am.
{11885}{11942}-MEV systems check confirmed.|-I'll be on the deck with Bowman.
{11948}{12005}-Yep, sure.|-500,000.
{12009}{12069}832. Tighten up.
{12098}{12137}Get ready, boys.
{12169}{12214}I hate him. It's like high school.
{12220}{12286}There's the jocks and then us.|You watch my back, I'll watch yours.
{12297}{12334}Do you want to help me with AMEE?
{12340}{12391}It's time for her prelaunch|diagnostics check.
{12462}{12525}Hang on. Who are you kidding?|You're a jock.
{12537}{12581}You did the NASCAR circuit, right?
{12601}{12669}I was just tuning cars.|Wasn't really jock stuff.
{12678}{12733}-It's heavy.|-Ears are still ringing.
{12770}{12819}What powers this thing?
{12824}{12857}A helium nuclear power cell.
{12862}{12934}Size of a beer can,|runs her for eight months.
{13209}{13232}Hey, sweetie.
{13237}{13299}Sweetie? Is she our navigator|or your girlfriend?
{13305}{13363}-Been a long flight.|-Certainly has.
{13368}{13417}It's looking good.|Let's check your T1.
{13709}{13740}Tighten up!
{13806}{13866}So the military removed her reflexes?
{13871}{13916}That should make her your kind of girl.
{14044}{14086}Gut him like a fish.
{14287}{14319}Kill him.
{14528}{14582}That's my kind of girl.
{14607}{14642}That's real damn funny.
{14647}{14725}-Activity strictly prohibited. Cease.|-She could've hurt me.
{14731}{14818}They took away her knife,|but inside she's all Green Beret.
{14830}{14888}Back in navigator mode.|You'll dig Mars.
{14961}{14999}So have a good time...
{15005}{15081}...and I hope to see you back|on Earth soon. Good luck.
{15087}{15119}We miss you.
{15134}{15162}Bye.
{15167}{15218}209 web messages remaining.
{15223}{15256}Hey, Teddy. Remember me?
{15261}{15302}Sure hope you haven't forgotten|your old friends...
{15307}{15357}...now that you're a big hotshot|astronaut.
{15364}{15425}Just letting you know|I'm thinking about you.
{15564}{15623}I sense an irregular humidity mixture.
{15861}{15885}How you doing?
{15895}{15963}Fine.|Soon as someone explains to me...
{15968}{16072}...why a flight deck indicator says|the temperature is above normal.
{16086}{16119}About 10 degrees.
{16140}{16184}Fahrenheit or centigrade?
{16332}{16370}He's teaching me about biology.
{16375}{16444}-I've developed an interest in--|-Fermentation?
{16481}{16583}A billion dollars in this mission, and|you use the lab equipment as a still?
{16588}{16627}No. I'm....
{16649}{16691}I'm sterilizing.
{16719}{16825}And how do you propose|that I explain to Houston...
{16951}{17043}...that two of my crew went blind|drinking moonshine vodka?
{17095}{17124}Very carefully?
{17329}{17412}So, what? Doesn't this establishment|serve women?
{17456}{17495}Allow me.
{17554}{17600}Commander Bowman.
{17782}{17827}I learned how to drink|in the Navy, boys.
{17949}{18020}Chantilas, there were frogs around|when you were a kid, right?
{18025}{18049}Lots.
{18055}{18132}And then we killed them.|Every last one.
{18140}{18233}Now, since frogs breathe|through their skins...
{18239}{18335}...they react to the toxins|in the environment more rapidly.
{18340}{18415}That should've been a warning.|Don't you think?
{18461}{18486}Your point?
{18497}{18607}Man's a party animal. lf he's doing|okay, then nothing else matters.
{18618}{18662}That won't change.
{18685}{18780}Unless there are larger forces|at work than biology.
{18819}{18925}We're going to talk about God now?|lf we are, I'll need another pop.
{18941}{18972}Not God...
{18977}{18999}...faith.
{19005}{19107}I had a girl named Faith. Cheated|on me with a girl named Chastity.
{19180}{19287}You wouldn't be riding|309 million kilometers...
{19293}{19345}...into outer space and back...
{19351}{19441}...in a rocket ship that nobody|ever tested properly...
{19452}{19499}...without having a little faith.
{19604}{19690}Listen, let's forget all|the hypotheticals for a second, okay?
{19695}{19740}I say...
{19749}{19818}...to hell with humanity.|I say, Commander Bowman...
{19852}{19932}...when we get to Mars,|we just take it.
{19949}{20000}We just take it over for ourselves.
{20020}{20087}Call Earth, tell them it sucks|and don't bother coming?
{20092}{20162}Yeah. Whatever keeps out the riffraff.
{20168}{20203}You can do the religion thing.
{20209}{20299}Gallagher, you can keep|the space john working, and...
{20304}{20357}...Pettengil's passed out...
{20364}{20451}...and I can handle pretty much|everything else, you know.
{20463}{20487}King.
{20503}{20538}What about me?
{20622}{20668}Well, you'll be my queen.
{20773}{20828}Propagation of the species.
{21112}{21144}It's just a....
{21164}{21256}It's just a joke.|Commander Bowman, it was a....
{21303}{21415}And on that note, gentlemen,|I suggest we retire.
{21501}{21577}Mars-1 , Houston.|You have acquired orbit.
{21585}{21659}Congratulations on 182 days|of smooth sailing.
{21664}{21732}And welcome to Mars. Houston out.
{22597}{22631}Found a good parking space?
{22644}{22713}Yep. Right between Phobos and Deimos.
{22777}{22829}I prefer one moon, you know?
{22837}{22899}That way, you know what to call it.|"The moon."
{22932}{22985}More color commentary|from the janitor.
{22996}{23093}The correct term is|"mechanical systems engineer."
{23101}{23175}-But he will accept "space janitor."|-To hell with the chitchat.
{23182}{23281}After six months, I'm ready to get out|of this hamster cage. Bowman?
{23293}{23372}Lucille, initiate all pre-launch|systems checks.
{23377}{23406}-Yes, commander.|-Finally.
{23437}{23469}We'll eat dinner on Mars.

{24016}{24051}We'll have fresh tomatoes tonight.
{24069}{24116}That's one requirement|for my dream house.
{24121}{24184}Bet you want|a white picket fence, right?
{24189}{24222}I wouldn't mind.
{24227}{24302}-Lucille, can we see our new home?|-Yes, commander.
{24433}{24477}Locking in on HAB.
{24482}{24529}LZ 56.
{24546}{24582}Sure is desolate.

{42967}{43022}O-2 level 2% and increasing.
{43052}{43081}Where the hell is HAB?
{43086}{43128}lf you hadn't dumped our navigator,|we'd know.
{43133}{43202}Can't get a visual on AMEE,|but maybe I can fix this radio.
{43207}{43235}How long?
{43241}{43294}Don't know.|These repairs'll take a while.
{43299}{43347}Science package is IKO'd also.
{43353}{43454}-Shit. There goes the mission.|-Mission's not over yet, Pettengil.
{43459}{43538}Really? Did you miss something?|We lost the science package.
{43544}{43601}-We can't do what we came here for.|-Quit whining.
{43635}{43678}You did park us on the rocks.
{43683}{43727}And you knew there were risks.
{43732}{43812}Right now, gentlemen, locating HAB|is what matters.
{43829}{43878}Exterior atmosphere indicator is|disabled.
{43883}{43962}-I think we're somewhere downrange.|-Calculating landing ellipse.
{43972}{44023}Based on our last uncorrupted nav|state...
{44030}{44108}...I'd say we're somewhere in this 60|by 120 kilometer ellipse.
{44119}{44236}The mission data's here. We need to|close in on the downrange variables.
{44242}{44272}It's about the math.
{44292}{44356}This is it. That moment they told us|about in high school...
{44361}{44417}...where one day, algebra would|save our lives.
{44449}{44471}Shut up.
{44482}{44509}Sorry.
{44533}{44594}Warning, AMEE not responding.
{44603}{44661}Mars-1 comm initiation unsuccessful.
{44761}{44829}T-ray imaging.
{45219}{45253}Oh, man.
{45368}{45439}System memory, bring up a panoramic|shot from the HAB.
{45444}{45479}Ocular mach 1-X panoramic mode.
{45487}{45507}Reverse?
{45517}{45556}Downrange charging.
{45648}{45683}Hey, guys. Look at this.
{45688}{45720}What, Gallagher?
{45726}{45806}I don't think it's about the math. I|think it's about the picture.
{45811}{45837}What picture?
{45843}{45871}This one.
{45876}{45974}We're not in that picture.|lf we were, we'd know where HAB was.
{45980}{46099}I know, but if this rock is HAB and|it's in the line about 30 degrees...
{46105}{46182}...it sees these two peaks, but|reverse, as it's on the other side...
{46187}{46245}...and at 180 degrees,|it sees those two peaks.
{46251}{46308}Which puts us on a line about here...
{46323}{46388}...which makes the line to the HAB|about there.
{46435}{46470}He's right.
{46511}{46551}Nice work, space janitor.
{46577}{46631}We only have seven|and a half hours of air left.
{46656}{46687}Let's get moving.
{47349}{47396}I realized science...
{47401}{47492}...couldn't answer any of the really|interesting questions.
{47501}{47549}So I turned to philosophy.
{47568}{47627}Been searching for God ever since.
{47637}{47670}Who knows?
{47677}{47757}I may pick up a rock and it'll say|underneath, "Made by God."
{47763}{47831}Universe is full of surprises.
{47848}{47887}That would be a big one.
{48015}{48039}You ready, sir?
{48105}{48167}Unfortunately, I'm staying here.
{48173}{48195}What?
{48211}{48295}My spleen's ruptured.|There's significant internal bleeding.
{48301}{48335}I wouldn't get very far.
{48340}{48432}We have emergency medical gear at HAB.|We can lock out the spine impulse.
{48439}{48487}You can walk us through the surgery.
{48494}{48598}Carrying me will slow you all down,|enough to deplete everyone's oxygen.
{48604}{48670}This is no time for misguided heroics.
{48675}{48706}I won't let you die here.
{48721}{48788}What we came here to do|is more important.
{48810}{48879}The four of you must carry|on with the mission.
{48888}{48959}It won't be easy,|but I know you can do it.
{49013}{49045}Get going.
{49169}{49207}You heard the man.
{49624}{49671}I got to see Mars.
{50675}{50732}Come on, give me a red light.|Give me juice.
{50737}{50855}Come on, don't do this to me and my|team. Give me a goddamn red light.
{50861}{50913}Communications online.
{50920}{50971}See? All you needed|was an attitude check.
{50976}{51009}Thank you, commander.
{51037}{51118}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.|Can you hear me? Over.
{51187}{51270}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.|Do you copy? Over.
{51373}{51442}Terrascan has nothing to report.|No life form trace apparent.
{51453}{51505}It's weird. There's nothing here.
{51519}{51551}It's Mars.
{51563}{51639}No, I mean there's not one sign|of the algae we sent up here.
{51644}{51744}Even if it all died, there should be|something. Dried algal mat, traces--
{51749}{51794}He's right. They're not just dead,|they're gone.
{51799}{51890}Like they were scoured off. This says|there was nothing here. impossible.
{51910}{51975}Maybe there was never anything|in this valley.
{52001}{52050}lf we are where we think we are...
{52055}{52129}...this area was covered|with blue algae just a month ago.
{52156}{52224}The valley before this should've been|blazing with red-orange chloroflectic.
{52229}{52276}All this talking's burning up oxygen.|Move out.
{52281}{52354}We know what happened to the oxygen.|Nothing here to make it.
{52359}{52380}You done?
{52407}{52449}I said, move out.
{53385}{53443}Ten minutes until we exit the day side.
{53448}{53497}Okay, where are the boys?
{53513}{53549}Grid tracking. De-lock.
{53647}{53689}-Boys, where are you?|-LZ topography.
{53695}{53761}Six degrees tracking,|three minutes tracking.
{53768}{53800}LT lock.
{53816}{53859}MEV landing zone. LZ 56.
{53864}{53909}Why aren't you at the LZ?
{54511}{54595}Five minutes until we exit|the day side and lose visuals.
{54600}{54643}1-4-4-X.
{54653}{54689}Azimuth HZ 4.99.
{54695}{54728}Boys, where are you?
{54733}{54775}MEVLP lock.
{54861}{54888}Oh, shit.
{54933}{54983}Find HAB for me, Lucille.
{55304}{55332}There it is!
{55337}{55416}-We made it.|-26 months of food, air and water!
{55420}{55443}We made it!
{55448}{55478}Food!
{56275}{56316}God help us.
{56664}{56703}It's all chewed up.
{56786}{56819}What happened?
{56840}{56918}-Ice storm couldn't have done this.|-No way.
{56924}{57004}Every HAB stood up to an F-5|in tornado alley.
{57019}{57047}This isn't weather-related.
{57054}{57096}Okay. What are we going to do?
{57119}{57164}Start looking for O-2.
{57299}{57362}Houston, this is Mars-1.
{57367}{57472}We've experienced a massive proton|field upset sequel to a solar flare.
{57492}{57611}Mars-1 systems at below 70% , orbital|path degraded by fire-control air purge.
{57616}{57658}Engine function zero.
{57880}{57958}MEV launched with a crew of five.|I have visual on crash site.
{57963}{58062}I can see one person down. I have|absolutely no radio contact with them.
{58067}{58156}Houston, visuals confirm that HAB-1|is tango-uniform.
{58162}{58216}I repeat, HAB-1 has been destroyed.
{58411}{58507}Even if the rest of the team is alive,|they have no way to survive.
{58535}{58627}I'm uploading telemetry|and video data to you now.
{58716}{58764}Data unit relay.
{58972}{58996}I don't see anything.
{59010}{59068}No food, no air, no water.
{59111}{59171}-What are we going to do?|-Nothing we can do.
{59188}{59211}We're out of time.
{59216}{59260}We're out of time|when we're out of air.
{59266}{59308}16 minutes. What do you got left?
{59314}{59348}A little less.
{59376}{59436}Some final entry for the bio.
{59455}{59567}"Disappointed 12 billion people,|not counting the ex-wives."
{60536}{60583}I hope Bowman made it.
{60665}{60746}You know, I had a thing for her...
{60781}{60819}...from the start.
{60824}{60919}I thought they chose me|because I was single...
{60938}{60980}...in case I died.
{61104}{61156}Short time to live.
{61212}{61270}Long time to wait.
{61544}{61602}God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?
{61796}{61871}I was planning on getting engaged|when I got back.
{61940}{62006}Yeah, well, I'm going to miss|a lot of girls.
{62028}{62076}A lot of girls are going to miss me.
{62151}{62206}I was never supposed to be here.
{62218}{62284}I was just the next lucky guy|on the list.
{62330}{62404}Well, my flying ability|isn't an issue now.
{62416}{62495}With HAB destroyed, it makes no|difference where we landed.
{62501}{62532}You're calculating excuses.
{62537}{62638}Nothing to excuse.|It's moot. No impact.
{62670}{62728}-But Chantilas?|-Moot.
{62756}{62807}He'd have died here anyway.
{62828}{62867}Just like us.
{62932}{62983}You're amazing, Mr. Santen.
{62993}{63078}Your life is about to end,|and you still can't accept defeat.
{63092}{63208}I can come across as a hard-ass.|I know that. But technically...
{63223}{63267}...I didn't fail.
{63360}{63410}Look, what's done is done.
{63475}{63560}-I came up here to forgive you.|-Yeah? Well, screw you.
{63566}{63638}I don't need forgiveness|from a pussy like you.
{63744}{63784}Get out of here.
{63842}{63912}Go away and die like a man if you can.
{64007}{64040}Oh, my God.
{64400}{64511}Mars ' polar ice is mostly CO-2.
{64521}{64648}We use low-order nuclear detonations|to melt the ice.
{64673}{64706}That releases CO-2.
{64724}{64834}CO-2 buildup creates|a greenhouse effect.
{64867}{64904}Mars starts to warm up.
{64915}{64962}Now, when it's hot enough...
{64968}{65048}...we seed down some algae.
{65060}{65164}The algae grows and emits oxygen.
{65338}{65427}You want me to just shut up|and let you die quietly?
{65479}{65519}No. Kind of peaceful.
{65546}{65646}Okay. So, they sent us here...
{65651}{65772}...to figure out what happened|to the oxygen.
{65778}{65820}Question is...
{65852}{65911}...what happened to the algae?
{65938}{65962}You know?
{66195}{66232}Santen's dead.
{66252}{66295}He threw himself off a cliff.
{66352}{66391}I tried to stop him.
{66650}{66718}Gallagher, replace your O-2 canister|immediately.
{66723}{66762}I'm under a minute.
{66823}{66866}What's it going to be like?
{66906}{66943}Hypoxia?
{66984}{67059}Dizziness. Skin will tingle.
{67075}{67116}Vision narrows.
{67124}{67175}Then shock, convulsions...
{67190}{67230}...acidosis....
{67252}{67295}Is it going to hurt?
{67342}{67366}Yeah.
{67466}{67542}I'm going to.... I'm going to...
{67548}{67598}...go over here. Take a walk.
{67652}{67702}Gallagher, oxygen supply depleted.
{68607}{68715}Burchenal.|Replace your O-2 canister immediately.
{69275}{69356}Pettengil, replace your O-2 canister|immediately.
{69782}{69817}I can breathe.
{69824}{69858}I can breathe.
{69963}{70010}It's like being in high altitude.
{70015}{70089}I don't know how we can breathe,|but we can breathe.
{70265}{70307}We can breathe!
{70375}{70427}I don't know what the hell this is.
{70443}{70481}But I'll take it.
{70701}{70732}I can breathe.
{70839}{70885}This can't be possible.
{70932}{70985}What the hell is going on here?
{71019}{71087}lf Santen waited a few more|minutes....
{71092}{71119}We can breathe, Santen.
{71151}{71189}We can breathe.
{71311}{71374}Attention, commander, incoming relay.
{71379}{71471}Mars-1 , this is Houston. We got your|message and are glad to hear you.
{71478}{71527}Analysis of your telemetry...
{71532}{71603}...indicates Mars-1 orbital failure|in 31 hours.
{71608}{71664}The good news is, we'll have you|out of there by then.
{71669}{71743}We believe we can restore engine|function for a main engine burn...
{71748}{71803}...and exit from Mars ' orbit.
{71808}{71906}Ground crew is presumed|End of Mission. Houston out.
{71996}{72113}Terraforming didn't even come close|to creating breathable air up here.
{72118}{72142}Right?
{72175}{72243}The oxygen levels were already|dropping when all the sensors died.
{72248}{72326}So how can there be more O-2|now than ever before...
{72348}{72401}...and no algae to make it?
{72536}{72629}Sorry, commander. No response|from ignition systems.
{72786}{72833}Houston, Mars-1.
{72839}{72897}No joy on all scenarios|for engine ignition.
{72902}{72999}That includes hitting the console.|What next? Over.
{73005}{73097}God, I wish I didn't have to wait|40 minutes to hear your answer.
{73120}{73182}Hey, guys. Here's the radio.
{73220}{73273}We're not going to be calling Bowman|on this.
{73323}{73351}Wait a second.
{73365}{73455}I saw something when we were trying|to locate HAB.
{73476}{73541}That little rover they sent up|here back in '97.
{73547}{73590}That must have a radio, right?
{73596}{73633}-Yeah.|-Hang on.
{73654}{73698}It's 4 kilometers from here.
{73742}{73789}Going to get dark real soon.
{73796}{73831}It'll be too cold.
{73840}{73878}We'll go first light.
{73932}{74002}This thing still has enough rocket|fuel to keep us warm.
{74010}{74062}Here comes a billion-dollar campfire.
{74114}{74165}At least it's good for something.
{74737}{74793}lf the radio at the rover works...
{74820}{74855}...we can contact Bowman...
{74896}{74957}...tell her there's|breathable air here.
{75035}{75090}But that isn't gonna help us, is it?
{75186}{75259}Must have been hard watching|Santen go like that.
{75337}{75375}Yes, it was.
{75442}{75475}I bet.
{75759}{75801}It's your girlfriend. She made it.
{75807}{75872}AMEE. I thought you were dead.
{75878}{75936}Hi, sweetie. Good to see you.
{75941}{75995}You're kind of banged up.
{76000}{76039}I Knew you'd make it.
{76052}{76144}Hey, are you a little out of whack?|Flip over for me.
{76392}{76441}Shoot. The processor's damaged.
{76446}{76521}-Can she still navigate for us?|-Yeah, till she breaks down for good.
{76527}{76577}We wait till she breaks down,|the drone'll crash.
{76583}{76637}Let's yank her Mars positioning|system now.
{76642}{76715}MPS hard drive's modular.|It's self-powered.
{76720}{76800}We can run it through an HHC. That|would give us control of the drone...
{76805}{76875}...but then, that'd be killing her.
{76884}{76942}Yeah? You want me to do it?
{76963}{77005}No, I'll do it.
{77639}{77663}Shit!
{78068}{78094}No.
{78105}{78135}No.
{78763}{78792}Gallagher, what's going on?
{78799}{78857}She's in military mode.|Crash must've flipped her.
{78863}{78941}-Why did she turn on us?|-We tried to kill her.
{78979}{79020}-Made us the enemy.|-Son of a bitch.
{79024}{79064}-You okay?|-Then override her.
{79069}{79116}I tried. She won't respond.
{79241}{79272}It's a broken rib.
{79295}{79364}Why did she let us live? She had us.
{79380}{79443}She's playing war games.|Guerilla tactics.
{79448}{79507}It's an old trick.|Wound one of the enemy.
{79512}{79563}The others have to help out.|Slows them down.
{79643}{79718}Sooner or later, she'll play search|and destroy.
{79744}{79773}Then she'll come and kill us.
{79783}{79815}One by one.
{79860}{79890}You all right?
{80459}{80537}AMEE jammed the transmitters|so we won't know where she is.
{80807}{80835}You all right?
{80929}{80981}Only hurts when I breathe.
{81083}{81128}Sun's going to come up soon.
{81163}{81238}Might as well get going.|Give me a hand?
{81955}{82039}Sure get some high arc|in this low gravity, huh?
{82142}{82219}Watching this, AMEE?|Taking the first piss on Mars.

{83422}{83458}Thank you, guys.
{83470}{83522}Thank you for busting your asses.
{83628}{83682}I have some time|before I have to punch.
{83687}{83744}I'll take another look|for the crew at daybreak.
{83758}{83825}I know they're End of Mission,|but it's something I got to do.
{83830}{83860}Over.
{83870}{83901}Relayed.

{87009}{87042}Come on. Someone talk to us.
{87055}{87076}Try again.
{87081}{87153}This is Mars-1 ground crew.|Do you copy?
{87163}{87231}This is Mars-1 ground crew.|Do you copy?
{87236}{87304}Maybe they'll hear us back in 1997.
{87464}{87509}It's been two hours.
{87608}{87651}Mars-1 , Houston.
{87656}{87746}We've picked something off a radio|telescope pointed in your direction.
{87751}{87779}You won't believe this.
{87784}{87874}You'll have to tune to a frequency|we haven't used in 50 years.
{87879}{87914}Yeah, well...
{87934}{87973}...it was worth a shot.
{88243}{88307}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1 .|Do you copy?
{88334}{88382}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1 .
{88387}{88410}Bowman!
{88443}{88470}Gallagher?
{88557}{88583}You're alive.
{88593}{88622}Yeah.
{88633}{88683}Holy shit, you made it too.
{88700}{88768}I know that HAB is wrecked.|What is your status?
{88773}{88871}We're down here at the little rover|with Burchenal and Pettengil.
{88893}{88962}Got no food and water,|AMEE's gone mustang...
{88968}{89030}...and, oh, yeah, we can breathe.
{89077}{89173}How can that be? The oxygen levels|are.... That is impossible.
{89179}{89202}I don't know.
{89207}{89231}But we're doing it.
{89238}{89301}I saw a body back at MEV.|Who was it?
{89307}{89393}That was Chantilas.|Santen's gone too.
{89398}{89421}What happened?
{89426}{89485}Pettengil says he threw himself|off a cliff.
{89500}{89552}Anyway, that's the news.
{89581}{89611}We won't make it much longer.
{89631}{89712}I hope you got an idea,|because we're fresh out.
{89721}{89805}Let me work on it.|I'll get back to you.
{89826}{89886}I hope she has a magic wand.
{89938}{90038}Houston, we have three men alive|and breathing on Mars.
{90067}{90115}Let's bring them home.
{90150}{90199}You just can't get around it, can you?
{90219}{90299}I still can't figure out this algae|and oxygen business.
{90304}{90337}You hate not knowing,|don't you?
{90344}{90443}-Given time, believe me, I'll know.|-Yeah, maybe.
{90468}{90551}Maybe life's just more mysterious|than you think it is.
{90608}{90663}You know, you spent too much time|with Chantilas.
{90668}{90723}But if you want|to take the God route...
{90729}{90787}...the easy way, that's up to you.
{90793}{90854}There's nothing easy|about a spiritual life.
{90859}{90951}It's a lot more difficult|than just being intelligent.
{90977}{91023}I think you're just ignoring the facts.
{91038}{91118}Facts. I bet you were no fun|at Christmas.
{91123}{91183}I bet your mom told you there's no|tooth fairy when you were 4.
{91188}{91251}I'm a geneticist. I write code.|Okay?
{91256}{91331}A, G, T, P in different combinations.
{91336}{91387}Hacking the human genome. Okay?
{91395}{91438}I choose what, I choose where...
{91444}{91549}...and either your kidneys work or|you grow a sixth finger. I do that!
{91569}{91617}Now, you spot God...
{91631}{91709}...you let me know.|Until then, I'll trust my Ph. Ds.
{91957}{92022}It might sound crazy,|but it's the only choice you got.
{92028}{92101}We walk 100 kilometers to a 30-year-old|Russian rock probe...
{92107}{92175}...that failed to launch and try|to jump-start it.
{92210}{92253}Gee, why couldn't you make it tough?
{92270}{92381}The probe's called Cosmos. Houston|found the designer, name's Borokovski.
{92386}{92433}Owns a deli in Brooklyn.
{92438}{92523}He thinks you can start the launch|sequence right there on site.
{92529}{92611}Former rocket scientist|who now specializes in...
{92617}{92694}...making sandwiches. Terrific.
{92700}{92731}Here's the hard part:
{92745}{92811}You got just under 19 hours to get|there and get it off the ground.
{92817}{92897}Then I take back what I said|about it being tough.
{92902}{93007}I got to ditch the B tank and use more|fuel from A to hold orbit that long.
{93012}{93111}I can't burn much after that or Mars-1|won't have enough fuel to get home.
{93117}{93164}I need a heading.|Which way should I go?
{93214}{93301}Okay, you want to go|to your 5:00.
{93372}{93421}-There you go.|-Okay, we're set.
{93426}{93501}I got some work to do, then I'll be|in blackout on the dark side.
{93507}{93542}So I'll call you when I get back.
{93582}{93609}Roger. Thanks.
{93614}{93645}Sorry it's not more.
{93650}{93686}Hey, it's something.
{93703}{93729}Give me a hand.
{93739}{93787}It's nice just to know|you're still up there.
{93793}{93861}Well, I don't mind dying.|I just hate being alone...
{93867}{93936}...so get your asses back here.|Talk to you later.
{93948}{94031}Thanks. My rib feels|like it's through my lung.
{94044}{94077}Gallagher, what do you think?
{94082}{94191}I think it's very distracting seeing|you get out of the shower.
{94197}{94257}I started to lock the door after that.
{94262}{94297}No, you didn't.
{94316}{94353}-Yes, I did.|-No, you didn't.
{94751}{94782}Good night.
{95686}{95710}What's that?
{95731}{95763}Over there.
{95795}{95835}Looks like the ground's moving.
{95841}{95879}I didn't see anything.
{95934}{96028}It's gone now,|but I definitely saw something.
{96305}{96383}Hey, Bowman. How you doing?|Need a headings check.
{96388}{96456}You're right on target.|Listen, I need to talk to you.
{96525}{96580}Took the comm off. What's the matter?
{96659}{96759}The only place to ride the Cosmos is|in the rock sample container.
{96773}{96808}Sounds comfy.
{96816}{96856}It's very small.
{96877}{96924}Borokovski and Houston...
{96929}{97035}...have been trying to figure out how|to cram three people in...
{97069}{97118}...and it only fits two people.
{97134}{97171}Two people, barely.
{97216}{97245}How we doing?
{97250}{97283}Good. Great.
{97311}{97345}I'm sorry.
{97405}{97467}Yeah, right. I'll talk to you later.
{97672}{97758}Let's patch you up.|It'll help with the pain.
{97838}{97927}I can barely breathe.|This air's too damn thin!
{97949}{97983}You'll be okay.
{98023}{98052}Put your arm over.
{98057}{98114}That's right. Left foot.
{98120}{98163}Right foot. That's right.
{98173}{98220}Hop like a bunny. Just go.
{98246}{98329}Here it comes, here it comes
{98334}{98407}Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
{98412}{98443}What are you doing?
{98449}{98520}It's a song my grandfather sang.|The Rolling Stones.
{98526}{98573}Come on, sing it. Here it comes
{98587}{98626}Here it comes
{98631}{98721}Here comes your 19th|nervous breakdown
{99391}{99414}Commander.
{99420}{99491}A massive low-pressure system|is approaching the crew.
{99505}{99586}Atmospheric pressure 820 millibars.
{99619}{99677}A big ice storm's coming|straight for you.
{99682}{99750}It's the size of Montana,|and it's moving fast.
{99756}{99802}I'm going into comm blackout.
{99807}{99870}You need to find shelter immediately.|Now.
{99959}{100010}Where can we find shelter around here?
{100038}{100103}Over here! There's an opening!
{100156}{100253}Maximum sustained winds: 111 miles|per hour.
{100258}{100326}Temperature: negative 50 degrees|Fahrenheit.
{100527}{100557}Hurry.
{100800}{100829}Shit!
{100834}{100879}Houston, this is Mars-1.
{101455}{101507}How far is Cosmos from here?
{101557}{101582}What?
{101596}{101631}Cosmos.
{101659}{101702}How far you think it is?
{101710}{101751}Five or six hours.
{101767}{101803}Say five.
{101830}{101902}That leaves us four hours|to try and launch...
{101907}{101989}...not counting whatever time|we lose here.
{102012}{102075}This Borokovski better have|a good memory.
{102121}{102173}Won't be time for plan B.
{103094}{103154}Only two of us can go on Cosmos.
{103238}{103267}What?
{103294}{103358}There's only room on Cosmos|for two people.
{103422}{103468}You two will both go.
{103493}{103548}You carry on with the mission.
{103553}{103621}Tell people what they need to know,|about what you learned here.
{103646}{103725}When we get to Cosmos|I'll help you rig it, and then...
{103747}{103782}...we'll say goodbye.
{103964}{104043}Probably won't even launch.|It is Russian, after all.
{104048}{104138}Ten feet off the ground, it'll explode.|I'll still live longer than both of you.
{104322}{104359}You're a rare man, Gallagher.
{104424}{104477}But somehow I don't quite believe it.
{104494}{104531}What are you talking about?
{104562}{104626}He thinks I'm responsible|for Santen's death.
{104684}{104726}What do you think, Gallagher?
{104814}{104850}You trust me?
{104919}{104947}Do you?
{105009}{105062}I'll watch your back, you watch mine?
{105151}{105191}Shit, I know I don't trust you.
{105369}{105457}But you're going to leave your buddy|here behind...
{105468}{105510}...and take off with me?
{105569}{105605}Yes, that's...
{105625}{105673}...that's what he's going to do.
{105891}{105931}Mars-1 , this is Houston.
{105952}{106049}We don't know about your clock,|but ours is running out of time.
{106055}{106123}Your team's been out of contact|over three hours.
{106136}{106187}They did a great job getting|this far...
{106192}{106261}...but that's a killer storm|no one can survive.
{106267}{106304}So here's where we are:
{106309}{106378}If you haven't heard from your crew|by the time you receive this...
{106383}{106433}...you're ordered to return home.
{106454}{106487}Houston out.
{106553}{106598}Gallagher, come in.
{106637}{106699}Gallagher, can you hear me, please?
{107016}{107055}Shit!
{107120}{107153}-He's gone.|-What?
{107158}{107199}He took the radio.
{107222}{107285}Aw, shit. Shit!
{107473}{107505}It's AMEE.
{107540}{107573}She wants us to watch.
{108825}{108850}She's got him.
{109106}{109209}He was afraid we'd leave him here.|He made it come true.
{109251}{109330}We got to get that radio|or we're both dead too.
{109454}{109485}We lost three hours.
{109490}{109553}At least Pettengil's heading|in the right direction.
{109558}{109665}-How do you know?|-I took a heading before the storm.
{109684}{109727}And lined it up with the stars.
{109732}{109765}We're okay.
{110281}{110306}Hold on.
{110536}{110559}This is algae.
{110585}{110622}There's algae here.
{110666}{110714}Why is it here and nowhere else?
{110858}{110900}No time for that now.
{110914}{110942}There's Pettengil.
{111440}{111501}At least he didn't drop|the goddamn radio.
{111568}{111617}AMEE really tore him up.
{111817}{111936}Little shit's got a death grip on it.|Give me the radio.
{112021}{112058}I'll call Bowman.
{112068}{112113}Why'd he close his visor?
{112121}{112168}He didn't have any air left.
{112568}{112637}Bowman, it's Gallagher. You up there?
{112664}{112718}Bowman, it's Gallagher.
{112834}{112885}Must still be on the dark side.
{113114}{113150}Jesus!
{113393}{113435}Some kind of nematode.
{113441}{113488}The sparks ignited them.
{113496}{113536}They're feeding on the algae.
{113574}{113654}That's where it went.|They're feeding on the algae.
{113664}{113704}Come on. Son of a bitch.
{113709}{113740}Got it.
{113797}{113865}-Thought there wasn't any life here.|-I was wrong.
{113885}{113939}Where there's water|and air, there's life.
{113944}{114020}Think it's so smart to take|those things with us?
{114026}{114106}-You don't get how important this is.|-I'm the janitor, remember?
{114113}{114185}Earth's losing oxygen.|See how those things burned?
{114190}{114233}They eat algae, and they make O-2.
{114238}{114321}I finally get it.|I told you I'd solve this damn thing.
{114336}{114365}Why are the nematodes here?
{114370}{114434}Because there's something left to eat.
{114610}{114636}Hang on.
{114772}{114849}I haven't seen green fields like this|since I was a kid.
{115988}{116032}They're eating through my suit!
{116071}{116099}Stay there.
{116152}{116215}You'll need my air. For the launch.
{116250}{116300}Take this back, Gallagher.
{116343}{116384}Accomplish the mission.
{116396}{116424}It's up to you now.
{116440}{116484}Better put your helmet on.
{116492}{116551}I'm not going out like Pettengil.
{116864}{116956}Commander, there is a disturbance|on the surface of Mars.
{117100}{117135}Oh, God.
{117157}{117250}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1 .|Can you hear me? Over.
{117256}{117355}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1 .|Do you copy? Over.
{117360}{117430}Gallagher, what's going on?|What's happened?
{117448}{117543}Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1 .|Can you hear me? Over.
{117737}{117787}I can't go back.
{117801}{117836}There was some kind of oxygen burn off.
{117875}{117912}It was like a blowtorch.
{117932}{117967}Burchenal's gone.
{117991}{118039}He sacrificed himself.
{118047}{118095}Gallagher, where are the others?
{118102}{118139}I've got to rest.
{118188}{118220}Where are the other guys?
{118282}{118312}Dead.
{118372}{118396}All dead.
{118419}{118508}-I'm the only one left.|-Stop and listen to me.
{118533}{118567}It's over.
{118572}{118627}I don't know what happened tonight...
{118659}{118732}...but you have come too far|to give up now.
{118764}{118840}You are going to accomplish|the mission.
{118852}{118884}I can't.
{118888}{118990}Burchenal sacrificed himself for you.|You want to make that for nothing?
{119007}{119088}I want you to stand up|and I want you to start walking.
{119148}{119214}If you can't do it for him,|Gallagher....
{119240}{119271}-I can't.|-Do it for me.
{119329}{119364}Do it for me.
{119412}{119452}You have to keep going.
{119458}{119487}Okay.
{120182}{120271}55 minutes until we need to leave|orbit, commander.
{120436}{120495}-Time?|-52 minutes to go.
{120510}{120535}Should be there.
{120564}{120588}You're almost there.
{120602}{120652}I could have screwed up|the celestial nav.
{120663}{120715}-Could be off-course.|-Trust me, you're there.
{120778}{120848}-Could've run right past it.|-Shut up and keep moving.
{121295}{121330}I found it.
{121636}{121704}Okay. What do I do now?
{121708}{121758}Get rid of the sample return tray.
{122039}{122084}Okay. What next?
{122102}{122172}There's an infrared maintenance port.|It should be marked.
{122208}{122252}Marked. Yeah.
{122260}{122295}In Russian.
{122372}{122396}All right.
{122408}{122440}Got it.
{122454}{122472}Now what?
{122480}{122531}Connect the radio to Cosmos.
{122544}{122608}I'll download what you need|through the modem.
{122919}{122942}Still works.
{123156}{123175}Go.
{123319}{123372}Okay, you should be able|to run diagnostics now.
{123630}{123660}All green.
{123664}{123731}This thing has two settings:|on and off.
{123759}{123814}Right now, "on" sends it all the way|back to Earth.
{123819}{123882}As you lack air, food and water,|that would be bad.
{123887}{123987}We want power to reach orbit. I've|recalculated for the weight of one.
{123992}{124096}Take two liters out of each fuel tank.|There's a central purge.
{124143}{124183}Russians couldn't add a gas gauge?
{124200}{124275}I'm going into comm blackout soon,|we're down to 49 minutes...
{124281}{124328}...so shut up and get to work.
{124578}{124620}Okay. What now?
{124626}{124700}Launch diagnostics. Avoid pressing|anything that says "ignition."
{125262}{125299}Battery's dead.
{125432}{125482}There's not enough power to launch.
{125532}{125568}Not enough power to launch.
{125576}{125648}-Anything else you can use?|-I don't know.
{125654}{125738}Let me look around. See if I see any|alternate high-voltage sources.
{125744}{125774}No.
{125788}{125826}Just rocks.
{125988}{126043}I'm gonna die on this planet.
{126060}{126135}I'll stay up here|and we will find another way.
{126140}{126206}You can't stay there without burning|more fuel to hold orbit.
{126248}{126283}You got to go.
{126444}{126479}How much time till blackout?
{126517}{126547}About a minute.
{126564}{126640}Okay. There's a couple things|I got to tell you.
{126654}{126688}There's life here on Mars.
{126704}{126787}The guys couldn't figure how they got|here, but they ate the algae...
{126808}{126847}...and they ate HAB too.
{126880}{126910}The important thing is...
{126928}{127007}...that they make oxygen.
{127012}{127052}Don't know how...
{127080}{127162}...but Burchenal said it might|be able to save Earth...
{127168}{127279}...so get some guys up here quick.|Just tell them to be safe.
{127367}{127407}They eat everything.
{127480}{127535}Thirty seconds, commander.
{127588}{127656}Well, that's about it. I....
{127695}{127739}I really hate this planet.
{127800}{127843}I really miss Earth.
{127904}{127952}I really miss a lot of things.
{128143}{128179}I'm going to miss you.
{128339}{128380}Aren't you gonna say anything?
{128595}{128639}I should have kissed you.
{128719}{128771}Yeah, you should have kissed me.
{128952}{129015}Comm frequency lost, commander.
{129344}{129380}Goodbye.
{129932}{129991}Here it comes
{129999}{130060}Here it comes
{130788}{130856}Alternate high-voltage energy source.
{130890}{130931}Come and get me.
{130974}{131027}I'm going to steal your batteries,|sweetie.
{134588}{134623}Bye, sweetie.
{136431}{136470}I'm going home.
{136864}{136903}Fuck this planet.
{136908}{136956}Oxygen supply is low.
{138098}{138147}Warning. Object in orbital path.
{138152}{138195}Oh, my God. Gallagher.
{138238}{138263}Abort!
{138268}{138339}Re-route orbital maneuvering.|I need pitch. Roll!
{138358}{138392}Ten-millimeter bursts.
{139214}{139256}Seal this level.
{139288}{139324}Level sealed.
{139419}{139442}Open the dock.
{139858}{139920}Targeted object .3 kilometers.
{139926}{140002}We only have five minutes|before Mars-1 leaves orbit, commander.
{140007}{140052}Hook me up, Lucille!
{140109}{140159}Line release! Full velocity!
{140751}{140774}Gallagher!
{141026}{141063}Retract.
{141474}{141519}Ninety-millimeter bursts!
{142023}{142094}Seal! Emergency atmosphere now!
{142168}{142215}Atmosphere restored.
{142694}{142727}Linking to suit computer.
{142732}{142779}Gallagher's vital signs are negative.
{142784}{142840}Bioscan indicates cardiac arrest.
{143340}{143371}Come on!
{143494}{143532}Come on!
{143666}{143708}Stand him up, commander.
{143714}{143744}Come on.
{144272}{144307}Aw, man.
{144348}{144394}I saw Elvis.
{144587}{144632}Let's go home, Lucille.
{145015}{145095}Organism bioscan. DNA mapping.
{145140}{145200}Hard to believe they're the good guys.
{145216}{145266}Do you think it was worth it?
{145318}{145362}Houston thinks so.
{145367}{145447}On Earth, they're calling you a hero,|Gallagher.
{145476}{145544}God works in mysterious ways.
{145616}{145654}A memento?
{145692}{145758}It's for Chantilas' granddaughter.
{145860}{145900}He had faith.
{146179}{146255}You are not who I thought you were.
{146520}{146583}Nothing went the way|it was supposed to.
{146592}{146691}But the team, mankind|at its best and its worst. ..
{146696}{146743}...accomplished the mission.
{146810}{146930}Maybe Chantilas was right.|Maybe it isn't just the science.
{146935}{146971}I sure don't know.
{146978}{147055}But whatever forces were at work,|we triumphed.
{147082}{147163}And me? I've got six months|before we get home.
{147168}{147212}I guess I'll get to know the janitor.
