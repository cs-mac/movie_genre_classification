1
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:57,123
THE TALL BLOND GUY WITH ONE BLACK SHOE

2
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:24,505
Somewhere in New York...

3
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,189
You were arrested at customs in New York...

4
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,189
...trying to get through with a car
containing 40 kilos of heroin. Do you confess?

5
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,620
Yes. I've asked for
a lie detector test.

6
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,108
Because I'm telling the truth.

7
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,702
And you say that you're not...

8
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,302
...a drug trafficker?
- No, I'm not.

9
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,985
Whom are you working for?
- The counter intelligence of my country.

10
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,182
I came from the USA on a mission.
I'm not a drug trafficker.

11
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,302
What kind of mission?

12
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,669
The head of my service told me
to get the drugs to the USA.

13
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,100
He should be held responsible
for the matter.

14
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,270
I'm innocent.

15
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:28,295
Somewhere in Paris...

16
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,624
Yes. Come in.

17
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,222
Back from holidays already, sir?

18
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,544
Sit down.

19
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,420
What's this mess, dear Bernard?

20
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,506
I'm more surprised than anybody, sir.
- Really?

21
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,100
Yes. I found out through the press.
I'm astonished.

22
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,189
Somebody's making a fool of me.
It's nasty.

23
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,302
Very nasty, sir.
- This trafficker pretends...

24
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,985
...he's working for me, but he isn't.
- He's not working for me either.

25
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,420
Well for whom does he work then?
- I don't know, sir.

26
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,622
This situation could cost
me my job. You will...

27
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,188
...succeed me as head of the service.
- No matter who'll succeed you...

28
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,619
...I'm sure he'll try
to follow in your footsteps.

29
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,221
With the same goals and energy.

30
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,107
Thank you, dear Bernard.

31
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,781
Have you ever seen this
trafficker?

32
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,224
Never, sir.

33
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,423
It's a fake!

34
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,588
A fake? That's possible.

35
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:10,499
Bloody well done then,
but it's possible.

36
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,142
Alright... that was all.
You can go to work.

37
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,026
Bernard.

38
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,106
Bernard?

39
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,666
Yes, sir?

40
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,701
Did you receive my case of wine?

41
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,221
Yes, I wanted to thank you.

42
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,702
You shouldn't have...
- I said to myself:

43
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:00,139
What's a good present to
give to Saint Bernard?

44
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,821
First I thought of a cask of rum.

45
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:09,861
And then I remembered
that our friend Milan...

46
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,262
...loves good wine.
- But a case of Mouton-Rothschild!

47
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,621
And from 1970.
- It's excellent.

48
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:23,986
Store it in a good cellar and
drink it to my health in ten years.

49
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:28,105
I hope we'll drink it together, sir.

50
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,060
Why not?

51
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,824
Yes, sir.

52
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:01,507
The thing with the car failed.

53
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:10,819
I didn't find dear Bernard
in very good shape.

54
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,705
No, not very.
- He should take a holiday.

55
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:19,866
Come in, dear Perrache.
- He just arrived home, sir.

56
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,782
Excuse me, sir. How was
your holiday, sir?

57
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,621
It was a good holiday, Perrache.
Very good.

58
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,301
Very quiet.
We had a good rest.

59
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,221
Mother came back in great shape.

60
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,301
A cure of 10 days makes her
10 years younger.

61
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,582
We didn't have great weather, but
the climate is very invigorating.

62
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,019
When we came back to Paris,
we felt like we were suffocating.

63
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,505
The cure is mainly about
fresh air.

64
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,188
There is no pollution yet
in the Puy-de-Dôme.

65
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,619
It was nice. And the mud
baths were marvellous.

66
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,142
Hot mud really relaxes the nerves.

67
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,619
And afterwards they put you
under ice cold water.

68
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,668
He's also bugging your apartment.
A car full of drugs...

69
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,100
...microphones in the statues.
Milan doesn't stop at anything.

70
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,180
He's behind the affair with the car,
but I can't prove it.

71
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,505
I discovered the microphones
by coincidence.

72
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,588
It was well done.

73
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,099
He's working hard for it.
- I hate careerists.

74
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,140
They never get very far.
- We should remind him that...

75
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,942
...it's not his job to do
what he can to replace...

76
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,143
...you as the head of the service.

77
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,506
Why the microphones?
- Milan played a dirty trick on me...

78
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,189
...and he's expecting me to hit back.
It is fun to imagine him...

79
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,506
...trembling with fear behind
his phone tapping equipment.

80
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,619
He should keep that on.
He'll catch a cold.

81
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,108
Milan deserves to be
taught a lesson.

82
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,189
I don't want an assistant who confuses
intelligence with dirty games.

83
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,619
The best duck pâté
I've ever had.

84
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,189
Mother had three servings.
She wouldn't listen to reason.

85
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,224
I told her: "Mother, you're going
to be sick".

86
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,620
But, dear Perrache, I didn't
make you come here...

87
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,222
...to tell you about my holiday.

88
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,143
Tomorrow morning, at 9:30,
a man arrives at Orly.

89
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,620
This man should be able to help us
quickly clear up...

90
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,143
...this dirty American mess.
You have to look after him.

91
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,186
Alright, sir.

92
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,620
I hope we can keep the service
out of this affair.

93
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,620
Of course, sir.
- This man will need protection.

94
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,620
Make sure he's safe
and take Poucet and Chaperon with you.

95
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,222
I have faith in them.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,143
Nine thirty at the airport.
Don't be late, Perrache,

97
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,302
It's important.
And a big secret.

98
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,620
Understood, sir.
- Do you like Italian food?

99
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,709
What?

100
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,101
Tomorrow morning, at Orly,
at nine thirty...

101
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,420
This man should be able to help us
quickly clear up...

102
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,625
...this dirty American mess.
- Damn!

103
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,302
The guy we're meeting...
Who is it?

104
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,108
I don't know
- Excuse me?

105
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,667
I don't know. Go to Orly, tomorrow
at nine thirty and pick a man.

106
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,100
I don't understand.
- Yes, pick one. Choose anybody.

107
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,986
A man from the crowd.
As anonymous as possible.

108
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,908
It doesn't matter at all
who you'll pick.

109
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,138
It's make believe.

110
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:09,010
What matters is that
Milan takes the bait.

111
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:19,860
I'll tell you what you'll be looking for
at the airport, dear Perrache:

112
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,902
...an asshole trap!

113
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,222
Who is this guy we have to protect?

114
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,106
Well? Who is it?
- You don't need to know.

115
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,623
Follow him discretely.
He can't notice a thing.

116
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,702
Arrival from Sydney.

117
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,222
Flight Air France nr 704, gate 17.

118
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,668
Is your guy from Australia?

119
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,100
Arrival from Sydney,
Air France flight 704, gate 17.

120
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,224
Choose anybody...

121
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,188
...a man from the crowd...

122
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,108
...as anonymous as possible...

123
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,024
Choose.

124
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,304
It's make believe...

125
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,824
Choose.

126
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,983
Is he from Australia?
- No.

127
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,908
It's nine thirty.

128
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,702
Arrival from Munich...

129
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,824
He's from Munich.

130
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,740
Arrival from Munich,
Lufthansa flight 320, gate 12.

131
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,224
Is he a musician?

132
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,384
Is that him?
- No.

133
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,308
Maybe he missed the plane.

134
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,344
He'll be there.

135
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,944
Is he black?

136
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,507
That's him.

137
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,942
A tall blond guy with a black shoe.

138
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,707
Michel!

139
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,222
Excuse me, sir. I made a mistake.

140
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,223
François Perrin, 32 years old, single.

141
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,624
Violinist. Lives at 24 Rue de I'Alouette,
7th arrondissement. Arrived from Munich.

142
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,582
There's no file about him?
- No, sir.

143
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,543
Not with the intelligence service,
not with Internal Affairs.

144
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,742
He made a phone call from the airport.
- To whom?

145
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,262
To his dentist.
- And the violin case?

146
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,223
I want to know tomorrow who
he is and what he's going to do.

147
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,660
That's not a lot of time. 24 hours.
- It's all the time we have.

148
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,620
We have to neutralise him right away.
- Do we kill him?

149
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,189
I want to know what he's up to.
Go to work.

150
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,189
Do what it takes. Discretely.
We don't want to get caught.

151
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,302
Poucet and Chaperon don't know you.

152
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,107
Alright, sir.
- Botrel!

153
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,949
Why a black shoe?

154
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:35,339
Why a violinist?
- You said to pick anybody.

155
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:39,341
Yes, but why a violinist?

156
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,861
Because he had a black shoe.

157
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:56,507
Hello! Hello! Hello!

158
00:17:56,629 --> 00:18:00,542
What? Who's speaking?
- Its doctor Müller from Munich.

159
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:05,188
You're a murderer, a butcher.
You executed him in a terrible way.

160
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:08,221
Poor Prokofiev!

161
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:13,188
Maurice, don't be an asshole.
I'm soaking, just out of the bath.

162
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:16,665
You didn't recognise me, idiot.
Do we still meet at 4?

163
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,669
Listen, Maurice, I lost a filling
at the airport. My tooth hurts.

164
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:24,668
Whatever, I'll be there at 4.
- I swear. I called the dentist.

165
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:28,668
Doctor Michaux can't see me until
tomorrow morning. And it hurts.

166
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,986
Alright, see you at 4.
- But...

167
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:43,187
Keep listening. Don't miss it
when Toulouse contacts him.

168
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:46,619
Alright, sir.
- We have to make him leave the house.

169
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:50,421
What's the name of the dentist?
- Michaux.

170
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,188
It's Mr. Perrin.
- Keep it open. What?

171
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:58,142
He says he's suffering badly.
- Keep it open. Alright, listen...

172
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:02,222
I'll do him in between.
Tell him to come in an hour.

173
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,061
Keep it open.

174
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,346
In an hour? Perfect.

175
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,822
Hello?

176
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:22,142
Hello? This is Dr Michaux's practice.
The doctor can see you...

177
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:27,146
...in an hour if that suits you.
- Alright. Well, that's great.

178
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,189
That's very friendly. thank you.
It's hurting a bit less.

179
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,618
But I'll be there in an hour.

180
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:36,308
He changed shoes.

181
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,019
He changed shoes.
Renault 15, orange red.

182
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,507
Number plate 2868 X 075.

183
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:44,541
Hello?
He's not going to the dentist.

184
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:53,507
He's not going to the dentist.

185
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,663
Hello, sir.

186
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,667
He's not going to the dentist.
- Why not?

187
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,622
I don't know, sir.
- Why isn't he going to the dentist?

188
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,668
Why not?
- He's going to the park.

189
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:22,099
Excuse me, sir, what?
- He's going to the park.

190
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,143
He's going to the park...

191
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,223
He's going on the lake.

192
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:41,904
He's renting a boat.
- What's he doing on the lake?

193
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:46,784
Yes, what's he doing on the lake?
- He must have noticed us. No problem.

194
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:51,142
We'll wait for him at the dentist's.
What's he doing on the lake?

195
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,506
He's rowing.

196
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,822
Ah, yes. He's rowing.
- Rowing. - Rowing.

197
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:09,262
Not too close. Go to the island.
- I'm hot.

198
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,341
He's on the island.
In the restaurant.

199
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:21,061
He's throwing bread at the ducks?
Damn.

200
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,022
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, can you hear me?

201
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,823
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

202
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,857
I can hear you fine.
Hurry. He's finished lunch.

203
00:24:56,229 --> 00:25:00,188
They made him leave his place
and they're bugging the apartment.

204
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:04,188
They must be finished by now.
Milan took the bait.

205
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,189
He brought all his men.
- Our little plan has already shown us...

206
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:12,302
...who are in Milan's secret team.
That's good, isn't it?

207
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:17,184
There are too many people I don't
know in my own service.

208
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,662
Alright. You can go have lunch.
- There was a black guy at Orly...

209
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:26,019
A big black guy wearing a woollen coat.
I picked a tall blond guy...

210
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,059
...with a black shoe over a tall
black guy with a green woollen coat.

211
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:37,703
Listen, old man, if you want to produce
literature, wait until after you're retired.

212
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,463
Enjoy your lunch.

213
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,621
Won't you finish your leaks,
Louis?

214
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,383
No, thanks, mother.

215
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,701
Yesterday was Bernard Milan's birthday.

216
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:06,463
I hope you remembered?
- Yes, mother, I remembered.

217
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:10,905
Born in Epinal, in the Vosges,
on 28 March 1940.

218
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:15,739
Only son, late arrival...
His mother, Marie Bugeaud.

219
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,588
45 years old, teacher.

220
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:23,662
His father, Gérard Perrin, 55 years old,
teacher and amateur violinist.

221
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:29,701
Two teachers, retirement
came quickly.

222
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:35,786
Uneventful childhood.
His father introduced him to music.

223
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,702
Practising catholic.
- Homosexual?

224
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:48,099
No. Goes to the conservatory
of Strasbourg at the age of 13.

225
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,985
Leaves at 15 to spend
a year at a sanatorium.

226
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,100
Lost his virginity to the head nurse.
- How do you know?

227
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,700
A letter.

228
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,821
Relax, muffin, I'm not pregnant.

229
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:09,699
Cured, he goes to the conservatory
of Paris. First price...

230
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:15,423
28 months of military service.
Participates in none of the colonial wars.

231
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,822
Serves his time in army bands.

232
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:22,259
First violin in a string orchestra
for 5 years now.

233
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:26,668
Often travels abroad.
Also to the USA.

234
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,100
There! He worked in the USA.
I knew it.

235
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:34,099
But none of our people know him.
- But of course.

236
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:40,179
He's a super agent, working on his own.
- We took this picture from his place.

237
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,667
In a drawer, under a pile of shirts.
There's a message on the back.

238
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,781
Decode that for me.
As fast as you can.

239
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,099
Our specialists have been on it
for an hour. - Good.

240
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:58,588
Seemingly, an uneventful life.
- A perfect cover.

241
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,783
So, do we kill him?
- No.

242
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:07,823
I want to know what he's up to.
His eyes give him away.

243
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,504
What's he doing?

244
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,623
No. I told you a hundred times
you have to hold the violin correctly.

245
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:47,179
Look, hold it well
and make it really long.

246
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:50,187
Pull, push, look at me,
pull, push...

247
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,488
What kind of a clown is he?

248
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:37,875
François Perrin - Violin lessons

249
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:10,185
Too loud.
- Yes, the water mike is too loud.

250
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:13,819
Well, turn it down.
- No. I'd turn the others down too.

251
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,065
What's that idiot doing?
- Very bizarre.

252
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:26,663
Yes, it's bizarre.

253
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,099
He flushed?
What do you mean, he flushed?

254
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:52,102
No, I don't understand.
There must be a reason.

255
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,823
It's broken.

256
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:17,178
You're nervous, dear Bernard.
- I didn't see you.

257
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:21,142
And the difference is that I
always see you.

258
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:33,021
I have another little
present for you.

259
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:36,665
It's a concerto for violin and orchestra,
played by a very talented young man.

260
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:39,701
Listen to it tonight, to relax.

261
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:46,221
The violinist's really very talented.

262
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,660
What is it?

263
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:08,821
What is it?
- Paulette.

264
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:13,861
Hello, my love.
- Hello, Paulette.

265
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,705
Paulette, Paulette, Paulette, listen.
I have to talk to you, Paulette.

266
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:25,146
I've been thinking a lot in Munich.
We can't go on like this.

267
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,421
We have to make a decision, Paulette.

268
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,739
We can't continue the secrecy,
the lies.

269
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:38,819
Are you recording this?
- I dreamt of you last night.

270
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:43,822
Paulette, please. I'm telling you
this is not fair...

271
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,179
...towards Maurice.
- Maurice's a loser.

272
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:51,188
He gets what he deserves. I dreamt
you were tearing off my clothes.

273
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,189
You had big burning hands and
you tore off my clothes.

274
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,301
Paulette, please,
leave my shirt on.

275
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:03,188
You've torn it. Are you happy now?
You're hurting me.

276
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,667
Hold me with all your strength.
- Stop. You're making me fall.

277
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,619
Oh, François...
- Paulette! Paulette! Paulette! Paulette!

278
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:17,501
Paulette!
- François! François! François!

279
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,019
François! François! François!
- Paulette! Paulette! Paulette!

280
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:24,541
François!
- Paulette! Ah, Paulette!

281
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:27,821
François...
- Paulette! Paulette!

282
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,108
François...
- Paulette.

283
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:34,107
How does a horse sound?
- No.

284
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:37,107
Yes, how does a horse sound?
- No.

285
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:48,701
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

286
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:52,543
Stop that, shit!

287
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:25,142
So, was Munich nice?
- I'm really a loser.

288
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,822
No.

289
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,262
Yes. I should have gone to
the dentist, but I got scared.

290
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:38,187
Why?
- Afraid.

291
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,187
I went to have lunch at the lake.

292
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:45,188
They expect me at the dentist and
I go to the lake. I'm a loser.

293
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,221
Well, go tomorrow. Does it hurt?

294
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,303
I don't know...

295
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,063
Scared...

296
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:57,619
By the way, do you know who's
coming at 4?

297
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,185
No.
- Maurice.

298
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:03,619
Maurice? What for?
- We're going bike riding in the park.

299
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:09,264
That's funny. I play horses with
you at 2 and I see your husband at 4.

300
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:13,301
He wants to get me in shape.
If only he knew...

301
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:18,505
Whose little ear is this?
- Mine.

302
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:22,301
Whose little eye is this?
- Mine.

303
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,305
Whose little mouth is this?
- Mine.

304
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,544
Whose cigarettes are these?
- Mine.

305
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,505
They're being bugged 24/24.

306
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:40,544
A florist's van's driving around
the building constantly.

307
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:47,668
Milan won't have a clue,
because he set up the trap himself.

308
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:52,988
We just put the cheese in the cellar
and Milan built the trap around it.

309
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:57,505
And what's going to happen
to the little cheese?

310
00:35:58,229 --> 00:36:02,142
Excuse me?
- What if Milan gets rid of the tall blond guy?

311
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,668
That would be very stupid.

312
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:09,819
Doesn't it bother you to send
this clown to the slaughterhouse?

313
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,226
Does it bother you?

314
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:17,188
The tall blond guy with the black shoe...
you picked him.

315
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:21,222
Does that bother you now?
- No, sir.

316
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,341
Ok, hurry up, lazy bastard!

317
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,177
Hurry up. To work!
- Don't be stupid, Maurice.

318
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:37,823
Come one, let's go!

319
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,619
You've got some egg there.
- Don't be stupid, Maurice.

320
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:46,619
I bought cigars. Do you want one?
- That's nice, yes.

321
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:50,301
You'll smoke it later
and think of me.

322
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,868
Ok, go! To work!

323
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:12,939
He's leaving on bike with a guy.
Yes, a bicycle.

324
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,063
I want a photo.

325
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:23,427
He's supposed to go to the park,
unless he decides to go to the dentist now.

326
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,520
Don't be stupid, Maurice!

327
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,409
Don't be stupid, Maurice!

328
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:46,301
I can't follow a bike
through Paris.

329
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,307
Go.

330
00:37:57,229 --> 00:38:00,221
Careful, they're turning.
- I can see that.

331
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:08,273
It's punctured.
- Or he didn't put the valve on right.

332
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:11,281
Do you think?

333
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:14,307
Or his tires are porous.

334
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,500
Shit!

335
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:36,101
Look at those little bikes.
Having a flat?

336
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,499
No, we're playing a game.
- There's no more quality, these days.

337
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:45,188
I remember before the war...
I'm talking before the war, gentlemen...

338
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:49,188
...they produced quality then.
- Smoke this, grandpa.

339
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:53,222
Thanks, boys... thanks.

340
00:38:55,429 --> 00:39:02,906
This is going to take a while.
- His bike's completely messed up.

341
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:12,146
Now, they're running.
They put their bikes away.

342
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:17,544
He stopped. The tall blond guy
stopped and is talking to someone.

343
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,665
Micro canon.

344
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:26,668
Come on, you can't stop every
500 meters, lazy bastard.

345
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,669
Come on, we've hardly started.
- Maurice, I have to talk to you.

346
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:35,225
No way. You're not quitting. Go!
- It's about Paulette.

347
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,699
Play me the complete recording
of the woman again.

348
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,702
Paulette! Hello, Paulette.
I have to talk to you, Paulette.

349
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,227
I've been thinking a lot in Munich.
We can't go on like this.

350
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:04,619
A good shower
and you'll feel great.

351
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:08,301
What's that?
- Listen, Maurice...

352
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:12,217
See you tonight.
- What an idiot. What an idiot.

353
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,595
Maurice's a loser.
He gets what he deserves.

354
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:23,740
I dreamt you were tearing
off my clothes.

355
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:26,861
You had big burning hands and
you tore off my clothes.

356
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:30,023
Hey, stop!

357
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:34,019
Paulette! Paulette!

358
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:38,026
Paulette!

359
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,619
The guy on the bike's behind us.
- How does a horse sound?

360
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:46,107
No.
- Yes, how does a horse sound?

361
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,506
No...

362
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:26,421
Paulette has an affair with a florist.
- What?

363
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:31,302
Paulette has an affair with a florist.
I just caught them...

364
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:36,423
...in a delivery van. They were
going for it on the plants...

365
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:40,462
...and they said terrible things.
- Come in and sit down.

366
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:44,504
What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Shaving cream...

367
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:48,462
...in my toothpaste.
- I stopped next to this van...

368
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:52,942
...and I hear Paulette' voice.
I fell off my bike...

369
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:58,103
...for the first time ever.
- Paulette and a florist? That's absurd.

370
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:03,188
Stop that. It's irritating.
- I told you I had shaving cream...

371
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,619
...in my toothpaste.
- First, I thought I was dreaming.

372
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:11,188
And then she talked about me. She said:
"Maurice is a loser."

373
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:15,507
And then she said terrible things.
François, my wife's hysterical.

374
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,427
Go wash your mouth.

375
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:23,781
The guy sounded a bit like you.
- Which guy?

376
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,303
The florist.

377
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:33,187
But that's crazy. Paulette with
a florist in a van.

378
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:36,619
It's nuts!
- But I'm telling you I heard them.

379
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:40,619
She asked him what a horse sounds like.
- But... what?

380
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:46,668
She asked him to sound like a horse.
He did and I fell off my bike.

381
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:49,587
What are you doing?

382
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,505
I'm calling her.
- But I'm telling you it was her...

383
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:57,585
...in a van with a horse...
- Hello, Paulette.

384
00:42:57,629 --> 00:43:00,905
Hello, François speaking.
I'm here with your husband.

385
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:04,907
No, I'm fine. I'll give him to you.

386
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:09,701
Hello? Who's that?
Is that Paulette?

387
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:15,107
Good, no, yes, yes...

388
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:19,099
Yes, oh no, no, no, yes,
alright. I'll be there right away.

389
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,821
Yes, we did go for a run.

390
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:30,699
She's been home
for an hour with my mother.

391
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,187
Well, see? You were dreaming.

392
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:38,701
But...
- It's strange, François.

393
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:43,745
They found the mike in the flowers.
- Damn!

394
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,219
We're not getting anywhere, this way.
- We're going in circles.

395
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:51,219
We're going in circles.
We're going in circles.

396
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,219
He's been making fun of us since the start.
He's playing with us.

397
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:59,219
He's very good!
- We have to take him to the property...

398
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:03,502
...and execute him.
- No. We're going to try something else and...

399
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:06,821
Hello, yes? Musical instruments?

400
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:12,388
Musical instruments. Old ones.
Go to some antique shops and...

401
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:16,388
...rent some recorders, sitars,
violas d'amore, violas da gamba...

402
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:20,422
I don't care. Send it all to
85 Rue des Vignes.

403
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,901
We're going to have some fun.

404
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:55,903
Mr Perrin?

405
00:44:56,349 --> 00:45:00,786
I saw your little ad for violin
lessons at the record shop.

406
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:04,823
Can I come in?

407
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:12,185
The lessons are not for me,
but for my son.

408
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:15,619
I have a six year old
and he loves music.

409
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:20,303
Six years is the right age, I think.

410
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,341
I'd prefer lessons at home.

411
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:26,623
He's so young.

412
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,100
My father also collected
old instruments.

413
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,587
He died last year.

414
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:40,107
He left it all to me.
- I see.

415
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:46,261
I don't know much about it but I
think some instruments are interesting.

416
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:51,144
If you like, I can show you
when you come to the house.

417
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:57,188
The little one's on holiday at the moment.
He won't be back until next week.

418
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:00,301
I don't intend to keep the collection.

419
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:04,346
Too many memories.

420
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,106
I see.

421
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:17,343
You could at least have a look.
But you'd have to be quick.

422
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:21,143
When?
- Let's see...

423
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:24,619
Tomorrow is impossible.
So is Wednesday.

424
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:28,301
What are you doing this evening?
- Today?

425
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:34,904
I invited a few friends.
Would you like to come over?

426
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:38,461
This is my address: 85 Rue des Vignes.

427
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:46,586
See you tonight.

428
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:55,826
No, tonight's impossible.
I have a concert in Gaveau at nine.

429
00:46:56,429 --> 00:47:00,627
You can come over after midnight.
I go to bed very late. See you later.

430
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:04,739
She's leaving the building.
No, we don't know her.

431
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:10,703
Tall, beautiful, blonde, leopard-skin.
Distinguished, you know?

432
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:46,821
Stop.

433
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,264
There he is.
- There he is, sir.

434
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:57,226
Come.

435
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:05,543
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

436
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:10,861
Did the concert go well?

437
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:18,907
My friends just left.

438
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,701
Yes, they're such early birds.

439
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:28,184
Maybe I'm here too late.
- Not at all. I was expecting you.

440
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:32,219
What would you like?
Champagne, whisky, cognac?

441
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,100
I'd like a bit of champagne.
It's great... here.

442
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:41,985
Yes, there are some nice items.
- A giraffe piano.

443
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:46,541
The rest is in the cellar.
- In the cellar?

444
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:52,186
We can have a look later
if you like. Have a seat.

445
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:57,619
Not there. On the couch
is more comfortable.

446
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:16,339
It's so good to relax.
I'm glad the others are gone.

447
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:19,779
So nice. A bit of intimacy
from time to time.

448
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:23,421
Yes, that's true... that's true...

449
00:52:25,629 --> 00:52:29,542
The others are gone. That's true...
- You seem tense.

450
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:32,701
Do I intimidate you?
- No, no, not at all.

451
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,625
It's hard to believe.
- What is?

452
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:55,943
All that...

453
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:01,986
But it's nothing special.
- Yes, yes. For me, it's very special.

454
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:06,188
The most beautiful woman who
ever rang my doorbell...

455
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:10,700
...and that same evening, I'm drinking
champagne in her apartment.

456
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,344
Is it cold enough?

457
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:17,025
Yes, yes, perfect.
- Are you hungry?

458
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,787
No, not right now.

459
00:53:23,229 --> 00:53:27,188
Would you mind if I take of this jewellery?
I've had a hard day.

460
00:53:27,229 --> 00:53:30,619
I'd like to get comfortable.
- By all means.

461
00:53:40,229 --> 00:53:43,505
I'll be right back.
Serve yourself a drink if you want.

462
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:03,307
What is this...

463
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:07,907
What is this...

464
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,943
He's very good.

465
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:25,626
I see...

466
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:30,227
I lost my cigarette...

467
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:33,227
It's better like this.

468
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,221
Take of your jacket.
You'll feel better.

469
00:54:57,229 --> 00:55:00,221
Why don't you take off
your clothes?

470
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,026
What?

471
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:06,823
Take off your clothes.

472
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,621
I wouldn't mind a bit of champagne.

473
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:27,619
You're pulling my hair.
- No, it's stuck.

474
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:34,619
What's happening?
- The zipper's stuck.

475
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,819
You're hurting me.
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

476
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:42,501
It's the first time it got stuck.

477
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:46,507
Damn! Damn!

478
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:49,026
Damn!

479
00:55:51,229 --> 00:55:54,505
Well?
- I don't know... it's crazy.

480
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:59,188
I can't stay here all night.
- No. We need a pair of scissors...

481
00:55:59,229 --> 00:56:02,187
...to cut the bit that's stuck.
- In the bathroom.

482
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:04,823
I'll get it.
- Ouch!

483
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:08,187
Oh, sorry.
- I have to go with you.

484
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:12,188
Yes, that's better. Wait.
Don't get up. Stay on your knees.

485
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:16,666
Right. Now slowly go to the bathroom.
I'll follow.

486
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:21,383
I'm sorry. That's it.

487
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:30,822
It's a nice little apartment.
After you. Please.

488
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:34,941
What kind of a clown is this?

489
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:37,146
Done.

490
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,628
Did you hurt yourself?

491
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:04,341
I'll keep your hair.

492
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,586
Ok, go.

493
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:13,587
I'm sorry. It's crazy.

494
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:21,622
Aren't you hungry at all?
- I wouldn't mind a little bite now.

495
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:26,544
Cold chicken, roast beef, ham?
- A bit of chicken would be nice.

496
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:31,506
Oh no!

497
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:45,341
We'll have dinner on the bed.

498
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:07,585
My nose's bleeding. I think it stopped.
The bagpipes hit me.

499
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,824
The bagpipes?
- The bagpipes.

500
00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:12,747
But I'm better now. I'm better.

501
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,101
Eat.
- I'm sorry. I'm not hungry anymore.

502
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:34,987
I'll turn off the lights. You get
undressed and get into bed.

503
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,021
You've had enough problems for tonight.

504
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:49,421
The platter.
I think I knocked it over.

505
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:59,307
How many sugars?
- Two.

506
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,621
He's taking his time to get undressed.

507
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:05,787
Are you separated from your husband?
- Yes.

508
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:08,787
And the little boy's in the countryside?
- Yes.

509
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:11,662
With his grandparents?
- Yes.

510
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:15,668
What does that idiot care?
- No comments please.

511
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,588
I'm in bed.

512
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:35,503
Some coffee?

513
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:40,981
Some coffee?
- No, no, no.

514
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:45,501
My feet are frozen.
- That's alright.

515
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:50,421
What a strange day.
- Why?

516
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:56,741
It started this morning. My mates nailed
down my shoes in front of the door...

517
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:00,065
...of my room, in a hotel in Munich.
- I see.

518
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:06,666
They're always playing pranks on me.
I left my shoes outside...

519
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:09,177
...so they would be polished
and they nailed them down.

520
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:14,064
I had to go home wearing
one brown shoe and one black shoe.

521
01:01:15,229 --> 01:01:19,142
And then there was toothpaste
in my shaving cream.

522
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:22,421
And shaving cream
in my toothpaste.

523
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:27,587
And nobody finds that strange.

524
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:32,903
And then I went running in the park,
with a friend and he had visions.

525
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:36,701
Otherwise a very normal guy.

526
01:01:36,749 --> 01:01:40,025
Sports-loving, strong.
Not the type for hallucinations.

527
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,861
And suddenly he hears voices.

528
01:01:44,229 --> 01:01:47,619
And then at the concert tonight,
I snapped a string.

529
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:52,660
And now I'm in bed with you.

530
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,587
And then you kiss me.

531
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:59,347
And my feet are frozen.

532
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:05,107
Ok, they're having sex.

533
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,301
They're making love at
85 Rue des Vignes.

534
01:02:17,229 --> 01:02:21,666
As you can see, your protégé
enjoys certain perks.

535
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:36,463
Do you feel good?
- Yes.

536
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:39,026
Me too.

537
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:44,419
I'm going to tell you something
I never told anybody.

538
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,221
Yes?

539
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:51,307
It's a secret.
- I see.

540
01:02:53,509 --> 01:02:56,899
I'm not only a violinist.
I also do something else.

541
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:03,627
I'm a composer.
- What?

542
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:08,419
I'm also a composer
but nobody knows that.

543
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:13,428
I wrote an opera. It took me three years.
And I'm still working on it.

544
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:16,461
I'll publish it when it's finished.

545
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:20,701
What?
- I feel like dedicating it to you.

546
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:25,187
What are you doing?
- I'll play it to you.

547
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:28,107
What?
- Only the main theme.

548
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:32,668
You're not going to play the violin now.
- You're the first one to hear it.

549
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:36,099
I'm warning you. It's very modern.
- Come on, François!

550
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,021
What's that?
- What is it?

551
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:04,823
Turn down the volume.

552
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,867
Enough.

553
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,739
Don't you like it?
- It's very beautiful, but not now.

554
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:28,184
It's very beautiful but
who wants an opera at 3 AM?

555
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:32,587
Are you angry?
- Not at all.

556
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,707
Come here then.

557
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:52,021
Yes, you're angry.
- Absolutely not.

558
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:55,903
Come here.

559
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:05,107
And there we go again.

560
01:05:05,229 --> 01:05:08,221
We won't get anywhere tonight.

561
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:32,021
Take him to the property.
- Yes, sir.

562
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:58,099
Oh là là! You made me lose
a night, idiot!

563
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:02,668
You should have confronted him.
Toulouse's paying him and I'll pay him more.

564
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:06,622
Can't you use your head
from time to time?

565
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:11,668
When? When he gets
my hair in his zipper?

566
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:15,668
When he hits himself with bagpipes,
writes an opera, makes love to me...

567
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,985
...very well, by the way.
- We're going in circles, damn.

568
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,789
We're going in circles.
- Sir...

569
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:24,901
What?
- I don't think he's a pro.

570
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:29,342
Well, I don't care what you think.
Get dressed and go to the shop.

571
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:53,021
Oh, my Christine!

572
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:59,063
Oh, my Christine.

573
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:04,861
Christine?
- No, it's Paulette.

574
01:07:05,549 --> 01:07:08,621
Ah! Hello, Paulette.
- Who's Christine?

575
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:13,862
Listen, Paulette, don't come
to my place this afternoon.

576
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:18,181
I met a wonderful girl
last night and I think I love her.

577
01:07:18,229 --> 01:07:22,222
Are you pulling my leg?
- No, I'm not joking.

578
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:26,702
Poucet and Chaperon are the problem.
If we could get rid of them...

579
01:07:26,749 --> 01:07:30,742
...there'd be no problem. Easy.
- Easily said...

580
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:35,419
I want the violinist here in one hour.
- Perrache just arrived at Toulouse's.

581
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:40,188
I won't wear a coat this morning.
- It's not cold, sir.

582
01:07:40,229 --> 01:07:44,188
I'll stay in the office for a bit.
I have a meeting at the ministry at 11.

583
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:47,301
I see.
- Yes, the violinist finished his job.

584
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:51,301
He's going to report to us at 11.

585
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:55,619
Some people are in for a
nasty surprise, Perrache!

586
01:07:56,229 --> 01:07:59,619
Find me the violinist right away
and kill him.

587
01:07:59,749 --> 01:08:02,900
You have one hour.

588
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:08,587
Hello?
- François? François?

589
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:12,341
I'm calling you because I'm sad.

590
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:16,301
I can't stop crying. It's crazy.

591
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:20,025
Have pity on me, François.
I love you.

592
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,663
Yes, yes, I love you.

593
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:27,625
I'm lost when I'm not
in your arms.

594
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:32,146
I won't ask you to sound like
a horse. I promise, François.

595
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:35,221
But don't leave me, darling.

596
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:40,188
You must have achieved what
you wanted. Milan has gone mad...

597
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:44,188
...and the violinist is a dead man.
- Look at the road when you're driving.

598
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:48,188
Tell Poucet and Chaperon to stop
surveillance and go home.

599
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:49,580
They did a good job.

600
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,620
Stop surveillance... but then the
tall blond guy will be killed.

601
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:58,223
Stop questioning my orders
and look at the road.

602
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:07,623
Tell Poucet and Chaperon
to go home. Do it.

603
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:17,907
Chaperon? Perrache speaking.

604
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,820
The boss wants you to
tighten surveillance.

605
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:28,098
They're going to try something,
this morning. Be very vigilant.

606
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:46,902
They're going through the garden.

607
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:17,461
We're too old for this.
- Hush! Don't move.

608
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:28,099
Where's my tie?
I think it's in the living room.

609
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:48,061
Hello?

610
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,701
Hello, François. Christine speaking.

611
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:56,987
I have to talk to you.
I'm in the café on the corner.

612
01:10:57,029 --> 01:10:59,987
Yes. Come right away.
It's very urgent.

613
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:02,907
Hello, Christine? Christine?

614
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:06,663
Talk to me, Christine.

615
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,223
Hello, Christine...

616
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:16,821
What are you doing here?

617
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:22,146
Go home. Mr. Milan doesn't want
you hanging around here.

618
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,823
Understood?

619
01:11:33,829 --> 01:11:36,707
He's gone.
- Yes.

620
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:48,409
Don't move.

621
01:12:10,029 --> 01:12:13,419
Come on, we're not going to
shoot each other, are we?

622
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:20,619
We're colleagues. We're not
going to kill each other, are we?

623
01:13:14,309 --> 01:13:18,268
A blonde. Beautiful. She was here
3 minutes ago. She made a phone call.

624
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,268
Yes, she left.
- What do you mean, she left?

625
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:24,187
Well, she just left.

626
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:32,188
Maurice! Sorry, I can't see you now.
I'm meeting somebody.

627
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:35,187
There are 3 corpses
at your place.

628
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:38,187
What?
- 3 corpses at your place.

629
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:41,619
I came to kill you.
There are 3 corpses at your place.

630
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:44,986
What's wrong with you now?
- Come have a look.

631
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:46,708
But...

632
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:50,742
But Maurice, why did you want to kill me?
- You two jerked me around.

633
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:54,702
Both of you. I caught Paulette
on the phone, hypocrite!

634
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:57,627
Hypocrite! Bastard! Go in.

635
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:05,303
Well?

636
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:10,939
I don't understand...
- Come, sit down.

637
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:15,939
There were 3 corpses in this room.
- Yes, of course.

638
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:30,099
I'm not crazy, François.
- Of course not.

639
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,907
I heard Paulette on the phone.
- Yes. And you heard her...

640
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:39,181
...have sex in a van yesterday and
today you saw 3 corpses at my place.

641
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:43,142
Not a good sign?
- I'm not a doctor, you know.

642
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:48,781
Drink a glass of water.
- A glass of water?

643
01:14:49,029 --> 01:14:52,305
Yes, it'll do you good.
A big glass of water

644
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:24,781
I'm not thirsty.
- Look at your face.

645
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:30,146
I'll get you a glass of water.
- But I'm not thirsty at all.

646
01:15:46,349 --> 01:15:48,146
Here.

647
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:52,107
I'm not doing well, François.

648
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,702
Not well at all.

649
01:15:57,229 --> 01:15:59,982
There are 3 victims, sir:

650
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:03,419
Two of Milan's men and Chaperon.
- Excuse me?

651
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:08,669
They had it out with
each other, but I assure you...

652
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:13,544
...the tall blond guy is fine.
- I thought I told you to tell...

653
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:19,419
...Poucet and Chaperon to go home.
- Really? I must have misunderstood.

654
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:24,102
I told them to tighten
surveillance.

655
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:29,701
You definitely misunderstood.

656
01:16:29,749 --> 01:16:32,627
I'm very sorry, sir.

657
01:16:34,629 --> 01:16:37,302
I didn't mean to go against you.

658
01:16:37,349 --> 01:16:40,625
I only wanted to protect
an innocent person.

659
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:46,266
Well, you failed anyway.
Now is the hour of truth.

660
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:50,622
Milan's entering the scene.
On one side, there's Milan with...

661
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:55,180
...all his gang and on the other side
the tall blond guy with the black shoe.

662
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:59,222
This should end in a big showdown,
like in good western movies.

663
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:03,381
I have to go for a pee.
- Alright, go then.

664
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:09,821
Come with me.
- Oh, come on.

665
01:17:10,349 --> 01:17:13,625
Please, come with me.
- Leave me alone.

666
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:27,826
Christine!

667
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,667
Christine!

668
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:43,021
You were told not to come back here.

669
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:46,506
Get in.

670
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:55,227
Christine! Christine!

671
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:59,221
Christine!
- Sir, your glasses.

672
01:18:24,669 --> 01:18:26,705
Lucien!
- My God!

673
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:43,026
François?

674
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:46,506
François!

675
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:09,178
Get up.

676
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:11,026
Come here.

677
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:16,107
Turn around.
- Like this?

678
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,507
Very good.

679
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:48,619
I'm colonel Milan,
the assistant of your boss.

680
01:19:49,229 --> 01:19:52,107
Oh! Sorry, sir.

681
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,667
Excuse me.

682
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:04,218
Thanks.

683
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,626
Perrache!

684
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:41,066
Perrache.

685
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,541
The tall blond guy
with the black shoe.

686
01:20:49,749 --> 01:20:52,343
Who is it?

687
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:07,821
It's an asshole trap, sir.

688
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:20,420
What's going on with you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

689
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:26,142
Maurice. But Maurice...
- Go upstairs. Everything's fine.

690
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:30,107
Everything's going smoothly.

691
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:38,227
You'll see everything's fine.

692
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:46,669
You don't seem to be doing too well.
- I have a musician's insurance.

693
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:50,099
Social security...
If I find a good clinic...

694
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:53,701
...they'll refund me everything.

695
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:59,187
Hello, madam. Goodbye, madam.

696
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:02,505
Christine. Where were you?
I looked for you everywhere.

697
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,703
I'll tell you an incredible story.

698
01:22:09,469 --> 01:22:12,541
Mysterious death of colonel Milan.

699
01:22:13,749 --> 01:22:17,139
Toulouse says:
"Milan was a remarkable man."

700
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:19,586
Maurice.

701
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:31,942
Darling.
- Bye bye, Paulette.

702
01:22:35,509 --> 01:22:37,306
Maurice.

703
01:22:37,749 --> 01:22:41,139
Stay here. Don't move.
Come say goodbye to François.

704
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:44,663
Goodbye, François.

705
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:48,668
The doctors are reducing his
tranquillizers. He's getting better.

706
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,701
He has no more nightmares.

707
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:57,260
See you tomorrow. I'll be there at 2.
- See you tomorrow.

708
01:22:58,229 --> 01:23:02,188
Everything will be back to
the way it was, darling.

709
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:07,145
Better go home.
He'll catch a cold.

710
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:09,626
Come.

711
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:15,901
Have a good trip. Be good in Munich.
- Bye bye.

712
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:26,619
Going to Munich?
- No. To Rio, in Brazil.

713
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:30,301
Ah, to Rio.
That's not the same desk.

714
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:33,782
No, let me.
I'll check it in myself.

715
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:37,223
Hey, sir!

716
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:54,339
Christine? Are you alright?
- I'd be better in your arms.

717
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:58,107
Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you.

718
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:05,701
When he'll be back from Rio...
- Yes, sir.

719
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:10,020
...and come back he will,
you must contact him.

720
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:16,622
After all,
the guy has a talent.

721
01:24:23,697 --> 01:24:31,478
Everybody has the right
to a private life.

722
01:24:31,754 --> 01:24:35,495
Article 9 of the Penal Code.

723
01:24:35,866 --> 01:24:41,768
THE TALL BLOND GUY WITH A BLACK SHOE
