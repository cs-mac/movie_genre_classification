Encoded by M@husni

1
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,880
"Take It To The Limit"?

2
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,946
Artist and year?

3
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:41,454
1975. The Eagles, of course.
Very funny.

4
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,996
That's not a song. It's ridiculous.
You made it up.

5
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:29,001
That is definitely a song.
It's a good song, and a winning song.

6
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:32,963
You give up?

7
00:02:33,276 --> 00:02:34,632
On belay.

8
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:40,054
"MacArthur Park." Richard Harris.
1968.

9
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:45,163
1968? I didn't even think they had
recorded music back then.

10
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:48,499
Excuse me. I have a signed album
by Mr. Harris.

11
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,793
It was cutting-edge stuff back then.

12
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,817
Peter, check your sister's belay.

13
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:55,277
Want to tell him we're not 15?

14
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,092
Why bother? We'll always be 15.

15
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,012
Dad, she needs a second cam.

16
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:02,889
That won't hold in a fall.

17
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,078
Screw you.

18
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,434
Listen, Annie.

19
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:08,624
No matter how experienced...

20
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,960
...a smart climber always wears a belt
and suspenders.

21
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,463
Two cams are safe, three's better.

22
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:18,842
I'm not kidding. We're not moving
until you put another cam in the wall.

23
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,762
I have three cams.
He's yanking your chain.

24
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,743
Watch out!

25
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,790
Amateurs at twelve o'clock!
Check your safety!

26
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:00,029
Too much weight!
It's not gonna hold!

27
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,868
Hold it together, you two!

28
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,432
Now get a grip.

29
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,413
We're getting out of this.

30
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:13,792
Annie, how close to the wall are we?

31
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:19,423
Keep still, goddamn it!
Stop moving around! Stop!

32
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,655
Dad!

33
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:37,670
Both of you...

34
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,756
...keep very still.

35
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,528
Try and stay calm.

36
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:43,405
Annie.

37
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,533
Is the other cam moving?

38
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:47,993
No.

39
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,078
Try and reach the wall.

40
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:53,207
See if you can anchor us back in.

41
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,501
Try it.

42
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,180
It's moving!

43
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,412
Peter, get your knife.

44
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,455
What?

45
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,123
Just do as I say.

46
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:36,896
Get it!

47
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,711
You don't have much time here.

48
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:43,256
You have to do something for me.

49
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,237
Cut me loose.

50
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,636
One cam can't hold us all.

51
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:50,555
You have to cut me loose...

52
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,892
...or else I'll pull everybody down.
Everybody will die!

53
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,560
Shut up, Annie!

54
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,063
It's one dead or three, Peter.

55
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,627
Don't make him do this.

56
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,712
You're gonna kill your sister.

57
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,797
Annie will die if you don't.

58
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,570
-I won't do it!
-Cut the rope!

59
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:07,343
-I can't!
-Stop it!

60
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,992
That cam is gonna come out
and Annie and you will die!

61
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:13,599
-You'll kill your sister!
-Stop it!

62
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,206
Cut the damn rope!

63
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,229
It doesn't matter about me. Cut it.

64
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:20,481
We're out of time!

65
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:21,836
Don't do it!

66
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,381
No one will blame you for it!
Just cut it!

67
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,074
Annie and you are gonna die!
Just cut it, Peter!

68
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:17,531
We're cleared for the Siachen glacier.
A doctor's on standby.

69
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,555
I was heading there anyway.
Mail and supplies.

70
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,058
I can drop you on my way back
to K2 base camp.

71
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,205
Sounds good.

72
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:37,864
I tried to visit you a few days ago.

73
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,950
But the weather closed in.

74
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,390
Annie's at base camp.
Arrived last week.

75
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:33,649
Would you like a tea?

76
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,421
No, I'm fine.

77
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:39,279
You must try the tea. It's very good.
Indian, of course.

78
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:43,659
We may be at war with them,
but their tea's the best.

79
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,641
-Forgive me. Mr. Garrett, isn't it?
-Yes.

80
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,039
National Geographic is always welcome.

81
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:13,584
The only Westerners who come to
Pakistan without conquering something.

82
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,381
The colonel's angry. Only 25% of his
medical supplies are onboard.

83
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,300
And three days late.
Look at this place.

84
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:25,158
In six years, I've lost 800 men.
Not one to the enemy.

85
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,661
But the chopper was full of stuff.

86
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,642
Not for my men.

87
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,604
For Americans who can pay $3 million for
climbing permits.

88
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,689
Elliot Vaughn, the entrepreneur.

89
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:40,486
He's got 40 people with him to try K2.
I've been seconded to his team.

90
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:42,050
Seconded or sold?

91
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:50,287
That's a question only a general
in Islamabad can answer.

92
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,249
Three o'clock.
Time to wake up the Indians.

93
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,810
So Annie's coming in with Vaughn's team?

94
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,729
She's leading a WNN documentary crew.

95
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,919
They're going up the mountain
with him.

96
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,421
Have you seen her?

97
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,654
Not yet. One of the guides told me.

98
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:28,033
What about Vaughn?
What's he all about?

99
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:32,829
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Sensitive, kind, modest.

100
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,915
Your typical billionaire.

101
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,711
Four years ago his team took
on the south face.

102
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,527
Was 800 feet from the top
when weather closed in.

103
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,342
Twenty-four hours in the death zone.

104
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,555
Next morning, he walked down.
He's a bloody good climber.

105
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:37,581
-Got your update, Annie.
-What's up?

106
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,188
That cyclone's tracking fast
from southeast.

107
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,378
Let me know if anything changes.

108
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,512
What are you--?

109
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,517
I just happened to be in the area.

110
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:26,067
I heard WNN hired you. And you're
hosting it. Congrats.

111
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:30,029
They needed someone who could climb K2
and look presentable.

112
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:31,385
Not much of a rush.

113
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:35,243
That's not true. They wanted the best.

114
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:40,560
I read about you on the Eiger.
Fastest female ascent.

115
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,688
Dad would be proud.

116
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,874
When you leaving?

117
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,358
Early tomorrow morning. We want to
be summiting by 2:00 Wednesday.

118
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,694
What does the mountain say about that?

119
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,448
I thought you laid siege to it.

120
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,159
I didn't know it could be scheduled.

121
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:19,662
It's a plan, Peter, that's all.

122
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,937
Vaughn's aggressive. He knows what he
wants and goes for it.

123
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,605
I admire him.

124
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,108
How long have you known him?

125
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,591
Wherever you're going with this,
you're wrong.

126
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,885
Nobody ever affects my climbing.

127
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,021
Was that two of them, Cyril?

128
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,505
Or has this stuff just gotten
better than we thought?

129
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,829
-Frank.
-Good to see you.

130
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,999
-Tommy McLaren. Colorado Kid.
-You ready to go?

131
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,668
You lead, I'll follow.

132
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,066
There's my leading lady. Hi, Annie.

133
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:37,090
-How was your trip?
-My stomach's still up there.

134
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,384
Luckily I passed on the eggs Benedict.

135
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:43,763
Excuse me for a minute.

136
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,621
Ed Viesturs.
It's an honor to meet you.

137
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,394
-Elliot Vaughn.
-Nice to meet you.

138
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,626
This guy has been up Everest five times.

139
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,171
He's climbed 12 of the world's
14 highest peaks.

140
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:58,257
All without oxygen.

141
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:03,262
Rock on. By comparison, all of us
are merely amateurs.

142
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,077
-It's a real honor, Ed.
-Welcome to base camp.

143
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,328
Thank you.

144
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,570
Outdoors magazine wants
to interview you.

145
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:23,386
"Bankruptcy at High Altitude."

146
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,680
How much can we--

147
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:29,955
Yes?

148
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,524
I could go and come back, or....

149
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,031
Looking for Skip?

150
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:46,325
Yeah.

151
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:49,662
Try the command tent.

152
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,747
Thanks.

153
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:01,861
Skip?

154
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,051
I'm Peter Garrett.

155
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:06,032
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

156
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,369
I got your message.
Bad luck about your porter.

157
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,748
I've got four you can meet tomorrow.
Supplies you need are no problem.

158
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,981
The Swedish hooker's taking longer
than I thought.

159
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:21,568
There's no shortage of entertainment.
You saw Mr. Vaughn fly in?

160
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:26,573
He's hard to miss. What's this
about his climbing to a deadline?

161
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,014
-Friend of yours?
-My sister's climbing with him.

162
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,247
Annie Garrett.

163
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:39,086
Vaughn's got this publicity stunt
for his new airline, Majestic Air.

164
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:44,091
He stands on the top of K2 waving
as the inaugural flight goes overhead.

165
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,489
Are you serious?

166
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,157
I'm deadly serious.

167
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:52,849
Your sister's safe. No one knows
these hills better than Tommy McLaren.

168
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,352
He told Vaughn they'd get up there.
I know I did.

169
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,376
I'd have told him anything
for $1 million.

170
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:01,087
Is that what he's spending?

171
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,153
That's just for Tom. Bought his
company out for the entire season.

172
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,116
Not that I'm pissed off.
Look what I get to drag to the top.

173
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:14,642
56-year-old movie producer
with dysfunctional bowel syndrome.

174
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,770
He's got the runs, mate. Permanently.

175
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,254
The Bench brothers bet
he won't make it past 18,000.

176
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,443
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

177
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:29,448
It depends. I'm so broke I might have
to shove him in a crevasse myself.

178
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,349
This is Monique, our base camp manager
and medic. Monique, Peter.

179
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,686
We've met. You should look at these.

180
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,691
Don't mind her. She's French-Canadian.

181
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:46,027
Some days she's Canadian
and can be quite pleasant.

182
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,321
Today, she's obviously French.

183
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:15,536
How about some Spanish mackerel
for the bow?

184
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:19,602
My name's Cyril. I'm not much,
but I'm all I think about.

185
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,730
Watch out for him, he's like a dog.
If he sees something...

186
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:26,901
...he tries to shag it. If he can't
shag it, he tries to eat it.

187
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:29,195
If he can't eat it, he pisses on it.

188
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:33,679
It's easy to tell us apart,
because I'm the shy one.

189
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,660
No, no, no, señorita.

190
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,731
Here you go.
Have a drink on Mr. Vaughn.

191
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:46,817
What time's the laser show?

192
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,509
Is this thing on?

193
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,386
Howdy!

194
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,348
Everyone hear me all right?

195
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,329
No!

196
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,917
You're the lucky ones.

197
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:09,131
Welcome to the highest party
in the world!

198
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,951
Okay, maybe I did overdo it
just a bit.

199
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:22,373
Four years ago, I came here
with a dream to climb K2.

200
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:25,084
The toughest mountain in the world.

201
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,776
As most of you know,
that attempt ended in tragedy.

202
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,426
On Wednesday,
with the help of Tom McLaren...

203
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,449
...I intend to fulfill that dream.

204
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:41,037
And while I'm at it, take care
of some business, Texas style.

205
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,858
At 0900 hours, Greenwich Mean Time...

206
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:52,403
...the inaugural flight of Majestic
Air will fly over the summit...

207
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,905
...and we'll be there to wave them on!

208
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,830
To the other teams climbing,
I'd like to say be safe...

209
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,228
...and good luck.

210
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:09,294
Kick up your heels
and enjoy the barbecue!

211
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:22,954
What about the weather, Mr. Vaughn?

212
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,504
We hope for the best.
You know something we don't?

213
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,988
The weather closes in
and people die up there.

214
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:39,116
Or don't you have to worry about that?

215
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:45,789
Anybody who doesn't worry
about that is a fool.

216
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:49,647
Brian Maki did a high-atmosphere
analysis of the last 4 decades.

217
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:55,799
Most years there's a 9-to-12-day lull
before the fall storms.

218
00:23:56,216 --> 00:24:00,178
On August 2nd, we calculate
an 82% chance of fine weather.

219
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,515
Give me odds like that
in the oil business, I'd be rich.

220
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,667
Who's the leader, Mr. Vaughn?

221
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:14,672
Who makes decisions that mean
other people live or die?

222
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,653
Who plays God, so to speak?

223
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:22,492
There can be only one leader.
It's always the best climber.

224
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:27,497
I've made it clear to everyone
that Tom McLaren is that man.

225
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,900
Even the Pakistanis agree.
They're giving you a 21-gun salute.

226
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,261
Okay, let's party!

227
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:47,100
Thanks for that, Elliot.

228
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:49,811
You climb as good as you talk,
we'll get you there.

229
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:13,748
You know that old guy
who was asking questions?

230
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:16,876
Montgomery Wick.

231
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:20,734
Remember Dad used to talk about him?

232
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,886
They were in the service together--

233
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,868
Of course, I remember.

234
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:38,043
I miss him, Annie.
I miss him just as much as--

235
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,816
I can't talk about it.

236
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,797
You never have.

237
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:45,342
There's nothing to say.
He's gone, Peter.

238
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,869
Look, you can blame me all you want...

239
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,371
...but that last cam would've failed.

240
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,665
It held the two of us.

241
00:26:56,812 --> 00:27:00,357
You want to do this?
Okay, fine, let's do it.

242
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,651
You didn't give it a chance.

243
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,779
-He knew it wouldn't hold either.
-Of course he didn't.

244
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:07,343
We were his life.

245
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:11,514
He would've died rather than take
a chance anything might happen to us.

246
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,912
I think we owed him the same.

247
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,604
But I did what I thought was right.

248
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:23,505
If you're so right, why haven't
you climbed? Or been to his grave?

249
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:29,970
I'm not going up there for a TV show.
I'm going up there for him.

250
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:33,098
I want to be the person
he always wanted me to be.

251
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:37,477
When I'm up there, I feel close
to him.

252
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:38,937
I touch his soul.

253
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,487
Take care up there.

254
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:00,730
This is it.

255
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,336
Wish you were going with me.

256
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:08,446
Not this time. Take care up there.
It'll be a great day for Texas.

257
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,427
And Scotland.

258
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,549
What is it?

259
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,634
Spindrift coming off the top.

260
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:37,701
That's local. If something was coming
in, it'd show on the other peaks.

261
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:41,663
Your sister's fine, man.
You look after yourself.

262
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:45,834
You too. Thanks for everything.

263
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:05,913
Understood, Tom.
You guys take good care up there.

264
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:09,146
Thanks, base. Out.

265
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,378
Well, you heard it.

266
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:18,426
Computer model shows it's building.

267
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:20,824
That's a concern.

268
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,952
We're about an hour from
the bottleneck, right?

269
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,436
Let's kick it and get up there.

270
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:31,668
Gets any worse,
we'll shelter under the ice cliffs.

271
00:31:31,877 --> 00:31:35,630
If it comes in fast,
we're totally exposed out here.

272
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:38,237
It's not fast.
He said it's slow-moving.

273
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,574
There's a 70% chance
it'll turn east and miss us.

274
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,806
I'm not gonna risk a storm.
Not at 26,000.

275
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:48,560
We're not suggesting anything stupid.
The weather could turn.

276
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,105
The odds are with us.
We're five hours from the summit.

277
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:55,650
We turn back now, that's it.
We've lost our window.

278
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,925
I know. Elliot, I'm aware of that.
It's my responsibility.

279
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:03,992
I won't let a marketing campaign
compromise our safety.

280
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,703
You think this is
about a marketing campaign?

281
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:10,874
Come on, Tom.
This is about getting to the top.

282
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,210
I don't give a shit
about the publicity.

283
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:16,921
This is a life statement for me.

284
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:24,220
We're only 500 feet from
the bottleneck. Let's keep going.

285
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:32,458
Okay.

286
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,898
Okay.

287
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,155
Let's go.

288
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:03,634
980 hecto-Pascals and falling.

289
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:07,909
Lenticular cloud to the southeast.
Winds at 80 knots, rising.

290
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:10,933
Tom says he's going on.
What's base camp pressure?

291
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,436
Pressure's dropped two points
in four hours.

292
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:15,938
You made your case. We listened.
We decided.

293
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:20,109
It's too high a risk. Why am I here
if you don't listen to me?

294
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:25,323
I'll assess the risk. As to why
you're here, I wonder myself.

295
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:28,972
I'm Annie's brother.
McLaren's pulling them back, right?

296
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:31,370
We're on target. They're going on.

297
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:35,020
The wind's hit to the south.
What's your satellite show?

298
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,314
We've assessed the data.
We're going up.

299
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,920
It shows bad air coming in from India.

300
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:43,987
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:50,869
-How high are they?
-26,000.

302
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:54,935
-What are you doing?!
-Warning my sister!

303
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:57,542
Leave it! That's enough!

304
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:01,504
Tom McLaren, come in.

305
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:05,154
Tom McLaren, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

306
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:07,552
Tom McLaren, do you read?

307
00:34:10,993 --> 00:34:12,348
Come in, base.

308
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:17,041
You've got a major storm coming in.
You've gotta start down.

309
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:19,960
Who is this?

310
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,254
Peter Garrett.
You copy about the storm?

311
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,695
Where's Frank Williams?
Put Frank Williams on.

312
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:32,055
Skip here. We're looking
at the weather screens.

313
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:36,748
If this doesn't turn, you'll be in
big trouble. Turn back immediately.

314
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,250
Do you copy?

315
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:42,482
Yeah, I copy that.
Thanks, Skip. Out.

316
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,942
How we doing?

317
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,862
I'm pulling the plug.
We're going down.

318
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:49,781
-Just hold on.
-I'm sorry, Elliot.

319
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:52,701
You pay me to make these decisions.

320
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,578
I'm paying you to get me to the top.

321
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:59,166
Jesus! Elliot, you told me
I was in charge up here.

322
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:01,877
You are! Why are you vacillating?

323
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:05,005
Because some second-rate guide
got on the radio?

324
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:07,194
Nobody knows this mountain better
than Skip.

325
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,574
Skip Taylor's a hustler. He was
jockeying me to be in your boots.

326
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,598
Don't crap out on me now.

327
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,683
Come on, what did you think?

328
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,271
She'd just lift up her skirt
and pull her panties down for us?

329
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,356
Is this how you got up Everest twice?

330
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,797
I'm going down.

331
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,158
Fine. Fine.

332
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:37,120
Go down. Go on. Sit it out.

333
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:41,082
The storm will turn and you'll spend
the rest of your life living it down.

334
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,419
That should do wonders
for your business.

335
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:00,685
I'm sorry, can I? Please.

336
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:48,545
We're going back!

337
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:55,010
We don't have a choice!
We are dead on the ridge! Let's go!

338
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:03,039
Fuck you!

339
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:19,052
Annie!

340
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,867
Annie, can you hear me?

341
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,829
I'm all right! I'm safe!

342
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,294
Elliot!

343
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,631
I'm fine! We're okay!

344
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,565
Avalanche!

345
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,805
Annie, are you there?
Can you hear me?

346
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:56,082
Come in, base, this is summit team.
Do you read me?

347
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:08,282
Anybody, do you read me? This is
the Vaughn summit team. Come in.

348
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,078
Summit team, this is base camp.
Do you copy?

349
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:19,543
Summit team, this is base camp.

350
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,833
If you're gonna do that,
do it outside.

351
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,845
Base, this is summit team.
Are you trying to contact us?

352
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:35,765
Here. Let me.

353
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,665
Oh, my God. That's Morse code.

354
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:46,296
My dad taught us when we were kids.
Said it could save your life.

355
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,178
Smart man, your father.

356
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,097
He sure was.

357
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:04,648
There's three of them.

358
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:10,695
Vaughn.

359
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:15,283
Tom.

360
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,288
Annie.

361
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:37,597
I'm sorry, Kareem.

362
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,829
You say there are three.

363
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,687
Maybe there are others.

364
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:48,962
Maybe.

365
00:43:56,678 --> 00:44:00,745
Tell them we can't keep talking.
We gotta save power.

366
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,977
He's right.

367
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,105
What's he saying, Annie?

368
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:11,172
They're coming to get us.

369
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:17,220
It's not just snow.
It's gonna be ice and rock.

370
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:20,765
We need special tools.
I don't know how much we have here.

371
00:44:21,182 --> 00:44:23,684
Then how do you get it
up there, Mr. Garrett?

372
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:28,689
Then we dig with our bare hands
if we have to.

373
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:33,277
Whatever it takes. We have more than
enough guys here to get this done.

374
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:40,576
What the hell do you want to do?
Just leave them there?

375
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,292
Peter.

376
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,506
You can't ask people to work there.

377
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:55,695
That high, just staying alive is--

378
00:44:56,008 --> 00:44:58,719
So we just walk away
and forget about them?

379
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:04,141
They had one fuel can each. They can
melt ice and rehydrate for a day.

380
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:06,644
At 26,000, without it,
their lungs fill with fluid.

381
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:09,980
That's pulmonary edema,
they die within another 12.

382
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:13,525
That gives us a window of 36 hours.

383
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,910
Montgomery Wick.

384
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:25,725
Wick speed-summited in 24.

385
00:45:26,038 --> 00:45:27,498
We're not Montgomery Wick.

386
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:31,251
Even if we were, how long does that
leave to get through the rock and ice?

387
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:38,550
We don't know their exact location.
How long will that take?

388
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:44,389
I won't let Annie die.

389
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:49,082
So what are we gonna do?

390
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:35,273
Nitroglycerin, Mr. Garrett.

391
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,089
I wouldn't touch it
with an English barge pole.

392
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:41,425
We use it to blast rock
for gun emplacements.

393
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,658
It's low-freezing
and more powerful than symtex.

394
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:48,411
My responsibility ends at that door.

395
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:52,165
I want to make one thing clear.
This is your decision.

396
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,876
It's got nothing
to do with the Pakistani army.

397
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:58,108
Which is a legal way of saying
I think it's madness.

398
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,611
A magnificent madness, though.

399
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:02,175
Good luck.

400
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,346
Stop!

401
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,308
Skip, don't move your feet.

402
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,123
Everybody keep very still.

403
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,408
Okay, Skip.

404
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:34,558
Let me get this straight.
You want to go up that hill...

405
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:37,999
...with nitro on your back
and hope that it doesn't jolt?

406
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:39,459
That's right.

407
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:44,568
A hundred thousand sperm
and you were the fastest?

408
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:51,450
Skip here's agreed to go,
so I need four more.

409
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,995
It'll be a speed ascent,
in pairs, one canister per team.

410
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:59,583
People have to share?
Won't everyone want their own bomb?

411
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:06,465
Ed.

412
00:49:06,882 --> 00:49:08,759
You're the best climber here.

413
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,555
I'm not one to walk away,
but I think it's suicide.

414
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,432
If we just leave them,
what do you call that?

415
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:19,082
It's reality. You're willing
to risk six lives to save three?

416
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:20,854
How do you feel about that?

417
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,523
The same way you do.

418
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:27,423
Your best friend died on Everest.
What if it was him up there right now?

419
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,262
I will go.

420
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,120
Ali is my cousin. It is my duty.

421
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,050
How about it, Mal? You and Cyril
have been up there before.

422
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:52,969
No....

423
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,846
Why would we want to leave this place?

424
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:57,453
Luxurious accommodation.
Fine cuisine.

425
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,643
Sultry weather.
Frostbite's off my dick.

426
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,979
I reckon we should wait
until they chuck in a ski lift.

427
00:50:03,188 --> 00:50:06,733
Good idea. lmagine coming to the
Himalayas and actually climbing.

428
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:10,174
Especially when you have
to complete your autobiography.

429
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:15,179
And rustle up those all-important
endorsements. You wankers!

430
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:21,644
What's bloody wrong with you?!

431
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,833
We're in.

432
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:27,796
Thank you.

433
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,341
I need one more.

434
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:43,436
I'll write a check now
for anyone who goes.

435
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,607
Whether Elliot makes it or not,
I'll be waiting when you get back.

436
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,005
Half a million bucks.

437
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,347
Does that include the tip?

438
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:26,604
My brother's got explosives.
They're gonna blast their way down.

439
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,689
Blast their way down.

440
00:51:30,983 --> 00:51:34,946
How are they gonna find us?
We might as well be on Mars.

441
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,282
It's not a question of how,
it's how long.

442
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:42,557
It's time that's gonna kill us.
We have to lay down a schedule.

443
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,956
A regimen we all adhere to.

444
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,875
Edema sets in
if we don't keep drinking.

445
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:51,629
Now, I figure, three water bottles...

446
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,610
...that's half a cup each,
every 2 hours.

447
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:58,094
After that, fuel cells to melt ice,
and finally...

448
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:00,075
...we use the dex syringes.

449
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:03,933
Chances are we're all gonna get
pretty sick...

450
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,582
...but if we keep to the schedule,
keep to it...

451
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:09,459
...maybe we can hold out.

452
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,028
Annie, we need to give them the grid
reference for our last known position.

453
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:20,616
She says they were about 300 feet
above the Anvil, heading down east.

454
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:22,597
The shoulder ice field.

455
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,308
I checked their manifest.
This is what they have.

456
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:29,792
We leave at dawn.
They got 22 hours if they're lucky.

457
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:31,460
How high can we chopper in?

458
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:34,692
Rasul says 21,000.
Any higher, the air's too thin.

459
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:36,986
He drops us.
How fast can we get there?

460
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:41,574
Negrotto Col's the only place we can
land. From there, 27 hours.

461
00:52:51,897 --> 00:52:53,461
Five hours short.

462
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,864
We need Montgomery Wick. He's the
only man who's done it faster.

463
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:02,011
Will he do it?

464
00:53:04,722 --> 00:53:09,206
Four years ago, a big storm blows
an American team off the hill.

465
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,377
There's nine up there, including
his wife. She was a guide.

466
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:18,173
He knows he can't help her, but he
goes anyway. The only one who did.

467
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,865
He lost all his toes to frostbite
but dragged 3 guys off the mountain.

468
00:53:23,178 --> 00:53:26,515
They owe their lives to him.
What do you reckon?

469
00:53:28,183 --> 00:53:29,226
Where is he?

470
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:33,605
On the mountain.
Up the shoulder, where he always goes.

471
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:37,359
They never found his wife's body,
so he keeps looking.

472
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,131
The guy's a lunatic.

473
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:41,947
That's just what we need.

474
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:45,283
Yeah. Strap on the nitro.

475
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:12,394
That's a great idea.
Smoking next to the nitro.

476
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:16,773
Although, bro and I always hoped
that you'd blow us.

477
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:43,779
Why are you going?

478
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:45,760
The money, of course.

479
00:54:46,177 --> 00:54:49,618
Skip hasn't paid anyone in months.
You know of a better way out?

480
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,746
Can you climb?

481
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,960
Peter wants to know if I can climb.

482
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:01,818
Worst I've seen.
Couldn't climb a ladder.

483
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:04,216
You're that good, huh?

484
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,742
Yeah. But it was a very tall ladder.

485
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:28,302
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:31,430
I'm trying to kiss my ass goodbye.

487
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:47,175
It's dawn.

488
00:55:47,384 --> 00:55:49,990
If the weather's cleared,
they'll be on their way.

489
00:55:50,408 --> 00:55:51,659
I know.

490
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:54,266
Thank you.

491
00:55:56,038 --> 00:55:57,602
And your brother?

492
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,626
Has he climbed since Utah?

493
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:03,129
No.

494
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:08,029
People say he lost his nerve.

495
00:56:08,759 --> 00:56:10,740
Have you heard that?

496
00:56:11,053 --> 00:56:13,973
Yeah, I've heard that.

497
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:38,372
Annie!

498
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,666
It's a pack! Quick!

499
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,767
I'm not interested.

500
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,815
You went before.
Men owe you their lives.

501
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:28,630
Four years ago.
Now I just climb for myself.

502
00:57:29,673 --> 00:57:34,261
My father was a climber. Royce
Garrett. He climbed Everest with you.

503
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:38,119
I don't care. I don't live my life
so you can look up to me.

504
00:57:38,327 --> 00:57:39,787
My sister's dying up there.

505
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:42,602
Before you lecture me,
get your facts straight.

506
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:44,583
It'll be less embarrassing.

507
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:48,337
Up there, you're not dying,
Mr. Garrett. You're dead.

508
00:57:52,508 --> 00:57:54,280
What the hell happened to you?

509
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:00,120
Vaughn's people are offering $500,000
to anyone that goes.

510
00:58:00,328 --> 00:58:02,205
Maybe that'll make a difference.

511
00:58:03,456 --> 00:58:04,916
Why would they do that?

512
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,480
He's one of them.

513
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,699
What's their supply situation?

514
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:18,263
Enough for 22 hours.

515
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:19,827
Twenty-two.

516
00:58:20,452 --> 00:58:21,912
Who's coordinating at base?

517
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:24,415
-Vaughn's people.
-That's a mistake.

518
00:58:24,623 --> 00:58:29,315
I'll need someone there I can trust.
Taylor, you know the mountain best.

519
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:32,548
Skip's one of the best climbers.
We'll need him.

520
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:36,093
Let's agree on one thing:
This is not a climbing democracy.

521
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:39,117
On a rescue, we don't vote,
question or argue.

522
00:58:39,325 --> 00:58:42,766
You listen and do exactly as I say.
Chopper will take you back.

523
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:55,904
Here's how we'll split it up.
Malcolm, you'll climb with Kareem.

524
00:58:56,113 --> 00:58:58,615
-Cyril, you'll--
-What? No, I bloody won't.

525
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:03,099
You've been up the mountain too long
and forgotten the rules.

526
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,184
Never eat at a place called "Ma's"...

527
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:08,312
...don't play cards
with a fellow named Doc...

528
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:12,379
...and never climb with a stranger.
I'm going with my brother.

529
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:15,715
Frankly, I'd rather climb
with the Sheila.

530
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,782
My rules: I put a strong climber
with a weaker one.

531
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,867
You'll climb with Kareem.

532
00:59:22,597 --> 00:59:24,996
Mr. Garrett,
you'll be climbing with me.

533
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:28,749
Cyril. Guess what?

534
00:59:30,418 --> 00:59:32,607
Come on, darling.
Give us a smile, eh!

535
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:36,152
It's the second best thing
you can do with your lips.

536
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,641
We'll take the west ridge.
Cyril, the Mushroom.

537
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,622
Malcolm, Hockey Stick Gully.

538
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:49,708
Speed up all of them is the same.

539
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:29,226
We're as high as I can take you!

540
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,208
Move it! I can't hold it for long!

541
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:25,740
Next!

542
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:53,789
I'm having trouble
maintaining altitude.

543
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:31,848
Get out of here! We're gonna burn!

544
01:02:32,056 --> 01:02:34,454
Go! Move it! Move it!

545
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,029
Grab my hand, damn it! Grab it!

546
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:21,167
Come on! Come on!

547
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:37,389
He needs dex. Now.

548
01:04:37,597 --> 01:04:38,744
No.

549
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:40,934
We stick to the schedule.

550
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:46,043
In nine hours, the water runs out.
We need it. Our lives depend on it.

551
01:04:46,878 --> 01:04:48,754
He'll die if he doesn't get it.

552
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:50,944
He will anyway.

553
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:56,575
Come on, Annie.

554
01:04:56,783 --> 01:04:59,494
We both know Tom isn't going anywhere.

555
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,456
You've done your best. You have.

556
01:05:04,082 --> 01:05:06,480
We can't waste resources
on a lost cause.

557
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:08,983
Saving somebody's life
is not a lost cause.

558
01:05:09,191 --> 01:05:11,694
It is, if you know
they can't be saved.

559
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,405
Why should three people die
if two can live?

560
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,182
Okay. If that's what you think,
why don't you go tell him yourself?

561
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,751
Tom, can you hear me?

562
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:30,254
-Don't listen to--
-He has a right to know!

563
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:37,240
You're a climber, Tom. A pro.

564
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,202
You know the reality.
Even if they get to us...

565
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:45,477
...they can't carry you down.
Not from this altitude.

566
01:05:46,207 --> 01:05:51,004
Now, Annie wants to give you the dex.
I understand that, I do.

567
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:55,279
But you and I know it's just
delaying what's inevitable.

568
01:05:57,885 --> 01:05:59,867
Just lie here and die, Elliot?

569
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:03,203
Is that what you're telling me?

570
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:08,730
I'm not telling you anything.
I'm asking you to respect life...

571
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:11,128
...not to waste it.

572
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:16,446
-If I was in your position--
-You're not in my position!

573
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:21,451
That's right, I'm not.

574
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:27,811
Understand something. You're not just
killing me. You're killing her too.

575
01:07:34,648 --> 01:07:39,445
We're on a bit of a deadline, mate.
Can we just leave this till later?

576
01:07:39,653 --> 01:07:42,051
He's all right, isn't he,
this Allah bloke?

577
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,492
He won't strike you dead
if you miss one prayer, will he?

578
01:07:53,521 --> 01:07:56,649
All right. One prayer.

579
01:07:56,962 --> 01:07:58,422
Under the circumstances.

580
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,967
What harm can it do?

581
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:08,223
Do Muslims believe in Hell?

582
01:08:09,683 --> 01:08:10,934
Do you?

583
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,314
So if that thing there blows...

584
01:08:16,148 --> 01:08:18,963
...and I don't believe in Allah,
I'm going to Hell?

585
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:21,987
Is that what you reckon?

586
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:27,305
You're all the bloody same,
aren't you?

587
01:08:28,764 --> 01:08:32,101
Born-agains say I don't believe
in Jesus, so I'll go to hell.

588
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:35,125
Jews say I do believe in Jesus,
I'll go to Hell.

589
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:39,191
Catholics say I don't believe
in the pope, I'll go to Hell.

590
01:08:40,755 --> 01:08:43,154
So any way you look at it,
I'm in the shit.

591
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:47,950
Well, go on, then. What did he say?

592
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,661
We gonna die up here or what?

593
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:53,372
All men die, my friend.

594
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:57,334
But Allah says it is what we do
before we die that counts.

595
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:01,401
Jet stream's rising. I'd say
all clear for the next 48 hours.

596
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:04,321
Wick, do you copy?

597
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:05,572
Copy.

598
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,117
Pressure's up. You have clear skies
and light winds. Over.

599
01:09:09,325 --> 01:09:10,785
How long will it last?

600
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:12,975
You're good for the next 48 hours.

601
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:15,373
What is your exact position? Over.

602
01:09:15,582 --> 01:09:19,127
The rock wall, about 400 feet
above Negrotto Col.

603
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:21,421
I thought you'd be at the top by now.

604
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:26,217
Yeah, so did I. What's the status
at 26,000? How's the girl?

605
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:30,597
As far as I can tell, okay.
McLaren's serious. Internal injuries.

606
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:32,056
And Vaughn?

607
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:33,829
No word.

608
01:09:34,038 --> 01:09:35,602
Keep me informed.

609
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:40,398
What is this with you and Vaughn?

610
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:44,360
You're too slow, Mr. Garrett.
You've gotta move faster.

611
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,721
Take your hands off me.

612
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:54,162
It's not your concern.

613
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,081
If it involves my sister,
it's my concern.

614
01:09:57,498 --> 01:10:00,522
I made it clear.
No arguments, no questions.

615
01:10:03,025 --> 01:10:05,423
Look, if you've got another agenda...

616
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,759
...why don't you go back?
I don't need you.

617
01:10:13,347 --> 01:10:16,163
Your sister will be dead in 14 hours.

618
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:22,940
Good luck.

619
01:10:29,718 --> 01:10:31,699
I've got you. I've got you.

620
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:37,642
You're as crazy as your old man.

621
01:10:47,652 --> 01:10:49,842
You did the right thing
to cut the rope.

622
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:54,743
Any good climber would have.

623
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:58,809
If Royce had had the knife,
he'd have done it himself.

624
01:11:38,953 --> 01:11:41,143
I just got some spindrift in my lungs.

625
01:11:55,636 --> 01:11:58,764
Summit team, this is alpha team.
Do you read?

626
01:11:58,973 --> 01:12:02,727
This is summit team. Come in, alpha.
This is summit team.

627
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,916
Annie Garrett, is that you?

628
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:07,106
It's Elliot Vaughn. Who's this?

629
01:12:07,732 --> 01:12:09,087
Montgomery Wick.

630
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:15,031
-How many are you?
-Three teams, different routes.

631
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:17,637
I'm with Peter Garrett.

632
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:19,827
I thought you only climbed solo.

633
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:23,059
Rescue missions are different.

634
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:26,083
What's your location?

635
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:29,628
West ridge, 23,000.

636
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:32,444
You'll have to climb faster.

637
01:12:33,174 --> 01:12:35,989
Tell Garrett Annie has edema.
That'll speed him up.

638
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:38,283
Wick! Wick, this is Annie Garrett!

639
01:12:39,534 --> 01:12:42,975
Wick! Do you read, Wick?

640
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:01,014
She needs dex.

641
01:13:01,848 --> 01:13:03,933
It's too soon. She'll have to wait.

642
01:13:07,061 --> 01:13:08,104
Annie.

643
01:13:09,772 --> 01:13:10,815
Get it.

644
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:14,569
I told you.

645
01:13:15,716 --> 01:13:18,323
I told you not to let her
give it to you.

646
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:22,493
You saddled up that pony,
now she can ride it.

647
01:13:24,162 --> 01:13:25,413
Vaughn, you're not sick!

648
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:26,977
Not yet.

649
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:28,958
We hold to the schedule.

650
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:33,233
-It's the only way to stay alive.
-For you, maybe.

651
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:39,802
You know, Tom, intelligence doesn't
threaten me. Stupidity does.

652
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:42,096
You arrogant prick!

653
01:13:44,912 --> 01:13:47,205
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

654
01:13:48,352 --> 01:13:49,812
You were the leader, Tom.

655
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:58,571
He's right.

656
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:02,220
None of us are gonna make it.

657
01:14:03,993 --> 01:14:05,661
You want to survive?

658
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:07,747
Go and get it.

659
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:16,922
That's what I thought.

660
01:15:09,683 --> 01:15:11,143
Use your ax!

661
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:04,425
Cyril!

662
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:06,927
-Cyril!
-I'm here!

663
01:16:10,577 --> 01:16:12,141
I'm coming!

664
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:19,961
It's coming through!

665
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:22,985
Hang on! It's gonna be okay!

666
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,070
Just hang on.

667
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:48,531
That's all there is.

668
01:18:16,535 --> 01:18:18,204
You see the rocks to your left?

669
01:18:19,976 --> 01:18:22,166
Yeah, I can see them!

670
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:24,877
I'm gonna swing you.

671
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:48,397
Look out!

672
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:17,906
Cyril! Cyril, are you there?
Peter, are you there?

673
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:19,991
Malcolm! This is Peter!

674
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,868
I repeat, this is Peter.

675
01:20:22,702 --> 01:20:27,082
-It wasn't us!
-Cyril, you answer me, you bastard!

676
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,760
Cyril!

677
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:41,158
Are you there?

678
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,182
Cyril!

679
01:20:45,016 --> 01:20:47,310
Damn it, you answer me!

680
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,604
Nag, nag, nag.

681
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:52,315
They always bloody nag.

682
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,192
You're sick.

683
01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:40,175
They could still be alive.

684
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,052
I'm going back.

685
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:47,370
Mr. Garrett.

686
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:52,583
Your sister has pulmonary edema.
We don't have the time.

687
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,398
Monique and Cyril are question marks.

688
01:21:56,232 --> 01:21:57,275
Your sister is not.

689
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,656
Bro, I'm sorry.

690
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:27,201
We gotta go.

691
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:06,630
You gotta straighten it.

692
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:13,929
Go ahead.

693
01:25:19,872 --> 01:25:21,540
It'll be fine. Just look me--

694
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,356
Don't bullshit me, Peter.
I'm a nurse.

695
01:25:31,863 --> 01:25:33,323
Where were you going?

696
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:38,328
-What are you talking about?
-Where will you go with the money?

697
01:25:38,536 --> 01:25:39,892
Anywhere!

698
01:25:46,565 --> 01:25:47,816
Tell me.

699
01:25:53,968 --> 01:25:55,220
Paris.

700
01:25:55,428 --> 01:25:58,139
I did two years of premed.
I want to finish it.

701
01:26:01,372 --> 01:26:03,040
Any career worth this?

702
01:26:06,064 --> 01:26:09,713
Two years on Everest, three at K2.
I've had enough.

703
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:14,718
Skip makes the Pakistanis look
well-organized, plus he's sexist.

704
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:20,349
-How long you been sleeping with him?
-Two years, and screw--

705
01:27:04,976 --> 01:27:06,332
My friend...

706
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:10,086
...I think you should turn back.

707
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:15,418
Wick, do you copy?

708
01:29:16,878 --> 01:29:19,485
Wick, this is base camp. Do you copy?

709
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:21,779
Come in, base.

710
01:29:21,987 --> 01:29:24,073
The nitro reacts to the sun.

711
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:25,741
Get the nitro out of the sun.

712
01:29:26,262 --> 01:29:28,661
Get that goddamn pack out of the sun!

713
01:29:29,078 --> 01:29:30,225
It's gonna blow!

714
01:29:30,642 --> 01:29:31,893
It's gonna blow!

715
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,770
Get the pack in the shade!

716
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:38,254
The nitro! It's gonna blow!
Get it out of the sun!

717
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:43,467
In the shade! There it is!

718
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:50,870
Malcolm! Can you hear me?

719
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:53,060
It's not their call time!

720
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:54,520
Malcolm, do you read?!

721
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:58,795
You take the shoulder.
I'll try the ridge.

722
01:29:59,837 --> 01:30:00,984
Malcolm!

723
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:36,749
Malcolm!

724
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:39,356
Kareem!

725
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,110
Malcolm! Kareem! Can you hear me?!

726
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:46,655
You guys! Your radio!

727
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:48,949
Turn on your radio!

728
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:07,717
Come in, Peter.

729
01:31:10,116 --> 01:31:11,158
Are you listening?

730
01:31:11,367 --> 01:31:13,765
Malcolm, get the nitro into the shade!

731
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:20,855
Please, Peter, repeat.
I don't understand.

732
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:25,443
Get the nitro into the shade right now
orit will blow! Do you understand?

733
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:48,502
Don't touch her.

734
01:35:00,448 --> 01:35:02,221
Is this what you're looking for?

735
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:09,833
Four years ago, an American team
got blown off the mountain.

736
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:11,605
She was the guide.

737
01:35:12,648 --> 01:35:15,255
What happened?
She take shelter with Vaughn?

738
01:35:16,402 --> 01:35:20,364
Twenty-four, thirty-six hours.
I figure she died of edema.

739
01:35:20,572 --> 01:35:22,345
If only she'd had dex.

740
01:35:22,554 --> 01:35:25,890
-You're wasting time.
-You think he used it for himself?

741
01:35:26,724 --> 01:35:29,123
-Answer me, damn it!
-Of course he did!

742
01:35:32,981 --> 01:35:34,440
How long have you known?

743
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:37,777
At the interview,
he said the dex got swept away.

744
01:35:37,986 --> 01:35:40,384
That was a lie.
She always carried it on her.

745
01:35:42,991 --> 01:35:44,242
Four years, Wick?

746
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,953
The mountain owns him.
He had to come back.

747
01:35:49,351 --> 01:35:50,811
Now you're gonna kill him.

748
01:35:51,436 --> 01:35:52,896
My wife died of edema.

749
01:35:53,105 --> 01:35:56,129
Skin stripped from her throat,
lungs filled with water.

750
01:35:56,337 --> 01:36:00,821
She drowned in her own bodily fluids.
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

751
01:36:02,385 --> 01:36:03,636
I can't let you do it.

752
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,911
Do you know where you are?

753
01:36:08,015 --> 01:36:11,561
Above 24,000, you're at the
vertical limit, you're already dying.

754
01:36:11,769 --> 01:36:14,793
Look at you. You can hardly stand.

755
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,547
If you think you can stop me,
go ahead.

756
01:37:20,066 --> 01:37:22,986
Peter. Are you there?

757
01:37:23,507 --> 01:37:24,862
Peter.

758
01:37:25,175 --> 01:37:26,844
Annie. Annie, is it you?

759
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:29,555
Annie. Annie, what is it?

760
01:37:32,474 --> 01:37:33,725
Where are you?

761
01:37:36,436 --> 01:37:38,105
Five hours away.

762
01:37:40,607 --> 01:37:42,380
I want you to go back.

763
01:37:43,735 --> 01:37:46,446
Don't risk it. There's no reason.

764
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,868
I won't be here and neither will Tom.

765
01:37:56,873 --> 01:37:57,812
How long?

766
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,817
An hour. Two at the most.

767
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:10,846
Peter. Peter!

768
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:12,514
I'm here, Annie.

769
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:21,481
I've been thinking.

770
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,799
I've been thinking a lot about Dad.

771
01:38:31,595 --> 01:38:33,785
We shouldn't have gotten him a grave.

772
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:39,103
We should have come up here
together with his ashes.

773
01:38:43,795 --> 01:38:46,089
He said this is where he was happiest.

774
01:38:48,174 --> 01:38:49,321
He was a climber.

775
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:53,492
I think every real climber
would want to stay on the mountain.

776
01:38:59,436 --> 01:39:00,791
What do you think?

777
01:39:05,796 --> 01:39:07,986
I think we'll come back some day.

778
01:39:09,863 --> 01:39:11,322
The two of us.

779
01:39:12,574 --> 01:39:13,825
For Dad.

780
01:39:16,849 --> 01:39:18,621
I would've liked that.

781
01:39:20,498 --> 01:39:23,209
-I'm coming to get you, Annie.
-No, don't.

782
01:39:23,418 --> 01:39:25,920
Promise me. I don't want you to die.

783
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:29,153
-I don't care!
-Don't put me through it, understand?

784
01:39:29,882 --> 01:39:31,029
Please.

785
01:39:32,281 --> 01:39:33,323
Just...

786
01:39:34,783 --> 01:39:36,347
...please don't.

787
01:39:37,598 --> 01:39:38,745
Please.

788
01:39:41,352 --> 01:39:43,020
Good night, Peter.

789
01:39:44,585 --> 01:39:45,940
I love you.

790
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:08,209
Are you gonna kill me now?

791
01:41:09,356 --> 01:41:10,607
Yes.

792
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,840
Bastard!

793
01:44:28,616 --> 01:44:29,659
Are you ready?

794
01:44:30,076 --> 01:44:32,996
I can't get them to melt.
They're frozen.

795
01:44:34,247 --> 01:44:36,541
-Boil the water!
-With what?

796
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:16,476
Easy.

797
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,292
Easy.

798
01:45:23,254 --> 01:45:24,401
Wait.

799
01:45:27,633 --> 01:45:29,406
Okay. Keep feeding it.

800
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,127
Keep it coming.

801
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:48,175
Stop! It's leaking!

802
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:52,241
We can try and push it through
before it rips.

803
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:53,805
On three.

804
01:45:54,744 --> 01:45:56,516
One, two, three!

805
01:49:03,473 --> 01:49:05,141
Annie!

806
01:49:05,662 --> 01:49:07,539
Annie!

807
01:53:13,721 --> 01:53:15,076
Hold it! Hold it!

808
01:54:00,538 --> 01:54:01,789
No! No!

809
01:54:50,796 --> 01:54:52,048
How is she?

810
01:54:54,133 --> 01:54:55,384
Amazing.

811
01:54:57,157 --> 01:54:59,242
Talk about a will to live.

812
01:55:49,396 --> 01:55:52,003
-That's not a song.
-That's definitely a song.

813
01:55:52,212 --> 01:55:53,671
No way that's a song.

814
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,757
That's a good song.

815
01:55:57,217 --> 01:55:59,406
A winning song, by the sound of it.

816
01:56:00,032 --> 01:56:01,700
I think you're making it up.

817
01:56:08,165 --> 01:56:10,563
That was a hell of a thing
you did up there.

818
01:56:11,397 --> 01:56:13,274
Anybody else would've given up.

819
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,924
Not everybody.

820
01:56:18,175 --> 01:56:19,843
He'd be proud of you.

821
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,805
Angry, but really proud.
