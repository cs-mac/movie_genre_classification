I'm afraid it's damn low waterwith me.

496
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:40,497
-I'm afraid I'm short, sir.
-Take it.

497
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,832
How embarrassing.

498
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:46,665
Yeh!

499
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,905
Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy?

500
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:58,680
Was I deficient in propriety?

501
00:43:01,377 --> 00:43:03,447
Why did you do that?

502
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,556
Couldn't waste
all those expensive boxing lessons.

503
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,189
Forgive me if I suspect in you a sense of justice.

504
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:15,032
(CHUCKLING)

505
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:21,898
I am a lawyer. Justice plays no part in the law.

506
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,240
Is that what you believe?

507
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,739
I believe it. I must.

508
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:35,220
I beg your leave.

509
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:48,101
-Her heart is stirred.
-It's a summer squall.

510
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:54,636
Mr Lefroy will soon be gone.
And Mr Wisley will still be waiting, I hope.

511
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:58,635
-The man's a booby.
-Oh, he will grow out ofthat.

512
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,446
And she could fix him with very little trouble.

513
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,408
You could persuade her.

514
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,012
To sacrifice her happiness?

515
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,615
Jane should have not the man
who offers the best price, but the man she wants.

516
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,287
Oh, Mr Austen.

517
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,921
Must we have this conversation
day in and day out?

518
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,300
We'll end up in the gutter ifwe carry on like this.

519
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:42,114
MRS AUSTEN: Jenny! Mr Austen!

520
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,522
Where are you?

(DOORBELL DINGS)

522
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,051
So kind ofyou to return the call.

523
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,588
-Will you take a dish oftea, ma'am?
-Green tea?

524
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,897
-Brown, Your Ladyship.
-Then no.

525
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,864
Where is your youngest daughter?

526
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,911
She's visiting the poor, ma'am.

527
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,625
Jane? Jane!

528
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:01,799
At last. Lady Gresham and Mr Wisley
have come to call. Where have you been?

529
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,195
Ma'am. Sir.

530
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:11,468
Well, perhaps... Perhaps the young people
would like to take a walk?

531
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:15,381
I see there's a pretty little wilderness
at the side of the house.

532
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,384
Excuse me.

533
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,290
Jane?

534
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,128
-What is she doing?
-Writing.

535
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,124
Can anything be done about it?

536
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:43,000
Miss Austen, you may know

537
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,003
that I have known you

538
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:50,073
for some considerable time
during my visits to Steventon.

539
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,817
The garden is so affecting in this season.

540
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:56,986
Indeed.

541
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,657
-The impression you have given me has always...
-The flowers particularly.

542
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,690
What I'm trying to say is that I...

543
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,126
I have a respectable property of 2,000 a year

544
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,029
in addition to even greater expectations
as Lady Gresham's heir,

545
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:15,933
-to which it may be indelicate to refer.
-Oh, indelicate, yes.

546
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,937
It's yours. Ifwe marry, all of it, yours.

547
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,278
Mr Wisley...

548
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:36,552
Your offer is most sincere, I can see,
and gentlemanlike, and it honours me, truly.

549
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:43,066
But for all you are, and all you offer, I...

550
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,364
Yes.

551
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,243
(CLEARS THROAT)

552
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,148
Sometimes affection is a shy flower
that takes time to blossom.

553
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:13,157
Lying to tradesmen,
mending, scratching, scraping.

554
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:16,661
Endlessly, endlessly making do!

555
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,264
I understand
that our circumstances are difficult, ma'am.

556
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:23,535
-There is no money for you.
-Surely something could be done.

557
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:28,406
What we can put by must go to your brothers.
You will have nothing, unless you marry.

558
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:32,110
Well, then, I will have nothing. For I will not
marry without affection, like my mother!

559
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,386
And now I have to dig my own damn potatoes!

560
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:50,470
Would you rather be a poor old maid?
Ridiculous, despised, the butt of jokes?

561
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:55,468
The legitimate sport of any village lout
with a stone and an impudent tongue?

562
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,448
Affection is desirable.

563
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:10,624
Money is absolutely indispensable.

564
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,127

-I could live by my...
-Pen?

567
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:33,004
Let's knock that notion on the head
once and for all.

568
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,346
What's this?

569
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,147
Trouble amongst my women?

570
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:40,148
Come,

571
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,448
take hands and there's an end.

572
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:46,986
-Where are you going? Miss!
-To feed the pigs, ma'am.

573
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,975
He could give you a splendid home.

574
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,981
-A comfortable life.
-Father.

575
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:13,713
Consider.

576
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,720
This is likely to be your best offer.

577
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,623
Wisley?

578
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,221
It is true, so far he has not impressed...

579
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:26,634
-A booby.
-He should grow out ofthat.

580
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,848
Nothing destroys spirit

581
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,043
like poverty.

582
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,900
I saw Queen Marie Antoinette
wear something the same at a ball once.

583
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:06,570
Am I making a show? I am, I know.

584
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,371
What trouble we take to make them like us
when we like them.

585
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,409
Henry?

586
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:25,254
-Eliza, my brother is much younger than you.
-And poorer.

587
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:30,896
He knows that I care for him sincerely.

588
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,424
I know that he is handsome...

589
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,527
And the handsome young men must have
something to live on as well as the plain.

590
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,863
You encourage him to take you for money?

591
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,299
-Men do.
-That does not make it honourable.

592
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,142
Well, I'm a sensible woman.

593
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,740
I thank God I am not, by your description.

594
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:52,477
Ifyou were, you might have ascertained
that your Irish friend has no money, not a penny

595
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,253
and could not be expected to marry without it.

596
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:58,221
Consider that at the ball tonight.

597
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:04,564
In any event, he'll be gone tomorrow back
to Bond Street where he can do no more harm.

598
00:53:57,803 --> 00:53:59,646
Good evening, Miss Austen.

599
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,109
Yes, yes.

600
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,258
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

601
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:18,681
Miss Jane Austen.

to be here at your aunt's ball.

00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:26,985
TOM: You dance with passion.

605
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:33,188
No sensible woman would demonstrate passion
ifthe purpose were to attract a husband.

606
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:38,996
-As opposed to a lover?
-Hmm.

607
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:46,299
Rest easy, Mr Lefroy.

608
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:48,835
-I have no expectation on either account.
-I did not mean to offend or hurt...

609
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:53,374
Oh, no, no, of course not.
Excuse me, I'm just overwarm.

610
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,277
Pardon me.

611
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:09,298
-Ah, Miss Austen.
-Excuse me.

612
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:49,195
HENRY: This is unbearable.
My father is pressing for an early ordination,

613
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:54,834
while my own inclination is to the scarlet of
a captaincy in His Majesty's regulars.

614
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:58,543
But I do not have the money to purchase one.

615
00:58:59,872 --> 00:59:01,214
I do.

616
00:59:03,075 --> 00:59:08,684
-Well, that, of course is impossible.
-Oh, Henry, do not disguise yourself, not to me.

617
00:59:12,919 --> 00:59:16,730
The scarlet will suit you very well.

618
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:22,299
Miss Austen? There you are.

619
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:37,244
Miss Austen, I cannot believe I am obliged
to have this conversation.

620
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:39,781
Your Ladyship?

621
00:59:41,314 --> 00:59:45,489
Mr Wisley's mother,
my own dear sister, died young.

622
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,664
I have no children of my own.

623
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:53,430
I hope you never come to understand
the pain ofthat condition.

624
00:59:55,229 --> 01:00:00,678
Let us simply say my nephew's wishes
are close to my heart,

625
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,813
however extraordinary they may be.

626
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:09,278
Well,

627
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:12,750
your health seems robust.

628
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:16,485
You have the usual accomplishments.

629
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:20,188
Your person is agreeable.

630
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:28,195
But when a young woman such as yourself
receives the addresses

631
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:33,770
from a gentleman such as my nephew,
it is her duty to accept at once.

632
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:36,473
But what do we find?

633
01:00:38,438 --> 01:00:40,440
-Independent thought?
-Exactly.

634
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:47,281
My nephew, Miss Austen, condescends far indeed

635
01:00:47,547 --> 01:00:52,386
in offering to the daughter of an obscure
and impecunious clergyman.

636
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:56,061
Impecunious? Your Ladyship is mistaken.

637
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,031
I am never mistaken.

638
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:03,975
Your father is in grave financial difficulties.

639
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:07,044
But all is not lost.

640
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:12,313
He has a daughter
upon whom fortune has smiled.

641
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:31,493
Mr Wisley is a good opportunity for Jane.

642
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:35,169
She should accept him at once.

643
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,903
Do not you think?

644
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:43,873
-Lucy, let us take some refreshments.
-What? Mother.

645
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:13,706
I have learned of Mr Wisley's marriage proposal.

646
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:16,803
My congratulations.

647
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:22,910
Is there an alternative for
a well-educated young woman of small fortune?

648
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,985
How can you have him?

649
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:29,383
Even with his thousands and his houses,

650
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:33,626
how can you, of all people,
dispose ofyourselfwithout affection?

651
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:40,131
How can I dispose of myselfwith it?

652
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:45,167
You are leaving tomorrow.

653
01:03:22,536 --> 01:03:25,710
-Did I do that well?
-Very, very well.

654
01:03:26,673 --> 01:03:31,178
I wanted, just once, to do it well.

655

I am entirely dependent
upon that bizarre old lunatic, my uncle.

But you must know what I feel.

01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,003
Jane, I'm yours.

660
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:57,577
Gah, I'm yours. I'm yours, heart and soul.

661
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,843
Much good that is.

662
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:04,979
Let me decide that.

663
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:06,514
(MEN LAUGHING)

664
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,086
What will we do?

665
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:16,497
What we must.

666
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:28,469

-Welcome...
-Madame Ie Comtesse.

681
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:26,798
Madame le Comtesse. Seldom, too seldom,
my house receives the presence of nobility.

682
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:29,971
And, of course, its friends. Please.

683
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:34,304
Your stay is short. There's not a moment to lose.

684
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:40,383
My nephew has devised a plan
of metropolitan amusement.

685
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:45,212
Pleasure is, as you would say, Madame, his forte.

ELIZA: Ah, is it?

687
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:51,552
Which battle was it, Tom?

ViIIers-en-Cauchies.

689
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:57,725
Very good.
Thousands slain. Served those Frenchies out.

690
01:05:57,725 --> 01:06:02,163
Oh. Saving your presence, ma'am.

691
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:05,333
Be not afraid of abusing
the Jacobins on my account, Judge.

692
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:09,337
-They guillotined my husband.
-Oh, savages. Beasts.

693
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:11,544
-And his property?
-Confiscated.

694
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,375
A disaster.

(LAUGHING)

699
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:28,022
Do I detect you in irony?

700
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:37,605
It is my considered opinion
that irony is insult with a smiling face.

701
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:40,068
HENRY: (LAUGHING) Indeed.

702
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:42,271
No.

703
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:45,508
No?

704
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:51,286
No, irony is the bringing together
of contradictory truths

705
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:55,583
to make out of the contradiction a new truth
with a laugh or a smile,

706
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:59,587
and I confess that a truth
must come with one or the other,

707
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:04,365
or I account it as false and a denial
ofthe very nature of humanity itself.

708
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,272
(CHUCKLES)

709
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:15,470
My cousin is a writer.

710
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:19,415
-Ofwhat?
-Jane?

711
01:07:22,943 --> 01:07:24,046
Novels.

712
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,617
A young woman offamily?

713
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:34,765
Yes, uncle, and tomorrow
we go and visit another, Mrs Radcliffe.

714
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:39,427
She keeps herselfto herself, almost a recluse,
but I know her husband through the law.

715
01:07:39,427 --> 01:07:42,897
-Who?
-The authoress, Mrs Radcliffe.

716
01:07:43,264 --> 01:07:46,067
-As writing is her profession.
-Herwhat?

717
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:48,836
Â£500, uncle, for the last novel,
The Mysteries of UdoIpho.

718
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:51,605
-And Â£800, I believe, for her next.
-The ItaIian.

719
01:07:51,605 --> 01:07:53,745
Above Â£1 ,000?

720
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:59,757
The times, the times.

721
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:16,298
You live so quietly.

722
01:08:16,298 --> 01:08:20,837
And yet your novels are filled
with romance, danger, terror.

723
01:08:23,004 --> 01:08:24,949
Everything my life is not.

724
01:08:27,309 --> 01:08:28,480
Apparently.

725
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,222
Ofwhat do you wish to write?

726
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:35,326
Of the heart.

727
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:38,157
Do you know it?

728
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,800
Not all of it.

729
01:08:41,957 --> 01:08:43,731
In time, you will.

730
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:49,040
But even ifthat fails,
that's what the imagination is for.

731
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:56,545
Your imagination has brought you independence.

732
01:08:58,373 --> 01:09:02,252
At a cost to myself and to my husband.

733
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:04,918
Poor William.

734
01:09:05,914 --> 01:09:08,817
To have a wife who has a mind
is considered not quite proper.

735
01:09:08,817 --> 01:09:12,924
To have a wife with a literary reputation
nothing short of scandalous.

736
01:09:18,326 --> 01:09:20,362
But it must be possible?

737
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:24,103
-To live as both wife and author?
-Oh.

738
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,340
I think so.

739
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,780
Though never easy.

Good night.

and that you be there hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

824
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:19,853
So, the infamous Mrs Radcliffe.

825
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:23,161
Was she really as gothic as her novels?

826
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,392
Not in externals,

827
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:31,428
but her inner landscape is quite picturesque,
I suspect.

828
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,998
True of us all.

for Reverend Austen.

830

-Thank you.

835
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:32,448
It seemed he died very soon
after landing in San Domingo.

836
01:24:32,744 --> 01:24:35,019
My God, he was hardly there.

837
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:37,892
What was the disease?

838
01:24:39,184 --> 01:24:42,961
Yellow fever. Lord Craven, he wrote.

839
01:24:43,388 --> 01:24:46,758
He said that if he had known
he was engaged to be married,

840
01:24:46,758 --> 01:24:49,067
he would never have taken him.

841
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:58,910
Jane, there's something else.

842
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:02,981
Mr Lefroy, Tom.

843
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:06,213
What?

844
01:25:06,978 --> 01:25:09,981
I would keep this from you if I could.

845
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:13,128
He's here visiting Mrs Lefroy and I...

846
01:25:13,251 --> 01:25:14,923
He is engaged.

847
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:26,636
So soon?

848
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:01,505
A letter?

849
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:05,006
No.

850
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,175
It's something I began in London.

851
01:26:12,577 --> 01:26:15,614
It is the tale of a young woman.

852
01:26:16,314 --> 01:26:17,986
Two young women.

853
01:26:20,318 --> 01:26:22,354
Better than their circumstances.

854
01:26:22,787 --> 01:26:24,355
So many are.

855
01:26:24,355 --> 01:26:27,335
And two young gentlemen who receive

856
01:26:27,826 --> 01:26:31,136
much better than their deserts
as so very many do.

857
01:26:33,264 --> 01:26:34,504
Mmm.

858
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,679
How does the story begin?

859
01:26:41,272 --> 01:26:42,841
-Badly.
-And then?

860
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:44,513
It gets worse.

861
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:48,188
With, I hope, some humour.

862
01:26:54,052 --> 01:26:55,690
How does it end?

863
01:27:01,726 --> 01:27:04,229
They both make triumphant, happy endings.

864
01:27:06,497 --> 01:27:08,169
Brilliant marriages?

865
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,643
Incandescent marriages

866
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:14,978
to very rich men.

867
01:27:27,986 --> 01:27:31,490
You asked me a question.

868
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:37,166
I am ready to give you an answer.
But there is one matter to be settled.

869
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:43,174
I cannot make you out, Mr Wisley.

870
01:27:45,203 --> 01:27:46,910
At times, you are

871
01:27:47,873 --> 01:27:51,076
the most gentlemanlike man I know
and yet you would...

872
01:27:51,076 --> 01:27:53,852
"Yet". What a sad word.

873
01:27:54,914 --> 01:27:59,760
And yet, you write yourself
most tellingly to great effect.

874
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,623
-I'm speaking, of course, ofyour letter.
-What letter?

875
01:28:04,623 --> 01:28:07,899
Was your aunt the correspondent on your behalf?

876
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:11,408
What matter?

877
01:28:12,398 --> 01:28:14,934
One way or another,
passion makes fools of us all.

878
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:17,436
I hope, in time,
passion may regain your better opinion.

879
01:28:17,436 --> 01:28:19,415
The emotion is absurd.

880
01:28:20,372 --> 01:28:23,309
When you consider
the sex to whom it is often directed,

881
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:25,721
indistinguishable from folly.

882
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:31,820
I thank you for the honour ofyour proposal.
I accept. Good day.

883
01:28:58,844 --> 01:29:00,414

884
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,683
Mr Wisley is... He's an honourable man.

885
01:29:04,683 --> 01:29:06,856
You'll always have a place with me.

Sir.

890
01:29:32,144 --> 01:29:35,614
I believe I must congratulate you, Mr Lefroy.

891
01:29:37,316 --> 01:29:41,320
And you've come to visit an old friend
at such a time. How considerate.

892
01:29:47,826 --> 01:29:51,063
I have come

893
01:29:51,063 --> 01:29:54,009
to offer an explanation, belatedly,

894
01:29:55,134 --> 01:29:59,171
for my conduct. I cannot think how to describe it.

895
01:29:59,171 --> 01:30:01,742
Tell me about your lady, Mr Lefroy.

896
01:30:03,042 --> 01:30:05,112
From where does she come?

897
01:30:07,179 --> 01:30:09,352
She's from County Wexford.

898
01:30:09,715 --> 01:30:12,718
Your own country. Excellent.

899
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:20,569
What was it that won her?
Your manner, smiles and pleasing address?

900
01:30:26,465 --> 01:30:29,445
No, no, not at all.

901
01:30:29,601 --> 01:30:36,241
No, had I really experienced that emotion,
I should, at present, detest the very sight of him.

902
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:38,210
And you are mistaken.

903
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:42,781
I'm even impartial towards
the gloriously endowed Miss Wexford...

904
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:44,453
I cannot do this.

905
01:30:54,426 --> 01:30:56,633
And so you would marry Wisley?

906
01:31:02,134 --> 01:31:03,908
(WHISPERS) Please?

907
01:31:07,072 --> 01:31:11,176
If there is a shred of truth
or justice inside ofyou,

908
01:31:11,176 --> 01:31:13,479
-you cannot marry him.
-Oh no, Mr Lefroy.

909
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:16,515
Justice, by your own admission,
you know little of, truth even less.

910
01:31:16,515 --> 01:31:21,122

I have tried and I cannot live this lie.

Can you?

912
01:31:24,523 --> 01:31:26,935
Jane, can you?

913
01:31:30,996 --> 01:31:34,636
What value will there be in life
ifwe are not together?

914
01:31:42,107 --> 01:31:43,984

by Friday be in Scotland, and man and wife.

-Leave everything?
-Everything.

922
01:32:33,193 --> 01:32:35,935
A lifetime of drudgery on a pittance?

01:32:36,663 --> 01:32:40,042
A child every year
and no means to lighten the load?

-I do not know.

01:39:54,969 --> 01:39:56,638
I will never give you up.

993
01:39:56,638 --> 01:40:00,677
-Tom...
-Don't speak or think.

994
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:05,218
Just love me. Do you love me?

995
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:08,721
Yes.

996
01:40:10,551 --> 01:40:14,396
But if our love destroys your family,
it will destroy itself.

997
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:16,099
-No.
-Yes.

998
01:40:16,991 --> 01:40:21,329
In a long, slow degradation
of guilt and regret and blame.

999
01:40:21,329 --> 01:40:22,864
That is nonsense.

1000
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,374
Truth.

1001
01:40:28,569 --> 01:40:30,343
Made from contradiction.

1002
01:40:33,908 --> 01:40:36,285
But it must come with a smile.

1003
01:40:37,378 --> 01:40:42,020
Or else I shall count it as false
and we shall have had no love at all.

1004
01:40:46,888 --> 01:40:49,095
Please.

1005
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,438
Goodbye.

1006
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:17,589
Typical bloody runaway. "Will I, won't I?"

1007
01:41:37,638 --> 01:41:40,015
Miss. Miss.

1008
01:41:44,846 --> 01:41:46,518
All right, offyou go.

1009
01:42:49,977 --> 01:42:52,650
(CLOCK TICKING)

1010
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:08,737
Hello?

1011
01:43:13,034 --> 01:43:17,004
-Where is everyone?
-Looking for you, Miss. Looking everywhere.

1012
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:20,109
-Thank you, Jenny.
-Mr Warren.

1013
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:28,020
Your family tried to keep the matter
from the servants, but...

1014
01:43:29,684 --> 01:43:33,421
Where is that blackguard Lefroy?
My God, if Henry finds him, he'll kill him.

1015
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:35,093
He won't find him.

1016
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:38,297
If he does, he won't kill him.

1017
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,433
There's no need.

1018
01:43:43,565 --> 01:43:46,841
What happened?

1019
01:43:49,104 --> 01:43:50,776
Nothing happened.

1020
01:43:52,908 --> 01:43:56,082
I see. I see.

1021
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:07,528
Jane,

1022
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:13,838
I may have less personal charm than Lefroy.

1023
01:44:14,997 --> 01:44:21,370
Superficial charm to some eyes.
To others, it is mere affectation, but I...

1024
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:23,816
-I have no hopes.
-Hopes?

1025
01:44:25,841 --> 01:44:28,685
You cannot begin to imagine.

1026
01:44:29,044 --> 01:44:32,320
Thank you for the great honour ofyour offer,

1027
01:44:33,615 --> 01:44:36,220
but are there no otherwomen in Hampshire?

1028
01:44:57,139 --> 01:44:59,516
It was you who wrote the judge.

1029
01:45:04,246 --> 01:45:07,716
You must consider
how much I have always loved you.

1030
01:45:29,237 --> 01:45:31,546
(PLAYING SLOW SONG ON PIANO)

1031
01:45:56,198 --> 01:45:57,574
Well?

1032
01:46:02,437 --> 01:46:04,382
You came back to us.

1033
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:33,909
Leave it.

1034
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:41,910
Mr Austen, I must inform you
that I shall not attend service today.

1035
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:44,780
-Not in the presence ofthis young woman.
-Indeed...

1036
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,982
-If I must speak plainly...
-Aunt.

1037
01:46:46,982 --> 01:46:51,186
I believe your youngest daughter
has been on a journey.

1038
01:46:51,186 --> 01:46:55,991
-Her Ladyship considers travel a crime?
-Unsanctioned travel.

1039
01:46:55,991 --> 01:47:00,195
Furthermore, be aware that my nephew
has withdrawn his addresses

1040
01:47:00,195 --> 01:47:04,165
to someone without family, fortune, importance

1041
01:47:05,033 --> 01:47:08,537
and fatally tainted by suspicion.

1042
01:47:08,537 --> 01:47:13,713
-Oh, she has family, madam.
-REVEREND AUSTEN: Indeed she has.

1043
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:19,390
Importance may depend upon other matters
than Your Ladyship can conceive.

1044
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:24,190
As to fortune, a young woman
might depend upon herself.

1045
01:47:26,621 --> 01:47:29,124
An interesting notion, Miss Austen.

1046
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:31,831
(EXCLAIMING)

1047
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:40,371
Oblige me a walk along the river
to enlarge upon the topic.

1048
01:47:42,672 --> 01:47:43,980
Wisley?

1049
01:47:51,714 --> 01:47:56,686
I am sorry if my conduct
has disappointed you, Mr Wisley.

1050
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:01,991
It seems you cannot bring yourself
to marry without affection.

1051
01:48:01,991 --> 01:48:03,697
Or even with it.

1052
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:09,369
I respect you for that
and share your opinion. Neither can I.

1053
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:15,238
I'd always hoped to win your love in time,

1054
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:19,108
but I am vain enough to want to be loved
for myself rather than my money.

1055
01:48:19,108 --> 01:48:21,110
Do we part as friends?

1056
01:48:23,112 --> 01:48:24,556
We do.

1057
01:48:27,783 --> 01:48:30,422
-So, you will live...
-By my pen. Yes.

1058
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:37,962
Will all your stories have happy endings?

1059
01:48:38,694 --> 01:48:40,605
My characters will have,

1060
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:43,539
after a little bit oftrouble,

1061
01:48:44,934 --> 01:48:47,107
all that they desire.

1062
01:48:49,472 --> 01:48:52,418
The good do not always come to good ends.

1063
01:48:54,911 --> 01:48:57,721
It is a truth universally acknowledged.

1064
01:48:59,048 --> 01:49:02,051
JANE: "...that a singIe man
in possession of a good fortune

1065
01:49:02,051 --> 01:49:03,920
"must be in want of a wife."

1066
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,093
(ALL CHEERING)

1067
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:10,259
"However IittIe known the feeIings
or views of such a man may be

1068

"on his first entering a neighbourhood,

1069
01:49:12,728 --> 01:49:16,676
"this truth is so weII fixed

1070
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:23,072
"that he is considered as the rightfuI property
of some one or other of their daughters.

1071

that NetherfieId Park is Iet at Iast?'

1073
01:49:29,478 --> 01:49:31,948

(WOMAN SINGING OPERA)

1076
01:51:26,996 --> 01:51:30,066
Is it Miss Austen? The Miss Austen?

1077
01:51:30,066 --> 01:51:33,602
No, Madam. That courtesy,
according to the customs of precedence,

1078
01:51:33,602 --> 01:51:35,671
belongs to my elder sister.

1079
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:39,509
Miss Jane Austen,
the authoeess of Pride and Prejudice?

1080
01:51:39,509 --> 01:51:43,780
My sisterwishes to remain anonymous,
but your kind regard is much appreciated.

1081
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,657
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1082
01:52:19,516 --> 01:52:21,393
Please, come through.

1083
01:52:22,552 --> 01:52:24,121
I shall never forgive Henry for this.

1084
01:52:24,121 --> 01:52:27,227
Yes, you will.
We always forgive him for everything.

1085
01:52:32,028 --> 01:52:34,474
Jane, an old friend.

1086
01:52:35,365 --> 01:52:37,037
Late as ever.

1087
01:52:38,869 --> 01:52:41,349
Madame le Comtesse, Miss Austen.

1088
01:52:43,807 --> 01:52:45,251
Mr Lefroy.

1089
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:55,051
Please allow me to introduce to you

1090
01:52:55,051 --> 01:52:59,897
your most avid of admirers,
my daughter, Miss Lefroy.

1091
01:53:01,591 --> 01:53:04,731
Miss Austen, what a pleasure to meet you.

1092
01:53:07,164 --> 01:53:09,666
Will you read for us this evening?

1093
01:53:09,666 --> 01:53:12,335
Ah, well, you see, my sister never reads.

1094
01:53:12,335 --> 01:53:15,505
Otherwise, how else is she
supposed to remain anonymous?

1095
01:53:15,505 --> 01:53:17,040
-But...
-Jane.

1096
01:53:25,015 --> 01:53:27,051
I will make an exception

1097
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:30,057
if my new friend wishes it.

1098
01:53:32,355 --> 01:53:34,095
Come, sit by me.

1099
01:53:45,802 --> 01:53:47,645
She is lovely, Tom.

1100
01:53:49,673 --> 01:53:51,584
"She began now to comprehend

1101
01:53:52,809 --> 01:53:56,449
"that he was exactly the man who,
in disposition and talents,

1102
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:58,754
"would most suit her.

1103
01:53:59,649 --> 01:54:03,119
"His understanding and temper,
though unlike her own,

1104
01:54:03,487 --> 01:54:06,126
"would have answered all herwishes.

1105
01:54:08,191 --> 01:54:12,028
"It was an union that must have been
to the advantage of both.

1106
01:54:12,028 --> 01:54:14,231
"By her ease and liveliness,

1107
01:54:14,231 --> 01:54:17,906
"his mind might have been softened,
his manners improved,

1108
01:54:18,468 --> 01:54:23,508
"and from his judgment,
information and knowledge ofthe world,

1109
01:54:24,708 --> 01:54:28,314
"she must have received benefit
of greater importance.

1110
01:54:29,646 --> 01:54:33,753
"But no such happy marriage
could now teach the admiring multitude

1111
01:54:35,519 --> 01:54:39,057
"what connubial felicity really was."
