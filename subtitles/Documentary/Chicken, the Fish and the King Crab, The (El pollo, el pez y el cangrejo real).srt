01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,738
[Engine running]

663
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,723
[Sighs]

664
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:24,989
I saw your son.

665
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,064
What?

666
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,300
The Mitay Pyra.

667
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,236
We swam together at the lake.

668
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,553
-Your dad told me everything.
-Enough, Lala.

669
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:53,026
-You don't have to lie to me.
-I'm not.

670
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,165
-So tell me.
What?

671
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,599
Anything.

672
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,215
He was born at dawn.

673
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,280
[Voice cracking]
He was so weak.

674
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,956
So little.

675
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,723
Everything was hard for him.

676
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,228
Even breathing.

677
01:24:35,774 --> 01:24:37,965
-[Whining]
-He didn't cry.

678
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,078
He opened his mouth,
but made no sound.

679
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,609
[Whining]

680
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:53,116
He was suffocating.

681
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,415
I put him back in the water.

682
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:02,155
I held his little body.

683
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,132
Until he opened his eyes.

684
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,825
His mouth...

685
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,628
And breathed.

686
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:19,138
But by dawn
he stayed still at the bottom.

687
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:21,247
So still.

688
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:26,915
People in town
had started to talk.

689
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,453
They said I had a monster
locked up in my house.

690
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,629
I was running out of time.

691
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,098
The baby wouldn't eat,

692
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:47,801
wouldn't sleep.

693
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,874
One day,
he stopped breast-feeding.

694
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,145
I imagined myself in that house.

695
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,545
Alone.

696
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,985
Without my dad.

697
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,619
Alone with the baby.

698
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,323
I'll do it for him.

699
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:15,460
That's what I thought.

700
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:17,565
I'd do it for him.

701
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,338
For him to leave in peace.

702
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,004
For him to breathe...

703
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:33,585
We swam together until dark.

704
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:46,024
When I came out of the water,
the baby was no longer with me.

705
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,836
The cold stayed inside me.

706
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:58,701
The water's coldness...
I couldn't shake it off.

707
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,883
Until I met you.

708
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:08,616
[Weeping]

709

[Truck brakes]

710
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,904
Out you get.

711
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,978
[Knocks on door]

712
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:14,621
[Strikes heavily]

[Whining]

715
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,194
What are you involved in?

716
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,490
Just stop the bleeding.

717
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,501
[Dog grunting]

718
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:13,744
What about Serafín?

719
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:17,480
He's OK.
Easy now...

720
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,211
It's over.

721
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,186
You're on your own from here.

722
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,935
[Sighs]

723
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,116
Is he OK?

724
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,581
[Dog panting]

725
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,645
He'll be fine.

726
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,822
Now you kiss me and it's over.

727
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,691
What's over?

728
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,174
Is it a happy ending?

729
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:03,208
I don't know.

730
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:05,848
Make something up.

731
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:12,200
Subtitles: Arigon

732
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,555
We have the house.

733
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,060
And the lake.

734
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,332
Yes.

735
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,097
Will you swim with me?

736
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,509
To the bottom.
