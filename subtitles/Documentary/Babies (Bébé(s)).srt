1
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,789
<i>Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,
I've had to laugh.</i>

3
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>"Save the planet."</i>

4
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:46,922
<i>What for? And from what?
From ourselves?</i>

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>Life's simple:</i>

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,428
<i>Kill or be killed,
don't get involved...</i>

7
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,473
<i>... and always finish the job.</i>

8
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,350
<i>The survivor's code.</i>

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>My code.</i>

10
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>And it all sounds great until the day you
find yourself confronted by a choice.</i>

11
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,028
<i>A choice to make a difference,
to help someone...</i>

12
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,282
<i>... or to walk away and save yourself.</i>

13
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,118
<i>I learned something that day.</i>

14
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>You can't always walk away.</i>

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,125
<i>Too bad it was the day I died.</i>

16
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,320
Get out here!

17
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,657
Come here!

18
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,410
Get back!

19
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,164
You remember me?

20
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,084
You sold me a gun that don't work!
You almost got me killed!

21
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,503
I paid $20 for this.
I want my money back.

22
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,301
Give me that.

23
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,015
This one's very good, very good.

24
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,538
Okay.

25
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,053
I owe you.

26
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,431
I'll save you some.

27
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,867
Hey, Toorop. Toorop.
Somebody came here looking for you.

28
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,079
Okay.

29
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,719
<i>Boy, what a massacre.</i>

30
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,939
<i>At the peak of the rush hour,
bombs were detonated in...</i>

31
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,894
Karl, is that you?

32
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,940
I thought you were in Sudan
killing babies.

33
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,568
Remember the last time we met?

34
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,821
I told you if you ever
point that gun at me again...

35
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,949
...l'd kill you.

36
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,536
Who would hire a baby killer
to get me?

37
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,626
Who?

38
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,088
No shit. If you wanted me dead,
you'd have blown up the building.

39
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,673
Who?

40
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,175
Gorsky.

41
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,681
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

42
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,476
You're not a mercenary,
you're a terrorist.

43
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,940
You need two things to live in this
business, your balls and your word.

44
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,858
You don't have either.

45
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,487
You know the difference
between you and me, Karl?

46
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,533
I still got both.

47
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,954
Take it easy.

48
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,875
Personal between him and me.

49
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,736
You are a hard man to find, Toorop.

50
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm not hiding.

51
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,074
You could have knocked.

52
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,246
I needed to be sure
that you were the same idealist...

53
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,708
...who worked for me 10 years ago.

54
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,462
So you knew I was gonna kill Karl?

55
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,257
I don't like you, Gorsky.

56
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,843
You can't trust me
and I can't trust you.

57
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,762
Look at you.

58
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,140
Still in this shit hole, surviving.

59
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,477
No friends, no family, no future.

60
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,980
We are the same. You and me.

61
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,191
We're not the same.

62
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,109
What do you want?

63
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,070
I need a smuggler.

64
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,572
I don't do refugees anymore.

65
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,949
Use your own cargo.

66
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,826
- You own the borders anyway.
- Only on this side.

67
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,663
- This is an overseas delivery?
- A girl.

68
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,998
She needs to be in America
in six days.

69
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,501
Why are you playing with me?

70
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,462
You know I can't get back
into that country.

71
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,049
You know that U.N. passports
are impossible to fake.

72
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,765
This is not a fake.

73
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:21,019
Inject it in your neck
when you pass the official border.

74
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,146
This is your new life.

75
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,400
I'll do it for half a mil.

76
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,110
I can make you do it for free.

77
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,613
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

78
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,117
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

79
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,329
A car will pick you up outside.

80
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,623
Everything you need
will be in the trunk.

81
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,628
Cross me and you'll have no place
to hide anymore...

82
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,006
...Toorop.

83
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,385
It goes both ways...

84
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,470
...Gorsky.

85
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,880
Shit.

86
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,059
Good morning.

87
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,478
You must be Toorop.

88
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,230
I am Sister Rebeka.

89
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,233
I want to bring three simple rules
to your attention...

90
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,401
...before we start our journey.

91
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,070
We?

92
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,072
I'm here to pick up one girl.

93
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,618
Wherever she goes, I go.
That is rule number one.

94
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,747
Rule number two, the less contact she
has with the outside world, the better.

95
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,042
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

96
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,754
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

97
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,841
Now, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

98
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,010
I know. That is why we live in here.

99
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,557
Shit. Okay, what's your third rule?

100
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,559
No foul language.

101
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,772
Do we have an agreement?

102
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,114
You listen to my one and only rule.

103
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,617
Don't fuck with me...

104
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,912
...or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

105
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,291
...with nothing but your ass to sell
to get back here...

106
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,918
...your perfect world.

107
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,546
Do we have an agreement?

108
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,549
Obviously, you are not a gentleman.

109
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,384
Obviously not.

110
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,473
Now that we have an understanding,
pick up the bags.

111
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,938
No.

112
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,687
What's your name?

113
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,523
My name?

114
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,692
You don't have to talk to him.

115
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,069
You didn't introduce yourself.

116
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,114
My name is Toorop.

117
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,159
- Are you taking us to New York?
- Yes.

118
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,745
Now please get into the car.

119
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,749
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

120
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,088
Look, lady. I'm just a delivery boy.

121
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,549
And to me you're just a package.

122
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,136
I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother,
I'm not your boyfriend.

123
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,514
In six days, I'm gonna deliver you
and never see you again.

124
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,059
Sister Rebeka's right.

125
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,145
We shouldn't even talk.

126
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,688
Come on.

127
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,695
Comfy?

128
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,949
Your Highness,
your child has left the convent.

129
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,284
At last.

130
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,330
Six days until we reveal our miracle
to the world.

131
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,005
Your Highness,
the press conference will begin shortly.

132
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,345
She's coming.

133
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,347
Let's pray.

134
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,629
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

135
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,300
Take your bags.

136
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,053
Are you really going to need all that?

137
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,140
You can never have enough firepower,
Sister.

138
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,058
In fact...

139
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,394
Never touched a gun in my life.

140
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,646
Now would be the perfect moment
to start.

141
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,816
No, thank you. I can defend myself.

142
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,613
Stay close, this is the real world.
There's no mercy for the weak.

143
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,824
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

144
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,868
It does here.

145
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,918
Hurry.

146
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,129
Change.

147
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,839
What are you doing?

148
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,550
<i>We've located the targets.</i>

149
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,761
<i>Contact New York.</i>

150
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,680
<i>Patch me through to Darquandier.</i>

151
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,724
They found her.

152
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,559
Okay.

153
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,728
Be careful now.

154
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,106
Noelites would be watching too.

155
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,858
My daughter must not be harmed.

156
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,944
<i>Put this on.</i>

157
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,739
Come on.

158
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,118
I'm scared. Can I hold your hand?

159
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,455
Hold mine.

160
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,507
Hang on.

161
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,926
Okay, give me three.

162
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,597
Hey.

163
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,896
Where are you going?

164
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,413
What are you doing? Come on.

165
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,227
Hey.

166
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,812
Hey!

167
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,397
Hey, come here.

168
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,358
Hey!

169
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,834
<i>- She's on the run.
- Hey.</i>

170
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,585
Aurora. Toorop.

171
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,756
Aurora. Toorop.

172
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,516
<i>- What are you doing?
- Stop.</i>

173
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,643
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

174
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,353
We have to go. We have no time.

175
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,771
- Now.
- We have to get away.

176
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,107
What's wrong?
Make her walk or I'll carry her.

177
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,068
- Stop. Don't touch her.
- We gotta leave. We're going.

178
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,112
- Don't touch her.
- You will die. No!

179
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,794
Come on.

180
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,927
We're going to the train.

181
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,930
We need to catch it. Come on.

182
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,788
Move. Get out of the way.

183
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,123
Move!

184
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,850
Those tigers in the cage.

185
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,478
They weren't real, right?

186
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:21,151
Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017.

187
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,071
The last one died in the Moscow Zoo.

188
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,534
What is she,
a walking wildlife encyclopedia?

189
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,036
They were clones?

190
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,707
Second generation clones.
Not real tigers.

191
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,042
Copies of copies.

192
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,545
But they're living creatures.

193
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:40,879
Made by God.

194
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,883
No, they were organic machines
made by man.

195
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,219
God made man in his image...

196
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,972
...so, what man creates
is also God's will.

197
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,224
Is this what you teach her
in the convent?

198
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,893
You wanna talk?

199
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,729
Tell me what happened
at the marketplace.

200
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,524
How did you know
about the explosion?

201
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,027
If I'm gonna protect you...

202
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,530
...I need to know
what's wrong with you.

203
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,325
She was scared.

204
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,578
It's her first time out of the convent.

205
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,372
And you put us in that situation.

206
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,920
<i>Your attention, please. We are about to
pass through high-radiation smog.</i>

207
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,215
<i>For your security,
the shutters will now be lowered.</i>

208
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,885
First time out of the convent, huh?

209
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,026
Stay close.

210
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,364
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a friend.

211
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,659
Must be somewhere around here.

212
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,048
Come on, come on.

213
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,677
It's a glorious game.
Marcus from gracious England...

214
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:37,389
...against the Killa from China.
Only one round.

215
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,267
You can make it.

216
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,071
<i>I got them. They're right here.</i>

217

And you, don't talk to anybody.</i>

219
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,036
They're splitting up.
What do we do now?

220
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,914
Everybody maintain their position.

221
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,250
Get up, Finn.

222
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,795
Hey, Toorop.

223
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,423
- How are you?
- How are you doing?

224
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,092
What you doing in this beautiful
part of Russia?

225
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,887
<i>- Working.
- Working for who?</i>

226
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,598
<i>Hey, hey, two shots.</i>

227
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,225
<i>Gorsky.</i>

228
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,941
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

229
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:34,571
- What can I do for you?
- I need three passes on the boat.

230
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,782
And two snow bikes
on the other side.

231
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,701
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering.

232
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,371
A girl.

233
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,374
Her?

234
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,209
Who is she?

235
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,127
I don't know.

236
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,421
- Where are you taking her?
- America.

237
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,298
You're on the terrorist list there.

238
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,801
- Yeah.
- You know that. You need a passport.

239
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,553
You need an identity.

240
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,930
You're kidding me.
You got a passport?

241
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,765
Yeah, and I'm not coming back.

242
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:05,978
- That is a bold move.
- I got 50 G's saying you can help out.

243
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,938
When?

244
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,606
Now.

245
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,737
You don't have to look.

246
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,783
Who is he?

247
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,664
He's a lost soul.

248
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,175
See you at the landing at 0600 sharp.

249
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,010
You got it.

250
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,180
- Who is that?
- An old friend, a good smuggler.

251
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,391
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anybody. Come on.

252
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,482
- Sorry, kids, these girls are with me.
- Just let her go, Toorop.

253
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,652
- How do you know my name?
- We know a lot of things you don't.

254
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,198
- Yeah? Like what?
- Like you don't know what you're doing.

255
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,617
- I'm doing my job.
- Forget your job.

256
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,204
- What?
- One million, tax-free.

257
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,668
Take the money
and walk out without a fight.

258
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,545
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

259
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,517
Go!

260
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,490
Move!

261
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,298
Aurora.

262
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,645
Hey!

263
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,899
- Aurora.
- Hey, man, let the girl go.

264
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,817
Just let her go. Let her go.

265
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,986
Another one is about to die.

266
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:03,155
A new opponent for the Killa.

267
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,540
Hey, man, hey, hey. I don't...

268
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:19,630
Get over there.

269
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,965
Wanna fight? Let's go.

270
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,929
No!

271
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,609
Aurora.

272
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,209
Stop!

273
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,044
Stop it!

274
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,713
Stop it! Stop!

275
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,843
Don't kill him.

276
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:11,640
He doesn't want to hurt me.

277
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,397
He wanted to protect me!

278
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:23,819
Your father sent us.

279
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,906
- My father?
- Yes, your father.

280
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,367
Get away from her.
Get away from her.

281
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,536
It's okay, Aurora.

282
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,415
- I have to know.
- No, Aurora.

283
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,834
Aurora? Aurora. Aurora!

284
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,085
Listen to me. Stop.

285
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,880
Toorop. Toorop.

286
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,014
Come on.

287
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,532
Let's go. Hurry up.

288
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,494
Come on.

289
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,746
Move it.

290
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,123
Come on.

291
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,083
Go, go, go.

292
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,390
Let her go!

293
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,982
Next one dies.

294
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,738
Come with us.
They're ready to die for you.

295
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,657
I don't want anybody to die for me.

296
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,086
What do you think you're doing?

297
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,463
- What's wrong with you?
- Think this is a game?

298
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,632
- Why did you shoot?
- Trying to get killed?

299
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,467
- Why didn't you let me go?
- You don't know them!

300
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,346
And what are you gonna do? Shoot me
in the head? Swing on me like an animal?

301
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,306
Stop it.

302
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,524
I told you I'd take you to New York.

303
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:26,859
And I will.

304
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,945
You don't have to like me.

305
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:38,203
Is my father really alive?

306
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,290
No, baby girl.

307
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,376
He died.

308
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,391
This is way too many refugees,
man.

309
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,227
The ice is getting thinner every year.

310
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,731
We're losing cargo all the time.

311
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,694
We're not gonna all get on the boat.

312
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,655
Make sure we do.

313
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,535
This goddamn global warming
is bad for business.

314
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:37,638
What's happening?

315
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:39,932
Watch this.

316
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,231
There's not much time.

317
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,441
They don't wanna be spotted
by satellites.

318
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,652
Hurry, come on.

319
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,072
<i>Diving in two minutes.</i>

320
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:57,676

321
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,678

00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:06,685
Go.

323
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,937
Come on.

324
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,466
No!

325
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,476
No!

326
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,856
You can't do this.

327
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,358
They'll die out there.

328
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,901
No!

329
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,239
- You can't do this.
- Get away from the controls.

330
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,658
- What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it.
- No.

331
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,368
Don't do that. What's wrong?

332
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,745
- Put it down.
- No, don't.

333
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,664
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You, put it down.

334
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,083
- Hey, take it easy.
- Hey, take it easy.

335
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,586
- Put it down.
- We go back up.

336
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,506
- Now.
- Okay, okay.

337
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,384
- Relax.
- We go back up.

338
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,095
- Easy.
- Now.

339
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,597
- Relax, stay put.
- No.

340
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,849
Calm down.

341
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,976
- Put her on the floor.
- I feel them dying.

342
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:32,187
No, no mercy. Dead!

343
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:44,741
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the hell was that?

344
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:54,710
I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco.

345
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,254
My life was a mess.

346
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,590
I met the wrong man.

347
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,426
I was lost in darkness.

348
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,762
But the high priestess of our church
opened the doors...

349
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,807
...that led onto the path of light.

350
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,769
I joined the Noelites...

351
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,647
...and I ended up in the convent.

352
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:20,110
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

353
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,822
I worked in the orphanage.

354
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,910
She arrived.

355
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,913
A little baby.

356
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,749
Her father was dead.

357
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,418
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

358
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,421
I took her as my own.

359
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,089
I fed her.

360
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,841
I taught her.

361
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,930
Everything was fine
until three months ago.

362
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,516
The doctor came and gave her a pill.

363
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,351
He was with her for 10 minutes...

364
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,811
...and then she slowly started...

365
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,104
To change, huh?

366
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,315
Schizophrenia.

367
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,692
Spasms.

368
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:05,197
Nothing as violent
as what you saw today.

369
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,951
Now, how could she know how
to operate a 30-year-old Russian sub?

370
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:14,373
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

371
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:18,335
Aurora could speak
when she was 2 years old.

372
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,296
Yeah, but there are kids
that can speak at 2 years old.

373
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,507
Nineteen different languages?

374
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,556
Who else knows about this?

375
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,641
Nobody but the doctor.

376
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:35,686
He told me to keep it a secret
to protect her.

377
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:39,857
He said...

378
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:44,111
...that we would get
the best medical help in America.

379
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,407
She needs help.

380
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,619
<i>Crew, prepare to surface.</i>

381
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,540
Get her ready.

382
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,768
You know, two years ago...

383
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,690
...in Uzbekistan,
I saw this viral bomb go off.

384
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,777
I saw it from the air. It was...

385
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,699
...incredible. Everybody died.

386
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,162
She's carrying, ain't she?

387
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,956
All the symptoms fit.

388
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,167
All that weird behavior.

389
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:43,921
I'm telling you, man,
she's carrying a weapon.

390
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,798
Do you have any idea
how much money she's worth?

391
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:51,303
If she's carrying a virus...

392
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,476
...l'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

393
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:19,957
What happened to them?

394
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,166
Fighter drones.

395
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,126
Anything that moves
is shot on sight.

396
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:24,920
It's 10 miles to the DMZ.

397
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:28,590
Then let's make it 10 fast miles.
Let's go.

398
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:46,024
Toorop, they're coming.

399
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:47,860
Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!

400
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,247
Brake!

401
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,880
Finn, get close to me.

402
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:10,674
Jump onto his bike.

403
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,139
I'll draw them off.

404
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,269
- What are you doing?
- Toorop cleared our way out.

405
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:07,022
We're only a mile from the border.

406
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,239
- Toorop, we need help.
- Don't worry.

407
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,406
We're almost there.

408
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,122
Toorop, we need you now.

409
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,083
Hang on, I'm getting there.

410
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,350
Stop! We have to get Toorop.

411
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,369
Toorop.

412
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,247
He's not dead.

413
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,500
Oh, shit.

414
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,502
Hey, stay with me.

415
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:15,299
He's not reacting.
He's bleeding to death.

416
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,093
I need your help. Okay.

417
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,807
We gotta get out of here now.

418
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,810
It's a small piece of metal.
I'm gonna take it out.

419
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,479
- What do you need?
- Just hold him.

420
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,276
Look, we don't have time
for this, okay?

421
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,195
They're gonna send more drones.

422
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,030
Aurora?

423
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:42,201
- You got it?
- I got it.

424
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,161
- He's okay.
- Give me a bandage.

425
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,830
We should never have turned back.

426
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,042
He knows the rules.

427
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,836
I'll sew it up later.

428
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:55,839
Hey...

429
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:59,051
...now you
and the passport are mine.

430
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,638
- What are you doing?
- You, I don't need.

431
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,693
Like I said...

432
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,195
...trust no one.

433
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,239
Remember that.

434
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,414
It's good.
Where did you learn to cook?

435
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,167
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

436
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,253
You never had a woman
take care of you?

437
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,007
Sorry.

438
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,385
No, not in my line of work.

439
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,056
Finished.

440
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:49,226
- She gets pleasure out of this.
- Crybaby.

441
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,395
Crybaby?

442
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,901
What is that?

443
00:46:58,652 --> 00:46:59,862
Painkiller?

444
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,947
No, thank you.

445
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:05,033
- Live a little.
- No.

446
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,369
- Aurora, stop.
- Wait, let...

447
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,122
Spit it out.

448
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,006
Girls.

449
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,592
We made it across the border.

450
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,427
Here's to survival...

451
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,805
...and thank you for saving my life.

452
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:29,308
Maybe now you can trust somebody.

453
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:35,647
We protected each other like family.

454
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,781
We are all going to die in New York.

455
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,789
Good night.

456
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,677
She's just scared.

457
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:08,972
Yeah, right.

458
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:39,044
Go back to sleep.

459
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,006
We still have a long way ahead of us.

460
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,300
What are you doing?

461
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,721
We go through customs tomorrow.

462
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,599
Can't take these.

463
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,863
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first found me as a baby...

464
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:08,407
...it was a night like this.

465
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,577
Aurora.

466
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,246
That's where I got my name.

467
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,081
From the chaos.

468
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,708
It suits you.

469
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,546
You're risking your life for me.

470
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,548
Why?

471
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,386
I've done my time.

472
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,599
All this killing and pain...

473
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:36,268
...and war for what?

474
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,897
I'm tired.

475
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,275
I'm tired of it all.

476
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,777
You're my only chance
out of this hell.

477
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:47,446
And go where?

478
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:53,035
27 Cedar Grove...

479
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,955
...near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

480
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,459
My parents had a farm.

481
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,130
More like a cabin with a lot of land.

482
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:09,051
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

483
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,807
There is no place like home.

484
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,981
Well, Kansas ain't what it used to be.

485
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:24,942
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

486
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:28,320
1939.

487
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,447
That's right.

488
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:40,123
Toorop.

489
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:48,423
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

490
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,971
I hope I won't have to.

491
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:50,587
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

492
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:54,550
There's a plane to New York
in two hours.

493
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:12,067
<i>Passengers for Flight 712
to New York...</i>

494
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:16,280
<i>... please proceed to Gate 211
for immediate boarding.</i>

495
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:23,161
<i>You are now leaving Canada.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.</i>

496
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:27,124
<i>Welcome
to the United States of America.</i>

497
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:36,967
Welcome to America.

498
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,344
Welcome to America.

499
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,097
Welcome to America.

500
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,267
Stop.

501
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,187
Hold it right there.

502
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,605
- Hey.
- I said, hold it.

503
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,690
- Calm down.
- Hey.

504
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,453
<i>A miracle in the making.</i>

505
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:04,721
<i>Tomorrow is the dawn
of our new age.</i>

506
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:37,254
Harlem, we've changed.
We've changed.

507
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,803
Right here, girls.

508
00:55:56,982 --> 00:56:00,444
It's okay. It's safe here.

509
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,636
Here.

510
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:30,933
Can we turn it off?

511
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,309
You can't turn it off.

512
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,936
You can change the channel.

513
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:43,153
Hey.

514
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,197
There's no food.

515
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:47,783
Because we're not
gonna be here long.

516
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,167
What's wrong?

517
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:59,586
They're all dead.

518
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:06,677
<i>Sources report the destruction in
Kirghizstan of a 1000-year-old convent.</i>

519
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:11,056
<i>One of the oldest continually functioning
convents in Central Asia.</i>

520
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:14,017
<i>Now occupied by an ascetic branch
of the Noelites...</i>

521
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:16,854
<i>... the convent was struck by a missile
late last night.</i>

522
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,480
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

523
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,650
<i>Here, an initial reaction
from the Noelites.</i>

524
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:25,195
<i>It is a tragedy to think
that even defenseless women...</i>

525
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:29,867
<i>... who made the choice to withdraw
from society and lead a life of purity...</i>

526
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,202
<i>... should suffer the attacks
of terrorists...</i>

527
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:37,875
<i>... who have absolutely no respect for
the lives of decent, God-fearing people.</i>

528
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:40,544
<i>We shall mourn our Sisters.</i>

529
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:44,047
<i>The Noelites have been persecuted
for too long.</i>

530
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:47,009
<i>Tomorrow will be the dawn
of our new age.</i>

531
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,725
<i>Congratulations, my friend.</i>

532
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,019
<i>You made it safe and sound.</i>

533
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:58,937
Gorsky.

534
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,941
<i>- Did you destroy that convent?
- I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.</i>

535
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:06,278
<i>- I'm a mercenary like you.
- Bullshit.</i>

536
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,905
What the hell is going...?

537
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:09,781
What the hell is going on over here?

538
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:12,451
<i>- You didn't leave me a gun?
- You've done your job.</i>

539
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:16,747
<i>When you turn over the girl, I'll get paid
and you're home free.</i>

540
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:21,251
<i>And the tracking device in your passport
will be deactivated.</i>

541
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:23,045
<i>Deliver the package.</i>

542
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:26,381
<i>My men will be there
to be sure you do.</i>

543
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,760
They never hurt anybody.

544
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:31,929
Maybe it was an accident.

545
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:34,806
It was not an accident.

546
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:39,102
It was destroyed
right after we crossed the border.

547
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,941
Would you like to pray with me?

548
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,694
I don't feel like praying anymore.

549
00:58:56,995 --> 00:59:00,207
Toorop said
I'm just a package to him.

550
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,503
Is that all I am to you?

551
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:08,131
Of course not.

552
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,342
I love you.

553
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,444
How is she?

554
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,196
Scared.

555
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,490
Yeah, well, she should be.

556
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:36,535
Who are they?

557
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:40,622
To the left, the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

558
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,208
To the right...

559
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,252
...the bikers work for Gorsky.

560
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:54,303
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

561
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:56,847
And if we don't?

562
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:02,311
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

563
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,316
Look, Sister.

564
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:10,694
We traveled 6000 miles together.

565
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:14,364
The truth is this has been
a suicide mission from the beginning.

566
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:17,367
They won't let either one of us
walk out of here alive.

567
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:23,498
That's the doctor that came
to the convent three months ago.

568
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:26,293
Answer the door.
Act like nothing's wrong.

569
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,838
Okay.

570
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:41,183
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

571
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,439
Good evening.

572
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,066
Where is she?

573
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,943
In the room.

574
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,383
You're a bad man.

575
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:27,145
Thank you, Aurora.
Thank you so much.

576
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:47,165
- How is she?
- She's fine.

577
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:48,792
I have to run some more tests.

578
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,169
- More tests?
- Standard...

579
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:51,628
You just ran your test.

580
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,006
- What's wrong with her?
- Expect a call.

581
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:56,800
What is wrong with her?

582
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,343
Toorop.

583
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,638
Toorop, let him go.

584
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,641
If you please?

585
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:09,021
Thank you, Sister.

586
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:18,197
- Get over here.
- What's wrong with you?

587
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:19,698
I wanna know everything.

588
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:23,994
Don't you think that if I knew anything,
I would tell you?

589
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:25,787
No, I don't think.

590
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:29,374
You're a Noelite. You are like him.
You swore an oath.

591
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,668
Not to them. To God.

592
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,213
God has nothing to do with it now.

593
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:35,547
You understand?

594
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,550
If she carries a virus,
she could annihilate the city.

595
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,677
I'm not gonna have it on my conscience.

596
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:53,065
I'm pregnant. Twins.

597
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,652
It's not possible.

598
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,571
I've watched over you all your life.

599
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:02,032
No one's ever touched you.

600
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,205
- And nobody has.
- It's a miracle.

601
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:11,875
Shit.

602
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:18,590
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. Toorop, this is the High Priestess.</i>

603
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:20,509
<i>- I am the...
- I know who you are.</i>

604
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:24,513
<i>Thank you for doing such a good job,
Mr. Toorop.</i>

605
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,722
You're welcome.

606
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,058
<i>Bring the girl to the limousine
and you'll be free...</i>

607
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:29,434
<i>- Toorop...
...and rich.</i>

608
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,980
...if you deliver me to them, I'll die.

609
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,487
We're on our way out.

610
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:48,412
<i>All right, guys.
Let's go get her. Are you ready?</i>

611
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,394
We can't let her go, Toorop.

612
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:15,314
Look around. Do we have a choice?

613
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:21,945
She's your problem now.

614
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:34,958
Move!

615
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,937
We're going to the subway.

616
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,105
Thank you, Toorop.

617
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:12,120
What's wrong?

618
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,456
It's a missile linked to my passport.

619
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:17,876
How can you stop it?

620
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:19,711
- I got him!
- Only by death.

621
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:25,300
Go to the subway.

622
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,696
Toorop.

623
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:54,872
Aurora.

624
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:59,251
Get the girl.

625
01:07:14,826 --> 01:07:16,954
It's you.

626
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,207
Protect them.

627
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:42,229
I need you to live.

628
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,801
Aurora was our miracle.

629
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:15,220
A true virgin birth.

630
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:19,308
This was to make ours
the dominant religion on earth.

631
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:22,394
Now we don't know
what's happened to her.

632
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:25,898
In this mess,
there's no sign of Aurora.

633
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,400
We can't find her.

634
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:32,404
We were finally on the verge
of becoming a bona fide religion.

635
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:37,034
Your incompetence has thrown 20 years
of careful planning down the tubes.

636
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:39,494
Who gave the order to use guns
to retrieve her?

637
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,413
You left Gorsky no choice.

638
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,290
What were you thinking?

639
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,044
- Your Highness.
- What?

640
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:49,379
The body stolen from the morgue
was Toorop's.

641
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,674
The police have found the van
that transported him to New Jersey.

642
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:57,304
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

643
01:09:06,522 --> 01:09:08,732
He's back online.

644
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:20,410
Where are you taking me?

645
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,579
To Darquandier.

646
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:42,766
Jamal, Mr. Toorop is not our prisoner.
You can release him.

647
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,397
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.

648
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:51,900
I'm Dr. Darquandier. Aurora's father.

649
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:57,281
I thought you were dead.

650
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:01,076
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

651
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,286
You'll see.

652
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:06,999
Oh, yes. You we're clinically dead
for two hours.

653
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,459
We lost time
getting you from the morgue.

654
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:11,795
And then you went into a coma
for five days.

655
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:15,132
I fixed you up as best I could.

656
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:19,595
Now, Mr. Toorop, I believe
I owe you some explanation.

657
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:25,309
Twenty years ago, I was drummed out
of the medical profession...

658
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:28,770
...for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

659
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:31,356
Around that time,
the Noelites came to me...

660
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:35,277
...to create smarter,
stronger, healthier human beings.

661
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:41,366
So I built a super computer
to be Aurora's artificial mother.

662
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:46,330
As a fetus, Aurora learned
to process information...

663
01:10:46,496 --> 01:10:48,916
...just like a computer.

664
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:52,044
But when she was born...

665
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:54,713
...she became much more
than just an experiment.

666
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,340
She became...

667
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,885
She became my daughter.
She was beautiful. She was unique.

668
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:03,889
I couldn't give her away, so that's when
they hired Gorsky to kill me...

669
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:07,976
...and, well, he almost succeeded.

670
01:11:09,144 --> 01:11:12,314
He took my baby away
and hid her for the Noelites.

671
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,566
I searched for her,
but I couldn't find her.

672
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,736
I knew that one day the Noelites
would present their miracle...

673
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,321
...to the rest of the world.

674
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:28,205
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

675
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:31,208
We think she's alive
and that she's left you a message.

676
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,669
You died with your eyes open...

677
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,880
...but your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

678
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:39,091
We just need to rewind the tape.

679
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:43,345
You need to return to the same condition
you were in when we found you.

680
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,390
I was dead.

681
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:49,893
Quite.

682
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:56,525
What am I looking for?

683
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:59,027
What you missed the first time.

684
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:01,905
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

685
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:04,950
Are you ready, Mr. Toorop?

686
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:22,134
Stay with the memory.

687
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,303
Stay with the memory.
Move forward a bit.

688
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,392
Focus on his memories of Aurora.

689
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,312
He's seeing her. Very good.

690
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,813
Stop!

691
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:37,316
I'll die.

692
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:40,068
That's right. We're getting there.
We're getting there.

693
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:44,239
Now is good. Focus on his gun.

694
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,332
Easy, easy. Steady, steady.

695
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:01,965
- Way past the danger threshold.
- I know, but he'll be fine. He'll be fine.

696
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,138
Hey, slow down. Slow down.
Now. Slow down.

697
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,977
Let's wait, let's wait, let's wait.

698
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,945
I need you to live.

699
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,837
He's dead.

700
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:41,797
Wait.

701
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,340
Don't bring him back yet.

702
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:46,468
He's almost there. The last seconds.

703
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,034
Go home.

704
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,498
It's all right. You're back. You're safe.

705
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:18,667
You're all right. You're fine.

706
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,044
I know where she is.

707
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:26,383
Mr. Gorsky, I hoped
I wouldn't have to see you again.

708
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,385
<i>Where is my money?
You haven't paid me.</i>

709
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:30,929
You have an odd way
of killing people.

710
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:32,556
What are you talking about?

711
01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:35,726
I'm on my way
to see our old friend, Darquandier.

712
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:39,021
Impossible.
I made his car explode myself.

713
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:42,065
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill, I kill for good.

714
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:44,401
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

715
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:47,070
You will need a nuke to kill me.

716
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,741
Bitch.

717
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,746
How did she survive the blast?

718
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:58,540
It's the babies, you see.

719
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,084
They're gaining power.

720
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,670
They're the ones guiding her.

721
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:08,258
Her capacity for survival is greater than
anything we could ever have imagined.

722
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:12,429
Professor, your wife has found us.
She'll be here in two minutes.

723
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:14,473
Find her, Toorop.

724
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,267
You're the only one
who can save her now.

725
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:24,775
So where are we going?

726
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:25,984
North.

727
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:46,463
Hello, my dear.

728
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,257
It's lovely to see you.

729
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:51,218
- Where's my daughter?
- I see you haven't found her.

730
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,595
And you never will.

731
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:55,681
You selfish bastard.

732
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:59,142
Twenty years ago,
I gave you the opportunity you wanted.

733
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,228
Now it's my moment.

734
01:16:02,354 --> 01:16:04,439
Where is my daughter?

735
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:05,858
She's not your daughter.

736
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:07,150
She comes from me.

737
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,653
- I designed her.
- For me.

738
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:11,697
She's my miracle.

739
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:14,867
- She belongs to my church.
- Your church is a lie.

740
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,995
You're peddling miracles
for your own profit.

741
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,003
Are you willing to die for her?

742
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,337
Yes.

743
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:41,268
Find Toorop. He knows where she is.

744
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:17,804
Wait here.

745
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:54,091
You're finally home.

746
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,094
What's left of it.

747
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,599
But I came back for you.

748
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:07,437
Have a little faith.

749
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:49,897
Toorop, they're coming.

750
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:20,000
By - MoSToFA K@MAL™

751
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:53,692
Break left.

752
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,211
Toorop, they need help.

753
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,256
No!

754
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,101
Take the wheel.

755
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:24,343
Toorop.

756
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,651
Thank you.

757
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,154
For protecting us.

758
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,122
You're their father now.

759
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:09,012
Aurora.

760
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:16,144
That's the first time
you've said my name.

761
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,857
You're gonna be okay.

762
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:25,362
Take care of them, Toorop.

763
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,626
Hey, kids.

764
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:45,048
There's a storm coming.
We need to go.

765
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:55,017
Ready?

766
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:56,935
Okay, Dad.
