00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,180
<i>The head of the Motion Picture
Association of America, Jack Valenti,</i>

2
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,366
<i>said today in New-York
that the film industry</i>

3
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:20,782
<i>plans to set up a voluntary
rating system,</i>

4
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:23,924
<i>designed to keep youngsters
from seeing undesirable films.</i>

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,010
<i>10 years ago, on this very day,
November the 1st of 1968</i>

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,766
<i>the film industry stopped censoring
and started a rating system.</i>

7
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,326
<i>The system has since been praised,
but also condemned.</i>

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,077
<i>For 30 years, the MPAA</i>

9
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:38,046
<i>has been helping parents decide</i>

10
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,271
<i>what movies they should let
their children see.</i>

11
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:42,849
<i>But lately,
their decisions've come under fire.</i>

12
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>Encino, California.</i>

13
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,406
<i>Inside the headquarters of the MPAA,</i>

14
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:51,362
<i>an anonymous group of parents
gathers to rate films</i>

15
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:56,652
<i>G, PG, PG-13, R
and NC-17, formerly X.</i>

16
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:00,722
<i>But the MPAA won't let anyone inside
to see who these people are,</i>

17
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:02,373
<i>or how they make their decisions.</i>

18
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:04,798
<i>And among their most
controversial decisions</i>

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,570
<i>are the films they rate NC-17.</i>

20
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:04,505
My film was very autobiographical.

21
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:08,318
It was very reflective of many
of the girls that I knew in downtown NY

22
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:10,109
who were passing as men.

23
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,855
So, I was in the editing room, and I got
a call from my producer, and he said:

24
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,349
"We have some bad news.
You got an NC-17".

25
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,089
And I was like:
"That's great!"

26
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:21,151
Oh, NC-17! All the films that I love
have it...

27
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,878
Well, it used to be an X.

28
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:25,080
They said: "It's not good",
and I said: "Why?"

29
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,967
They said: "Well, the studio won't
release your movie if it has an NC-17."

30
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,798
I was so floored...

31
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:34,473
To have worked so hard,
against all the obstacles of no money

32
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:38,259
and with people saying: "You can't make
that movie. It makes no sense",

33
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,623
getting the audiences to love it,
at that point...

34
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:43,537
And then, they have this unknown board
- that was apparently

35
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:46,989
doing it for the filmmaker... 'cause
that's kind of the whole mantra -

36
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,726
saying I couldn't have my meaning.

37
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,955
It was like being shut up,
and I was like:

38
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,730
"Wait! Let me talk to you.

39
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,916
"You can't make...
This isn't right."

40
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:58,556
So, I said to my lawyer
"What were the counts... the problems?"

41
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,125
There were three.

42
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,645
After Brandon goes down on Lana,

43
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:05,832
he comes up, and wipes the cum off
his mouth.

44
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,124
We had to strike on that.

45
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:09,161
I said: "Okay, what's the problem?"

46
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,226
"Well, we don't really know,
but that's really offensive."

47
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,012
And I said:
<i>"So, I shoot Brandon in the head,</i>

48
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:18,307
"and I do all these things...
And that's fondamentaly okay,

49
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:20,040
"- but there is a problem here.
- Yes.

50
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,522
"- Can somebody explain?
- No

51
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,415
"- Anybody I can call?
- No.

52
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:25,204
"Okay, what's the second one?"

53
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,223
"The anal rape.
They want to cut it out."

54
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:30,560
I said: "No, I'm not cutting that.
It's inherent to the movie.

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,884
"What's the 3rd thing?

56
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,035
"Well, Lana's orgasm is too long."

57
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,320
And I was like:

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,590
"Who's ever been hurt
by an orgasm that was too long?

59
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,484
"Well, it's offensive."
And I was like: "That's outrageous."

60
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,080
So, when I looked at her orgasm,
I was like:

61
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,601
"This is totally about Lana's pleasure.

62
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:52,819
"So, there's something about that
that's scaring them, unnerving them."

63
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:08,346
Why do you think
they had a problem with...

64
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,918
- With female pleasure?
- Yeah.

65
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,519
Well, in a construct where most movies
are written by men, directed by men,

66
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:16,067
they're most for the male experience.

67
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,154
So I think that... even in sex scenes,

68
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:20,933
it's from a male perspective.

69
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,631
So I don't think that the focus
is female pleasure.

70
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:26,735
I think that female pleasure
is unnatural, scary.

71
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,986
In that kind of narrative setting.

72
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:32,711
So I think that if you are a woman
who understands female pleasure,

73
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,093
and understands it
from the woman's perspective,

74
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,847
you're probably going into a terrain
that's unfamiliar.

75
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:41,799
And I think generally,
unfamiliar is what breeds the NC-17.

76
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:55,144
<i>I definitely felt censored
and I felt discriminated against</i>

77
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,185
<i>for making a gay film.</i>

78
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:00,179
<i>We were told anything with a dildo
would have to be removed.</i>

79
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,947
<i>Give me the physical frame: where
exactly do we go from a PG to an R?</i>

80
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:07,913
<i>You're given a list in the beginning
with everything that can't be on screen.</i>

81
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:11,604
<i>I had to cut one shot
where you just infer...</i>

82
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,977
<i>that one of the girls is going towards
the crotch of the other girl.</i>

83
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,966
<i>There was some pressure from the studio
to cut a part of it.</i>

84
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,554
<i>And in the end, they cut 3 seconds.
I think it was...</i>

85
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:23,813
<i>And the MPAA members'd tell you:
"You don't have to accept the ratings.</i>

86
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,858
<i>"It's not mandatory."
That's bullshit!</i>

87
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,451
<i>Why should that film get an R?</i>

88
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,965
<i>And why, for seeing my pubic hair,
do we get an NC-17?</i>

89
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,639
<i>It's a terrible situation.</i>

90
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:36,429
The current rating sytem
is a form of censorship

91
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,198
in a kind of fondamental way.

92
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,941
Because it categorizes films
in advance of their release

93
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,509
and they're categorized
not by the people who make 'em

94
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,784
but by a handful of people

95
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,744
whose names we'll never know.

96
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,508
The rating board members
who are parents,

97
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,647
neither gods nor fools,

98
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,842
look at a movie

99
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,915
and try to put a rating on it,
that the average parent

100
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:02,722
would believe to be an accurate
depiction of that film.

101
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,366
This mythical american parent
is a fiction!

102
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,106
A convenient fiction
that somebody has to make up

103
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:15,214
to come up with what's got to be
an arbitrary system.

104
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,821
They're told that they're guardians
of morality,

105
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,170
they're told they're the last bar

106
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,060
between what... what you expect what
children should see.

107
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,244
With that kind of authority,
they felt to take themselves seriously.

108
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,237
And they tend to try and promulgate

109
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:34,528
some concepts they basically make up.

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,184
They try to make up standards.

111
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,691
The critical community has never
really taken

112
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,829
the MPAA terribly seriously

113
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,413
or given it a huge amount of respect.

114
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:47,438
And were often, you know, very puzzled

115
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,876
by some of the decisions they make.

116
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:53,924
Why this is... Why people
can't go see this terrific movie?

117
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,724
Just 'cause, you know...
There's this "word" in it!

118
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,641
It just seems so...
kinda childish!

119
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,633
Even though it's supposed to protect
children,

120
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:05,956
it's turning us all into children.

121
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,163
<i>What do movie ratings mean?</i>

122
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:09,941
<i>"G" means "General audiences".</i>

123
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,339
<i>No nudity, no sex, and no drugs.</i>

124
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,813
<i>Violence must be cartoonish and minimal.
And there may be language</i>

125
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>that goes beyond polite conversation.</i>

126
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,730
<i>"PG" means "Parental guidance".</i>

127
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,569
<i>There may be strong language
like "shit" or "ass" and brief nudity</i>

128
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,368
<i>like showing off an ass. Or like
violence like "being kicked in the ass".</i>

129
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:30,036
<i>"PG-13".
"Parents are strongly cautionned",</i>

130
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,370
<i>as in "Look out, mum,
here come more shits!</i>

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,235
<i>"Bullshit, dumbshit, little shit,</i>

132
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,764
<i>"shitfaced, and shithead."</i>

133
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,556
<i>"Fuck" is also allowed,
but usually just once.</i>

134
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:41,463
<i>So filmmakers're urged
to choose their "fuck" carefully.</i>

135
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,722
<i>A simple "Fuck you!" is okay.
But referring to the sexual act,</i>

136
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:47,885
<i>as in "May I please fuck you?"
or "I enjoy getting fucked!",</i>

137
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,521
<i>is totally unacceptable.</i>

138
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:53,098
<i>If a character says that, especially
while abusing illegal narcotic,</i>

139
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,721
<i>the film is rated "R".</i>

140
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:58,974
<i>"R" means "Restricted". Nobody 17
or under without parent or guardian.</i>

141
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:03,209
<i>There may be sexual themes, franc sex
talk, sexualized nudity, tough language</i>

142
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,496
<i>and tough violence like 100 handicapped
orphans decimated by hell of a gunfire.</i>

143
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,164
<i>But if the film depicts</i>

144
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,978
<i>realistic baby-making
in a position other than missionary,</i>

145
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,171
<i>acts involving oral sex with females,
anal sex, fetishes, more than 2 humans,</i>

146
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,776
<i>or what the MPAA bills
"aberrational behavior",</i>

147
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:21,581
<i>this film could get slapped
with an "NC-17".</i>

148
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:25,139
<i>"NC-17" means "No children 17 or under".
Period!</i>

149
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,110
<i>An NC-17 may range from
a senior citizen gang-bang</i>

150
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,217
<i>to a foreign Pedro Almadovar film.</i>

151
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,444
<i>But art films make people feel funny,</i>

152
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,274
<i>especially the ones with
"aberrational behavior".</i>

153
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,308
We have censorship board

154
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,700
called the MPAA
that looks at your movie and says:

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,629
"This is the rating
we're gonna give you.

156
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:45,632
"If you want it to be any more extreme,
expect 5 people to see your film."

157
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,915
Then, no advertising budget,
no distributor's gonna wanna touch it.

158
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,899
I have Valenti's law which says:

159
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,945
"If you make a movie a lot of people
want to see,

160
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,873
"no rating will hurt you.

161
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,291
"If you make a movie few people
want to see,

162
00:09:58,391 --> 00:09:59,991
"no rating will help you."

163
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,411
Ratings have nothing to do
with box-office.

164
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:06,536
The difference between an NC-17 and an R
rating can be millions of dollars.

165
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:08,209
It can mean a difference of...

166
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,935
On some films, maybe even
tens of millions $.

167
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,372
'Cause it definitely limits your ability
to market the film.

168
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:16,588
If you're limited on that,

169
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:20,516
people aren't aware of it.
They won't even note to see that movie.

170
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,936
And if you choose not to accept
the rating,

171
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:26,868
then your ads don't really run.
You can't run TV spots...

172
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:30,614
If they run a TV spot for a movie
that hasn't been rated yet, they say:

173
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,372
"This film's not yet been rated."

174
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:35,440
But you never see TV spots for like:
"This film is unrated."

175
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,763
The worst censorship of all, I believe

176
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:40,160
is "Wal-Mart", "Blockbuster".

177
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,154
All the big chains - that are probably
responsible for

178
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,772
40% of all videos sold, DVDs -

179
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,491
will not carry NC-17.

180
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,409
Jack Valenti's been very good
and publicly about

181
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,469
"We serve the public, the parents."
It's a crap, they serve the studios!

182
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,164
That's who pays their bills...
They are all of the studios.

183
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,533
Does the perennial charge

184
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,110
that the studios will treat it better

185
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,537
than the independants hold true?

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,425
I'm sorry, but when I was there

187
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,508
the answer was "Absolutely no!"

188
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,518
When we did "Orgazmo"
which was indenpendantly financed,

189
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:16,811
they gave us an NC-17.

190
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,385
We got a phone call with the MPAA,

191
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,361
and the guy'd basically say:

192
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,509
"It's for the overall sexual content.

193
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,428
"Anything we'd cut out to get an R?

194
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,682
"You're welcome to re-cut it
and send it back.

195
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,177
"We'd look at it again."

196
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,001
And their whole position with this film
was:

197
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:35,527
"We don't give specific notes.

198
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,554
"Otherwise,
we'd be a censorship organisation.

199
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,252
"We just give you the rating."

200
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:41,867
Then, cut to 5 years later,
we're doing the South Park movie,

201
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,782
and we're working for Paramount...

202
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,297
And we turn in the first cut
of the movie.

203
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,722
And we've a phone call:
"You got an NC-17.

204
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:52,090
"You need to cut out this, this.
Change this, this..."

205
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,927
It was extremely specific.

206
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,727
This word, this line, this joke.

207
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,426
Our treatment was a completely
different experience.

208
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,949
They target independants,
because the system is set up

209
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,505
to favor the studios.

210
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:09,080
And because the independant filmmaker
is independant of the studios,

211
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,899
I mean, what's an independant film?

212
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,610
What is it "independant of"?

213
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,416
It is "independant of
that big studio culture".

214
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:17,212
Looking for more freedom.

215
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:19,534
Looking to be able to operate
in a manner

216
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,763
where they can completely express
themselves.

217
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:24,590
Without restriction,
and without censorship.

218
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:26,459
There is a mystery here, though.

219
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:30,474
Who is controlling this thing,
and how are they controlling it?

220
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,590
Because I don't fully understand yet.

221
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,727
- Would you like to know?
- Oh, yeah!

222
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:38,166
We've looked at rating systems
accross 30 different countries,

223
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,448
and the MPAA system is the only
movie rating system

224
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:44,869
that doesn't disclose
who its rating board members are.

225
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,568
I think that does rankle with
a lot of people, and rightly so.

226
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,744
Who are these people who're just sitting
in judgement of your movie?

227
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,047
I would like to know.

228
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,987
No one knows.
That's the whole point!

229
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,280
That's what's really odd
about the whole thing:

230
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,927
in an industry this big
and as public as this,

231
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:03,803
that there is an organisation,
supposedly accountable to the public,

232
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,823
that's running in such a shadowy way.

233
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,741
Some of the things we're doing,

234
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:09,897
is we're hiring
a private investigator.

235
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,423
To try to find out
who these people are on the board.

236
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:20,748
Hi, my name is Kirby Dick,
and I was interested in

237
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:23,202
actually hiring a private investigator

238
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,985
for a project I'm about to begin
working on.

239
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,375
How hard'll it be,
and what methods'd you use to find out

240
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,488
who these people are
and where they live.

241
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,510
We'd find out where the screening is.

242
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,347
We'd use surveillance on the building,

243
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,120
get the license plates
of the vehicles.

244
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,868
I could get myself employed...

245
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,342
... at a low level position...

246
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:49,642
... I'm inside
where I could find those things out.

247
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:52,816
What about... can you go through
people's trash, stuff like that?

248
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,569
In the city of LA,
it's completely legal to do that.

249
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,349
As long as it's on the street.

250
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:59,313
You do a lot of undercover work?

251
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:01,620
I... I look like a cop!

252
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,577
I couldn't get away
whith any kind of undercover work.

253
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,424
But I know lots of people
who don't look like cops.

254
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:11,272
Being a woman, I get in places
that most people don't.

255
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,630
That's one advantage.

256
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,396
Usually, security guards open the door.

257
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,235
I'll smile, they open the door,
and go!

258
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,941
I have wigs and hats,
and things like that.

259
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,306
When it's necessary.

260
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,335
This is my hooker wig.

261
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,209
But if it came down to where I needed

262
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,195
her or her daughter,
I'd bring 'em with me.

263
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,575
But I definitely do everything
in my power to get in.

264
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,638
Okay, the MPAA
is that pinkish coloured building.

265
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:47,112
They've got it all towards
it's impossible

266
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:49,279
for you just to walk on the premises.

267
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,348
Here, they have an intercom.

268
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:53,482
The guardian'll come and ask
what you want.

269
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:54,921
He won't let you come in.

270
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:57,533
It's all gated in here,
locked and secure

271
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,620
so there's no way of going in.

272
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,245
Unless you're invited.

273
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:03,451
I don't think
they're gonna invite us.

274
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:07,241
So, there's absolutely no way
we're gonna get in that building.

275
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:19,504
It's lunch time.
They're gonna start coming out.

276
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:21,694
We'll take some plates
and get some information.

277
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,176
- All right. What are you looking at?
- That security guard, over there.

278
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,609
Is he gonna make it harder
to do what we have to do?

279
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,104
No, unless he starts looking at us.

280
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,326
There's one moment right back
he did look over here.

281
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:38,517
- Really? Think so?
- He just probably glanced.

282
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:42,247
Okay, Lindsey.
We have a black Honda.

283
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:45,549
Female caucasian.

284
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:49,526
5XF 3CV

285
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,191
I kinda get a thrill out of knowing
I'm watching someone

286
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,019
and they don't know it.

287
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,487
There's something exciting about that.

288
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,913
So, um...

289
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,592
Lindsey, write this down:

290
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,842
4SW F3

291
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:13,017
Brand new Mercedes.

292
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,331
Very attractive woman whoever she is.

293
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,835
So, it's a slow process.

294
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,825
This could take six months.

295
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,175
And I'm not even sure
if it's possible.

296
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,989
This is like saying: "Go into Fort Knox
and bring out a few bricks.

297
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,542
"We just want to see
what color they are."

298
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,208
I was a full-time
motion picture rater.

299
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:49,506
I was with the MPAA
for about four and a half years.

300
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,843
From september of 1995

301
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,881
to march of 2000.

302
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,467
The starting salary at that time

303
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,231
for a full-time rater
was 30 000 dollars.

304
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,137
Generally, in the morning,
you'd meet and discuss

305
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,049
the movies that you had seen

306
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,691
the previous day.

307
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,926
And so first,

308
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,589
people would kind of talk about 'em
as if there was any issue.

309
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,904
That... This... seemed kinda violent,

310
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,267
or there was too much sex, here.

311
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,251
People would sort of
give their opinions on...

312
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,021
why they thought it should be
one rating or another.

313
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:23,885
There weren't...

314
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,961
any clear set of standards...

315
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:28,831
in a sense you...

316
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,678
you were taught,
and then had to apply.

317
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,492
There was no kind of
rater-training process.

318
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:38,994
People were hired,
they were put in the screening room,

319
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:42,104
put in the rating chair,
and started rating films.

320
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,280
Sometimes they'd show us
like an edited version of the movie

321
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,548
after it'd been given like an X or an R,
and they want to change it.

322
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,604
And all the board would be very pleased

323
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,882
when they'd throw
that re-edited version.

324
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,068
"Oh! This is much better!

325
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:57,899
"The way that we told them
how to re-edit the film.

326
00:17:57,999 --> 00:17:59,434
"It plays much better, now!"

327
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,493
And I found out that
to be very offensive.

328
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,687
I'm gonna say the F-word.

329
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,357
You know...
I believe it's a facist system.

330
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:09,640
They have just established themselves,

331
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,979
they have injected themselves

332
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,618
as a vital, necessary entity.

333
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,050
And it isn't.

334
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:18,328
We have to police these people.

335
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:22,449
We have to determine
that these people have

336
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,138
our best intentions in mind.

337
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,953
And if they don't,
then, we'll correct 'em.

338
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,947
You can't talk about the history of film

339
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,049
without talking about
the history of censorship.

340
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,400
And most people'd see Will Hays
with this sort of first

341
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:38,322
formal attempt
on the part of the industry

342
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,925
as a whole to institute self-regulation.

343
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,160
<i>News on the march!</i>

344

<i>The Roaring Twenties choke

345

351
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,391
<i>hiring post master general Will Hays</i>

352

<i>to restore decency to the movies,</i>

00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:09,412
<i>by implementing a strict
production code.</i>

354
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:13,365
But, in the 1950s,
you have a handful of films that...

355
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:15,449
get released, that...

356
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:18,262
... challenge the PCA.

357
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:19,929
The first is "The moon is blue".

358
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,658
You won't mind coming up, will you?

359
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,799
Well, I'm not so sure.

360
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,177
Would you try to seduce me?

361
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,465
And it was clear that for Hollywood not
to look sort of

362
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,984
hoplessly antiquated,

363
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,223
they were gonna have to figure out
a new way

364
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,743
to bring reality into the movies.

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,311
How about "Hump the hostess"? Uh?

366
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:45,251
How about "Hump the hostess"?

367
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,910
Wanna play "Hump the hostess"?

368
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,126
- Calm down!
- You want to wait till later

369
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,474
- off in the bushes.
- Hump the hostess!

370
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,728
Shut up, will you?

371
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:55,823
The language in "Virginia Woolf"
was really shocking and new.

372
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:59,663
And I think it's really
what inspired Jack Valenti

373
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,913
to come up with the MPAA rating systems.

374
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,538
<i>No film can ever survive</i>

375
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>the blaze and hiss of public scorn.</i>

376
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:09,975
When Jack Valenti became
president of the MPAA,

377
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,454
back in, I guess, 1966,

378
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,722
he came from Washington,
he came from the President's office,

379
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,206
where he'd been Lyndon Johnson's man.

380
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:23,347
And he became the man of Lew Wasserman

381
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,053
and of the other owners of Hollywood.

382
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:29,408
He came to serve their interest.
He came as their lobbyist.

383
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,887
The fact that he did come out
of Washington,

384
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,708
I think was, you know...

385
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:38,617
Hollywood felt comfortable
that he could protect them

386
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,983
from the people that he knew back there.

387
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,389
Because he was a Washington insider.

388
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:47,049
And in Hollywood, when you ask
what their economic interest

389
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:49,933
had to do with ratings...

390
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:52,847
If there weren't ratings,
and there was censorship,

391
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:56,115
there would be 50 different
censor boards.

392
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,136
In my opinion, the MPAA uses
the fear of government's censorship

393
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:03,036
to keep power in control in the...

394
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,809
motion picture industry.

395
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:07,932
If you look at the
Supreme Court decisions, key decisions,

396
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,959
in the 1950s and 1960s,

397
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,678
there is no real threat
of governement censorship...

398
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:17,114
... at the motion picture industry
after that time,

399
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,124
except for the area
of child pornography.

400
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:21,117
It'd be better
if the goverment came in.

401
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:23,308
I mean, it's wrong for the government
to come in,

402
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,322
but if those were the 2 options,
you'd rather have the government in.

403
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,703
Because, whatever the government does,

404
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:32,145
is subject at least
to some kind of judicial review.

405
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,883
The current rating system
is unconstitutional.

406
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,720
If somebody wanted to mount a
constitutional

407
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,344
case against it...

408
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,634
It's an agreement.
An industry agreement.

409
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:45,656
Now, the industry's never been
competitive. It's always been collusive.

410
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,524
Really from the very beginning,

411
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:50,067
the studios were vertically
integrated monopolies.

412
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,218
They controlled development,

413
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:54,593
production, post-production,

414
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:57,274
distribution and exhibition.

415
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,944
There were two big strikes.

416
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,687
There was the 1941 Disney strike,

417
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,070
in which labour won
sort of a fairly clear victory.

418
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,863
And then, you had the 1945
Warner Brothers strike,

419
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:11,527
in which you had the battle
between the two big industry unions.

420
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:13,913
And you had the studios hiring scabs,

421
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,503
and you had high-powered water hoses
used on picketers.

422
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:21,882
And one way of dealing with
these increasingly powerful unions,

423
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:23,730
was to make

424
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,692
participation membership
in a union dangerous.

425
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:29,586
<i>Calling the House Un-American
Activities Committee to order,</i>

426
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:33,614
<i>chairman Jay Parnell Thomas,
of New Jersey, opens an inquiry</i>

427
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,897
<i>into a possible communist penetration
of the Hollywood film industry.</i>

428
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,329
So, during the "Black list",

429
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:42,527
the two questions that were asked
routinely at the hearings were:

430
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,850
<i>Are you a member of the communist party?</i>

431
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,460
<i>And have you ever held any position
in the screenwriters guild?</i>

432
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,448
First of all,
asking the 2 questions together

433
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:52,538
suggests there's a connection
between the two.

434
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,778
And asking the second question

435
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,487
makes saying "yes"
a very dangerous act.

436
00:22:57,648 --> 00:23:00,610
So, to confess seems the wrong word,

437
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,586
but to confess membership in the union

438
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:05,677
would be tantamount to accepting

439
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:07,688
a life sentence of "Black list".

440
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:10,276
People generally
associate this with McCarthyism

441
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,151
but it had nothing to do with McCarthy.

442
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,411
Once the MPAA got on board
the MPAA did it all themselves.

443
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,586
And the "Black list" was implemented by

444
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,979
the very body
that controlled the industry.

445
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:23,054
<i>There is no subversive propaganda
on the american screen,</i>

446
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:24,832
<i>and there isn't going to be.</i>

447
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,240
<i>Communists hate our films.</i>

448
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,531
<i>Because they show a way of life
that they hate.</i>

449
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,879
<i>A life where free men work</i>

450
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:35,178
<i>and play in the ways of freedom.</i>

451
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,820
The MPAA's always been about
public relations,

452
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,901
making sure everybody in America
is happy with the movie industry.

453
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,429
Movie industry appears
socially responsible,

454
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,308
the movie industry appears to care about
everyday americans.

455
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:52,103
Well, the MPAA is composed of

456
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,460
the seven largest producers of

457
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,818
of film and television in the world,
the old great studio names.

458
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,206
And I've been the head of it
for 34 years.

459
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:04,568
My greatest achievement
as head of the MPAA is:

460
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:05,859
I survived.

461
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,105
<i>He's got the whole world in his hands.</i>

462
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:17,316
<i>He's got the whole world in his hands.</i>

463
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,638
When I left the board,
it was brought to my attention I was,

464
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,818
expected to be... remain
completely silent about

465
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,912
any of my experiences
on the rating board.

466
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:03,051
I suddendly was offered,

467
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:06,856
a large increase in my salary.

468
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,255
"But here, sign this",
and lo and behold, there was another

469
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:13,918
"You may not, ever,

470
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,871
"say anything, write anything etc,

471
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,958
"without Jack Valenti's permission."

472
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:24,233
One thing that I've learned in my long,
and some would say checkered career,

473
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,568
is that in Hollywood and Washington,
there are no secrets.

474
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,176
If somebody thinks there is a secret,
there isn't!

475
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:36,753
"You shall not, during the term
of your employment, or thereafter

476
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,161
"disclose to any other person,
firm or corporation,

477
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:43,063
"nor use in any way

478
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,590
"related to the MPAA,

479
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,086

or be calculated to cause

480
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,895
"injury or loss to any
of the above mentionned."

481
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:54,064
When I asked Joan Graves
that they could put in writing

482
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:56,515
what specific forms of information

483
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:58,339
they considered confidential,

484
00:25:58,442 --> 00:25:59,719
they refused to do that.

485
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:02,317
- Really?
- Yeah. And they said:

486
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,729
"We deliberately leave the...
what's in writing fuzzy

487
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,972
"so that in any time, we can use
our discretion as far as...

488

489
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:14,207
"what we consider to be
too much information.

490
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:17,621
And they indicated that they would not
hesitate to sue

491
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,254
if they felt that...

492
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,961
there was injury to their interest.

493
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:32,302
<i>Thank you for calling the MPAA.</i>

<i>Please, enter the first three letters

500
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:57,214
I thought we would get
more matches on this.

504
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,525
The ratings!

505
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,755
This is what I think is a rater.

506
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,575
- That's a camera, right?
- Yeah.

507
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,645
It's just something
I could put on my shirt?

508
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,042
Could you walk into a restaurant,
with it?

509
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,848
What's your range? Your wide range?

510
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:32,769
- It looks like this.
- That's good.

511
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,801
We'll take this one,
and *

512
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,330
- Okay?
- Yeah.

513
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,914
So now, today, you wanna...

514
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,195
You wanna come in,
or you wanna *.

515
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,033
- Are you very cold?
- Yes, she is.

516
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,023
But she is gonna be wearing...

517
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:57,060
It looks like a button
if you're not really...

518
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,171
Show it!

519
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,085
- Look at this.
- That's the camera but

520
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:04,046
- it looks like a little button.
- It looks like a button on a scarf.

521
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,709
We did it last night.
You wouldn't believe what we were doing.

522
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,017
Let's see the back.

523
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,895
We just had the wire to go in here,

524
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,745
and the reason why I wanted to do it
in a scarf is because

525
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,642
if the camera is high or too low,
you just pull the scarf up or down.

526
00:28:16,884 --> 00:28:19,268
Everything is hooked up
to that camera, inside.

527
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:20,465
Okay, sounds cool.

528
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,107
Okay, it is 12:30, so...

529
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,047
they're gonna come out before 1:30.

530
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:28,955
Becky, look !

531
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:32,812
Oh, okay.
We got a car, here.

532
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,872
This is a Honda... 417.

533
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:39,405
Okay, we got another one. We got
someone coming out of the alleyway.

534
00:28:39,505 --> 00:28:41,460
That's Mary Ann Constanza, right there.

535
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,127
*They go through that light.

536
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,691
Shit!

537
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,697
They're way ahead of me, now.

538
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:51,934
Now, I think we lost her.

539
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:55,357
So I think I'm gonna turn around and
go back and try to catch someone else.

540
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:02,896
A couple of people... 4DON

541
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,917
Oh, lot of peo...
lot of women.

542
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,538
We need to go for this one.

543
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,499
There's four women.

544
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,569
Which is even better.

545
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,826
Now, they may not be raters,

546
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,216
but I have a good instinct,
and I feel good about it.

547
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,801
Watch them, Lindsey.
Keep an eye on 'em.

548
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,157
Can you see 'em?

549
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,261
Right there, at the corner.

550
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,979
They're going to Highlands.

551
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,928
They're parking at the meter.

552
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,742
These are raters.
I can feel it.

553
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,297
You're okay, Lindsey?

554
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:39,456
Okay, we're gonna let them go in
before us.

555
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:40,560
Hold on.

556
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:45,557
You gotta fix your scarf, Lindsey.

557
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:48,839
Can you see them behind me?

558
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:52,577
No, I can't see any one of them.

559
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:55,915
Maybe you can get a better shot
if you move over.

560
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,196
No, I still can't see them.

561
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:04,265
Maybe you can get them later.

562
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:11,390
They were talking about
editing one of the films.

563
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,331
That they should edit a certain part.

564
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,623
- That's all I could get.
- Right.

565
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:17,850
I was lucky I got that much.

566
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,365
- Did we get the license plates?
- Yes, we got that.

567
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:24,555
So... But we don't know who they are.
It's the problem.

568
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,715
No, but you know what?
They're so casual.

569
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,664
They were talking... loud.
Like... normal!

570
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:32,797
And then, when they sarted talking
about all of that, they got very quiet.

571
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,312
Lindsey, did you get a shot
of 'em as you were coming out?

572
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:38,359
Yeah, I did. You want to take a look?
Here, I'll show you.

573
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:41,820
Oh, good.

574
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,233
This is a good thing.

575
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,464
Only thing is
all we're gonna know, is the name

576
00:30:47,564 --> 00:30:48,898
- of the driver.
- Right.

577
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,270
But then, they were all like:
"They had to get back!"

578
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,600
I heard one of them wondering about
what they're gonna see.

579
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:02,382
How'd you like
to "birdie" that hole, huh?

580
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:06,697
You say the word, she's yours any time.
I'll keep a running tab for you.

581
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:07,797
Nah!

582
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:11,211
What? She is not your type?
Are you kidding me?

583
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,919
I was just going to a meeting,
and I got a phone call.

584
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,124
It was the producer of the film saying:

585
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,515
"Guess what,
we got an NC-17 from the MPAA."

586
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,981
Oh, sh... And I said:
"Was it for that first scene?"

587
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,104
"No, it was because of the glimpse
of Mary's pubic hair in the 2nd scene."

588
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:26,348
I was like: "What?"

589
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,020
Just a couple of months before,
I had gone

590
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,941
to see a horror film

591
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,972
that was rated R.

592
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,898
It was a "funny" horror film.

593
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,000
And in the first ten minutes,

594
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,903
a woman gets her fake breast cut out.

595
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:46,325
And there's blood everywhere...
and that's what made me so furious.

596
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:48,434
To wanna go in and fight
for my pubic hair.

597
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:49,590
I was like:

598
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,624
"Don't tell me! I'm a mother.
Why should that movie get an R,

599
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:56,747
"and why for seeing my pubic hair
do we get an NC-17?

600
00:31:56,924 --> 00:31:59,276
"When it was this... a beautiful moment

601
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:01,634
"between two people
that had a lot to do with love?"

602
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,822
By the time we get to the scene
they found offensive...

603
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,867
These people are
committed to each other!

604
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:10,239
It's a real love story.
It's not promoting promiscuity.

605
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,221
It's about the intimacy
of that situation.

606
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:17,402
And the power of just a camera being
on your face, is what I think, caused

607
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,267
the MPAA to give that scene an NC-17.

608
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,071
That because they couldn't reach inside
themselves and realize

609
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,576
why it felt so real,

610
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,421
I think the next thing they saw
was a glimpse of Mary's pubic hair,

611
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:29,509
and they got:
"Oh! That must be it!"

612
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,401
And I don't feel anybody who saw

613
00:32:35,647 --> 00:32:37,805
the uncut version of that film
would've gotten home

614
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:40,644
and wanted to rape the next woman
on the street.

615
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,869
Or feel like they were brain-damaged

616
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:44,857
from seeing a woman's pubic hair.

617
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:46,659
I just don't know what the big deal is.

618
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,671
Everybody sees everybody naked
in the world.

619
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:51,250
We are not showing 'em
something never seen before!

620
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,759
That's what it looks like?

621
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,616
I guess.
What does yours look like?

622
00:33:04,168 --> 00:33:07,146
- Not like that!
- Yeah? Let me see.

623
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:08,699
All right.

624
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,532
They gave us an R on "Jersey Girl".

625
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,814
And it was based on a conversation

626
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:15,736
that Ben's character and Liv's character

627
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:18,401
have in a diner, about masturbation.

628
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:22,033
If it makes you feel any better,
I mean, I do it, like, twice a day.

629
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,806
Good God!

630
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,240
What can I tell ya?
I get bored easily...

631
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,508
You're gonna get
carpal tunnel syndrome!

632
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:32,116
Don't get all judgmental with me.
You're no slouch yourself!

633
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,753
For some reason,
I guess it was because

634
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:37,363
watching the movie, the MPAA
was sitting, and going:

635
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:40,497
"Liv Tyler masturbating
on a regular basis? Arwen, the elf?

636
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,826
"Can't have it!"
And they gave it an R.

637
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:45,451
And I actually spoke to Joan Graves,

638
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:47,474
who's the current head of the MPAA

639
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,054
Where are we going?

640
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,045
To your place.
We're gonna have some sex!

641
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:54,907
And she was saying: "It would just
make me uncomfortable thinking about

642
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,886
"my sixteen year old daughter sitting
in a movie theater watching that scene."

643
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,190
To which I was like so...

644
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,078
"But, Joan.
Do you think your 16 yo daughter

645
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:06,094
"hasn't masturbated already?

646
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,718
"Do you really think there's anything
in that scene

647
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:12,097
"she hasn't already tried,
when the lights go out at night

648
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:14,755
"or in the bathroom, the tub,
or with the showerhead...?

649
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,292
"I'm telling you, I'm not teaching
this broad anything new."

650
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:21,899
Well, first of all, all teenagers,
because of the Internet, have seen

651
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,659
more hardocre pornography
than their parents have seen.

652
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:28,253
They've seen the most hideous things
you can find on the Internet.

653
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,018
Believe me!
What else do you think they're doing?

654
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:33,239
Do you think they're doing
their homework upstairs?

655
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:36,463
Come on, all kids have searched
and gone deep

656
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:38,009
into web porn sites.

657
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:40,157
Who wouldn't, as a teenager?

658
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:44,637
Pretending that it's so damaging
and harmful

659
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:46,754
to their growing psyches,

660
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,250
that we have to stamp something
with a rating

661
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,471
that prevents them from seeing it,
even with a fucking parent.

662
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:55,709
We take pools every year by the
"Opinion Research Corporation".

663
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,286
2 600 people interviewed nation-wide.

664
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:00,813
And for the last 20 years,
parents,

665
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:04,377
at about 70% or more,
of children under 13,

666
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,233
find this rating system
very useful to fairly useful

667
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,755
in helping them guide
their children's viewing.

668
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:13,939
And they have these bullshit statistics
that they bring up: "78% of parents

669
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,829
"say they find the ratings very useful."

670
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:19,363
And I've always felt that because
they're the only game in town,

671
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:22,757
I mean, as compared to nothing at all,
they probably are useful.

672
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:25,030
But it's like that Tide commercial
we have.

673
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,212
The sock that's white,
and then, the whiter one!

674
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:29,692
I've always wondered:
"Look at their parents!

675
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:31,417
"There could be a real ratings board.

676
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:33,836
"Where if you are unhappy with it,
there could be

677
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:37,378
"real transparency, real accountability.
If people wouldn't like that more."

678
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,451
Sometimes, it seems quite variable.

679
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,980
You could swear to yourself that
you've seen films that were rated R

680
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,142
that had things that were far more...

681
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:49,826
problematic
than what you're asking for an R.

682
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:53,701
And the irony of it is
if it's presented

683
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:57,046
in a sort of shoulder up sort of way,

684
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:58,968
it tends to be an R.

685
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:02,290
And if the camera is further away,

686
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,105
where the perspiration doesn't show,
where...

687
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:09,320
... it's not like
right in there with them in the bed...

688
00:36:09,595 --> 00:36:12,309
But if you see a touch of hip...

689
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,554
It's that pelvic thrusting!

690
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:19,333
Oh, I think there is definitely
like a thrust number.

691
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:23,626
You really could *hear out
the people counting the amount...

692
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:26,799
- The amount of...
- Of actual thrustings.

693
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:06,983
I've always been such a fan of the

694
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,852
European filmmakers in the way
that they deal with sexuality,

695
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:12,658
which is real people, and real bodies.

696
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:14,970
And it's just a part of life

697
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,819
and a part of human nature.

698
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,506
And I find...

699
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:22,617
... in this country,
we have kind of "desexualized" sex.

700
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:24,421
We've taken it out of...

701
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,563
the realm of a day-to-day function,

702
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:31,916
and... something that is...

703
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:35,034
... implicit in just being
a human being.

704
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,000
Because we're so afraid of it!

705
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,512
Well, the Europeans have always found
America very odd.

706
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,363
Sexual manners...

707
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:45,945
They've always found us
strangely puritanical.

708
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,612
And I remember Stanley Kubrick's
"Eyes Wide Shut".

709
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:53,208
In its R version,

710
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:55,950
they digitally superimposed

711
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,791
certain bodies or shadows

712
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:00,392
to cover offending body parts.

713
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,728
But it just seemed

714
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,505
so much ado about nothing.

715
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,159
Frankly, in 1970, you saw

716
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:16,128
probably more sexual explicitness in a
lot of movies than you'd be seeing now.

717
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:20,387
You know, there's a movie that's been
playing on TV quite a bit lately.

718
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:23,137
It's "Coming Home",
the Hal Ashby movie.

719
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:27,253
And the most amazing scene
in the movie is

720
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:29,695
Jon Voight going down on Jane Fonda.

721
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:32,472
I mean, here's a guy
that's in a wheelchair,

722
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:34,125
who's getting this woman off.

723
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,761
And she finally experiences

724
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:39,288
what might have been
her first orgasm ever.

725
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:41,528
I mean, we start to think

726
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:44,908
that it might be the first time
she's ever had an orgasm.

727
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:57,643
And it does spend a lot of time.

728
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:59,802
I mean, it's a long scene.

729
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,295
This orgasm lasts a long time, okay?

730
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,398
It's like kind of amazing.

731
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:08,228
You know,
when I see it, I'm kind of like:

732
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:12,361
"Wow! How did they get by with that
in the seventies?"

733
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:15,546
So, I do think
that it's a really good point.

734
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,057
That there is a...

735
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,505
A denial of female pleasure.

736
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:23,501
A denial of...
A denial of pleasure, period!

737
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:26,298
Male pleasure too.
I mean, you can't see...

738
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:29,302
You know, you can barely see anything
of a male body,

739
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:30,643
on the screen.

740
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,979
So... I think that
nobody gets to come, basically.

741
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,788
I think that it's what it is!

742
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,190
There was always a fear

743
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:41,016
that sex, in some ways,

744
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:45,263
would dissolve the social bonds.

745
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:47,328
Sex more than violence.

746
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:50,208
Un... Unleashed sex,

747
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:52,709
would take the society apart.

748
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,913
Of course, that focus's * now at

749
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:57,692
unleashed gay sex
would take the society apart.

750
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:06,194
"But I'm a Cheerleader"
was a movie about

751
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:08,853
gay kids who go to
a homosexual rehabilitation camp.

752
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,251
It's a comedy, it's a teen movie...

753
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,456
It's all the things
I thought kids would like.

754
00:40:14,556 --> 00:40:16,315
And I really wanted teens to see it,

755
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,483
and I feel like the most important teens
to see it are in high school.

756
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,370
In Wyoming or wherever.

757
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,635
You know... that are just feeling
like they're the only ones.

758
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:27,317
You know... Especially these kids
that are sent to these

759
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:29,975
homosexual rehabilitation camps.
Those camps are very real.

760
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:37,531
So, I got a call from
the ratings board,

761
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,834
and they said:
"You got an NC-17."

762
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:43,113
And I was really angry,

763
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:46,125
and really devastated.
And I didn't understand why.

764
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:49,831
Because there is no nudity in the
sex scene, and they're fully clothed.

765
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:52,693
It was ridiculous.
But, the really offensive thing...

766
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:55,241
At the time that I submitted it
to the ratings board,

767
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:56,853
"American Pie" had just come out.

768
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,508
I had seen the trailer a million times

769
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:02,205
of Jason Biggs masturbating
in an apple pie, in the trailer!

770
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:06,380
So, the ratings board then tells me
that in order to get an R,

771
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,445
I have to cut one of my girls

772
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:13,077
masturbating over her underwear,
fully clothed.

773
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,209
And you don't see anything.

774
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,344
Basically,
you can tell she's masturbating.

775
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,069
Ratings board is populated by

776
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:25,717
parents, normal human beings,
neither gods, nor fools,

777
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:28,801
who make errors of judgement
from time to time.

778
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:31,514
What's really offensive about that

779
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,350
is for a rater to say:

780
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,130
"We're just gonna rate this film
like an average american parent."

781
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,277
Who is that?
I'm an american parent.

782
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,459
I'm a lesbian, I live in Los Angeles,
I'm a filmmaker,

783
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,919
I have a daughter, I'm a parent.
I pay taxes.

784
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:48,287
Is there anyone on the ratings board
who is a parent like me?

785
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,578
I highly doubt it.

786
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,977
Were there any gays or lesbians
on the board during your tenure?

787
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,409
Well, you know, to my knowledge...

788
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,853
There weren't any...

789
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:09,620
... that were

790
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:13,746
self-proclaimed homosexuals
on the board while I was there. No.

791
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,133
You know, if it's the same gender sex,

792
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,170
they seem to often have a bigger problem

793
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,053
than they do if it's a man and a woman.

794
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,770
But, if you are of the majority,
then, it's a lot easier

795
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,761
to get the good rating

796
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:44,024
and throw your movie
in the theater.

797
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:08,280
This whole house is just my savior.

798
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,043
I make my living here,
I have my best friend here...

799
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:14,442
I have all my peace here,
and I feel safe.

800
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:17,598
And you live, you both right here?

801
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:18,987
- Yeah.
- That's nice...

802
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:21,751
We both got divorced at the same time.

803
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:25,527
My son was five,
her daughter was five.

804
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:29,432
And we just moved in together,
we've been there ever since.

805
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:32,610
So I always call her daughter
my daughter, 'cause I feel like she is.

806
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,402
I raised her when she was five, so...

807
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,976
When I was growing up,
the word "lesbian" and "gay" was bad.

808
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,124
It was a sin, it was something
you just didn't do.

809
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,569
I always seemed to be more attracted
towards women, and...

810
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:51,409
... girls.

811
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,648
Yes, it was girls, then...
5 VXE

812
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,890
CHE

813
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:01,067
And then, one day, may aunt said
she thought I was a lesbian.

814
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:03,137
And that just freaked me out.

815
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,199
And that was not gonna be acceptable.
I was like: "Oh, my God!"

816
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:11,264
So, I met Ross a few months later,

817
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,735
and just felt I needed to get married

818
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:16,008
and do whatever everybody
wanted me to do.

819
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,381
And after about 6 years
of marriage,

820
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:21,012
I met a woman on a military base,

821
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:24,209
and just brought out feelings in me
I had never felt in my life.

822
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,056
And, one day, I'm just like:

823
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:30,511
"How could something that makes me feel
so good be wrong?"

824
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:33,718
And I was just telling Lindsey
I love Cheryl

825
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:36,391
more than I could ever imagine
loving anyone in my life.

826
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:39,097
She is everything to me.
She is my best friend.

827
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:43,212
I just could never imagine
being with anybody else.

828
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,907
And if someone told me: "You have to be
with a guy. You can't do this."

829
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:50,119
Then I would rather just be alone
than to...

830
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,333
... not have that complete fulfilment.

831
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:57,898
GNCH

832
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:03,017
Oh, my God,
This one matches up. That one.

833
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,407
- Joan Graves?
- Yeah. Joan Graves.

834
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:35,634
I felt that it's somewhat
detrimental to have

835
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,991
a manager who holds
hiring and firing power

836
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:42,814
to be sitting there in judgement

837
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,924
of people's rating decisions.

838
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,023
So, yeah, he could be very

839
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:50,021
kind of unyielding and intolerant

840
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:53,894
and really... tried to intimidate us

841
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:57,658
into sort of going along with
what the majority point of view was.

842
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,087
Sometimes, people really inclined
to try to pull rank

843
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:04,979
and that sort of thing is problematic.

844
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,510
How would they pull rank?

845
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,258
Well, just the attitude.
In the attitudes.

846
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:11,780
You know, say:

847
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,412
"That's out of line

848
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:16,053
"with the way that film
should be rated."

849
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,991
Sort of categorically,

850
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:21,193
you need to get with the group think.

851
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:23,780
If there was a tie, though,
- which I think it could be

852
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,664
because sometimes, we had 8 people,
so it could be 4-4 -

853
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:29,489
and then, the chairman of the board
could really...

854
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,500
kind of make...
Arbitrarily, he makes the decision!

855
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,495
And usually, when I was on the board,
he was gonna make the decision for the

856
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:39,991
more restrictive rating,
the more conservative rating.

857
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:43,003
- But, he voted? Didn't he...
- Yes, yes!

858
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:45,665
So, he was one of the votes,

859
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:47,811
and there was no kind of

860
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:50,693
other method
for any kind of tie-breaking.

861
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:52,346
It was just sort of...

862
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,011
He had the right to do what he wanted,
in that case.

863
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:59,845
And frankly, he had the right
to do what he wanted even.

864
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:02,744
'Cause I was amazed,
in one case, that...

865
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:04,219
it'd been voted

866
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,059
like a five to three in favor of the R

867
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:10,820
and then, we found out that

868
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,626
the movie was being cut!

869
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:17,874
So I was like puzzled.
I said: "I don't understand that!

870
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:20,174
"If it already got an R,
why is this happening?"

871
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,663
So, one of the board members said:
"Well,

872
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:25,891
"we don't object to cuts
to make it a better R."

873
00:47:39,404 --> 00:47:42,160
It's just two puppets
in sexual positions.

874
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,880
The whole joke is that.
What kids have done for years.

875
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,998
Take your GI Joe, and your Barbie and...

876
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,387
The first thing that came back
to Paramount was:

877
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:56,908
"You can have the missionary,
and her on top. That's it."

878
00:47:57,786 --> 00:48:00,670
We were just like:
"That's not a joke. That's nothing!

879
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,153
That's 2 positions.
You can't make a scene out of it.

880
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,510
But we purposely left in
stuff you don't even want in the scene.

881
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:13,951
'Cause you have to give 'em
something to cut so they

882
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:15,850
feel like they pissed on it, somewhat.

883
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,776
So, we left the sex scene...

884
00:48:17,876 --> 00:48:20,713
We put in *
every second of footage we cut.

885
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:23,234
Four minute like sex scene.
It's just ridiculous.

886
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,422
It's not the way it should've been cut.
It was bad.

887
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:27,026
Wasn't even good for the movie.

888
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:29,085
We ended up shooting extra shots

889
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,238
we didn't even want to put in there.
But we did.

890
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,398
"If you push the line way back so maybe
they'll only cut to here" kinda thing.

891
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:42,696
I also had heard on "A dirty shame",
and I have no proof of this,

892
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,872
that there were doctors involved,

893
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:49,027
and that some of the kinkier terms
like "felching" and stuff,

894
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,127
*this explained to the MPAA
what "Felching" meant.

895
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,957
Now, I would like to have heard that,
because,

896
00:48:56,442 --> 00:48:59,013
"felching",
no one has ever done "felching".

897
00:48:59,113 --> 00:49:00,695
"Felching" is when you...

898
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:04,774
fuck someone and suck your own cum
out of the very asshole.

899
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,727
I know a lot of perverts,

900
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:09,869
and I don't know anyone that's done it.
And I said that, at my appeal.

901
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:12,445
No, I didn't say what "Felching" was,

902
00:49:12,545 --> 00:49:14,334
but they supposedly had been told.

903
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,847
And I was gonna say, if they'd come up
with what they'd heard about it:

904
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:20,541
"No that's farting in the bathtub
and biting the bubble."

905
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:23,876
Who can approve what this really is?

906
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:43,458
So, my contract said
it had to be an R rating.

907
00:49:43,558 --> 00:49:47,347
And I said: "Oh, come on!
It's a non-explicit american comedy.

908
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:49,103
"It's a Tracy Ullman, for God's sake!

909
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:51,160
"This is not a real dirty movie."

910
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,756
So, I sent it. I was a little nervous,
I got the call,

911
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:56,554
and they said: "NC-17."
And I said:

912
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,957
"I'm kinda really surprised."
The man answered:

913
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:00,563
"You are surprised?"

914
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,443
And I said:
"What can I cut?"

915
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,839
And they said: "Honnestly,
we stopped taking notes.

916
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:09,748
That's when my blood turned to ice,
because that's what you fear the most.

917
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:13,409
When they say: "From overall,
that's the reason, which means..."

918
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,029
And they said: "There is a thousand
brush strokes in this,

919
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:17,482
"you can't cut ten."

920
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:19,713
And, I was very...

921
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:23,365
I think fair about sexuality.
I was responsible.

922
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:25,691
I made safe sex.
It might be perverted,

923
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:28,827
but it's safe: you can't get pregnant,
or get AIDS, what's the matter?

924
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:31,143
I think,
from what I've * read now,

925
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,512
in 8th grade, girls give blowjobs
routinely.

926
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:38,083
If I was a parent, I hope they were
"sploshing" instead of giving blowjobs.

927
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:42,321
"Sploshing" is the erotic urge
to dump food in your private area.

928
00:50:42,563 --> 00:50:44,538
I think you ought to hope
your children

929
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:46,540
are doing perverted sex acts
with food.

930
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:50,148
Now, right when
"A dirty shame" was rated, about

931
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:52,605
a week or two before the Iraq pictures

932
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:54,516
had been released, from the prison,

933
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:58,500
nobody was in a great mood about making
jokes about weird sexuality.

934
00:50:58,752 --> 00:51:02,419
I think that had something to do with
it. It could have been *a weird one.

935
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,232
But I think what they'd said to me
this time this rating was:

936
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:10,135
"Not only can't you make a movie
where you'd show sex all over,

937
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,789
"you can't even talk about sex
all through it."

938
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,937
That's new to me, it seems.

939
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,092
I've been running background checks

940
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:24,795
on the photo prints for possible raters.

941
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:26,753
And I don't think they are raters.

942
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:30,636
I think they're probably working
advertising or anti-piracy.

943
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,959
Is the guard gone?

944
00:51:43,638 --> 00:51:46,218
He's using their time
to chat on the phone.

945
00:51:48,374 --> 00:51:51,678
Oh, my gosh, there is extensions
hanging on the wall.

946
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,462
- What? In his booth?
- Are you serious, Becky?

947
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:57,222
- Yes! You see it?
- No.

948
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,916
Okay, you see the phone
hanging in the window?

949
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,017
- In his booth?
- Yeah, look at the window.

950
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,289
- Okay.
- Can you see the phone?

951
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,890
Right above, there is a list.

952
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,275
And it's got names of extensions.

953
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:11,438
I wonder if I can get it
with my camera.

954
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,823
Look, the security guard's leaving.
What are the chances of that?

955
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,116
Let's go, Lindsey.

956
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:36,314
While I'm filming, you watch for me.
Make sure nobody's coming.

957
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,008
Check it out. Nobody is here.

958
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:53,385
- Becky, you got that?
- Yes, but not enough.

959
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:55,459
There are all kinds of stuff, in there.

960
00:52:56,697 --> 00:52:59,987
They have memos,
and office extensions.

961
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,697
- But what was on the list?
- Everybody's names and extensions.

962
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:07,410
But I don't know how *get *.

963
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,397
Hi, good morning.
I'm trying to reach Joann Yatabe, and

964
00:53:18,497 --> 00:53:21,264
and I keep getting her voicemail.
Is she in a screening, right now?

965
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,377
What time do you think they'll be out?

966
00:53:24,757 --> 00:53:25,956
9:30.

967
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,300
Okay, and they come out for a break?
Thank you, bye bye.

968
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:36,850
It's like a puzzle.
You just start with one piece,

969
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,481
and you gradually just slowly
put it together

970
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,867
until you come up with the full picture.

971
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:45,253
- What time is it, now?
- 17:39.

972
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:47,323
17:39? They must have a

973
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:49,830
a long movie that they're watching.

974
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,065
- Yeah.
- Here's somebody.

975
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,876
She has a Jag... There she is!

976
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:57,477
- Yatabe?
- Yeah.

977
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,552
Look at the plates,
just to make sure.

978
00:54:00,652 --> 00:54:03,455
I'm sure it's her. She's the only one
who has a pink Jag.

979
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:07,709
I don't wanna get too close to her,
but I don't wanna lose her, either.

980
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,138
I need to put on
my safety belt.

981
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,748
- She turned.
- *.

982
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:20,025
- Maybe.
- This is weird.

983
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:23,482
Maybe she's driving in
to see if we're following her.

984
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:26,049
Did she seem like she knew
she is being followed?

985
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:26,949
No.

986
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:33,175
- We should get outta here.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna lose her.

987
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:35,621
I just wanna make sure
there's no other way out.

988
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,153
- There she is.
- She picked someone up.

989
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:39,651
She's right there.

990
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:45,537
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop here.

991
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:48,859
They went into the "Chicken place".

992
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,996
Well, we're going in,
to sit by them,

993
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:53,552
eat some little, to see what
they're talking about.

994
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,571
- And get a shot?
- And get a shot.

995
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:00,909
Hello?

996
00:55:04,686 --> 00:55:07,653
Becky's camera isn't working.
I've gotta get that shot.

997
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:48,453
Kirby, you almost got us caught.

998
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,525
- You serious?
- Oh, my God!

999
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:53,038
- Did you see me go talk to 'em?
- What happened?

1000
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:55,335
Because they were going:
"Look at that man!

1001
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,054
"What's this weirdo? What is he doing?
Is he filming us?"

1002
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,162
I was like:
"My God, what am I gonna do?"

1003
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:03,004
So, I jumped out and go:
"Do you know him?

1004
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:05,527
And they're all: "No, do you?"
I go: "No!"

1005
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:08,433
And they go: "Only in LA
you can find someone that weird."

1006
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,317
Is that a gram?

1007
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:17,006
New card.
What do you think?

1008
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,743
Oh, very nice.

1009
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,627
Look at that!

1010
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,708
Picked them up from the printer's,
yesterday.

1011
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:26,566
- Good coloring.
- That's bone.

1012
00:56:27,078 --> 00:56:29,779
And the lettering is something called
"Silian Rail".

1013
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:32,008
It's very cool, Bateman.
But that's nothing.

1014
00:56:32,248 --> 00:56:33,407
Look at this!

1015
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,350
So, we finished the film,
we presented it

1016
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,905
and we had a call back that
the board objected.

1017
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:42,151
And they wanted to give it an NC-17

1018
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:44,369
as they objected to
the entire tone of the film.

1019
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,920
We started to laugh, 'cause, you know,
how do you change the tone of a movie?

1020
00:56:48,443 --> 00:56:50,689
And then... there was, you know...

1021
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:52,830
The ratings board is not a monolith.

1022
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,642
There are differing shades of opinion.

1023
00:56:55,742 --> 00:56:58,037
There was a lot of back and forth
at the discussion.

1024
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,666
And then, it came down
to really a few things.

1025
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:04,003
Chainsaw scene, which I thought
would be an issue,

1026
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:06,651
the axe murder, you know...
That was fine.

1027
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:08,623
It was basically just sex.

1028
00:57:08,754 --> 00:57:10,269
It was the three-way sex scene.

1029
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:15,766
It was particularly the rear entry sex.

1030
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:19,766
Any unusual forms of sex I think
are a problem for the ratings board.

1031
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:22,314
Why do you think they had a problem
with these scenes?

1032
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:24,961
I think maybe because
porn is very clear.

1033
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:27,283
You absolutely know where you are
with porn.

1034
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:30,020
It's a straight, you know...

1035
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:32,622
graphic depiction of sex for a purpose.

1036
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:36,552
And then, you know where you are with
entertainment, because it's kind of...

1037
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:40,874
escapist and romanticized.

1038
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:44,201
It takes you into another dream world.

1039
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:46,559
And then, art movies tend to

1040
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:50,549
rub your face in things, they tend
to more challenge you or disturb you.

1041
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:54,003
The fact is that this whole controversy
is whether or not you can

1042
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,302
make a dozen more adult pictures
a year...

1043
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:59,357
I don't think many parents
are gonna fret because their children

1044
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:01,460
can't see a sex orgy on a screen.

1045
00:58:01,702 --> 00:58:04,821
What strikes you immediately
about the MPAA,

1046
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:07,907
and I'm sure I am like
the 300th person to say this,

1047
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:13,133
is how much more they seem
to be concerned about sex

1048
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,034
than they are about violence.

1049
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,455
Whereas the movie rating systems
in Europe

1050
00:58:17,555 --> 00:58:19,134
have the exact opposite view.

1051
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:21,638
Much more open about sexual depiction,

1052
00:58:21,738 --> 00:58:25,670
much more restrictive about
violent depiction than the MPAA.

1053
00:58:25,997 --> 00:58:27,815
If you see a movie like "Sin City",

1054
00:58:27,915 --> 00:58:29,956
which is R rated and...

1055
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,325
it's just full of dismemberments,
decapitations,

1056
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,661
the most grisly kind of violence.

1057
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,429
But that gets an R.

1058
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:39,268
And yet, you see

1059
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,166
a film like "The dreamers",

1060
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:44,429
which is sex among three young people

1061
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:47,273
and not even explicit hardcore sex.

1062
00:58:47,515 --> 00:58:49,742
And that still is rated NC-17!

1063
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,539
The fact is it's not true.

1064
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:53,433
Most pictures that get

1065
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:57,516
an NC-17 rating, the adult rating,
have to do with violence.

1066
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:10,513
But it just seems backwards that...
to show human sexuality

1067
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,709
in pretty much any form...

1068
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,218
... is getting to art territory.

1069
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:21,159
While you can shoot as many bodies

1070
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,087
as long as there is no blood.

1071
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:26,605
And it's PG-13. I mean, what are we
training our kids for?

1072
00:59:27,555 --> 00:59:30,916
You're not showing the result
of what happens when you fire a gun.

1073
00:59:31,158 --> 00:59:32,778
So I think it should be flipped.

1074
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:36,343
If you show violence without blood,
it's like fantasy,

1075
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:38,988
and the only people that can
handle that, intellectually

1076
00:59:39,088 --> 00:59:40,178
are adults.

1077
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:44,096
But if you show violence with blood,
it should be a PG-13,

1078
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:47,800
so that people can actually realize
the result of what it actually does.

1079
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,956
If I were to create a rating
system, I'd put...

1080
00:59:51,117 --> 00:59:53,947
I wouldn't even put murder
right at the top of the chief offences.

1081
00:59:54,047 --> 00:59:56,558
I'd put rape
at the top of chief offences.

1082
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:59,650
And assault against women.
Because it's so

1083
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,991
insanely overused and insulting.

1084
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:05,249
How much it's overused in movies
as a plot device:

1085
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:07,605
a woman in peril.
That, to me, is offensive.

1086
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:09,225
That's shit cakes.

1087
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,948
We studied 98 of the 100
top grossing films

1088
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,651
from 1994, for this particular study
on the ratings system.

1089
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,745
And what we discovered was that

1090
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:43,656
they aren't doing a very good job
at discriminating for violence.

1091
01:00:48,304 --> 01:00:50,854
The film industry is engaged
in producing a product

1092
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:54,762
and for very fundamental reasons,
violence sells.

1093
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:57,776
Especially to their target demographic.

1094
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:03,474
But... it's not coincidental that
that target demographic

1095
01:01:03,574 --> 01:01:06,713
is also the most at risks
for violence in american society.

1096
01:01:14,428 --> 01:01:16,170
You remember Columbine?

1097
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,610
As soon as Columbine occured,
Jack and the others

1098
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:23,603
circled the wagons,
and defended the industry.

1099
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:25,870
And Jack said:
"Nobody knows

1100
01:01:26,709 --> 01:01:28,531
"what the impact of

1101
01:01:29,613 --> 01:01:31,586
"media violence is."

1102
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:33,479
And it's true.

1103
01:01:33,841 --> 01:01:36,924
Nobody knows, point by point,

1104
01:01:37,721 --> 01:01:41,635
what the relationship is between
this act of violence

1105
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:45,085
on the screen,
and this act of violence in real life.

1106
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,567
Nobody knows cause and effect.

1107
01:01:48,236 --> 01:01:51,531
But you can, over a period of time,
get the judgements

1108
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:55,529
of the people who deal with the kids

1109
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,301
and others who commit violence.

1110
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:02,490
And their judgement, from the first
surgeon generals report on

1111
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,473
has been almost unanimously

1112
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,574
that it's a negative input.

1113
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:10,976
So we think it's not too much to ask

1114
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,876
of a group of people who have

1115
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:17,150
embraced the responsability of informing

1116
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,605
parents what's going on in films,

1117
01:02:19,796 --> 01:02:23,317
to inform themselves about
what's going on in the research

1118
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:26,425
regarding this connection.

1119
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:27,994
I'd rather have

1120
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:31,851
the person who went to medical school

1121
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:34,869
tell me something
about a medical problem.

1122
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:37,693
This person who studied psychiatry

1123
01:02:38,065 --> 01:02:40,485
to tell me what the psychiatrists
know about

1124
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:42,670
the impact upon children

1125
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,073
of violence, or sexuality or anything.

1126
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:49,886
So, I do want to bring in
expert opinion.

1127
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,950
Do you want two or three bags?

1128
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,682
- Three?
- Okay.

1129
01:03:16,347 --> 01:03:18,682
It's like a motion sensor, right there.

1130
01:03:42,983 --> 01:03:45,170
- Do you want more?
- No, that's good.

1131
01:03:45,419 --> 01:03:47,255
This usually is the fun thing.

1132
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:52,771
Interesting, a current rating.
Let me see...

1133
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:55,227
This is from Macy's, okay?

1134
01:03:56,897 --> 01:03:58,204
What's this?

1135
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,375
I don't know what it is.
It's a kind of a summary.

1136
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:05,672
Name of film.
Oh, this is... Wow!

1137
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:07,618
This is...

1138
01:04:08,664 --> 01:04:11,766
- This is a... is...
- Is that what they write up?

1139
01:04:11,942 --> 01:04:15,759
Looks like it. It looks like
a blank form, or something. Let's see.

1140
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:20,126
Here we go.
This is "Memoirs of a Geisha".

1141
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:23,710
From this, it gets a PG-13.
Sex and art nudity, okay.

1142
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:26,279
"Chiyo peeks in on Hatsumoto

1143
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:28,399
"having sex with boyfriend in her room.

1144
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,276
"He's on top, gyrating around
and stops when he spots Chiyo.

1145
01:04:32,553 --> 01:04:35,255
"Mrs. Nitta sticks her hand
into Hatsumoto's robe

1146
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:37,398
"and inserts her fingers
into her vagina."?

1147
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,547
- And that got a PG?
- That got a PG-13!

1148
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:42,941
"She removes her hand and shows her wet
fingers to prove she's just had sex."

1149
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:44,155
Oh, my God!

1150
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:47,665
OK, and then,
look we have "Get Rich or Die Tryin".

1151
01:04:47,765 --> 01:04:49,771
That's coming out, I think next week.

1152
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:51,035
Who's making that?

1153
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:55,163
This is R for strong violence, language,
some sexuality and nudity.

1154
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:59,289
Okay, sex and art nudity. "Marcus
gets up from bed between two women.

1155
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:01,788
"One woman is topless, breasts exposed.

1156
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,494
"Inside prison shower, nude prisoners,

1157
01:05:04,594 --> 01:05:06,945
"penis and ass cheeks exposed."

1158
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,191
- And they rated it what?
- R.

1159
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:11,283
- Look at that: language.
- Wait...

1160
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:14,536
"Fucks", 20+,
"Motherfuckers", 20+.

1161
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:17,439
So, what I don't understand is
who's counted the "fucks"?

1162
01:05:17,953 --> 01:05:20,509
It's a substantial loss for society

1163
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:24,093
when you think that there are people
who can be censors of anything.

1164
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:28,136
And the MPAA is one of the last vestiges

1165
01:05:28,236 --> 01:05:29,909
of a censorship system.

1166
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,550
After you watched this,

1167
01:05:36,503 --> 01:05:38,581
you're gonna go get your pop-corn

1168
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:41,007
out of the microwave,
and talk about what I say.

1169
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,314
You'll forget me by the end of this.

1170
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:46,944
When we first started shooting
"Gunner Palace",

1171
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,366
in Baghdad,

1172
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,528
the soldiers in the palace,
all that they asked

1173
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:53,497
was that I tell it like it is.

1174
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:56,368
You know,
"tell the people what our life is like".

1175
01:05:56,807 --> 01:05:58,767
Uncensored, unfiltered.

1176
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,542
This is their day-to-day,
this is their life.

1177
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:07,654
After we finished editing
"Gunner Palace",

1178
01:06:07,754 --> 01:06:10,353
we submitted it for a rating
from the MPAA.

1179
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,720
And I think about 6 weeks later,
the rating came back and it was an R.

1180
01:06:15,165 --> 01:06:17,947
It was for language, and drug use.

1181
01:06:19,728 --> 01:06:21,915
I'm gonna fuck those motherfuckers up,
man.

1182
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:27,002
That motherfucker almost hit me.

1183
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:31,519
These are soldiers in a war zone!
What do you expect?

1184
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:35,507
They're gonna say: "Oh, darn!
A mortar almost landed on me!"?

1185
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,737
This is not fiction.
This is reality.

1186
01:06:38,966 --> 01:06:42,239
These are real soldiers.
They're living in a war zone.

1187
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:44,794
The language is not gratuitous.

1188
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:48,386
We're not instructing people
to bleed off.

1189
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,668
These obscenities,
this is just their life.

1190
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,418
And it's also not scripted.

1191
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:03,009
And Joan Graves' take on this was:
"Rules are rules.

1192
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:05,903
"There's no way
you're gonna get a PG-13.

1193
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:09,731
"Gentlemen, you're simply...
You know... You're wasting our time."

1194
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,764
She also pointed out that

1195
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:14,825
if they did rate a film

1196
01:07:15,084 --> 01:07:16,764
like ours PG-13,

1197
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:19,071
that they'd hear from pressure groups.

1198
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:21,889
They would start getting calls,
letters...

1199
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:24,234
And I found this really revealing.

1200
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,018
It didn't seem so much that

1201
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,659
it's about...

1202
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:32,310
representing the majority opinion
of America.

1203
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,962
It seems more about...

1204
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:37,770
kind of bowing to pressure.

1205
01:07:38,018 --> 01:07:40,043
The worst thing that could happen...

1206
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:42,268
Well, if you had diarrhoea right now,

1207
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:44,509
that would probably
suck pretty fucking bad.

1208
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,540
This is the language that's spoken.

1209
01:07:47,102 --> 01:07:48,573
Yeah, it's horrible.

1210
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:51,872
Yes, we may not agree with it.
We might even be disgusted by it.

1211
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:55,623
But, when the Americans liberated
Buchenwald,

1212
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,858
and they saw these images,
and these heaps of people...

1213
01:07:59,315 --> 01:08:02,141
Is that PG, is that PG-13, is that R?

1214
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,445
People need to see that.

1215
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:07,549
When the little girl's running down
the road,

1216
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:08,989
in South Vietnam,

1217
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,590
burnt by napalm, and she's naked...

1218
01:08:11,862 --> 01:08:14,099
Is that PG? Is that PG-13?

1219
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:15,841
Is that R?

1220
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,489
You can't rate reality.

1221
01:08:19,092 --> 01:08:22,530
And if you can't deal with that,
then, don't send people to war.

1222
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,897
The military and the film studios

1223
01:08:30,997 --> 01:08:33,493
have colluded for more than 50 years.

1224
01:08:34,349 --> 01:08:37,812
Anytime filmmakers want
military assets,

1225
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:40,259
- ships, or tanks, or planes -

1226
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:43,661
they have to give the Pentagon
five copies of their script.

1227
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:46,482
And if there's anything negative
in the script,

1228
01:08:47,785 --> 01:08:49,930
the Pentagon wants them to take it out.

1229
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,991
And so, they negotiate, and take out...

1230
01:08:52,091 --> 01:08:54,712
any war crimes,

1231
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:57,676
or foul language, or drinking.

1232
01:08:57,937 --> 01:09:01,628
Anything that would make the military
look bad.

1233
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:04,528
And then, after the agreement is made,

1234
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:08,644
the military send a minder on to
the set when the film is being shot

1235
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,174
to make sure it's shot
the way they agreed.

1236
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,594
And then, once the film is completed,

1237
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:16,061
it has to be shown to the Pentagon,

1238
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:18,862
admirals and generals
before it's shown to the public.

1239
01:09:19,123 --> 01:09:20,811
Dozens of films haven't been made

1240
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,999
because they couldn't get
military assistance.

1241
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:25,644
So, people have no idea
what they're not seeing.

1242
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:27,871
Jack Valenti knew what was going on.

1243
01:09:27,971 --> 01:09:29,904
He was complicit, he was part of it.

1244
01:09:33,782 --> 01:09:36,463
It's just a subtle form of brainwashing.

1245
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:40,593
I believe that 50 years
of the constant drumbeat of

1246
01:09:40,835 --> 01:09:44,340
"military's good", "american soldiers
are heroic and valiant",

1247
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,194
I think has made

1248
01:09:46,637 --> 01:09:49,768
the american people more war-like
over the last 50 years.

1249
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,826
I think we need to step back
for a second and wonder

1250
01:09:52,926 --> 01:09:55,389
sort of what all this means
that 2 or 3 companies

1251
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:57,430
completely control the information

1252
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:00,025
in our country.

1253
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,216
And when we think about censorship,

1254
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:05,879
what's being censored
are scenes in movies,

1255
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:07,773
which mean nothing
to these people.

1256
01:10:07,918 --> 01:10:09,855
And of course,
what's not being regulated

1257
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:13,714
is the ways in which these corporations
control the flow of information.

1258
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:17,568
In the recording industry, the film
industry, TV industry, radio,

1259
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:18,815
press, everything.

1260
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:21,594
And by the time it's completed,

1261
01:10:21,694 --> 01:10:25,278
we have three, maybe...
maybe two

1262
01:10:25,378 --> 01:10:28,582
companies that essentially own
access to our culture.

1263
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,026
It'll be impossible to break up.

1264
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:34,834
Because the political power
of those companies

1265
01:10:35,266 --> 01:10:37,203
will be so massive,

1266
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:41,179
and they'll be willing to spend
extraordinary amounts to protect

1267
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,074
their cartel position,

1268
01:10:43,229 --> 01:10:45,711
that no government'll be strong enough
to stand up to 'em.

1269
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:51,420
I want to pay particular gratitude

1270
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,649
to the members of Congress
who're here today.

1271
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:57,578
It pleases me greately that you've come

1272
01:10:57,678 --> 01:10:59,554
and it pleases me even more

1273
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:02,220
that you've come from
both sides of the aisle.

1274
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:05,102
I was struck with Ted Stevens,
I'd never heard that before.

1275
01:11:05,202 --> 01:11:08,533
But I'd like to claim
that Ted when he said he...

1276
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:13,087
has friends on both sides of the aisle,
but he doesn't know about an aisle.

1277
01:11:14,907 --> 01:11:17,103
I... I like that.

1278
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:00,525
There is no doubt
there is a problem with piracy.

1279
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:03,932
But we've got to make sure
that we don't spray DDT to kill a gnat.

1280
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,655
And I think it's happening.

1281
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:09,636
We're not thinking about the cultural
environmental consequences

1282
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,911
from this extraordinary war.

1283
01:12:12,172 --> 01:12:15,751
A war which Jack Valenti calls
his own "terrorist war",

1284
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:17,990
against the "pirates".

1285
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,892
Terrorist war? Who are the terrorists,
here? Our children!

1286
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:22,819
We're talking about them
as terrorists!

1287
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:25,804
The people who... who are...

1288
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,196
pirates, at least in the american
imaginary, are like 17 year-old boys,

1289
01:12:30,355 --> 01:12:32,819
who are clever enough
to figure out a way to do it.

1290
01:12:32,937 --> 01:12:35,115
They're also Hollywood's best customers.

1291
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:38,637
Still! So, even though
they're pirating information,

1292
01:12:38,737 --> 01:12:40,981
they're still going to a whole
lot of movies,

1293
01:12:41,097 --> 01:12:43,630
buying a whole lot of DVDs,
soundtracks...

1294
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:44,770
So,

1295
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,894
a part of me doesn't feel
tremendously sorry for huge corporations

1296
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:52,838
that make ridiculous profits,
maybe losing a little bit of profits

1297
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:56,008
to this sort of network that actually
ultimately may end up helping 'em.

1298
01:12:56,108 --> 01:12:58,699
'Cause it just creates this sort of
constant exchange

1299
01:12:58,799 --> 01:13:00,926
about their movies
that didn't exist before.

1300
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,525
The MPAA has a very powerful
hold on the culture

1301
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,807
and the licensing system,
that they have,

1302
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:12,084
the appeals board, the ratings,
it's just part of it!

1303
01:13:12,383 --> 01:13:15,734
I mean, they are a... group

1304
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,477
that ought to have its power
withered down.

1305
01:13:18,723 --> 01:13:22,288
You are dealing with a very powerful

1306
01:13:22,388 --> 01:13:24,303
cultural censorship group,

1307
01:13:24,403 --> 01:13:26,710
that doesn't wanna be disempowered.

1308
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:29,989
And if you made those names public,
you might disempower them.

1309
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:33,110
Is there any other review group,

1310
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,379
that you can think of, in this country,

1311
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:38,285
in any industry, besides the CIA

1312
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:41,179
that is secret,
that operates in secrecy?

1313
01:13:46,575 --> 01:13:47,827
No! No...

1314
01:13:48,427 --> 01:13:52,155
If you're gonna take on
that type of a public policy role,

1315
01:13:53,557 --> 01:13:55,342
for american culture,

1316
01:13:55,442 --> 01:13:58,284
then, I don't think
that you should be hiding

1317
01:13:58,384 --> 01:13:59,890
in a veil of secrecy.

1318
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,245
I know the MPAA said they're afraid that

1319
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:04,900
these people would be under pressure.

1320
01:14:05,298 --> 01:14:07,917
But there are many people that

1321
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:10,669
have important judgements about things,

1322
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:12,807
that are under pressure, influence.

1323
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:16,662
Judges or prosecutors, school officials.

1324
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:19,096
But they all operate
in the public sphere,

1325
01:14:19,196 --> 01:14:21,313
and I think these people should as well.

1326
01:14:39,414 --> 01:14:43,023
Hi, my name is Becky and I'm calling
to confirm some names with you.

1327
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:46,356
'cause we're gonna be sending
a package off to the ratings department.

1328
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:49,976
Yeah, I have Joan, Mary Ann, Cheryl

1329
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,987
Joann, Anthony

1330
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,253
Mary, Scott

1331
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:59,944
Alex, Howard, Barry, Mathew

1332
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:02,244
Arleen, John and Dannielle.

1333
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:04,726
Is there anyone I'm missing?

1334
01:15:04,896 --> 01:15:06,032
Kori Jones?

1335
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:09,345
Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Bye bye.

1336
01:15:11,365 --> 01:15:14,360
She was so sweet she went to get
the list to make sure I had everybody.

1337
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,810
Ready, Lindsey?

1338
01:15:20,502 --> 01:15:23,007
Wait, she's getting in the 405.

1339
01:15:23,427 --> 01:15:25,293
She's going at least 90!

1340
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:29,375
- This one, get him!
- I got him!

1341
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:36,224
- He doesn't look happy.
- No, he doesn't!

1342
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,855
Got a rater!

1343
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:45,891
He looked right at us.

1344
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:48,774
Here we go, Arleen.

1345
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:51,363
She's attractive.

1346
01:15:58,298 --> 01:16:01,607
Here he is.
Get the best shot, Eddie!

1347
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,210
Time to go!

1348
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:19,075
She's walking with the white...
Right there!

1349
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:25,075
She looks different in person
than in her car.

1350
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:26,988
We have two raters, here.

1351
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:29,629
Here he is.
Right there, in front of us.

1352
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:31,250
- Yoga class?
- He did?

1353
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:33,305
Yes!
Okay, here he comes.

1354
01:16:39,297 --> 01:16:41,072
He looks like George Lucas.

1355
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,964
Oh, it's Howard!
We finally get to see him!

1356
01:17:09,095 --> 01:17:10,986
He got a mustache, and a beard

1357
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:22,788
He's cute!

1358
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:41,377
Hi, is this the MPAA?

1359
01:17:42,184 --> 01:17:44,407
Could I have
the film ratings department?

1360
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:48,406
Yes, yes. I'd like to submit
my film for a rating.

1361
01:17:49,205 --> 01:17:52,201
It's a documentary.
It's about the film business.

1362
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:01,205
This is for the ratings board.

1363
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:03,737
- Is it gonna go up right now?
- Yes.

1364
01:18:03,837 --> 01:18:05,350
- OK, what's your name?
- George.

1365
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,059
George, OK, right. Thanks a lot.

1366
01:18:07,503 --> 01:18:09,084
How are you feeling?

1367
01:18:09,403 --> 01:18:12,712
It's strange, because you're so small,
and this organisation is so big.

1368
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:17,322
You are sort of... at the mercy of fate,
I guess.

1369
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,650
Hello?
Hi, how you doing?

1370
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:27,608
That's great.
Do you mind if I just ask you...

1371
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,193
Would you mind if we record
this conversation?

1372
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:32,551
Okay, good, fine.
Thank you very much.

1373
01:18:33,892 --> 01:18:36,383
So, was everybody able to see the film?

1374
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:38,968
<i>Yeah. I have a rating for you.
It's NC-17</i>

1375
01:18:39,068 --> 01:18:40,838
<i>for some graphic sexual content.</i>

1376
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,294
Okay, so, it's NC-17,

1377
01:18:43,889 --> 01:18:47,506
- for graphic sexual content.
- <i>"Some" graphic sexual content.</i>

1378
01:18:47,606 --> 01:18:50,110
For "some" graphic sexual content.
Okay...

1379
01:18:50,371 --> 01:18:52,631
Now, because I'm very interested

1380
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:54,619
in this being as accurate as possible,

1381
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,108
were there any
glaring inaccuracies in it

1382
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,953
that you might let me know about?
Or...

1383
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:03,887
<i>You know,
I'm not gonna comment on the film</i>

1384
01:19:03,987 --> 01:19:06,725
<i>in any other aspect
than the rating aspect of it.</i>

1385
01:19:08,526 --> 01:19:10,113
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi, how you doing?

1386
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,891
<i>You're not taping this conversation,
are you?</i>

1387
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:15,652
No, I'm not taping the conversation.

1388
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,597
- <i>Are you a parent?</i>
- I am a parent.

1389
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:19,721
<i>Do you feel there is material
in your film</i>

1390
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,615
<i>you wouldn't want your children to see?</i>

1391
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:24,058
It's really all depending on the child,

1392
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:26,728
and the context in which they see it,
actually.

1393
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,089
<i>I don't think you'd be
a very good rater!</i>

1394
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:31,610
You don't think I'm gonna be
a good rater myself?

1395
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:32,542
<i>No.</i>

1396
01:19:33,121 --> 01:19:35,776
- Do you ever do interviews at all?
- <i>No.</i>

1397
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:39,309
But why... I don't understand why
the names are anonymous, because...

1398
01:19:39,511 --> 01:19:42,117
<i>Their names are kept secret
so they can come to work every day</i>

1399
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:43,710
<i>and not feel pressure.</i>

1400
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:46,897
But it seems like the raters
you're trying to protect from influence

1401
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:50,893
actually are in direct contact with
the people who can influence them.

1402
01:19:50,993 --> 01:19:52,825
The senior raters, especially.

1403
01:19:52,925 --> 01:19:55,168
<i>They're strong people,
and I trust them.</i>

1404
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:58,317
Why can't you have an entire board
of those kind of people

1405
01:19:58,417 --> 01:20:00,263
and not worry about it,
and have it public?

1406
01:20:01,852 --> 01:20:03,632
Now that the public will know
their names,

1407
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,969
will the same raters continue to rate
the films?

1408
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:09,335
- <i>I haven't thought about that.</i>
- Well, let me ask you this:

1409
01:20:09,435 --> 01:20:12,819
- What was the vote of the raters?
- <i>We don't disclose that.</i>

1410
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:15,958
Can you tell me if it was close,
or not close, anything like that?

1411
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:17,337
<i>It wasn't close.</i>

1412
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:19,730
Could you send out the notes
that people take

1413
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,020
or whatever ratings
that the individuals...

1414
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,611
- ... raters do?
- <i>No.</i>

1415
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,333
Okay. And how many people saw it?

1416
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:28,061
<i>We don't give out that information.</i>

1417
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:31,332
And if I re-submit to try to get
an R rating,

1418
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:33,541
and I take out some footage,

1419
01:20:33,733 --> 01:20:37,471
how do I know that I won't take out
something I didn't need to take out?

1420
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,903
<i>I guess you can't know,
but if less graphic material is there,</i>

1421
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,520
<i>we could help you.</i>

1422
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:45,602
Okay. So, I formally accept the NC-17

1423
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:48,894
and I think I should probably at this
point move to the appeal stage.

1424
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,037
In your opinion and your experience,

1425
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,637
do you think I have a chance
to overturn the appeal?

1426
01:20:54,868 --> 01:20:57,970
<i>No, I don't think so.
But you are welcome to try.</i>

1427
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,338
I said: "OK, we're gonna do the appeal."
Before I call,

1428
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:03,737
we ask how it works,
and they explained the rules

1429
01:21:03,837 --> 01:21:05,771
and a woman, who's not the head woman
said:

1430
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:09,145
"We serve cookies.
Please do not get crumbs on the floor."

1431
01:21:09,245 --> 01:21:11,840
Of course, when we lost,
I wanted to crush

1432
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,851
the crumbs into the rug.
But I didn't.

1433
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:17,010
But it's a weird situation,
'cause they don't let you just speak.

1434
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,343
They say to you
you can not stand up there, and say:

1435
01:21:20,602 --> 01:21:22,228
"You know what, in "Basic Instinct",

1436
01:21:22,328 --> 01:21:25,323
"Sharon Stone opened her legs,
we saw everything, and you gave it an R.

1437
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:26,874
"Never mind, just pubic hair."

1438
01:21:26,974 --> 01:21:28,870
And then... It's not like

1439
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,505
a legal proceeding where you can quote
precedent.

1440
01:21:31,605 --> 01:21:33,139
They won't allow you to do that.

1441
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:35,856
That's what I told them:
"What other guidelines do I have?"

1442
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:38,483
"I've seen every...
I go to the movies all the time,

1443
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:41,197
"with audiences, in Baltimore.
Which is real America."

1444
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:43,680
And I think I know, I thought I know

1445
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,680
what is allowed in an R rated movie.

1446
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,003
I've seen some of these teen comedies,

1447
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,864
which I'm fine with,
but are really rude!

1448
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,525
And what anti-women in my movies,
I think?

1449
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:57,175
So, if you can not use your own history
with the MPAA,

1450
01:21:57,275 --> 01:21:59,037
what can...
What are the guidelines?

1451
01:21:59,137 --> 01:22:02,381
I only can see everything that comes out
and see what you've rated it recently.

1452
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:06,543
And then, there was a quick...
tallying of the votes

1453
01:22:06,643 --> 01:22:09,011
which... I don't know quite how
they tallied the votes.

1454
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:11,716
But then, they said:
"You did a great job.

1455
01:22:11,816 --> 01:22:13,576
"But we're sorry to say you lost.

1456
01:22:13,676 --> 01:22:15,848
"But you just lost by a margin."

1457
01:22:15,948 --> 01:22:18,287
I was so devastated,
because I had bought in to

1458
01:22:18,387 --> 01:22:20,652
the fact that this was a system
whereby I could win.

1459
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:23,542
It's kinda like the pat on the back.
You know: "Nice try."

1460
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:27,781
And suddendly, the curtain opens,
an assistant comes in, and she says:

1461
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:29,592
"It's nine to three."

1462
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:33,429
You could kind of hear
the sense of relief,

1463
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:37,136
you know, the sigh of relief
from Joan Graves, like...

1464
01:22:37,236 --> 01:22:40,485
And the assistant was like:
"It's 9 to 3. It's overturned."

1465
01:22:40,585 --> 01:22:42,758
And I think what's interesting
about our case,

1466
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:44,854
was that it was really a shock to her.

1467
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:48,115
It was like: "Number one, how dare you
come in and challenge it?

1468
01:22:48,215 --> 01:22:50,557
"And number two, how dare you win?"

1469
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,419
Is this suicide doing this?
I don't know, because

1470
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:55,821
there is only one.
I gotta go back to 'em, next time.

1471
01:22:56,324 --> 01:22:58,648
Are you concerned
that if they see you in the film,

1472
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:01,036
that they'll look differently
at your next film?

1473
01:23:03,267 --> 01:23:04,846
Yeah, I don't know...

1474
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:07,808
I don't know what
commenting on the very board

1475
01:23:07,908 --> 01:23:10,957
that has the power to give you a rating
to get out of the culture

1476
01:23:11,312 --> 01:23:13,053
is gonna do...

1477
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:16,160
How *rigid they'll be on my next film.

1478
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:17,827
I guess I would hope... not!

1479
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:23,883
Hello, this is Kirby.

1480
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:27,713
<i>I want to make sure you're aware
of the things that we don't allow.</i>

1481
01:23:28,369 --> 01:23:31,015
<i>First, you can't compare scenes
in your film</i>

1482
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:33,015
<i>to similar scenes in other films.</i>

1483
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:34,780
Well, let me ask you about that:

1484
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,716
can I compare films, as a whole, then?

1485
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,727
Compare my film to another film?

1486
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:40,648
<i>No.</i>

1487
01:23:40,843 --> 01:23:43,884
<i>Referring to any other film
is never allowed.</i>

1488
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,304
Can I go ahead and do that?
Will anything happen?

1489
01:23:46,404 --> 01:23:47,993
<i>I will cut you off.</i>

1490
01:23:48,301 --> 01:23:50,623
- You're gonna cut me off?
- <i>Yes, I will.</i>

1491
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:54,364
To restrict me in that way is sort of...

1492
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:57,165
I mean, you are part of the MPAA.

1493
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,694
They are the people that I'm...
It's their organisation that I'm...

1494
01:24:00,926 --> 01:24:02,559
sort of up against, here...

1495
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,968
And then, you're restricting
my opportunity to speak...

1496
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:09,568
It's like I'm going kind of into
a stat situation here, in a way.

1497
01:24:09,668 --> 01:24:12,795
At least... I'm actually very surprised
to hear that I...

1498
01:24:12,895 --> 01:24:15,514
couldn't actually...
I could actually get cut off!

1499
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:19,018
- I can't even make my point...
- <i>It's not like we forbade you to speak,</i>

1500
01:24:19,182 --> 01:24:22,120
<i>... but every system has its rules,
and you have to follow them.</i>

1501
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:26,192
But, do I like... Do I introduce myself
individually to each person,

1502
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:28,746
and they say: "Hi, I'm such or such,
from such..."?

1503
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:31,188
<i>No, I'm afraid we don't do that.</i>

1504
01:24:31,288 --> 01:24:33,080
Can I have a list of the people that

1505
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,435
that are there, so I know who those
people are, who made the decision?

1506
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,338
<i>No. Absolutely not!</i>

1507
01:24:38,438 --> 01:24:41,949
I can't even have a list of the people
who made a decision about my film?

1508
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:44,755
<i>No, you don't need to know those names.</i>

1509
01:24:44,855 --> 01:24:47,723
Wait a minute...
That doesn't seem right, because...

1510
01:24:47,823 --> 01:24:49,816
I mean, this is not a secret board.

1511
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:52,361
The ratings board is secret,
but this isn't secret.

1512
01:24:52,536 --> 01:24:55,408
So why can't I, at least, have
a list of those names?

1513
01:24:57,811 --> 01:25:00,764
That doesn't...
That seems like a sort of a...

1514
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,982
a Star Chamber, or something.

1515
01:25:05,618 --> 01:25:06,728
They're gone!

1516
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,911
Hello?

1517
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,917
- Hello? Where'd you go?
- <i>I'm here!</i>

1518
01:25:14,017 --> 01:25:16,737
- We were just looking at the rules.
- I see...

1519
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:20,040
But, nonetheless... Why can't
I have that list of those names?

1520
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:23,527
<i>Kirby, we choose not to make
those names public.</i>

1521
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:25,895
But it's not a secret board, is it?

1522
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:29,024
<i>I'm not going to tell you their names!</i>

1523
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:40,660
From the very beginning,
when we got our NC-17 rating,

1524
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,151
there was an undue emphasis
put on the fact

1525
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:47,046
that it was not to do
with the homosexual content.

1526
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:51,114
And that was repeated, and it made me
actually come to understand

1527
01:25:51,214 --> 01:25:53,332
that it probably was to do with that.

1528
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:54,823
Fuck, Vince!

1529
01:25:55,343 --> 01:25:58,604
We are buddies, we are pals,
we are partners, we are a duo!

1530
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:02,037
We love each other, but we don't...
fuck!

1531
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,417
The lady who was there
from the MPAA told me:

1532
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:09,430
"You're so close. If only you could
make that scene a bit fuzzier..."

1533
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:11,413
Then, she stopped and said:

1534
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:14,125
"But I'm not an artist,
I don't know how you compose that."

1535
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:18,011
And I said: "No, that's brilliant,
what you are saying! Keep going!

1536
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:21,527
"Would you like to edit my next film?
You're a visionnary!"

1537
01:26:23,217 --> 01:26:25,584
This is Denis,
from "Screen International".

1538
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:30,265
I can only say I gave it our best shot.
We really did!

1539
01:26:31,045 --> 01:26:33,323
And, what they were asking us to do...

1540
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:36,550
at this point, would've been
completely unacceptable.

1541
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,928
So, the film'll go out
as it was originally intended.

1542
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:41,787
There is nothing to do.
You can't re-appeal.

1543
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,999
We re-submitted it
in two different versions

1544
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,553
and this was the final stage.

1545
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:50,655
In this particular case, it means that
people won't be able to see the film...

1546
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:53,492
Theatrically, in many provinces
of the country.

1547
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:55,946
Yes, it was very surprising,
I must say.

1548
01:26:56,547 --> 01:27:00,425
Our FUM today said there were members
of the clergy in the room.

1549
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:04,726
They are specifically
from two denominations.

1550
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,906
Episcopalian and Catholic.

1551
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:08,713
And there is no rotating basis.

1552
01:27:08,813 --> 01:27:11,224
It's always going to be
Episcopalian and Catholic.

1553
01:27:11,485 --> 01:27:14,685
They do not vote, but they are part
of the secret discussion

1554
01:27:14,785 --> 01:27:16,403
which you are not previewed to.

1555
01:27:27,168 --> 01:27:30,342
Who is the person who's usually there
from *?

1556
01:27:30,442 --> 01:27:32,665
It is usually Joan Graves.

1557
01:27:32,765 --> 01:27:35,881
But I mean a different person
the MPAA actually... runs.

1558
01:27:35,981 --> 01:27:37,567
Usually, one of their attorneys.

1559
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:39,511
I see. Do you know their names?

1560
01:27:39,611 --> 01:27:41,817
I probably shouldn't... divulge.

1561
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:44,936
Even the chair...
That's also secret?

1562
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:48,013
Well, yes. It's probably better
if we don't mention names.

1563
01:27:48,283 --> 01:27:51,237
These two members of the clergy
are there too, right?

1564
01:27:51,373 --> 01:27:53,847
- As observers.
- Do they ever ask any question?

1565
01:27:53,947 --> 01:27:55,071
- No.
- No?

1566
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:58,207
They are not permitted,
according to the rules.

1567
01:27:58,423 --> 01:28:01,608
So they actually are totally mum,
they don't speak at all.

1568
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,826
So, what do they do,
when they're there?

1569
01:28:05,926 --> 01:28:07,872
They behave the same way as all of us.

1570
01:28:07,986 --> 01:28:11,286
They watch the movie, possibly
participate in discussion, they vote.

1571
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,871
- They do cast a vote?
- Yes!

1572
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:16,285
And there always has been clergy, since
the time that you've been there?

1573
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:19,423
What did you think about that?

1574
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:23,728
Since they were only observers, I really
didn't give it a second thought.

1575
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:28,404
What is this kind of rationnal...
behind having clergy on the board?

1576
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:32,390
I have no idea.
I guess they feel maybe they're...

1577
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:36,788
they have a horse in the race, and
they should be titled to an opinion.

1578
01:28:36,888 --> 01:28:38,648
But I don't know, obviously.

1579
01:28:38,973 --> 01:28:40,385
Why are they there?

1580
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:43,715
Frankly, I really haven't thought
about that, because I don't

1581
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:45,919
consider them part of the process.

1582
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:48,564
They are just there so...
it's sort of the...

1583
01:28:48,728 --> 01:28:51,810
... part of the wallpaper.

1584
01:28:52,511 --> 01:28:56,208
I'm already divulging a lot here that
I probably shouldn't be divulging.

1585
01:28:56,308 --> 01:28:59,246
At some point, I think I have to draw
a line, and be careful.

1586
01:29:01,534 --> 01:29:03,807
This is something that
we need you to look into.

1587
01:29:03,907 --> 01:29:05,919
This is a really important thing
we found out.

1588
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:09,233
We found out that there are two members
of the clergy

1589
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,879
on the appeals board.

1590
01:29:11,481 --> 01:29:14,140
A catholic priest
and episcopalian priest.

1591
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,807
* and they don't tell
anybody about this.

1592
01:29:17,044 --> 01:29:19,847
- Is that something you can do?
- Absolutely. I'm just curious.

1593
01:29:19,947 --> 01:29:21,741
How'd you go about doing that, though?

1594
01:29:21,852 --> 01:29:24,026
One, they would be associated
with a church.

1595
01:29:24,126 --> 01:29:26,132
- OK.
- If I run their names,

1596
01:29:26,232 --> 01:29:29,747
and if they are ministers,
the church is gonna come out.

1597
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:31,566
- Oh, I see. Cool!
- OK.

1598
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,684
I have been asked by the
National Council of Churches

1599
01:29:35,784 --> 01:29:37,906
to represent them, protestants.

1600
01:29:38,363 --> 01:29:40,797
And join forces if you will
with the Catholic office,

1601
01:29:40,897 --> 01:29:43,249
and they have representatives
in common.

1602
01:29:43,349 --> 01:29:44,721
And our role,

1603
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:46,490
is to...

1604
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:49,969
... attend the hearings for appeals.

1605
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:53,501
The relationship between church groups
and censorship

1606
01:29:53,794 --> 01:29:57,536
is apparent, palpable.
It always has been.

1607
01:29:58,052 --> 01:30:01,146
Whether be Lenny Bruce,
or whether be Comstock...

1608
01:30:01,899 --> 01:30:04,743
Valenti, wisely I think, felt

1609
01:30:05,012 --> 01:30:08,422
that this should be
a transparent process.

1610
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:11,248
But it couldn't be broadcast
to the public.

1611
01:30:11,957 --> 01:30:14,067
So, he reached the conclusion that

1612
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:16,550
religious representatives in the room...

1613
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:21,149
That would at least indicate
to the religious bodies,

1614
01:30:21,893 --> 01:30:23,939
and to the public, if they ask

1615
01:30:24,196 --> 01:30:26,631
that this is an above board process.

1616
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:29,373
There is a whole moralistic tone
to the room.

1617
01:30:29,473 --> 01:30:31,236
These are moral censors.

1618
01:30:31,336 --> 01:30:33,344
These are people
who're making judgements

1619
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:35,070
about other people's morality.

1620
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:38,195
There aren't that many places in the US
where you get that.

1621
01:30:38,423 --> 01:30:40,105
How is the vote taken?

1622
01:30:41,214 --> 01:30:42,346
It's...

1623
01:30:44,531 --> 01:30:46,422
What d'you mean, "how is it taken"?

1624
01:30:46,522 --> 01:30:48,563
How are the votes cast
in the appeal?

1625
01:30:50,624 --> 01:30:52,158
Ask *

1626
01:30:52,258 --> 01:30:55,344
Everybody know he comes to the meetings.

1627
01:30:55,748 --> 01:30:58,141
But I don't think that's a question
I should answer.

1628
01:30:58,294 --> 01:31:00,964
What is your relationship like
with Joan Graves?

1629
01:31:01,064 --> 01:31:02,960
We're friends, and...

1630
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:05,703
I respect her film knowledge,

1631
01:31:05,834 --> 01:31:08,168
and I respect the tough job
that she has.

1632
01:31:09,293 --> 01:31:11,789
She has the delicate role of trying

1633
01:31:11,889 --> 01:31:13,769
to make the filmmaker realize...

1634
01:31:14,004 --> 01:31:16,430
"Make your picture, make it work!

1635
01:31:17,607 --> 01:31:21,097
"But realize that if you go down
this road too far,

1636
01:31:22,113 --> 01:31:25,755
"you're cutting off a certain audience.
And that's your choice."

1637
01:31:26,603 --> 01:31:29,172
We don't want to restrict
the film artist.

1638
01:31:29,683 --> 01:31:31,694
We want to give the artists the freedom

1639
01:31:31,794 --> 01:31:33,832
to make the films they want to make.

1640
01:31:34,747 --> 01:31:38,041
But we do not want to make it
totally free.

1641
01:31:39,487 --> 01:31:42,932
<i>December 21st, 2005,
was the day of my appeal.</i>

1642
01:31:43,346 --> 01:31:46,159
<i>No cameras or press were permitted
inside the building.</i>

1643
01:31:46,259 --> 01:31:49,054
<i>And there was no written record
of the proceedings.</i>

1644
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:53,121
<i>The chair was Greg Goeckner,
the attorney for the MPAA.</i>

1645
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:56,729
<i>Everyone was given a badge,
with only a number on it.</i>

1646
01:31:56,971 --> 01:31:58,790
<i>My number was twenty-two.</i>

1647
01:31:59,161 --> 01:32:00,483
<i>After introducing myself,</i>

1648
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:03,286
<i>I asked for the names of the people
on the appeals board.</i>

1649
01:32:03,543 --> 01:32:05,582
<i>The chair refused my request.</i>

1650
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:08,574
<i>I then asked for the name
of the member of clergy present.</i>

1651
01:32:08,816 --> 01:32:10,809
<i>That name was also refused.</i>

1652
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:14,779
<i>When I turned to the board and asked
if anyone of them'd identify themselves,</i>

1653
01:32:15,022 --> 01:32:17,030
<i>there was complete silence.</i>

1654
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,021
<i>The chair suggested that
if I had a problem with the system,</i>

1655
01:32:20,181 --> 01:32:22,655
<i>I should send a letter to the MPAA.</i>

1656
01:32:23,116 --> 01:32:25,768
<i>I countered that it was the basic right
of any appellant</i>

1657
01:32:25,868 --> 01:32:27,918
<i>to know the people deciding
his appeal.</i>

1658
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:31,123
<i>A board member yelled out
that I was confused about the rules.</i>

1659
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,874
<i>Another shouted that I was wasting
their time.</i>

1660
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:38,152
<i>The NC-17 rating was upheld
by a ten to zero vote.</i>

1661
01:32:38,756 --> 01:32:40,723
<i>I later learned the MPAA was</i>

1662
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:44,441
<i>so afraid of exposing the names
