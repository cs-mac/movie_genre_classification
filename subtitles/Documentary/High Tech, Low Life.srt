17
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,167
So what exactly is it you want?

18
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:55,174
Look, National Shoes
is in business to make money.

19
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,136
That's right. You should
think twice about this model.

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,182
Do you really think
it will boost sales?

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,183
Hold on a second.

22
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,145
We're not losing money.

23
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,899
They're great shoes,
but they cost too much.

24
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,901
And they're old-fashioned.

25
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,028
And another thing.

26
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,905
They're too durable.

27
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,242
If shoes don't wear out,
we don't sell any.

28
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,830
Look, Gondo,
women see shoes as accessories,

29
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,957
like hats and handbags.

30
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,044
They flock to stylish designs
at affordable prices.

31
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,588
Exactly.

32
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,717
Our shoes are practical.

33
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:42,930
Women's hats don't wear long.

34
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,223
Why should their shoes?

35
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,476
You're wrong.
Shoes and hats aren't the same.

36
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,230
A woman wears
a hat on her head,

37
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,858
but shoes carry all her weight.

38
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,119
1 -0 for you.

39
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,789
Listen, you may be happy
with our product line,

40
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:14,003
but as director I have to ask
why sales have been flat.

41
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,630
That's why we're here.

42
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,549
What are you asking me to do?

43
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,303
Let me be frank.

44
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,932
We are the directors
of National Shoes.

45
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,645
I'm in charge of sales and operations.
You run the factory.

46
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,649
Ishimaru takes care of design.
Kamiya handles marketing.

47
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,817
Kawanishi is your right hand,

48
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,112
and a future executive.

49
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,451
We're all agreed
on what our problem is.

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,161
And what might that be?

51
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,621
Our president.

52
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,167
The Old Man's backward.
His dream shoe is an army boot.

53
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,963
But he holds enough stock
to dominate the shareholder meetings.

54
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,839
We can't do a thing.

55
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,258
Show him the sample.

56
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:11,352
Look at this style, this taste.
It's a sure winner.

57
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,521
Ishimaru,
this is a masterpiece.

58
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,983
And we can make them
at half the cost.

59
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,529
Well?

60
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,700
What would the Old Man say?

61
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,744
We won't let him say anything.

62
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:34,750
He may own a lot of stock,
but what if we join forces?

63
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,546
He holds 25%.

64
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,298
You three together hold 21 %.

65
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,259
Not enough to vote him out.

66
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,094
Gondo...

67
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,765
we included your holdings
in our calculations.

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,728
What do you say?
Will you join us?

69
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,733
With your 13%,
we'd have 34%.

70
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,902
More than enough
to boot the Old Man out.

71
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,949
And who'd be
the new president?

72
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:14,415
Well, you're certainly
a candidate, but -

73
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,586
But since this plan
was Baba's idea,

74
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,047
he'll be the next president.

75
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,883
You'll be executive director.

76
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,719
Fair enough?

77
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,541
The Old Man may be old-fashioned,

78
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,462
but at least he makes real shoes.

79
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,632
Yours are trash.

80
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,383
Listen to me.

81
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,139
I started as an apprentice
at National Shoes when I was 16.

82
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:16,560
Aside from time in the army,
I've spent 30 years of my life there.

83
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,981
I know every sound
and smell in that factory.

84
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:26,028
We've made many shoes.
I remember them all.

85
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,906
They were all good,
durable shoes.

86
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,743
I can't put our name
on garbage like this.

87
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,206
Listen!
This shoe wouldn't last a month.

88
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,792
There's no steel shank.

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,836
The insole is cardboard,

90
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,547
glued rather than
properly stitched.

91
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,591
The inner lining is flimsy.

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,261
You want money for this?

93
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,012
But the costs -

94
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,181
Costs are eating our profits.

95
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,267
- Business is business!
- I know that!

96
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,937
I love this business
more than I can say.

97
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,356
Shoes are my life.
I won't do slipshod work.

98
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,193
So you'll keep making
the Old Man's army boots?

99
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,864
No. He's wrong too.

100
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,377
He's wrong. We're wrong.
What's left?

101
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:29,884
I'll make my ideal shoes:
comfortable, durable, yet stylish.

102
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,596
Expensive to make maybe,

103
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,932
but profitable
in the long run.

104
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,562
How romantic.
Only we won't let you.

105
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:49,028
If we vote with the Old Man,
we can force you out.

106
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,072
Be my guest. The shareholders'
meeting is next month.

107
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,077
Kawanishi,
show the gentlemen the door.

108
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,924
Leaving already?

109
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,760
Pardon us, Mrs. Gondo.

110
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,971
Why isn't my husband
seeing you out?

111
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,520
If you'll excuse us.

112
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,585
What just happened?

113
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,379
Nothing.

114
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,798
It certainly didn't look
that way.

115
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,843
Don't worry.
You wouldn't understand.

116
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,720
It's business.

117
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:01,267
You always say that
to keep me quiet.

118
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,022
What's he got up his sleeve?

119
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,986
You're his right-hand man.
You must know his plan.

120
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:17,074
The son of a bitch, kicking us out!
Must be pretty sure of himself.

121
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,493
What's he up to?

122
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,162
Why didn't you
ask him yourself?

123
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,164
Don't be a wiseass.

124
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,583
You may not know his scheme,

125
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,587
but help us stop him
and we'll make you a director.

126
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,717
Please don't tempt me.

127
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,929
You want to be his flunky forever?
Think it over.

128
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
Jun, that's enough!

129
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,596
They're furious.

130
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,476
Will we be all right?

131
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,561
Wait and see.

132
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,856
A new round of feuding?

133
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,400
Sure looks like it.

134
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,823
They want to kick me out,
but I've taken measures.

135
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,786
They'd have to be pretty serious.
What measures?

136
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,248
I don't want to say
until everything's in place.

137
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,502
Then I'll do them all in.

138
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,007
Jun really takes after you.

139
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,594
You both love blood sport.

140
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,513
Jun!

141
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,101
Oh, Shinichi, it's you.
- I'm the sheriff this time.

142
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,438
Jun, is it your turn
to be the outlaw?

143
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,276
Well, don't run.
Hide and then ambush the sheriff.

144
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,822
A man must kill or be killed.

145
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,865
Now go. And don't lose.

146
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,624
- You get worse by the day.
- What do you mean?

147
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,918
Your attitude.

148
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,005
Success isn't worth
losing your humanity.

149
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,091
A woman can't understand.

150
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,094
This isn't about wanting
to become president.

151
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,638
I just want
to make shoes my way.

152
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,354
Yes, it is.

153
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,899
Osaka Hotel?
Did you call Osaka?

154
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,651
One moment.

155
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,528
Hello?

156
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,990
Room 310, please.
Gondo calling.

157
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,122
Hello. It's me.
How'd it go? All settled?

158
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,002
How much?
Within my limit?

159
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,504
Great work!

160
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,925
Good. Settle the deal.
And quickly.

161
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,095
Call me again when it's done.

162
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,639
I'll send the deposit tonight.

163
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,893
I'm counting on you.

164
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,523
I want you to go to Osaka.
Book a flight.

165
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,613
Use the phone upstairs.
I'm waiting for a call.

166
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,713
Is everything all right?

167
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,926
Something about this
scares me.

168
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,598
Hello. Yes, it's me.

169
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,477
It's all set?
Great, thanks.

170
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,728
Just a moment.

171
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,230
Well?

172
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,648
10:00 p.m. flight.

173
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:05,904
Kawanishi's off at 10:00
with a check for 50 million.

174
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,121
Time for a toast.

175
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,421
I kept you two in the dark,
but now I can talk about it.

176
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,717
My share isn't 13%.

177
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,887
I've bought 15% more
over the last three years,

178
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,891
and just now on the phone,
I bought another 19%.

179
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,978
That's 47%.

180
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,565
Even with the Old Man,
they only have 46%.

181
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,736
It was a risky move,
but National Shoes is mine.

182
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,658
But where did you get
that kind of money?

183
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,829
I borrowed against everything,
including this house.

184
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,835
It was hard work
raising 50 million.

185
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,382
One yen less
and Osaka would have refused.

186
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,095
Now I don't even own
the clothes on my back.

187
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,556
I've bet my entire fortune.

188
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:19,144
But wait a minute.

189
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,396
This is just
the deposit, isn't it?

190
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:26,193
That's usually one third.
Where's the other 100 million?

191
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,322
If I gain control of the company,
I'll get the rest.

192
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,625
In shock?
Have a drink.

193
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,213
Excuse me.

194
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,634
Have you seen my boy, Shinichi?

195
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,428
He and Jun are outside.
What is it?

196
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,014
I brought this for him.

197
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,685
I'll call Jun.

198
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,397
Aoki, drive Kawanishi
to the airport.

199
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,399
My flight's at 10:00.

200
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,116
Yes, this is Gondo.

201
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,579
What?
You've kidnapped my son?

202
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,665
What kind of joke is this?

203
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,709
It's not a joke.

204
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,252
Listen.

205
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,004
I have your son.

206
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,091
If you do as I say,
I'll let him live.

207
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,135
Get 30 million yen.

208
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,761
Thirty million?

209
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,055
No consecutive serial numbers.

210
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,933
- One thousand 10,000-yen notes -
- Wait a second!

211
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,856
- One thousand -
- 10,000-yen notes.

212
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,942
Three thousand 5,000-yen notes,

213
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,611
and five thousand 1,000-yen notes.

214
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,113
Total: 30 million yen.

215
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,239
Thirty million!

216
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,744
Have it ready by tomorrow.
I'll have more details then.

217
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,288
If you love your son,
don't call the police.

218
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,956
No, of course not.

219
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,625
So long, Mr. Gondo.

220
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,300
Thirty million yen?
Just hurry and pay it!

221
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,342
Get Jun back!

222
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,011
Calm down!

223
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,766
I'll get him back,
no matter what it costs.

224
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,935
I can raise more money later.

225
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,897
I'll call the police.

226
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,358
Fool!
You'll put Jun in danger.

227
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:36,198
- Kingo!
- Don't worry! It'll be all right!

228
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,244
Mom, did you call me?

229
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,746
Jun!

230
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,173
What's the matter, Mom?

231
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,510
What's going on?

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,347
What kind of sick joke is this?

233
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,524
Jun, where's Shinichi?

234
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,277
Don't know. I hid like you said,
but he never came.

235
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,946
Some sheriff!

236
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,659
Wait, Shinichi was wearing
Jun's outfit.

237
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,911
Even I got them mixed up.

238
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,164
Shinichi!

239
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,752
Call the police.

240
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,922
No, you can't!
What'll happen to Shinichi?

241
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,007
The kidnapper will realize
he has the wrong kid.

242
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,302
A chauffeur can't pay a ransom.
He'll let him go.

243
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,764
But I won't let him
get away with this.

244
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,736
- Is that the police?
- No.

245
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,405
A department store delivery.

246
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,574
Odd at this hour.

247
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,327
What the hell's
taking them so long?

248
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,875
Aoki, don't worry yourself
to death.

249
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,502
Any way you look at it,
Shinichi has to be safe.

250
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,097
Kingo, it's the police.

251
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,852
Madam, would you mind
closing all the drapes?

252
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,662
I'm Chief Inspector Tokura.

253
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,875
From the streets below,
if he has a telescope,

254
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,713
the kidnapper can see
this entire room.

255
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,175
Any other phones in the house?
- One upstairs.

256
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,094
- Are they listed?
- Just this one.

257
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,804
The phone's over there, guys.

258
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,141
We'll install a listening device
to record his calls.

259
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,813
But, Inspector,
I doubt he'll call again

260
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,149
when he realizes
he has the wrong child.

261
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,569
He may still think
he has your son.

262
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,822
Broadcast the mistake
on radio and TV.

263
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,035
If we do, he'll know
you contacted us.

264
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,411
So?

265
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,164
He warned you
he'd kill the boy if you did.

266
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,500
That's when he thought
it was my son.

267
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,835
He has to return a child
whose father can't pay.

268
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,754
You may think so,

269
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,966
but he may not.

270
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,019
Kidnapping cases are difficult.

271
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,982
The hostage is his protection.

272
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,360
On our way here
the chief told us,

273
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:05,407
"Save the child first,
then catch the kidnapper."

274
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:11,788
We must be especially careful
in this case.

275
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,460
The highest ransom ever demanded
was two million,

276
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,046
with most in the range
of 200,000 to 300,000.

277
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,008
Thirty million
is an extraordinary sum.

278
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,928
The kidnapper's extreme.

279
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,347
He may be mentally disturbed.

280
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,563
Are you the boy's father?

281
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,443
He's a widower.
It's his only child too.

282
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,070
Will you get my boy back?

283
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,365
We'll do everything we can.

284
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,410
What will you do next?

285
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,039
Wait for his next move.
It's all we can do.

286
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,418
I know how hard
it is just to wait,

287
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,129
but it's safest for the boy.

288
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,590
All set.

289
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:07,886
Have the phone company trace
all incoming calls.

290
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,637
This way, please.

291
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,434
- Where's your son, Mrs. Gondo?
- In the dining room.

292
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,646
Taguchi, ask him everything
about the kidnapping.

293
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,858
No, wait.
Nakao, you do it.

294
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,738
Taguchi might frighten the boy.

295
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,242
Taguchi,
you talk to the father.

296
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,079
Do you have a recent picture?

297
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,498
Yes. I'll get it.

298
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,050
I should drive Mr. Kawanishi
to the airport soon.

299
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,845
You're in no shape to drive.
Kawanishi, take a cab.

300
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,645
Wait. It may be
the kidnapper.

301
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,313
Upstairs phone.

302
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,108
Keep him talking.

303
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,318
We may be able to trace him.

304
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,655
Go ahead.

305
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,830
Hello. Gondo speaking.

306
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,627
Hello. Gondo speaking.

307
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,173
I got the wrong boy.

308
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,426
But before you start
celebrating, listen:

309
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,097
I don't care whose boy it is.
You're still paying.

310
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,349
You can't be serious.
Why me?

311
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,101
Don't ask questions.

312
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,689
It's simple:
Pay the 30 million or the boy dies.

313
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,190
This is absurd!

314
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,277
Exactly. It's absurd.

315
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,698
Taking the wrong boy
was a lucky break.

316
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,618
Did you know, Mr. Gondo,
that it's only extortion

317
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,999
when you threaten
a person or his kin?

318
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,544
In other words,
this doesn't count.

319
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,715
But you have to pay anyway.

320
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,135
You're a fool to pay,
but pay you must.

321
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:16,556
Who says I'll pay?
I absolutely will not!

322
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,349
You will.

323
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,519
You won't let him die.

324
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,105
You don't have the guts, Mr. Gondo.

325
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,995
He's a monster.

326
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,581
Smartest crook I ever saw.

327
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:47,754
Kidnap any child off the street,
then pick a millionaire to squeeze.

328
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,215
And he's right:
It wouldn't be extortion,

329
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,425
or even kidnapping for ransom.

330
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,596
Just simple kidnapping.
He'd get five years at most.

331
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,184
This is no joke.

332
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:11,027
I won't let him
laugh at me like this.

333
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,073
Inspector, he's not just
after my money.

334
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:19,410
He wants to humiliate me,
see me suffer,

335
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,749
make me throw away
my hard-earned money!

336
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,794
He wants to make
a laughingstock out of me.

337
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:32,006
I'll say this loud and clear:
I won't let him. I won't pay.

338
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,468
I'll spell it out next time he calls.

339
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,722
No ransom! Never!

340
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,824
Ow! Mom, that hurts.

341
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,785
Put Jun to bed.

342
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,330
I'm not sleepy.
I'll wait for Shinichi.

343
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:13,047
He understands very well
what's happened.

344
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,802
He feels responsible for it.

345
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,764
I feel the same way.

346
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,893
No one's responsible.
The man is a maniac!

347
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,773
But Shinichi was kidnapped
in your son's place. That's why I -

348
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:35,320
So you think
he should pay the ransom?

349
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,364
You know the position
Mr. Gondo is in.

350
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:43,536
But he was willing
to pay for his own son.

351
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,705
He said he could raise
more money later.

352
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,416
How? From where?

353
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,254
He's mortgaged everything.

354
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,759
He couldn't raise more money
to save his own life.

355
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,636
Giving 30 million
to a madman -

356
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,638
That's enough!

357
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,233
- Let's go to bed.
- But I -

358
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,111
You don't have to sleep.
Just go to your room.

359
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,508
Inspector.

360
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:44,097
Can you guarantee
the boy's safety if Mr. Gondo pays?

361
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,602
The boy may already be dead,

362
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,813
or he may be killed afterwards.

363
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,023
Then what's the sense
in paying?

364
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,525
That's true.

365
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,362
But if he's alive,
paying may make the difference.

366
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,115
We can only hope it does.

367
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,705
And what would
the kidnapper do if he isn't paid?

368
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,166
Would he actually kill the boy?

369
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,338
He seems intelligent,
from the way he talks.

370
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,049
Killing a child
is a capital offense.

371
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:24,053
I doubt he'd risk death
just because he wasn't paid.

372
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:29,976
But as Mr. Gondo pointed out,
he seems obsessed.

373
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,896
His cynical logic
betrays a sick mind.

374
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:38,734
We must believe
he'll carry it through:

375
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,530
If he's paid,
he'll return the child.

376
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,368
If not, I'm afraid
he'll kill the child as threatened.

377
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,503
This is a vicious case.

378
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,507
I'll ask the chief to deploy
the special investigation unit.

379
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,136
See what you can find out here.

380
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:15,646
Mr. Gondo, please alert us
before answering this phone.

381
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,325
What about me?
Am I still going to Osaka?

382
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,328
If I am, I'd better hurry.

383
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,711
Why are you hesitating?
What's there to think about?

384
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,881
Pay the ransom and we're ruined.
It's that simple.

385
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,217
Go.

386
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,558
I'm going,
no matter who's calling.

387
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,810
All right, go.

388
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,024
Kawanishi, wait!

389
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,571
Inspector!

390
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,410
Keep him talking
longer this time.

391
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,246
Upstairs phone, okay?

392
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,257
Hello. This is Gondo.

393
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,427
The boy's fine.
I'll let him talk to you.

394
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,846
Daddy? Are you there?

395
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,515
Shinichi!

396
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,646
Whether he lives or dies
depends on you.

397
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,315
Think it over carefully.

398
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,360
Good night, Mr. Gondo.

399
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,451
He got away again.

400
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,126
Please save my son!

401
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:07,133
Asking you to pay
that kind of money -

402
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,929
Until I heard his voice,

403
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:18,144
I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

404
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,855
But now I'm begging you.

405
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:26,652
Once he's safe, the police
will get your money back.

406
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,947
If you could just lend it
to me for now,

407
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,785
I'll do everything you want
until the day I die.

408
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,330
I'll make Shinichi work too.
Anything you want.

409
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,292
Stop it! Get up!
Damn it, stand up!

410
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,918
Please save Shinichi!

411
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,379
Stand up!
Please, stop it!

412
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:51,677
I want to pay, but I can't.
You don't understand.

413
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,180
I'm going, all right?

414
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,349
Wait.

415
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,271
Get up.
Please get up.

416
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:06,692
He won't let your son die.

417
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,279
I'll ask on your behalf.
Put your mind at ease.

418
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,365
It'll be all right.

419
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,371
Isn't Shinichi back yet?

420
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,211
Postpone Osaka until tomorrow.

421
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,296
I said we'll wait!

422
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,350
Then I'll return this
for the time being.

423
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,909
Excuse me. I'm tired.

424
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,824
Pardon me, but could you
keep the curtains closed?

425
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,617
Oh, sorry.

426
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,169
You all slept here?

427
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,504
No, the Bos'n and I -

428
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,006
Bos'n?

429
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,468
Bos'n is head
of the detective squad.

430
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:01,265
In Yokohama, much of our work
is connected with the harbor.

431
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,351
"Bos'n" fits him perfectly.
He's a real slave driver.

432
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,854
He dragged me out
all last night.

433
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,107
You're the one
who dragged me out.

434
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,610
Sneaking over walls,

435
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:16,989
hiding until morning, not knowing
if we're detectives or thieves.

436
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,620
Last night the chief
set up a special investigation.

437
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:28,042
We can use the whole
prefectural police force.

438
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,506
Also, though the kidnapper
claims it isn't extortion,

439
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,843
he's driven you into a corner.

440
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:44,475
He's exploiting your suffering,
and that's "kidnapping for gain."

441
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,686
It's a maximum
of 15 years' imprisonment.

442
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,690
His being in prison
won't stop me from going under.

443
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,028
His deadline is today.

444
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,574
I thought it over all night.

445
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,369
This is my decision.

446
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:18,384
The boy's father wants me
to lend him the money.

447
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,222
He says once his boy's safe,
you'll get my money back.

448
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:29,728
But even if you guarantee me that,
I won't pay the ransom.

449
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,439
I'd get it back too late.

450
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:39,196
Without that money now,
I'll lose everything.

451
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,574
Please understand me.

452
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,953
This is who I am.
My work is a part of me.

453
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,956
I'd be as good as dead
without it.

454
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,922
You may think it's heartless,
but I refuse to pay.

455
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,094
That's not true.

456
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,388
I know he'll pay.

457
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,098
Just stop it.

458
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:11,020
I won't - no, I can't pay,
no matter what you say.

459
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,106
I told you why last night,
yet still you persist.

460
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,110
Listen: You know
what'll happen if I pay?

461
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,613
I'll be penniless - no, worse.

462
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,742
I'll be saddled with debt
and forced out of the firm.

463
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:31,165
You'll be all right.
You can start over.

464
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,084
You don't know
the first thing about poverty.

465
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,964
From the day you were born
you've had big houses and cars,

466
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,258
servants tending
to your every whim.

467
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,719
Your whole life has been luxury.

468
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,307
Maybe I could start over,
but you - never!

469
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:53,062
Yes, I could.
I don't care about luxury.

470
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,439
It's all you've ever known.

471
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,984
That's why you can tell me
to pay 30 million yen.

472
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:03,364
It means nothing to you.
You're spoiled.

473
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,991
It's not that.

474
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,994
Don't you feel anything
for poor Aoki?

475
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,749
Of course! It takes all my strength
not to cave in to his begging.

476
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,710
I'd pay in a second
if I could.

477
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,839
But I can't sacrifice
everything for him.

478
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:25,678
There's you, and Jun,
and my own survival.

479
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,138
This is ridiculous!

480
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,184
There are plenty of people
richer than I am. Why me?

481
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,936
And at a time like this!

482
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:38,148
It would be suicide to pay.
Why should I?

483
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,861
I know.

484
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,574
But there's no other choice.

485
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,870
Aoki has nobody
to ask but you.

486
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,708
I'm asking too.
So is Jun.

487
00:38:55,875 --> 00:39:01,380
Enough! Nobody has the right
to ask this of me.

488
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:07,344
That's final.
I'm not paying any ransom.

489
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,648
Kawanishi, you're just in time.

490
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,192
Take this check
and get to Osaka.

491
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,907
Well, I've been thinking it over.

492
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,952
- What?
- About that check.

493
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,749
Whether I should take it or not.

494
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,252
You said there was nothing
to think about!

495
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,589
Well, I was confused.

496
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,009
But just hear me out.

497
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,056
If I go to Osaka
and close this deal,

498
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,099
you'll take over
National Shoes.

499
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:59,438
But you'd be hated by the public
for sacrificing a child!

500
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,817
You'd be ruined.
No one would buy your shoes.

501
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,196
That's enough!
You're not paid to think!

502
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,114
Stop arguing and go.

503
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,700
Please think this through.

504
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,829
Think how
Mrs. Gondo must feel.

505
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:25,756
After all, wasn't her dowry
the basis of your fortune?

506
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,343
She has a say in this,

507
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,220
and she wants you to pay.

508
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,347
And destroy myself?

509
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:37,142
I know how much
this money means to you.

510
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,854
But a human life means more.

511
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,857
We're talking
about a helpless child -

512
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,194
"Human life"?
"Helpless child"?

513
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,572
I've never heard such words
from your lips.

514
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,160
What happened
to the cold-blooded businessman?

515
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,038
When were you reborn?

516
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,625
What happened
after you left last night?

517
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,545
Nothing happened. I just. . .

518
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:11,718
If my takeover succeeds,
you'll be made a director.

519
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,057
Knowing that, you were ready
to go last night,

520
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,686
arguing with Reiko, bad-mouthing
the cops, even pestering me.

521
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,274
Yet today -

522
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,568
You want to sabotage
my takeover, don't you?

523
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,361
No. I just -

524
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,699
Answer me! If I pay the ransom,
the deal goes up in smoke.

525
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,368
That's what you want!

526
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,205
What are you up to?

527
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,625
Shall I answer for you?

528
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,295
If this deal fails, so do I,

529
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,714
and three men stand to celebrate.

530
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,385
Bastard, you sold me out
to those three, didn't you?

531
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,181
Yes.

532
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,725
- You told them about Osaka?
- Everything.

533
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,685
Worthless scum!

534
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:07,900
Maybe I am.
But let me have my say.

535
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,236
You weakened last night -

536
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,907
enough to pay the ransom.

537
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:20,078
What would happen to me then?
If I stake my life on you, I have nothing.

538
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:24,374
You'd be selling out
your loyal servant of 10 years.

539
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,253
What I did was self-defense.

540
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,130
Get out!

541
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,341
I'll go.

542
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,387
But you'll be the next
to hear those very words.

543
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,766
Baba and the Old Man
are talking as we speak.

544
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:45,812
But I still have this,
so I can still kick you all out.

545
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,940
I wonder.

546
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:52,486
Maybe the kidnapper's right.
You don't have the guts to let him die.

547
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:55,239
Get out!

548
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,932
Mr. Gondo.

549
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,353
I know it's late
to be saying this. . .

550
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,858
but you have the right
to protect your own livelihood.

551
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,696
It's our duty to help you.

552
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:40,075
We want to save the child,

553
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,036
but not by sacrificing you.

554
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,542
Still, we hope
you'll do one thing:

555
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,462
When the kidnapper calls,
say you'll pay.

556
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,798
You only have
to say the words.

557
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,510
Just ask him when and where.

558
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:03,181
We'll take it from there.

559
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,523
Forgive me, boss.

560
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,652
I didn't realize how unreasonable
my request was.

561
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,990
Please don't worry
about Shinichi.

562
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,080
I think the kidnapper
was just bluffing.

563
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:31,209
No human being
could kill an innocent child.

564
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,256
Anyway, Shinichi
is a clever boy.

565
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,720
I'm sure he'll find
a chance to escape.

566
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,602
Where's Mr. Gondo?

567
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,984
Mr. Gondo!

568
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,613
Phone! Hurry!

569
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,217
Hello. This is Gondo.

570
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,138
Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you?

571
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:07,806
What do you mean?

572
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:12,269
Curtains closed in broad daylight.
A first time.

573
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,605
- You can see us?
- Quite well.

574
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,942
You're on a hilltop.

575
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,902
It's hot as hell down here.

576
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,531
An inferno.
Feels like 105 degrees.

577
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,659
But you must be nice and cool
with your air-conditioning.

578
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,873
I understand the closed windows,
but why the drapes?

579
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,833
What are you up to?

580
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,044
Nothing.

581
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,006
Nothing?

582
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:46,011
People always say that
when they're up to something.

583
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,308
Then I'll open the drapes
and prove it to you.

584
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,529
Good. I can see you now.

585
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,532
Your wife, the chauffeur.

586
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,243
Just the three of you?

587
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,121
That's right.

588
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,916
Well, then, let's continue.

589
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,752
Have you decided to pay,
Mr. Gondo?

590
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,256
I have no choice.
I'll pay.

591
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,886
And is the money ready?

592
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:32,641
It will be by evening.
But only if the boy's unharmed.

593
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,727
- You heard him.
- No, I want to see him.

594
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,898
- And if I refuse?
- I won't pay. That's final.

595
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,317
Sounds fishy.

596
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,989
Well, I'll think it over,
Mr. Gondo.

597
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,587
Stay there!

598
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,508
Be careful!
The kidnapper's watching.

599
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,677
Damn.

600
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,931
Just a little longer
and I could've traced it.

601
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,107
Thank you, Mr. Gondo.

602
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,778
By saying you'd pay,
you bought us more time.

603
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:31,366
Your demand was also
very helpful.

604
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,579
If he accepts it,
we can formulate a plan.

605
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,972
Bank of Tokyo?

606
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:59,019
This is Gondo of National Shoes.
The branch manager, please.

607
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,148
Yes, hello.

608
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:07,902
This is short notice.
Send over 30 million yen in cash.

609
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,866
No new bills,
and no consecutive numbers.

610
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,201
Sorry to trouble you,

611
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,662
but I need
one thousand 10,000 notes,

612
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,582
three thousand 5,000 notes,

613
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,335
and five thousand 1,000 notes.

614
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,254
Yes, right away.

615
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,340
Thank you.

616
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,930
That's enough.
Don't say anything.

617
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,568
I don't know what to say.

618
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,363
Enough.
Leave me alone.

619
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:09,214
- What is it?
- Mom's crying.

620
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,567
Hello. This is Gondo.

621
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,238
Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you?

622
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,744
I hear a coin dropping.

623
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,747
Check all the pay phones
in this area.

624
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:49,671
The kidnapper's right.
One case holds 15 million yen.

625
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,384
What a sight, eh?

626
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,225
Hello. This is Gondo.

627
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,977
Got the money?

628
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,146
Yes, but -

629
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,983
I accept your condition.
You'll see the boy first.

630
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,943
- When?
- Tomorrow.

631
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,237
We'll swap the boy
for the money.

632
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,613
Where?

633
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,451
Calm down and listen carefully.

634
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,165
Get two briefcases,
less than 2.75 inches thick.

635
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,792
The money should just barely fit.

636
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,463
Close them tight but don't lock them:
I want ready access.

637
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,968
Take them on tomorrow's
Kodama No. 2 express train.

638
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,181
Understood? That's all.
- Where am I going?

639
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,225
Get on and you'll see,
Mr. Gondo.

640
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,025
Bos'n,

641
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:56,654
I doubt he's dumb enough
to make the exchange on the train.

642
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,574
Will he try a station?

643
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:03,828
That's risky, too.
I wouldn't try it if I were him.

644
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:10,502
Two briefcases
under 2.75 inches thick.

645
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,671
What's that all about?

646
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,258
"Get on and you'll see."
Shit.

647
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,764
By the way, Bos'n...

648
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:27,018
where should we hide these
in the cases?

649
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,522
That's not a job for amateurs.
I'll call a specialist.

650
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,399
What do you need?

651
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:40,532
We want to find him
with these briefcases.

652
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:44,869
We intentionally chose
an unusual style.

653
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:49,374
They're so conspicuous,
he'll have to get rid of them.

654
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:54,128
He'll have to bury them,
sink them, or burn them.

655
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,966
If the powder
in this capsule gets wet,

656
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,052
it gives off
a putrid smell.

657
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:07,475
The powder in this pouch
emits a pink smoke when burnt.

658
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,895
It's not much to go on,

659
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:14,232
but it just might
give us a lead.

660
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,328
Reiko!

661
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,127
Would you find
my old tool kit for me?

662
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:42,093
How long to record
just the 1,000-yen notes?

663
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:47,098
At ten a minute,
that's 5,000 in 500 minutes.

664
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:52,770
That's eight hours, 20 minutes.
Ten hours with breaks.

665
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:57,025
Isn’t that a waste of time?
I never notice serial numbers.

666
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,445
We can't neglect
any possible means of finding him.

667
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:06,284
When the boy's back safely,
I'll flush that rat out.

668
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,454
I'd burn him alive.

669
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,207
Fifteen years maximum?
To hell with that!

670
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:29,599
The capsule should go here,

671
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,561
and the pouch goes there.

672
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,998
In the old days,
shoemakers made cases too.

673
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,295
My training as an apprentice
comes in handy once again.

674
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,800
It's like I'm starting over
already.

675
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,370
He's really something.

676
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:36,708
I waste no love on the rich,
since I grew up poor.

677
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,294
At first I despised him,
but now. . .

678
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,388
Excuse me.

679
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,689
THE BOY'S NOT ON THE TRAIN

680
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,615
This isn't a pleasure trip.

681
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,930
Railway Telephone Service

682
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:39,103
paging Mr. Kingo Gondo
of National Shoes.

683
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:43,649
Please take your call
in the buffet car phone booth.

684
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,205
- It's the kidnapper.
- What do we do?

685
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:01,375
The next stop is Atami.
Will they do the switch there?

686
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,420
Go get some coffee.

687
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,763
I'm Mr. Gondo.

688
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:20,561
Coffee.

689
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,405
We just passed Kozu.

690
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,990
Perfect.

691
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,575
Listen carefully.

692
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,537
You'll cross
the Sakawa River in two minutes.

693
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,164
You'll see him
at the foot of the bridge.

694
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,387
Coffee.

695
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,658
The boy's at the foot
of the next bridge.

696
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,161
I'm to toss the money
at the other side.

697
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,745
These windows don't open.

698
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,206
He said the washroom windows
open 2.75 inches.

699
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,377
Son of a bitch!
That explains it!

700
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,923
There's no stop until Atami.
He'll get away clean.

701
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:35,011
The bastard thought of everything.
A real monster.

702
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,390
An emergency stop
would endanger the boy.

703
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,604
He's got us from every angle.

704
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,733
There must be two of them:
one with the kid, one to grab the money.

705
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,944
We'll get a glimpse.
Which side is the boy on?

706
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,072
- The left.
- You'll toss the cases from here?

707
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,867
Yes, from the washroom window.

708
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,870
We'll confirm it's the boy
from here.

709
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,788
You all split up
to take pictures.

710
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:08,336
Still photos on the left,
8mm in the front and rear.

711
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:16,385
The bridge is coming up.
Get a good look at the boy.

712
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,514
I only know him from photos.
It could be a switch.

713
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,226
Don't worry. I'm trading
my life for that boy.

714
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,102
I won't make a mistake.

715
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,075
Shinichi!

716
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,452
Are you sure?

717
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,239
We can't rest
until we find that kidnapper.

718
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,534
For Mr. Gondo's sake,
be bloodhounds.

719
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,589
Can you see
inside the living room?

720
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:01,592
This is the best view so far.

721
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,805
He may live around here.

722
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,517
But would he use a phone
this close to home?

723
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,477
Let's try the next one.

724
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:23,447
The kidnapper's right.
That house gets on your nerves.

725
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,826
As if it's looking down at us.

726
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,365
CLEVER KIDNAPPER
USES EXPRESS TRAIN

727
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:54,205
RANSOM FOR DRIVER'S SON
IS 30 MILLION YEN

728
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:58,000
SHOE EXEC THROWS ENTIRE
FORTUNE OUT THE WINDOW

729
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:05,007
ALL POLICE UNITS MOBILIZED

730
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:17,811
Police say money was not
the kidnapper's only motive.

731
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:22,316
His phone calls
have a taunting tone,

732
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:26,946
suggesting extraordinary
hatred for Mr. Gondo.

733
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:30,407
The kidnapper wanted
not only to steal money,

734
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:34,411
but also to torment and ridicule
Mr. Gondo in the process.

735
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,707
Yet Gondo's sacrifice
has not gone unnoticed.

736
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:44,922
Words of sympathy have grown
into national acclaim for him.

737
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,258
How will the kidnapper
react to this?

738
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:51,512
If he's listening,
I'll tell him this:

739
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,182
Mr. Gondo is having
the last laugh!

740
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,923
We learned from Shinichi

741
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,759
that a woman held him.

742
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:35,139
Unfortunately, hats hid the faces
of both the man and the woman,

743
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:38,809
making identification impossible.

744
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:43,105
But their movements
may provide important clues.

745
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,357
Watch carefully.

746
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,790
Well?

747
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:06,211
Any idea who they may be?

748
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,177
Don't hesitate to say
if you have any idea.

749
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,848
Delivery boys, milkmen,

750
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,434
gardeners,
junk collectors, salesmen.

751
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,647
Try to remember everyone
who's come through here.

752
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:31,195
This kind of thing
might come to you suddenly.

753
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,572
Take your time.

754
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:42,122
Bos'n, the 8mm films are well shot,
but not much help yet.

755
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,710
The figure is blurred in the photos,
but they're helpful.

756
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,755
Look at this.

757
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,720
This is the accomplice.

758
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:02,851
See this tiny figure here?
That's a farmer leading a cow.

759
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,271
He gave us
some useful information.

760
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:10,567
He saw a man with two briefcases
run into the shadows here

761
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,612
and then drive off.

762
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:18,742
We checked the area
and found skid marks.

763
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,037
It seems he ran
into a concrete railing,

764
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,081
leaving behind paint scrapings.

765
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:29,253
By having them checked,
we determined the following:

766
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,924
The car was
a gray '59 Toyopet Crown.

767
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,220
This is the car you rode in,
isn't it?

768
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,348
Yes.

769
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,102
- Can we go?
- Sure.

770
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:50,107
Shinichi, try harder
to remember everything.

771
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:55,028
You were at a house with a view
of the sea and Mt. Fuji?

772
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:00,033
What road did the car take
from there to the river?

773
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,787
- I don't remember.
- Try harder, damn it!

774
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,248
What did you see
from the car window?

775
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,918
Lots of things.

776
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,795
That's not good enough!

777
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,467
I'm asking you to try harder.
What did you see?

778
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,844
- I can't -
- Shinichi!

779
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,679
Aoki, stop this.

780
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:29,271
When you remember, kiddo,
come tell us, okay?

781
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,949
Mr. Aoki,
we know how you feel.

782
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,452
We feel the same way.

783
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,956
We're desperate to capture
the culprit and return the money.

784
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,002
We owe Mr. Gondo
at least that much.

785
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,087
Guests, sir.

786
01:08:56,049 --> 01:09:01,011
Anyway, Mr. Aoki,
go easier on the boy.

787
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,889
Excuse me.

788
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:10,521
Shinichi's already recalled
some key information.

789
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:16,985
They covered his face
with gauze soaked in ether.

790
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,780
He went to a house with a view
of Mt. Fuji and the sea.

791
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,536
Well, that's all for today.

792
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,376
Oh, one more thing.

793
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,504
We've received
a mountain of mail.

794
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,090
Mr. Gondo went through
a horrible experience,

795
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:41,176
but everyone admires him.

796
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,513
That lifts
our spirits a bit too.

797
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:48,600
You're a hero, and the public
is very sympathetic,

798
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,229
but what about
National Shoes?

799
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,732
A battle for ownership
won't be pretty.

800
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:01,363
We hear your position is shaky.

801
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,907
Is that true?

802
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,326
Frankly, we're worried.

803
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,495
Sympathy costs nothing,

804
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:13,542
but we've invested real money.
We have no sympathy for you.

805
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,837
As your principal creditors,

806
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,590
we've reached
a decision together.

807
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:24,011
We're returning the interest
you sent yesterday

808
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:28,432
to postpone
paying us the principal.

809
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,185
Pay us in full
when it falls due.

810
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:36,106
If you don't, we'll seize
your collateral property.

811
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:40,277
Public opinion aside, Mr. Gondo,
you can't pay a kidnapper

812
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:44,489
and leave us footing the bill.

813
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:10,599
The Gondo residence is visible

814
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,810
from Nishi Ward
and parts of Naka Ward.

815
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:17,147
There are some places
where changes in elevation,

816
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:23,570
trees, or large structures
block the view.

817
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:28,742
Those locations
are shown with hatch lines.

818
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,870
The Gondo living room
can be seen clearly

819
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,832
with an ordinary telescope

820
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:39,002
from any point within this circle.

821
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,964
It can also be seen
from the inside

822
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:46,176
of seven phone booths
within this perimeter.

823
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:50,180
Those are indicated
by these X marks.

824
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,517
Three of those seven
allow a good view

825
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:56,687
even when using a telescope
while on the phone.

826
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:01,566
Those are indicated
by these circled X marks.

827
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,822
We believe the suspect used
one of these phones.

828
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,785
He also complained
that it was very hot.

829
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,747
He called
a little before 9:00 a.m.

830
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:20,210
We checked which booths receive
the most direct sunlight at that hour.

831
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,879
Of these three,

832
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,174
this one is shaded
in the morning.

833
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,469
So it is safe to assume

834
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:33,181
that the suspect used
one of the other two.

835
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,976
The recorded
conversations suggest

836
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:40,272
he was looking through
the telescope while on the phone.

837
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,066
So we can narrow down
his place of residence

838
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,903
to this vicinity.

839
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:53,035
Judging from his voice,
he's a young male.

840
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:57,789
But with the boy he wore
a mask and dark glasses.

841
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,125
Not much to go on there.

842
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:06,131
Next we have a report
on the railway phone.

843
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:21,438
You can only call the express train
from Tokyo, Osaka or Nagoya.

844
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:28,195
The call is relayed by microwave,
but with a long delay,

845
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,405
so it was easy to trace
the origin of the call.

846
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:34,701
Yurakucho 2-6,
Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo.

847
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,789
A tobacco shop
near the train station.

848
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:44,753
But the old lady at the shop
had bad eyes

849
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,630
and even worse hearing.

850
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,799
It was hopeless.

851
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:53,804
We asked around
at all the shops in the vicinity,

852
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:57,516
but no one could recall

853
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:01,645
a man placing a call
at the tobacco shop at that hour.

854
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,148
Next.

855
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,653
The boy mentioned
Mt. Fuji and the sea.

856
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:12,155
Any leads?

857
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,454
We had him draw a picture.

858
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,676
The call with the boy
was a direct-dial local call.

859
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:36,012
Places with a view
of Mt. Fuji and the sea

860
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,431
where you can call Yokohama
without an operator

861
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:43,478
include Zushi, Fujisawa,
Chigasaki and part of Kamakura.

862
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,940
The sun in the picture
appears to be setting.

863
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,820
This appears
all along the coast.

864
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,993
Next, the ether.

865
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,958
It's not easy
to trace back to a source.

866
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,211
Pharmacies don't carry it.

867
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:13,258
Hospitals and larger clinics
buy it wholesale.

868
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:19,055
There is also industrial-grade ether,
used in welding.

869
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:23,560
So it's too early
to say the suspect

870
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:29,149
is a doctor, pharmacist,
or medical student.

871
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,735
Industrial-grade ether is used

872
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:35,822
in building ships, railroad cars
and automobiles,

873
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,409
as well as in small iron works

874
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,621
and repair shops.

875
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,164
That's all.

876
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,002
Next, the car.

877
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:59,012
The farmer said it had white plates,
so it's privately owned.

878
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,974
Crooks generally
don't use a family car,

879
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:06,436
so I checked
on stolen vehicles.

880
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:12,525
This month,
18 Toyopets were stolen.

881
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:16,196
However, 12 were recovered
before the kidnapping.

882
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,701
That leaves six. Only one is gray,
like our paint sample.

883
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:29,084
It was stolen
the day before the kidnapping.

884
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,128
The license number...

885
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,466
is Kanagawa SO3059.

886
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,762
Since the plates
may have been changed,

887
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:46,017
Vehicle Theft is checking
all gray '59 Toyopets on the road.

888
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:47,978
That's all.

889
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:52,649
Good.
Next, the 1000-yen notes.

890
01:16:56,237 --> 01:17:01,741
We compiled a list
of serial numbers

891
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:07,998
for tobacco shops, cafeterias,
cafés and movie theaters.

892
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,752
Goodwill for Mr. Gondo
makes the owners eager to help,

893
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:18,216
but none of the notes
have turned up yet.

894
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:23,263
Next, reports from the public.

895
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:33,273
We've received
1,305 reports of sightings,

896
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:38,153
only a few of which
are from cranks.

897
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:44,242
All reported seeing
men with boys of Shinichi's age,

898
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:50,915
but many of the sightings
occurred before he was kidnapped

899
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,585
or after he was recovered.

900
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:58,465
And he was seen
at the same time

901
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:03,094
in places far removed
from each other.

902
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,972
We're trying
to corroborate the reports.

903
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,852
One promising report
we received today

904
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,563
was from a turnpike
toll collector.

905
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,233
About 7:00 p.m.
the night of the kidnapping,

906
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:20,653
a man in dark glasses
drove up.

907
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:26,576
A boy was sleeping
under a blanket in the back seat.

908
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,413
The car was dark.
He couldn't see the boy's face,

909
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:35,710
but he did notice a toy rifle
and a cowboy hat.

910
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,507
The man was headed
toward Fujisawa.

911
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:44,010
This is our best lead so far.

912
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:48,932
We're now reexamining
all reports from that area.

913
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,398
Next, the railway connection.

914
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,277
The Kodama train's infrastructure

915
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,947
is not that different
from other express trains.

916
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:07,617
The suspect is very familiar
with the system,

917
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,286
but that doesn't necessarily mean

918
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,163
that he's a railroad man.

919
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:16,042
We nonetheless ran a check
on all employees

920
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,045
with connections
to express trains

921
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,923
who were absent
during the kidnapping

922
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,968
or had quit just prior to it,

923
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:30,348
and those living in view
of the Gondo home.

924
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:36,062
There were very few.
I'll have a final report tomorrow.

925
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,523
That's all.

926
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,485
Next, grudges or other motives.

927
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,159
I met today with
the National Shoes executives.

928
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,957
What a bunch of assholes.

929
01:19:57,168 --> 01:19:59,419
A grudge?

930
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:04,174
Inspector, you think
we were behind the kidnapping?

931
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:08,845
Think we set it all up
to get rid of Gondo?

932
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:14,350
That's absurd. We went that night
to join forces with him.

933
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,353
On bended knee even.
- He almost did us in.

934
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:22,525
We had no idea of his plans
until Kawanishi informed us.

935
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,569
Serves him right.

936
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:28,531
He was secretly buying stock
to take over the company.

937
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,117
Then this incident
comes along and ruins him.

938
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,995
I'd call it divine retribution.

939
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,375
It's not that I doubt you,

940
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:44,005
but you've known
Mr. Gondo a long time.

941
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,467
I just wondered
if there was anyone

942
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:50,637
who might have held
a grudge against him.

943
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,514
Where should we start?

944
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,891
We couldn't even
name them all.

945
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,729
One more question.

946
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:05,318
The kidnapping occurred
just after you left his home.

947
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:09,531
Did you notice anything
near the gate?

948
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:14,410
A car, for instance,
or a suspicious person?

949
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:19,874
Look here! He'd just thrown us out.
We weren't admiring the view.

950
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,880
They were no help.

951
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:30,134
But at the factory -

952
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:35,890
Mr. Gondo has
a sharp temper for sure,

953
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:41,271
but he also cares a lot
about the work.

954
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,649
He's an excellent boss
if you do a good job.

955
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,611
I doubt anyone here

956
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:51,573
holds a grudge against him,

957
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:54,450
except maybe the front office.

958
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,037
Here's what I think:

959
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,584
Nobody holds a grudge
against Mr. Gondo...

960
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,587
except the big shots.

961
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,131
They'd give
the kidnapper a medal!

962
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:10,675
Taguchi, calm down.

963
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:19,642
Now for the results
of this meeting.

964
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:21,853
Inspector Tokura.

965
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,158
So far, this case seems
impossible to break.

966
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:39,162
But the criminal
must be in these details.

967
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:42,081
Follow every lead through
to the bitter end.

968
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:46,878
It may be fruitless,
but when you're discouraged. . .

969
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,011
think of what
Mr. Gondo's going through.

970
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,310
Take the boy tomorrow

971
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,187
for a drive along the shore.

972
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:08,358
Cover every mile
until you find this view.

973
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:12,487
If you can jog his memory,
you may find the hideout.

974
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,163
It's Vehicle Theft.

975
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:28,211
Tokura speaking.

976
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:31,923
That's great news.

977
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:37,053
We'll be right there.
Don't touch anything.

978
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,223
They found the car.

979
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:44,644
Abandoned on a highway.
Call the crime-scene unit.

980
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:50,233
Have more men bunk at the station,
with the rest on call.

981
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,924
It's spattered with mud,
but there's been no rain lately.

982
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:18,928
It's actually dust
combined with splashed water.

983
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,581
What's this?

984
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:50,334
- What's wrong?
- Everybody listen to this.

985
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,469
Hello. This is Gondo.

986
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:03,806
The boy's fine.
I'll let him talk to you.

987
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,350
Daddy? Are you there?

988
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:15,151
Hear that trolley?

989
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,625
So?

990
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:34,003
A trolley passes
by the hideout.

991
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:38,132
Three lines pass through Zushi,
Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Kamakura:

992
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,469
the JR, Odayaku
and Enoshima lines.

993
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:46,224
Each has a distinctive sound. Maybe
a specialist could tell which it is.

994
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,142
I'll be back.

995
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,854
Enoshima Rail?
You're sure?

996
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,483
You bet your boots.
I live right next to the tracks.

997
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,319
That sound

998
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,696
isn't a pantograph trolley.

999
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:05,284
It's an old-style,
single-pole trolley.

1000
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:10,039
Only the Enoshima line
uses those old lines nowadays.

1001
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,209
Plus, their line has
a lot of curves,

1002
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,878
and they use short rails
with lots of joints.

1003
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:19,674
Also, the wheelbase is narrow,
so it goes. . .

1004
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,052
instead of...

1005
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:26,639
Thank you very much.

1006
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,892
Is Mr. Aoki in?

1007
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,186
I'm sorry. He's out.

1008
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:34,730
Is he at your husband's office?

1009
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:36,440
No.

1010
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,821
Where is he?

1011
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:44,574
He took Shinichi for a drive.

1012
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:50,246
He wants to jog Shinichi's memory
to help find the kidnapper.

1013
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,757
He just won't let up, will he?

1014
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:05,970
Give him a break.
He feels he has to do something.

1015
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,382
You're sure
he let you out here?

1016
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,968
- From which way?
- That way.

1017
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:50,348
Watch carefully
out the back as we go.

1018
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,809
Tell me
if you remember anything.

1019
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,781
Now what?

1020
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:09,784
We can't do anything
without the boy.

1021
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,078
My guess is Aoki
will go to the Sakawa River.

1022
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,163
Take the Tokaido Highway.

1023
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:25,216
Daddy!

1024
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:28,678
What?
Remember something?

1025
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:31,555
I peed over there.

1026
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:43,234
We're looking for Aoki. Once we have
the boy, we'll head for the shore.

1027
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,946
Hold on.
I just got word from the lab.

1028
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:51,534
There's a lot of fish blood
and oil on the stolen car.

1029
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,828
They also found
mackerel scales and bonito.

1030
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:56,622
That's what was splashed
on the hood of the car.

1031
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,710
He drove through a lot of fish offal.

1032
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,296
It must've been at a fish market.

1033
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,049
The Koshigoe market
is the only one near that trolley.

1034
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,052
Take a look over there.
We'll handle Aoki.

1035
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,846
Got it.

1036
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:25,276
Around here we mainly catch
bonito and mackerel.

1037
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:28,738
But that's not enough
to fill local demand,

1038
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:32,033
so we have other kinds
trucked in from Tokyo.

1039
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:41,250
Thanks. By the way, where does
the Enoshima trolley run?

1040
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,341
Under that bluff.

1041
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,719
Does the view from there. . .

1042
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,598
look anything like this?

1043
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,600
Let's see.

1044
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,355
You should be able to see
Enoshima Island from there.

1045
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:10,905
But if you go further right,
to the hill near the station...

1046
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:18,788
that cape is in front of Enoshima,
with a view just like this.

1047
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:28,756
You saw Enoshima Island, right?

1048
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,759
You must have.

1049
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,928
But we didn't come this way.

1050
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:54,156
Bos'n, I feel
we're getting closer.

1051
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:59,286
Let's go up that hill.
Try not to look like a cop.

1052
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,288
I'm not the problem.

1053
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:05,084
You, on the other hand,
would need plastic surgery.

1054
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,757
Daddy!
I saw this tunnel!

1055
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,802
What?
You passed by here?

1056
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,013
From which direction?

1057
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:19,473
That way.

1058
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:12,234
Shinichi, is this the spot?

1059
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:26,040
Hey, look at that.

1060
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,752
Enoshima doesn't look
like an island from here.

1061
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,337
Let's head back.

1062
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:35,382
They must have Aoki by now.

1063
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,510
We'll wait at the fish market.
If the boy shows us the way,

1064
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,721
with any luck we'll raid
the hideout tonight.

1065
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,765
You got your pistol?

1066
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:46,977
Of course. I'm not going
after a madman with my bare hands.

1067
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:54,610
Let's look around on foot.

1068
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,579
That car!

1069
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,665
That's Gondo's car.

1070
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,518
Don't be stupid.
Stop playing detective.

1071
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:42,032
When I pulled the car up
this morning, Mr. Gondo said,

1072
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,743
"Aoki, all we have now is time.

1073
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:47,913
We're not going
to the factory anymore."

1074
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,167
He was smiling,

1075
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:56,171
but I know how he felt inside.

1076
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,675
The directors are horrible men,

1077
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:03,387
but in the end it's all my fault.

1078
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,597
That's why. . .

1079
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:13,314
But walking around here
with the boy is madness.

1080
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:18,694
What if the kidnapper saw him?
Imagine the consequences.

1081
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,198
Bos'n, he's gone!

1082
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,583
Daddy!

1083
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:35,210
Here it is!

1084
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,481
Uncle and Auntie
are sleeping.

1085
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:33,685
Take the boy away.

1086
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,521
They're dead.

1087
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,427
Thanks for coming,
everybody.

1088
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,808
- Why the press conference?
- Yeah, what'd you find?

1089
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,102
Inspector Tokura
will fill you in.

1090
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:19,648
However, we ask you
not to print what you hear today.

1091
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:24,153
Earlier today,

1092
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,531
two accomplices, one male,
one female, were found dead.

1093
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:32,870
Both from heroin overdose.

1094
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,831
- An accidental overdose?
- I'll explain.

1095
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:43,922
Their arms were covered
with needle marks.

1096
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:47,259
Both were long-term addicts.

1097
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:52,014
It's unlikely
that experienced addicts

1098
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:54,766
would misjudge the dosage.

1099
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,729
Dealers, furthermore,
don't sell heroin that pure.

1100
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:04,026
Both died in bed,
their heads resting on pillows.

1101
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,737
Next to the pillows

1102
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:10,324
we found two empty packets,
two syringes,

1103
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:15,370
and a cup of water,
maybe to dissolve the heroin.

1104
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:17,873
In addition,

1105
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:22,169
we found two unopened
packets of heroin.

1106
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:26,423
So they obtained four packets,

1107
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:30,761
They took two right away
and saved two for later.

1108
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:33,764
These facts
don't suggest suicide.

1109
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,393
So then why did they die?

1110
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:46,985
The heroin
was unusually pure.

1111
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:54,409
We analyzed the unused samples.
They were over 90% pure.

1112
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,828
When heroin is smuggled in,

1113
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:00,999
its purity ranges
from 70% to 95%.

1114
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:04,336
Dealers cut it

1115
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:08,924
with glucose
and hydrochloric procaine,

1116
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,802
down to a purity
as low as 30%.

1117
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:15,597
So a one-gram package

1118
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:19,268
contains only 0.3 grams
of pure heroin.

1119
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:24,314
What happens to an addict

1120
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:28,443
who takes heroin
three times more pure?

1121
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:31,905
An ingenious murder.

1122
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:37,369
There's corroborating evidence.

1123
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:41,623
We found a notepad
in their room.

1124
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,917
The top page
bore impressions

1125
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:48,297
from scribblings
made on the page above it.

1126
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,349
Please observe.

1127
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:03,645
It's been reconstructed
and enlarged in this slide.

1128
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:08,692
The agony of withdrawal
can be clearly seen.

1129
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:13,030
"Get us more dope.
Bring it fast.

1130
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:16,408
If you don't,
we'll spend the money.

1131
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:20,829
We won't do
what you say anymore."

1132
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:30,047
Clearly, they tried
to blackmail him.

1133
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:33,091
- That's why he killed them?
- We're not 100% certain,

1134
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:36,136
but it certainly looks that way.

1135
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:38,347
Was there money around?

1136
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:41,808
We found 2,500
of Mr. Gondo's 1,000-yen notes.

1137
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,603
The serial numbers matched.

1138
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,522
The kidnapper may have
figured that out too.

1139
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:52,361
He gave them a share
but made them wait to spend it.

1140
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:55,530
We can gather that
from the letter.

1141
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,825
Have you identified
the accomplices?

1142
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,411
Caretakers of the villa.

1143
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:07,000
We learned that
from the villa's owner.

1144
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,878
So you're close?

1145
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:13,715
No, we're back to square one.

1146
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:17,552
Of course,
Narcotics is doing its best.

1147
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:21,890
They may provide us
with valuable information,

1148
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:25,894
but the accomplices' deaths

1149
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:28,814
are a terrible blow
to the investigation.

1150
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:34,528
The thread leading back
to the kidnapper has been cut.

1151
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:42,077
That's why I'm asking you:

1152
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:46,248
Don't print a word of this.

1153
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,876
Why not?

1154
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:54,756
The kidnapper has yet
to confirm that they're dead.

1155
01:40:56,384 --> 01:41:00,971
We know this because
if he had returned to the villa,

1156
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:06,017
he wouldn't have left 2.5 million yen
in evidence lying around.

1157
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:10,480
As far as he knows,

1158
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:13,275
they may still be alive.

1159
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:15,777
If we nurse that doubt within him,
how will he react?

1160
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:20,615
If he is the killer, he'll probably
try to kill them again.

1161
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:25,912
If there's no report
of their deaths in the papers,

1162
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,956
he won't be able to stay put.

1163
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:30,625
He'll surely return
to the scene to check.

1164
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:34,254
- And you'll nab him then?
- That's right.

1165
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,215
Even if we keep quiet,

1166
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:39,509
won't their deaths
be impossible to hide?

1167
01:41:39,677 --> 01:41:41,762
The neighbors will talk.

1168
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,722
That's not a problem.

1169
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:48,560
It's a new development
with few houses.

1170
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:53,064
It's also the off-season,
so hardly anybody's there.

1171
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,735
Drug addicts are cautious.

1172
01:41:56,903 --> 01:42:00,113
They kept to themselves
and had no visitors.

1173
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:05,827
But will our keeping quiet
really convince the kidnapper?

1174
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,456
Well, that's why

1175
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:12,000
I have another favor to ask.

1176
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:16,630
I'd like you
to run a story today

1177
01:42:16,798 --> 01:42:19,424
saying one of the 1,000-yen notes
was spent.

1178
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:25,639
Of course you can say
it's our announcement.

1179
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:29,643
I know it's a lot to ask.

1180
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:32,687
I'm asking your cooperation
for Mr. Gondo's sake too.

1181
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:37,400
Did you know he was dismissed
from National Shoes

1182
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,195
and kicked out
as factory manager?

1183
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:43,198
That's terrible.

1184
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:45,200
They seem to have no sense
of public opinion.

1185
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:49,788
At the next shareholder meeting,
he'll be voted out completely.

1186
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,541
In place of an article
reporting the deaths,

1187
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:56,545
shall we slam
National Shoes?

1188
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:03,510
Why not? Let's give 'em
a good thrashing!

1189
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,892
GONDO FORCED OUT
PUBLIC OPINION IGNORED

1190
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:14,813
WOMEN START BOYCOTT
OF NATIONAL SHOES

1191
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:20,861
RISING TIDE
OF SYMPATHY AND ANGER

1192
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,621
1, 000-YEN NOTE
FROM RANSOM FOUND

1193
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:41,423
30 MILLION IN RANSOM
IN BRIEFCASES LIKE THIS

1194
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:27,028
We've recovered 2.5 million
from the accomplices.

1195
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,573
We can hand it over at the station,
if it's not too much trouble.

1196
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,659
We're sorry that it's so little.

1197
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:35,495
No, it's a great help now.

1198
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:40,250
We believe the kidnapper
hasn't spent any yet.

1199
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:43,336
We hope
to recover it all intact.

1200
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:47,841
The twist is that he's harder
to catch if he doesn't spend it.

1201
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:50,468
Kingo,
Mr. Kawanishi is here.

1202
01:45:50,636 --> 01:45:53,847
Kawanishi?
What does he want?

1203
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:55,515
He has some kind of request.

1204
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:58,560
- We'll be leaving then -
- No, stay. Send him in.

1205
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:02,230
Please, help yourself.

1206
01:46:02,398 --> 01:46:05,191
Sorry I haven't been in touch.

1207
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:07,819
Well, look who's here!

1208
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:10,572
I must thank both of you.

1209
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:16,244
You've made Mr. Gondo a hero.
That was a great help.

1210
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,747
What the hell
are you talking about?

1211
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:22,083
Don't be so cold.

1212
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:25,420
I was your right-hand man
for over ten years.

1213
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:29,174
Did you think I would stand by
while they booted you out?

1214
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:34,596
I risked my own position
to try to keep you on.

1215
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:39,601
But the Old Man's stubborn,

1216
01:46:39,769 --> 01:46:42,771
and the executive director's a viper.

1217
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:44,939
It was a hard-fought battle.

1218
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:47,650
Fortunately,
public opinion's on your side,

1219
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:51,446
so I convinced them
to keep you on.

1220
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:55,283
Get out!
Tell this to your new masters:

1221
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:59,120
You can't trot me out
to ease the public's anger.

1222
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:02,165
I refuse to be an ornament,
an executive without power.

1223
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:04,667
I won't be your puppet.

1224
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:09,964
Can you afford
to bluff like that?

1225
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,258
You're going too far.

1226
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:17,555
Right now you have
nothing but debts.

1227
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:21,226
It may be a position in name only,
but your credit will be intact.

1228
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,144
Get out!

1229
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,189
I'm still the man I've always been,
even more so.

1230
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,400
But you're nothing,
not even a human being.

1231
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,138
Excuse me.

1232
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,266
I'd like you to see something.

1233
01:48:01,684 --> 01:48:03,351
What is it?

1234
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,020
It's nothing much,

1235
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:09,858
but the last picture
seemed to be of some help.

1236
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:14,696
Shinichi drew it.
He says it's the kidnapper.

1237
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:19,617
Dark glasses and a mask.
Not much to go on.

1238
01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,078
What's this?

1239
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:26,583
A handkerchief.
He always wore it.

1240
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:30,044
Mom!

1241
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:34,632
Look at the pretty pink smoke
from that chimney.

1242
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:49,397
You lit the incinerator
around 9:00 a.m., right?

1243
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:54,736
Yes, every day I burn
the trash from the day before.

1244
01:48:54,904 --> 01:48:57,071
What do you burn?

1245
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:05,038
Dirty stuff,
junk that you can't disinfect.

1246
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:08,750
They're always bringing stuff
that won't burn, damn it!

1247
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:12,462
- Who is?
- Handymen and janitors.

1248
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:15,089
Anyone else?

1249
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:21,054
Sometimes hospital nurses
and attendants.

1250
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:23,598
Anyone like that
come by today?

1251
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:26,017
Come to think of it,

1252
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:30,438
a man brought a cardboard box.

1253
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:34,525
- How big?
- Like this.

1254
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:36,903
- Anyone you know?
- No.

1255
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:39,239
An intern maybe.

1256
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,449
A young medical intern?

1257
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,952
Sure looked that way.

1258
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,996
Too young
to be a regular doctor.

1259
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:50,583
"Burn this, pops," he said.

1260
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:54,754
Doctors don't call people "pops."
- Anyone else?

1261
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:58,049
Who'd wanna come
to a place like this?

1262
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:01,177
Now why'd they bring -

1263
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:04,305
You can't burn tin!

1264
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:13,314
Do you know what department
that intern is in?

1265
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:15,525
How would I know?

1266
01:50:15,693 --> 01:50:18,361
But he was headed
toward Internal Medicine.

1267
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,822
Thanks a lot.

1268
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:19,505
According to Bos'n's report,

1269
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:23,051
his name
is Ginjiro Takeuchi.

1270
01:51:23,218 --> 01:51:25,053
An intern.

1271
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,015
He took three days off
during the kidnapping.

1272
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,145
He lives in a studio apartment

1273
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:38,608
at 4-278 Sengen-cho
in Nishi Ward.

1274
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,611
Sunrise Apartments, No. 12.

1275
01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:46,574
His room faces north,
right at the Gondo residence.

1276
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:52,288
One of the two phones
that we suspect the kidnapper used

1277
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:55,625
is right next to his apartment.

1278
01:51:57,836 --> 01:52:00,129
The male and female
accomplices

1279
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:02,882
had been examined
at his hospital.

1280
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:05,468
Takeuchi wrote up their charts.

1281
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:09,680
Both had pulmonary edema,
a result of their drug addiction.

1282
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:13,559
So we have two addicts
suffering from pulmonary edema,

1283
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:16,104
as well as from withdrawal.

1284
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:20,149
An injection of pure heroin
would cause death from shock.

1285
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:25,613
As their intern,
he would have known that.

1286
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:30,743
We may conclude
that he is the kidnapper.

1287
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:34,580
But we can't arrest him.

1288
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,708
Here's why:

1289
01:52:38,627 --> 01:52:43,464
If we arrest him now,
he'll only get 15 years.

1290
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:46,634
Mr. Gondo,
on the other hand...

1291
01:52:48,137 --> 01:52:52,390
is serving a life sentence of debt
for paying the ransom.

1292
01:52:52,808 --> 01:52:55,226
We won't let that happen.

1293
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:58,271
A criminal like this
deserves capital punishment.

1294
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:03,651
What's more, it's clear
he killed his accomplices.

1295
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:07,780
But if we arrest him now,

1296
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:11,492
we'll have no material evidence
to prove it.

1297
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:18,249
There's only one way to bring
this vicious criminal to justice:

1298
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:23,171
Leave him at large
to reenact his crime.

1299
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,840
But how?

1300
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:31,762
By giving him this.

1301
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,015
Please lower the blinds.

1302
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:48,821
GIVE US MORE DOPE.
WE'LL TALK IF YOU DON'T.

1303
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:51,741
A perfect forgery.

1304
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,464
You Mr. Takeuchi?

1305
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:50,424
He'll make his move today.

1306
01:54:51,343 --> 01:54:55,263
First, he'll go buy the heroin.

1307
01:54:56,056 --> 01:55:00,810
Then he'll try to kill them tonight.

1308
01:55:01,562 --> 01:55:04,522
There's no way
to predict anything else:

1309
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:10,361
where he'll go,
how he'll get the drugs.

1310
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:15,533
We can only know that
by keeping him in our sights.

1311
01:55:17,286 --> 01:55:18,786
Listen carefully:

1312
01:55:18,954 --> 01:55:22,206
Don't let him notice you,
but don't lose him.

1313
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:26,127
Bos'n, Nakao, Arai and I

1314
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:31,299
will head to the hideout as soon as
we hear he's obtained the drugs.

1315
01:55:31,466 --> 01:55:35,052
I'll give orders
from the car radio.

1316
01:56:03,749 --> 01:56:06,000
Is he waiting for a dealer?

1317
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:09,962
Just killing time, I'd say.

1318
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:22,827
He's walked up and down
this street for two hours.

1319
01:57:22,994 --> 01:57:27,415
If the same people keep tailing him,
he may catch on.

1320
01:58:16,465 --> 01:58:17,840
Inspector!

1321
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:19,675
Yes. Tokura here.

1322
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:21,510
He went into a florist's.

1323
01:58:21,678 --> 01:58:25,473
A florist's?
Have someone buy some flowers.

1324
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:33,022
I'm afraid none of us
fits the part. Wait -

1325
01:58:40,572 --> 01:58:42,948
What?
One carnation?

1326
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:45,159
Yes. One red carnation.

1327
01:58:45,327 --> 01:58:47,787
Is today Mother's Day?

1328
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:05,179
Earlier, the suspect spoke
on a pay phone.

1329
01:59:05,597 --> 01:59:09,558
He was told
how to find the dealer.

1330
01:59:09,726 --> 01:59:12,436
The red carnation
must be a sign.

1331
01:59:22,948 --> 01:59:26,325
Watch for anybody
approaching the suspect.

1332
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:31,831
Watch how the money
and dope change hands.

1333
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:55,946
Inspector Tokura!

1334
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:57,990
Tokura speaking.

1335
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:00,242
- He changed his course.
- What?

1336
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:02,703
He got out at "Dope Alley."

1337
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:05,038
So he didn't actually
buy any in the club?

1338
02:05:05,206 --> 02:05:07,416
We're sure he did, but. . .

1339
02:05:08,501 --> 02:05:11,336
Okay, we're turning back.
Don't lose him!

1340
02:06:12,148 --> 02:06:15,150
What are you staring at?
This ain't a picture show.

1341
02:06:15,318 --> 02:06:16,652
Get the hell out!

1342
02:06:16,819 --> 02:06:18,820
This ain't no place
for the likes of you.

1343
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:32,501
Lotta strangers snoopin' around
tonight. Be careful.

1344
02:06:32,669 --> 02:06:35,337
What are you, a cop?

1345
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:37,547
We don't know any of you.

1346
02:06:37,715 --> 02:06:41,510
Get out.
Get out, I said!

1347
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,467
Bos'n, I don't understand
what he's up to.

1348
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,929
He should be taking the dope
straight to the hideout.

1349
02:09:32,849 --> 02:09:37,936
And why go to the junkies
if he hasn't got it yet?

1350
02:09:38,104 --> 02:09:40,605
They don't have
any pure heroin.

1351
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:43,567
- Inspector!
- Tokura here.

1352
02:09:43,734 --> 02:09:46,945
He picked up a junkie
and took her to a flophouse.

1353
02:10:03,713 --> 02:10:08,175
KOGANE-CHO INN

1354
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:12,637
I've got it!

1355
02:10:13,431 --> 02:10:16,308
He'll use her as a guinea pig.

1356
02:10:16,476 --> 02:10:20,562
She's in withdrawal,
and he can test it on her.

1357
02:10:55,014 --> 02:10:59,059
- He left the area.
- And the girl?

1358
02:10:59,227 --> 02:11:02,270
Just a minute.
Two men went to check.

1359
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:05,273
Where to now?
The hideout?

1360
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:09,528
Wait a minute. The girl's a clue
to what he'll do next.

1361
02:11:09,695 --> 02:11:12,030
He's headed
toward the Isezaki district.

1362
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:15,075
What? We're there right now.
From which side?

1363
02:11:15,243 --> 02:11:17,661
Facing Yoshida Bridge,
the left side.

1364
02:11:19,413 --> 02:11:21,706
- Stop here.
- It's a no-parking zone.

1365
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:23,208
It doesn't matter.

1366
02:11:23,376 --> 02:11:26,545
I've just received word:
The girl's dead.

1367
02:11:26,712 --> 02:11:29,256
Syringe in her hand.
Death by overdose.

1368
02:11:29,423 --> 02:11:30,632
He's coming.

1369
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:36,137
We found him.
I'm cutting off the radio.

1370
02:12:59,889 --> 02:13:03,933
The guy's a real prize.
To the hideout.

1371
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:06,227
Excuse me,
you can't stop here.

1372
02:13:40,096 --> 02:13:40,762
It's 12:15 a.m.

1373
02:13:40,763 --> 02:13:42,931
It's 12:15 a.m.

1374
02:15:03,471 --> 02:15:06,264
Hey, I brought the stuff.

1375
02:15:08,809 --> 02:15:12,353
Takeuchi, you're gonna hang!

1376
02:15:38,923 --> 02:15:41,758
We've recovered
another 27,480,000 yen.

1377
02:15:41,926 --> 02:15:45,220
All that's missing
is the 20,000 he spent on heroin.

1378
02:15:45,387 --> 02:15:47,764
We wanted to let you know
as soon as possible.

1379
02:15:47,932 --> 02:15:49,933
Thank you.

1380
02:16:07,409 --> 02:16:09,369
Were we too late?

1381
02:16:09,537 --> 02:16:11,371
Have a seat.

1382
02:16:11,622 --> 02:16:12,914
Please.

1383
02:16:27,555 --> 02:16:31,766
No, please. You're free
to use them until the auction.

1384
02:16:54,415 --> 02:16:57,625
SEIZED PROPERTY

1385
02:17:16,437 --> 02:17:19,939
GINJIRO TAKEUCHI
GETS DEATH SENTENCE

1386
02:17:27,948 --> 02:17:29,741
Thank you for coming.

1387
02:17:30,242 --> 02:17:34,495
He refused to talk
with the prison chaplain.

1388
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:37,999
He insisted on speaking
to you instead.

1389
02:18:30,177 --> 02:18:33,012
Mr. Gondo, thanks for coming.

1390
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:00,289
You seem well.

1391
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:06,671
What are you doing now?

1392
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:10,216
Making shoes again.

1393
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:15,805
It's a small company,
but the owner gives me free rein.

1394
02:19:16,557 --> 02:19:22,020
I'm working hard
to rival National Shoes.

1395
02:19:28,944 --> 02:19:31,154
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1396
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:35,783
I'm going to die,
but I'm not afraid,

1397
02:19:35,951 --> 02:19:39,162
so stop looking at me
so pitifully.

1398
02:19:41,457 --> 02:19:44,542
That's why I refused
to see the chaplain.

1399
02:19:44,710 --> 02:19:47,462
He'd tell me to repent
and pray for mercy.

1400
02:19:47,629 --> 02:19:50,131
Why should I waste my time?

1401
02:19:52,509 --> 02:19:56,763
I'd rather be told the cruel truth

1402
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:59,974
than be fed gentle lies.

1403
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:14,739
Speaking of which,
you must be glad I'm going to die.

1404
02:20:14,907 --> 02:20:16,824
Aren't you?

1405
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,286
Why do you say such things?

1406
02:20:20,454 --> 02:20:25,166
Why do you think
we have to hate each other?

1407
02:20:25,334 --> 02:20:27,460
I don't know.

1408
02:20:28,837 --> 02:20:31,547
I'm not interested
in self-analysis.

1409
02:20:33,467 --> 02:20:38,513
But I do know my room
was so cold in winter

1410
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:41,015
and so hot in summer
I couldn't sleep.

1411
02:20:41,183 --> 02:20:45,144
From my tiny room,
your house looked like heaven.

1412
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:49,232
Day by day I came
to hate you more.

1413
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:52,193
It gave me a reason for living.

1414
02:20:58,867 --> 02:21:02,537
Besides, it's amusing
to make fortunate men

1415
02:21:02,704 --> 02:21:05,873
taste the same misery
as the unfortunate.

1416
02:21:07,751 --> 02:21:10,336
Were you really
so unfortunate?

1417
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:22,473
You want my life story?
Forget it.

1418
02:21:22,641 --> 02:21:27,520
I won't share my tales of woe
to earn your sympathy.

1419
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:31,399
I'm just glad my mom
died last year,

1420
02:21:31,567 --> 02:21:36,362
so I won't be sickened
by her pathetic slobbering.

1421
02:21:40,117 --> 02:21:44,120
Then why exactly
did you call me here?

1422
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:54,213
I couldn't stand having you think
I died crying and afraid.

1423
02:22:10,189 --> 02:22:14,025
You think I'm shaking out of fear,
but I'm not!

1424
02:22:14,193 --> 02:22:18,779
It's just a physiological reaction
from being in solitary too long.

1425
02:22:19,156 --> 02:22:22,617
Just leaving the cell
makes me shake.

1426
02:22:25,954 --> 02:22:29,874
I'm not afraid of death.
I don't care if I go to hell.

1427
02:22:30,042 --> 02:22:33,294
My life has been hell
since the day I was born.

1428
02:22:36,215 --> 02:22:41,594
But if I had to go to heaven,
then I'd really start to tremble.

1429
02:23:26,473 --> 02:23:29,850
THE END
