1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,963
<i>Previously on</i> 666 Park Avenue...

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,965
I was driving home, out of my mind.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,758
I think I hit somebody.

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,886
Do you remember what you
said to me that night?

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,638
That I would do anything
to walk again.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,265
Welcome to anything.

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,225
You've made your mother very happy.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,560
But if you hurt her again,

9
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,103
We're gonna have a problem.

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,896
Are you Harlan Moore?

11
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,815
That would make him...
117.

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,317
I have to find a door
to let Libby out.

13
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,527
The problem with opening doors...

14
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,112
You never know who's gonna
walk through them.

15
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,322
She did it.

16
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,286
So voter demographics
in this district

17
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,331
Have changed a lot
in the last six years.

18
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:40,708
We're talking about a 32% increase
In middle-income families.

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,751
I've noticed.

20
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,919
It's mostly due to some redistricting
That Sullivan pushed through.

21
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:45,629
The point is,

22
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,298
Cocktail parties alone
won't cut it these days.

23
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,925
I think Henry needs to be
out there in the community.

24
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,136
Well, it's a little cold for
a soapbox in central park.

25
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,806
Gavin, I was thinking
less soapbox, more pulpit.

26
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,185
Interesting idea except for
the fact that it's illegal.

27
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,849
Religious organizations
are nonprofit.

28
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:01,904
Right, which means

29
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,856
they can't endorse
a political candidate, but...

30
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,363
Henry's this district's
resident hero.

31
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:08,486
The public should just
meet him, hear him speak.

32
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,821
So he just happens to be
running for the council seat.

33
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,239
The speech would be personal,
not political.

34
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,617
Sell the man not the message.

35
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,118
I like it Gavin.

36
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,536
It'll get me talking to
the community about my values,

37
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,955
My character.

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,289
It's a smart idea, Laurel.

39
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,582
Good.

40
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,627
I think we should start
with the largest church...

41
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,878
Saint Thomas.

42
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,675
I'll put in a call to the cardinal
as soon as we're done.

43
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,260
The cardinal?

44
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,553
Gavin, full disclosure,

45
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,105
I'm kind of a lapsed catholic.

46
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,723
Well, you'll be fine.

47
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,266
The cardinal owes me a favor.

48
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,437
Good. All right.

49
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,906
Are you ever gonna tell me
why we're trying

50
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,876
To get Henry elected to city council?

51
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,578
Because he's a good man
with a bright future.

52
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,084
I wish you'd start
trusting me, dad...

53
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,369
Even just a little.

54
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,971
I do trust you a little.

55
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,799
That's why you're in our lives.

56
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,968
You want more.
Convince me.

57
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,478
I know I've made mistakes.

58
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,689
But I'm gonna fix things.

59
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,399
You'll see.

60
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,736
I look forward to it.

61
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,464
<i>We're all damned.</i>

62
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,963
The demons that haunt you

63
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,822
Can be expelled, father.

64
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:36,926
How?

65
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,844
Please tell me.

66
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,394
Slay the dragon.

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,356
The dragon?
I don't understand.

68
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,442
You have to kill Gavin Doran.

69
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,659
Episode 1x11: <i>Sins Of Our Father</i>

70
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,498
Was this before or after Dubai?

71
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,251
It was before Dubai
and after Malaysia.

72
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,294
God. It... Seems like a lifetime ago.

73
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,296
I'm just happy to be home.

74
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,757
New york...
greatest city in the world.

75
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,510
And the drake... its shining jewel.

76
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,073
I hope I'm
not interrupting something.

77
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,683
Speaking of shining jewels,

78
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,076
Allow me to introduce
our resident manager...

79
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,477
Jane Van Veen.

80
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,021
Jane, this is Patrick Corey.
He's moving in today.

81
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,232
Uh, today?

82
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,692
Charmed.

83
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,444
Um, thanks. Uh, Gavin,

84
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,988
Which apartment
is Mr. Corey moving in to?

85
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,030
2d.

86
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,290
Maris' old apartment?

87
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,284
But, uh... Wh-what about
the renovations?

88
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,785
We haven't even started yet.

89
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,496
Now you can work
directly with the tenant.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,669
There are demons in this world,

91
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,005
Walking among us,

92
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,006
Destroying us

93
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,475
One soul at a time,

94
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,112
Gaining power and influence over us.

95
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,932
You mean Gavin Doran.

96
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,934
How can you be sure?

97
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,519
He has an appointment
with the monsignor.

98
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,106
When you meet him,
you can decide for yourself.

99
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,904
I bought this...

100
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,165
From a dealer in Rome.

101
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,909
It's a grimoire

102
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,494
From the 16th century.

103
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,372
It gives three instructions
on destroying evil.

104
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,167
I assume you read latin.

105
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,595
"Only the hand of the cloth
may slay the dragon.

106
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,600
On holy ground
must its blood be spilled."

107
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,937
A priest, on hallowed ground,

108
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,165
Using a blade anointed
with the blood of a king.

109
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,566
That's the third part.

110
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,269
The blood of a king?

111
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,613
I know how to obtain
a knife like that.

112
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,949
You want me to kill a man?
This is crazy. It's wrong.

113
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,867
Papal law gives a holy dispensation

114
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,911
To soldiers of god.

115
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,330
The sin of murder

116
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,791
In the act of destroying evil
is absolved.

117
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,876
That's a law from the time
of the inquisition,

118
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,002
Ms. Harris.

119
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,587
There's no absolution for murder.

120
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,841
I can't stop him alone,
father. I need your help.

121
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,425
Too many people try
and justify evil acts

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,927
In the name of god.

123
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,355
Not many people see what you see.

124
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,115
We ever gonna talk about this?

125
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,383
About you getting wasted

126
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,984
And embarrassing yourself
the other night?

127
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,523
No. Not until you admit
you have a problem.

128
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:53,414
You know what? You're
right. I do have a problem.

129
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,458
I don't know how many times
you want me to tell you,

130
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,376
All I took that night
was one aspirin.

131
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,379
I got the news that
they wanted to do my show,

132
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,948
And you were so wasted,
you could hardly stand up.

133
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,167
Brian, I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

134
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,568
Maybe consider who made it possible

135
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,512
For you to write this play
in the first place.

136
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,307
Not like you've been working
your ass off to pay rent

137
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,435
Like I have for the last five years.

138
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,603
Nice.

139
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,062
And thank you

140
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,689
For reminding me what a loser I am.

141
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,358
Brian.

142
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,851
Wait.
Hey, we're not done here.

143
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,528
Yeah, we are.

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,026
The kitchen and the bathroom
need the most work.

145
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,462
My plan was to gut them both
and start over...

146
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,498
New fixtures, plumbing, tiles.

147
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,834
Sounds like a good plan.

148
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,171
And what... what do you do
for work, Mr. Uh, Corey?

149
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,881
Oh, a little of this,

150
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,175
Little of that.

151
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,469
You're a curious girl, Jane,

152
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,221
With a sad beauty.

153
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,389
Quite intoxicating.

154
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,116
Thank you, I think.

155
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,285
Well, I will do my best
to make this renovation

156
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,020
as painless as possible for you.

157
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,108
Well, what's a little pain
between friends, right?

158
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,403
You know, on second thought,

159
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,032
I think I'm going to do it myself.

160
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,159
Uh, I'm sorry.

161
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,469
Do what yourself?

162
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,570
Renovate.

163
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,739
And don't worry your charming
little head about it.

164
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,624
Gavin gave his blessing.

165
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,676
When I'm done,
I'll have you up for cocktails

166
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,212
And we'll get to know one another.

167
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,256
How's that sound?

168
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,007
Sure.

169
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,300
Excellent.

170
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,928
Welcome to the drake,

171
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,430
Mr. Corey.

172
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,895
Hey.

173
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,355
Hey.
Where you been?

174
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,332
Uh, there's a new tenant moving in.

175
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,025
I had to show him the apartment.

176
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,668
God, the guy's a total whacko.

177
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,571
He talks like he's something
out of an old Warner brothers movie.

178
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,200
And he's insisting on doing
his own renovations.

179
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,202
Yeah, definitely sounds like
a psycho.

180
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,445
Look at you,

181
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,914
Off to relive your glory days
as an altar boy.

182
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,375
Calm down. I'm just going to
church to save my immortal soul.

183
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,673
Henry, I want you to always
stay who you are.

184
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,425
Remember that.

185
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,593
It's the most important thing.

186
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,803
Where is this coming from?

187
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,889
- Are you worried about me?
- Yeah, I worry about you.

188
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,223
Don't.

189
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,267
I just feel like everything's
happening so fast,

190
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,269
The way it's all falling
into place for you.

191
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,939
Don't let anyone compromise
what you believe is right.

192
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,232
Jane, stop.

193
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,119
Are you sure

194
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,404
Gavin didn't plant that story
about Sullivan's affair?

195
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,531
That's what this is about?

196
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,159
I'm just asking.

197
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,203
Of course he didn't.

198
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,246
Hey, don't worry about me.

199
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,258
Hey, Henry.

200
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,710
Yeah.

201
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,518
I'm proud of you.

202
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,774
Blessed virgin,

203
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,601
Please forgive this poor sinner.

204
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,312
I don't know what to do.
Help me to see the path.

205
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,980
I...

206
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,177
Oh, God.

207
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,119
<i>Only you can stop him.</i>

208
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,526
No!

209
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,400
Mr. Corey!

210
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Corey...

211
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,416
Hi.

212
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,667
Patrick.

213
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,098
Door.

214
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,924
Miss Van Veen.

215
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,980
What a surprise.

216
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,515
Hi. Uh, your neighbors
are complaining

217
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,803
About the loud music.

218
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,017
Oh, dear me.

219
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:22,808
I suffer from enthusiasms
over a good stride piano.

220
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,393
I needed to hear it
over the hammering.

221
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm sorry. You've already
started construction?

222
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,647
Well, they say idle hands

223
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,399
Are the devil's playthings.

224
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,321
All renovation plans
need to be approved

225
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,572
Before you start construction.

226
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,365
Oh, I thought I'd surprise you.

227
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,743
Well, maybe I can take a look now.

228
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,507
Uh, miss van veen, while I
appreciate your pluck,

229
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,330
Now isn't a good time.

230
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:48,918
Perhaps later you can join me
and, uh, what's her name...

231
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:49,982
Shannon.

232
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,213
Me and Shannon for martinis.

233
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,986
I'm sorry. I-I'm busy.

234
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,021
Just try to keep
the music down, okay?

235
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,635
Wait.

236
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,114
Don't move.

237
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,959
Make a wish.

238
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,242
Beautiful, Marla.
Beautiful.

239
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,953
Great.

240
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:25,830
Think we got it.
Go change wardrobe.

241
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay. Alexis, let's reset,

242
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,089
Uh, before we freeze out here.

243
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:32,670
Oh, these shoots are the worst.

244
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,797
Guess that's what happens when
you piss off <i>Elle</i> magazine.

245
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,962
Is Brian still upset?

246
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,802
Brian thinks I'm
a selfish bitch, so yeah.

247
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,512
Well, I think he's just
stressed about his play.

248
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,222
Oh, right. His play.

249
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,974
I took a peek at it, by the way.

250
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,100
It's not that good.
Not like his old stuff.

251
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,352
I think it's great, actually.

252
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,878
He asked you to read it?

253
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,081
Yeah. Um, is that okay?

254
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,820
Sure.

255
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,253
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,033
It's not your fault.

257
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:13,544
Monsignor, it's nice
to see you again.

258
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,171
Gavin, how are you?
Great.

259
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,505
I'd like you to meet father Douglas.

260
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:20,176
Gavin is the prime benefactor
of the children's hospital.

261
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,970
Without him, the new wing
never would've broken ground.

262
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,221
Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,727
Well, I'm just along for the ride.

264
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,312
This is Laurel Harris.

265
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,856
Father Douglas.

266
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,922
Monsignor Williams, allow me
to introduce Henry Martin.

267
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,820
Soon to be this district's
newest council member.

268
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,093
The hero himself.

269
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,260
Pleasure to meet you, monsignor.

270
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,450
Very impressive, what you did
at the mayor's house.

271
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,743
I want to hear all about it.

272
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,453
By the way, Gavin tells me
you're a scratch golfer.

273
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,622
Um, I... I do all right.

274
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,249
You'll have to join us
for a game sometime.

275
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,605
Yeah, I'd like that.

276
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,461
Please, everyone, come inside.
I have some fresh coffee on.

277
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,297
I think ms. Harris and I should
let you all get acquainted.

278
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,593
But don't be too easy on him.

279
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:11,056
"A shining light
in a city of shadows."

280
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:15,064
- What does it mean?
- I don't know,

281
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,399
But it's all over
Peter Kramer's journal.

282
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,724
I mean, half that thing's
in some kind of code

283
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,166
Or weird alphabet.

284
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,136
Okay, how is there no clue
to deciphering this text?

285
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,905
Is this the only file
on the order of the dragon?

286
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,285
You know what?
In that one, too.

287
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,574
I've looked through it before.

288
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,977
Never saw any mention of that phrase

289
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,169
Or code or anything.

290
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,008
Oh, my god.

291
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,022
It's him.

292
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:45,302
Who?

293
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,512
A man named Patrick Corey

294
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,305
Moved into the drake today.

295
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,267
Now I know it sounds crazy,
but this is him in the picture.

296
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,770
I swear.
It's the same guy.

297
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,522
What are you gonna do?

298
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,104
I-I-I don't know. I...

299
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,039
He killed Libby,
so obviously he's dangerous.

300
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:05,322
I-I need to figure out what
he's doing in that apartment.

301
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,319
Henry's wrapping up.

302
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,134
That night...

303
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,136
Your mother had already gone to bed

304
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,683
When the police called,

305
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,935
But I was still awake.

306
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,730
They wouldn't give me any details,
but I knew it was bad.

307
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,523
Can we please not
talk about this here?

308
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,775
It's ironic now.

309
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,415
When they told me you'd been killed,

310
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,384
I refused to believe them.

311
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,222
How could you possibly
be taken away from us?

312
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,036
It didn't make any sense.

313
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:56,081
When I saw that
burning wreck of a car, I...

314
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,043
Never felt so powerless.

315
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,502
A few days later,

316
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,104
I buried you...

317
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:09,241
My only child...

318
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,721
Right here.

319
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,278
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,163
I love you, Sasha.

321
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,670
No matter what.

322
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,343
I always have.

323
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,036
And I always will.

324
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,390
I love you, too, dad.

325
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,631
Hello, father.

326
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,320
You mind if join you?

327
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,115
No, please.

328
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,035
The monsignor is very nice.

329
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,144
I'm gonna speak in
the congregation tomorrow.

330
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,542
When did you last attend mass?

331
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,130
It's been a while.

332
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,086
I mean, I-I was raised catholic.

333
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,356
It's part of who I am, but...

334
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,138
I don't know.
Maybe I have more doubts now.

335
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,828
Faith can be a challenge,

336
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,977
Even for the most devout.

337
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,606
God tests us.

338
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:47,151
But when we're called,
it's up to us to answer.

339
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:51,155
I feel a calling to public service.

340
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,111
You know, I have since
I was pretty young.

341
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:54,325
Now you have someone

342
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,035
Like Gavin Doran
opening doors for you.

343
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,215
What do you mean, someone like Gavin?

344
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,371
He's... He's been
a good friend to me.

345
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,082
Be careful of him, Henry.

346
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,590
The path you've been called to
is rife with temptation.

347
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,755
Your soul will be tested.

348
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,257
Stand fast against evil

349
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,593
Wherever you find it.

350
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,804
Okay.

351
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,791
I...

352
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:21,806
I see things in people, the truth...

353
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:24,230
Of who they are.

354
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,023
I can see

355
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,313
That you are a good man.

356
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,486
I try to be.

357
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,238
Henry.

358
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,866
Ready to go?

359
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,791
Excuse me.

360
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,038
If you confess your sins,

361
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,427
I can absolve you now.

362
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:45,330
Tomorrow you'll speak before
god with a clear conscience.

363
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:48,337
I have to go, father.

364
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,318
- Allow me to help you with that.
- No, that's all right. I got it.

365
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,778
Nonsense.

366
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,698
Please be careful.
That's camera gear.

367
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:16,907
Safe.

368
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,447
Patrick Corey.

369
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,882
2d. Just moved in.

370
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,499
Nice to meet you.
I'm Louise.

371
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,587
And you look like
you could use a drink.

372
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,022
And lucky for you,

373
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,839
I'm hosting a little
cocktail party upstairs.

374
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,467
You, me, a bottle, and your camera.

375
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,427
I'm married. Excuse me.

376
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:37,803
I'd never tell.

377
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:38,971
Sleazebag.

378
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,200
All right?

379
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,634
Yeah, thanks, Tony.

380
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,105
Hey, some weather we're having
today, isn't it, Mr. Corey?

381
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,973
Yeah. Tell me, Tony,

382
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:50,483
What's a fella like you
doing in a job like this?

383
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,109
Just trying to stay out of trouble.

384
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,415
You like to get into trouble?

385
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,031
Not particularly.

386
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,658
Listen, Tony.

387
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:04,257
An <i>obscene amount</i>
of items I've purchased

388
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:05,925
Are going to be delivered
this afternoon.

389
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,292
Could you bring 'em up
when they arrive?

390
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,396
It's gonna be a busy day
for me, Mr. Corey.

391
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,963
Uh, better you come down
and get 'em yourself.

392
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,168
Appreciate the courtesy.

393
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,583
Next item up for bid,

394
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,987
Lot 28, "The meeting of Jephthah
and his daughter"

395
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,023
By the circle of Peter Paul Rubens.

396
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,658
That one.

397
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,282
Oil on copper, the subject
of the present lot...

398
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,034
Do you think dad will like it?

399
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,328
Well, if it's from you,
he'll love it.

400
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,163
The bidding will start at $10,000.

401
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,915
Do I hear $10,000?

402
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,458
Thank you. $10,000.

403
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,539
Gentleman on my right at $10,000 now.

404
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:53,879
$15,000 will be next.

405
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,840
In the rear at $15,000.
Thank you, sir.

406
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,550
At $15,000.
$20,000 will be next.

407
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,052
At $15,000 now.

408
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:04,140
Thank you, Mrs. Olivia Doran
at $20,000.

409
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,351
At $20,000.

410
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:07,053
$25,000.
It's against you, madam.

411
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,622
At $25,000 now.

412
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,152
On my right at $25,000...

413
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:12,064
Mom.

414
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:14,066
What would you do...

415
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,026
If you lost dad?

416
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,946
I wouldn't worry about that, Sasha.
Your father is quite capable.

417
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,157
Yes,
but he does have a lot of enemies.

418
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,241
No?

419
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:24,370
At $30,000. Mrs. Olivia Doran
at $30,000.

420
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:26,036
Why are we talking about this?

421
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,414
At $30,000.
Because I worry about you.

422
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,644
What would you do if...
someone hurt him?

423
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,169
I would find them

424
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,171
And deal with how upset I was.

425
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,131
... At $35,000.

426
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,299
Would you like to say $40,000?

427
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,820
$40,000. At $40,000 now.

428
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:44,090
Still the lady's bid at $40,000.

429
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:47,099
Fair warning at $40,000.

430
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:49,862
Sold. Mrs. Olivia Doran for $40,000.

431
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,831
Thank you all very much.

432
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:53,522
Sweetheart, I love your father.

433
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:56,150
I don't want to think
about losing him.

434
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,908
Thanks for the painting, mom.

435
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,282
My pleasure.

436
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,867
A bronze roman dagger

437
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,514
Circa 44 B.C.E.

438
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,118
And this very dagger actually
is believed to have been used

439
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,835
In the assassination
of Julius Caesar.

440
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,222
And we have a lot of interest
in this lot,

441
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:19,840
And we'd like to start
the bidding at $20,000.

442
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,427
Do I hear $20,000?
Thank you, sir.

443
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:23,219
Gentleman on my right.

444
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:30,309
I guess my husband's not coming home.

445
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,436
He didn't call?

446
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:34,271
He's not that considerate.

447
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,744
Well, I think he's
going through a lot.

448
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,945
What does that mean?
What about me, Lex?

449
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,863
Good night, Lou.

450
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,783
No. Unh-unh. I want to know
what you meant by that.

451
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,120
All day

452
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,422
All you do is complain...

453
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,413
About how Brian is not there for you,

454
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,927
How he doesn't understand you,
how he doesn't believe you.

455
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,929
No wonder he doesn't want
to come home.

456
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:59,672
The Louise show is exhausting.

457
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:06,345
You have this great guy
who loves you.

458
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,776
You just won't see it.

459
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,016
Well,

460
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,813
Whatever you said, the monsignor...

461
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,438
Really took a shine to you.

462
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,749
Good job.

463
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:17,917
That's funny.

464
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,752
I think we talked more about
golf than we did about god.

465
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,861
He's kind of a zealot in that regard.

466
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,238
How was, um...
Father Douglas?

467
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,074
Kind of intense.

468
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,410
Said he feared for my soul.

469
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:31,931
Why, after all these years,

470
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,165
Do priests still make me feel guilty?

471
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:38,504
Guilt is something I choose not to...

472
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:40,087
Feel.

473
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,464
It's liberating.

474
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,811
So Olivia has never made you
feel guilty about anything?

475
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:46,886
I'm sorry. I didn't know
we were talking about women.

476
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,680
What did you do?

477
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,017
I lied to Jane.

478
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:56,789
About leaking the Sullivan
affair to the press.

479
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,063
I lied right to her face

480
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,149
When she asked me
if you were involved.

481
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,901
'Cause you didn't think
she'd understand.

482
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,194
That's right.

483
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,448
Stop protecting her.

484
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,202
Next time tell her the truth.

485
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:10,534
Make her understand

486
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,370
The man you need to be.

487
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:15,748
Mr. Corey.

488
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,173
Mr. Corey?

489
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,979
Anybody home?

490
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,221
Hello, Harlan.

491
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,692
You're Harlan Moore.

492
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:21,230
How'd you figure it out?

493
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,699
I'd rather not say.

494
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,694
You're a special girl, Jane.

495
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,946
I can tell this place likes you.

496
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,781
Why is this door padlocked?

497
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,743
I'd rather not say.

498
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,040
You murdered Libby Griffith.

499
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:47,878
Right.

500
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,345
Poor Libby.

501
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,723
Why did you do that?

502
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,437
Selfish reasons.

503
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,981
We thought we could become
like Vanderbilt

504
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,906
and Carnegie.

505
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,651
It was foolish.

506
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,695
Libby was innocent.

507
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,823
Not as innocent as little Jocelyn.

508
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:17,218
Your grandmother was the one
we were supposed to offer.

509
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,953
Murder.

510
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,081
Supposed to murder.

511
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,253
Murder...

512
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,485
Yes.

513
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,732
We, uh,

514
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,136
Called up something

515
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,670
Terrible that night,

516
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,738
Something we couldn't control.

517
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,273
It took over the drake,

518
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,603
And then one by one, it destroyed us.

519
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,112
Why did you come back here?

520
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,514
Because...

521
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,949
Now I'm... I'm free from the prison

522
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,752
Of my decaying body.

523
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,281
I've a-a second chance
to right my wrongs.

524
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:59,286
That is what I intend to do.

525
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,248
Well, I'm sorry
if I don't believe you.

526
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,250
You know what you are, Jane?

527
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,128
A shining light in a city of shadows.

528
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:13,307
You wanted to know
how to read Peter's journal?

529
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,052
That phrase is key.

530
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,012
It's a cipher text.

531
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,394
And a-a gesture of my good intent.

532
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,120
Esmeralda physically can't write
u-unless she's with him.

533
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,956
I mean, it's like
a-a creative paralysis.

534
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,858
So when he says
he's moving to Brazil, it...

535
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,293
It destroys her.

536
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,494
Exactly.

537
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,830
It, uh, like, renders her
just catatonic.

538
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,865
Brian, you have a visitor.

539
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,536
Um, you know, why don't
we just break for lunch?

540
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,622
That's 30, everybody. 30.

541
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,225
Hello?

542
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:33,130
I asked the stage manager
to change the lights.

543
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,090
Something about being here
makes me want to dance.

544
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,885
Why'd you ever quit?

545
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,960
It doesn't matter.

546
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,432
What matters is, I'm gonna
start dancing again.

547
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,732
Thanks to you.

548
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,477
What did I do?

549
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,855
You inspired me to.

550
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,737
We have a special connection, Brian.

551
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,281
I think you know that.

552
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:02,451
What if everything
that's happened between us

553
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,579
Is actually a lot simpler
than we thought?

554
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,666
What do you mean?

555
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,419
What if it's love?

556
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,019
Henry?

557
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,922
What's going on with you?

558
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,243
Jane, look, I, uh...

559
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,706
I have a confession to make.

560
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,297
Okay.

561
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,132
I don't want to keep
any secrets from you,

562
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,794
And I should've told you
what was going on.

563
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,758
Gavin did leak
the Sullivan story to the press,

564
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,374
And I knew about it.

565
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,635
So...

566
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,513
What you said to me this morning...

567
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:07,308
You lied to me?

568
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,225
Yeah, I didn't think
you'd understand.

569
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,602
You're right.
I don't understand.

570
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,896
The guy cheated on
his sick wife with an intern.

571
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,153
I didn't make him do that.

572
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,728
The story needed
to get out there quick

573
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:15,983
Or else we'd miss our window.

574
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,235
It's dirty politics, Henry,

575
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,446
Something you said
you'd never be a part of.

576
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,823
Jane, you don't get to city hall
by being an altar boy.

577
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,116
Oh, that'll make
a great campaign slogan.

578
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,076
- Jane, where are you going?
- I'm sleeping on the couch.

579
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,568
Jane...

580
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,393
I can't believe you lied to me.

581
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,310
Is that it?

582
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,440
Gaius Julius Caesar...

583
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,334
So hated for his tyranny...

584
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,038
That he was murdered
by his own people.

585
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,006
May god forgive me
for what I'm going to do.

586
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,036
May god also forgive me.

587
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:21,966
So I took your advice

588
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,343
And I told Jane the truth
about the whole Sullivan thing.

589
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,043
Ah. I'll hazard a guess

590
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:28,179
That's why she's not here, too.

591
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,599
She slept on the couch last night.

592
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,645
Growing pains, Henry.

593
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,022
She won't stay mad for long.

594
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,734
Okay, so Harlan was right.

595
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,893
It is a cipher text,

596
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,728
But this is all I've managed
to get so far.

597
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:46,407
And there are pages
and pages of this stuff.

598
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:47,698
It's gonna take a while to decode.

599
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,202
That's okay. We'll split it three ways.
You, me, and cooper.

600
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:53,122
I thought cooper
was in the dog house.

601
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,972
No, I'm afraid the only person
in the dog house

602
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:58,109
Is my dear...
Sweet Henry.

603
00:31:58,234 --> 00:31:59,712
What did he do?

604
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:02,046
Nothing. Never mind.

605
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,449
So... I'm mature enough to handle

606
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,927
Mysterious codes from dead murderers,

607
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,346
But not a little relationship drama?

608
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,933
He... Lied about something.

609
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,435
Okay?
So?

610
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,145
I mean...

611
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,855
What does he think
you're doing right now?

612
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,730
Well... It's different.

613
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,067
You know, I-I'm worried
he's turning into somebody

614
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,444
I won't recognize.

615
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,936
Look, Jane, I'm no expert,

616
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,571
But it sounds like you're suffering

617
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,140
From what Dr. Phil calls...

618
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,868
"projection."

619
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,369
Really?

620
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,246
Changes, keeping secrets.

621
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,584
But hey, I'm only 16.

622
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,837
As I mentioned
at the beginning of our service,

623
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,340
We have a local hero with us today.

624
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,425
We've read a lot about him
in the papers.

625
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,636
I'd like to invite Henry Martin

626
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,179
Up to the podium to say a few words.

627
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,181
Henry.

628
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,570
"The eyes of god are in every place,

629
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,948
"beholding the evil

630
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,983
And the good within all of us."

631
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,994
My dad used to tell me that.

632
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,996
We try and convince ourselves

633
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,791
That we can hide from those eyes,

634
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,726
That when we do something wrong,
we won't be judged...

635
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,160
Deliver me from evil, father.

636
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,965
<i>Or held to account.</i>

637
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,050
But my dad impressed upon me

638
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:30,219
That we always were

639
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,222
And we always will be.

640
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:39,822
And he also impressed upon me
the grace of forgiveness.

641
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,648
That we must forgive those
who we love

642
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:48,028
And hope they find the grace
to forgive us as well.

643
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,692
Do you know the story

644
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,061
Of Jephthah and his daughter?

645
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,829
Remind me.

646
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,898
Jephthah was an ancient warrior

647
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:02,460
Who made a deal with god.

648
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,169
"Allow me to win in battle," he said,

649
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,104
"and I'll sacrifice the first person

650
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:10,041
To walk out of my house
upon returning home."

651
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,969
Do you know who he saw?

652
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:15,097
I remember now.

653
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,640
His only daughter.

654
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,909
That is stunning.

655
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:25,397
But this frame is atrocious.

656
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,028
I think we have a much nicer one

657
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,488
Downstairs in the basement.

658
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,323
We should look.

659
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,709
Hello, father.

660
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,280
Shall we get this over with?

661
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,842
In the name of god...

662
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,479
She used you, father.

663
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,323
Hey.

664
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,758
Hey, uh, babe, can I...

665
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:42,411
Can I talk to you for a second?

666
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,371
Yeah, yeah, sure.

667
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,124
- Listen, I...
- No, let me go first.

668
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,625
Jane, you were right.

669
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,890
I messed up.
I never should've lied to you.

670
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,291
And when you walked into that church,

671
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,442
You made me realize
that I'm better than that.

672
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:53,464
- No, Henry...
- Jane...

673
00:36:58,156 --> 00:36:59,845
Will you marry me?

674
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:01,702
Our love

675
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:03,307
Is my light in the darkness.

676
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:05,351
I would be lost without you.

677
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:10,022
Will you please spend
the rest of your life with me?

678
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,470
Yeah.

679
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,027
Y... uh, yes.

680
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:15,986
Yes?

681
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,196
Yes.

682
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:21,951
Oh, my god.

683
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,913
Oh, I love you.

684
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,086
After you, mom.

685
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:35,002
I seem to remember the frames being

686
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,337
Back here somewhere.

687
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:40,678
Your father should be
returning from the service soon.

688
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,681
Actually, I don't think so.

689
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,977
Put it down, Sasha.

690
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:49,645
It's all over.

691
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:51,355
You can't hurt me here.

692
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:52,648
Put that down.

693
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,192
You'll never make it
out of the drake.

694
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:07,163
Please, mom.

695
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:09,206
Sweetheart, why?

696
00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:13,586
Everything you gave me,
you took from innocent people.

697
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,339
No. None of them were innocent.

698
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:19,175
Least of all father Douglas.

699
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,987
So what are you gonna do?

700
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:28,559
You gonna kill me,

701
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,604
Your only daughter?

702
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,959
Step back.

703
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,224
Oh, my god.

704
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,226
There's only one way out

705
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,173
If you want to live.

706
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:42,925
Where does it go?

707
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,898
For you...

708
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,345
To a whole new life,

709
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,098
A fresh start.

710
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,599
Somewhere beautiful.

711
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,811
I don't believe you.

712
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,842
Sasha...

713
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,345
You're my daughter, and I love you.

714
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,277
But you can't stay here.

715
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,612
And you can never come back.

716
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,324
Mom...

717
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:10,280
Please.

718
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:14,665
Don't be afraid, my love.

719
00:40:48,752 --> 00:40:52,055
Mother!

720
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:15,655
You want something done right,

721
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,747
You just have to do it yourself.

722
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:22,452
No mistakes this time.
No excuses.

723
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:01,355
Hi.

724
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:06,062
Is it too late
to take you up on that drink?

725
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:10,030
It's never too late
for a drink, doll.

726
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,616
Great.
