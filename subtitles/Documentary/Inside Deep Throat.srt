1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,591
We are living
in a glorious time,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,416
a time of great conflict
to be sure.

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:10,037
<i>Today, a nationwide crackdown
was underway... </i>

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,147
<i>... eight men were arrested
from... </i>

5
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:14,804
<i>... hardcore
pornographic pictures. </i>

6
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:18,458
On one side
of the coin are those in favor

7
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:20,083
of absolutely no censorship.

8
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,112
<i>On the other hand,
there are those who advocate</i>

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,528
<i>the government dictating to us
what we should see,</i>

10
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:30,736
<i>read, and hear. </i>

11
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,777
<i>... they say it all started
with the sex film Deep Throat.</i>

12
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,739
<i>I saw Deep Throat in New York</i>

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,759
when it first came out.

14
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,882
<i>People were lined up</i>

15
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,986
for at least three blocks.

16
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,946
Oh, yeah, there was a screening in
some psychoanalyst's apartment

17
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,506
and everybody watched
and smoked dope. Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,032
<i>I thought, "Fantastic. " </i>

19
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:25,651
<i>"This is going to change
the climate</i>

20
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:29,138
of talking about
issues of sexuality

21
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,541
in these United States. "

22
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,999
<i>I'm one of the handful
of people who never saw it. </i>

23
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,881
I didn't intend to not see it.

24
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,207
Perhaps you could
arrange for me to see it.

25
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,704
Now.

26
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,799
<i>Deep Throat
was an epochal moment</i>

27
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,588
in the history
of modern sexuality.

28
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,755
It is the first time that
respectable middle-class women

29
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,581
<i>went to porn theaters. </i>

30
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:10,318
<i>It really broke down,</i>

31
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,693
<i>uh, traditional codes
of... of decorum. </i>

32
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:16,982
<i>Linda Lovelace,</i>

33
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,568
<i>and conversations,
and jokes about Deep Throat,</i>

34
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,428
<i>appeared
on network television. </i>

35
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:23,415
If the film
became mainstream,

36
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:25,901
conversation about it
became truly mainstream.

37
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,633
It's kind of
a strange country, isn't it?

38
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:30,257
<i>Judges can see Deep Throat, but
they can't listen to those tapes.</i>

39
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,255
<i>I think the major thing
that set, uh,</i>

40
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,889
<i>Deep Throat apart was,</i>

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,236
it had a gimmick.

42
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,482
Ah! Ah... ah!

43
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,485
Well, there it is, you
little bugger, there it is.

44
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:43,730
What?

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,091
Your clitoris, it's deep down
in the bottom of your throat.

46
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,262
The clitoris
hidden in the throat

47
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,269
was something you could
talk about and laugh about.

48
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,284
It's better than having
no clitoris at all.

49
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,359
That's easy
for you to say.

50
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,164
Suppose your balls
were in your ear.

51
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,621
<i>I was 19 when I saw it. </i>

52
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,478
<i>I don't think I had found
where the clitoris really was. </i>

53
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:09,005
So I think the idea

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,540
that it was misplaced

55
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,501
on the human body
was lost on me.

56
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,152
I... I was looking for
the original site.

57
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:17,331
It was a giggle.

58
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,951
And the worst thing to be
said about us, as Americans,

59
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:21,778
is that we'll sell
our souls for a giggle.

60
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:23,734
Listen, uh, we have
the problem solved.

61
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:25,871
All we have to do now
is find the solution.

62
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,468
Like what?

63
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,655
Like deep throat.

64
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,019
Deep what?

65
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:32,979
Throat.

66
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,217
Have you ever taken
a penis all the way down

67
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,463
to the bottom
of your throat?

68
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,114
It was a badge of
the new freedom.

69
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,415
<i>Have you been
to the experience</i>

70
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:51,826
<i>of paying to go
in a porno theater</i>

71
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,324
<i>And see a woman
give a blowjob</i>

72
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,395
<i>in a movie theater
in your community?</i>

73
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,159
<i>That was very, very new. </i>

74
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,916
Something that's hard
for people today to imagine,

75
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,573
how liberating that was.

76
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,548
Or... or terrible, depending on
what you believe in.

77
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,388
It's a floodtide of
filth that's engulfed

78
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,890
the minds and
hearts and souls

79
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,875
of America like
nothing else ever has.

80
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,299
<i>We have smut all over the face
of this country now</i>

81
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:21,009
<i>because we are letting
those immoral people</i>

82
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,794
<i>have their way
in our country. </i>

83
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,095
<i>Deep Throat succeeded
commercially at least in part</i>

84
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,618
because the government
went after it.

85
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:35,408
<i>The government became
the driving force</i>

86
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,200
<i>behind the public relations. </i>

87
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:43,443
<i>I just saw it and I liked it. </i>

88
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:46,770
<i>I liked it. I wanted to see a dirty
picture and that's what I saw. </i>

89
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:49,683
<i>But I want the right
to see that picture. </i>

90
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,359
<i>I don't want somebody telling me
that I can't see a dirty picture. </i>

91
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:59,601
<i>Deep Throat attacks
the very core of our being.</i>

92
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,950
<i>Every time someone
watches that movie,</i>

93
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,872
they're watching me
being raped.

94
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,942
<i>Do I belong in jail for five years
for acting in Deep Throat?</i>

95
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:47,144
<i>Deep Throat now
has had a phenomenal success</i>

96
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,291
going on
for two-and-a-half years,

97
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,184
and it's only
because it's being hassled.

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,258
Do you
think it's a good movie?

99
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,818
No, I don't think
it's a good movie.

100
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,235
I'm takin' a walk,
Mrs. Brown.

101
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,718
I am doing fine, dear,
thank you.

102
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,654
These are some pictures

103
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:58,249
or posters from some
of the films I've done.

104
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,117
Aren't they kind of cute?

105
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:12,263
A picture of Gerard, my son,
when he was a lot younger,

106
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:14,923
and my daughter
when she was younger.

107
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,556
<i>Long before
Deep Throat, Damiano was a family man. </i>

108
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,972
<i>He and his wife ran a beauty
salon in Queens, New York. </i>

109
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:29,387
<i>I enjoyed being a hairdresser</i>

110
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:32,489
<i>because I always
could relate to women. </i>

111
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,689
<i>After you got to know
the woman,</i>

112
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,313
<i>especially when you
worked on them weekly,</i>

113
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,555
you start to get into history

114
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:43,078
about "we went to the movies"
and "he did this and I did... "

115
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:44,972
And realize that most...

116
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,948
most of the women
were very unhappy

117
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:49,095
in their relationship

118
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,884
with the person that
they were married to

119
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,707
and supposedly
in love with.

120
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:57,513
<i>After 40 years of marriage,
you know, you can get</i>

121
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,491
<i>tired of the good old
in and out. </i>

122
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:04,041
You... you got to be intimate.
It was almost like a priest.

123
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,281
I mean, I... I don't wanna say
I was a priest,

124
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,772
but it was almost like... it
was almost like a confessor.

125
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,068
<i>The confessions Damiano heard
in his salon,</i>

126
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:15,819
<i>made him realize he was on the
frontlines of a sexual revolution. </i>

127
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,998
<i>We grew up in a time</i>

128
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,136
in which sex itself
was largely taboo.

129
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:28,162
<i>When I was a kid, young people didn't
even know where babies came from. </i>

130
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:29,252
<i>I'd love to know. </i>

131
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,140
If I watch the rest of this
program, will I know the answer?

132
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,229
Gore Vidal would be very good
on the subject.

133
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:39,620
You must take into account
how ignorant people are.

134
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,155
<i>Particularly our countrymen,</i>

135
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,236
who have never taken
a course in biology,

136
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,518
never read a book.

137
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,817
Do you know anything
about the facts of life?

138
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,772
Not very much,
I'm afraid.

139
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:54,120
<i>The facts of life
and sexual morality in general</i>

140
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,618
<i>were forbidden topics. </i>

141
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>But as all that changed,
issues about sexuality</i>

142
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:00,292
<i>began to divide society. </i>

143
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:03,561
<i>Artificial contraception
is wrong. </i>

144
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:04,997
<i>Evil. </i>

145
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,856
<i>People were experimenting. </i>

146
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,583
<i>They were looking
for new kinds of lives. </i>

147
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,850
They were looking to break out
of all the old molds.

148
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,505
<i>And we knew
the American public were tired</i>

149
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:19,719
<i>of words like "coitus. "</i>

150
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,642
They wanted words,
like "fuck,"

151
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,531
and "suck," and "eat my cunt. "

152
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,687
I think the more that
filth is thrown at Americans

153
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,382
the less favored it becomes.

154
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:34,663
They're depicting sex
in a very filthy way.

155
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,811
<i>Jackie Kennedy
went to see that. </i>

156
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,534
The next week,
the gross doubled.

157
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:43,397
I... I don't mind seeing sex in
a... in a movie just for its own sake

158
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,377
because I think that's one
of the, you know,

159
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,307
more interesting
human emotions.

160
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:50,273
<i>Sex was in movies.
Sex was on TV.</i>

161
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,707
Sex came out of the closet.

162
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:00,480
<i>You had to be there.
You had to be there. </i>

163
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:02,497
<i>I'm thrilled
that I was there. </i>

164
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,480
And thank God
I had a camera with me.

165
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,141
<i>As the sexual revolution
swept through society,</i>

166
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:10,211
<i>people took sides in a culture
war that was gathering steam. </i>

167
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,650
<i>Gerry Damiano
joined the fray by swapping</i>

168
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,602
<i>his blow dryer
for a movie camera. </i>

169
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,449
<i>I loved film.
I... I always did. </i>

170
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,361
<i>The only thing you could make
was sex films. </i>

171
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:22,815
Uh, that was the only thing
you were allowed to make

172
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,809
and you made them
at a low budget.

173
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,226
Doing hardcore films
in those days, the early '70s,

174
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,576
<i>was very much
like summer stock. </i>

175
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,757
It was like,

176
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:37,247
"Daddy has a barn,
let's do a show. "

177
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:39,906
Oh, my!

178
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:40,927
Oh!

179
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,662
Lt... it was the only choice
we had.

180
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,349
Till 24 years old
without,

181
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,254
you know, uh, uh,

182
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,833
what do you call it, uh,
a track record, you know.

183
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,528
And these things
were so inexpensive.

184
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,179
Okay, what I want now is
some of your ass,

185
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,330
all right?

186
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,283
<i>I meant business. </i>

187
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:07,557
<i>I approached those films as if</i>

188
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:12,071
I was Luc Godard
or somebody, you know.

189
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:13,791
And just wiggle it
towards us.

190
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,932
I want to fill up 40 feet
of screen with your ass.

191
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,696
You're always
after my ass.

192
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,816
Keep wigglin'.

193
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:27,010
That's where I met
half of the people

194
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:29,480
that I became
acquainted with.

195
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,304
We were all working
for nothing.

196
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:33,856
Well, one of
Gerry's motivations

197
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,071
was to get laid.

198
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,455
Really. And he did.

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,970
<i>You could make a living</i>

200
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,724
<i>if you were a filmmaker,
making these films. </i>

201
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,792
Quite a number of people became
legitimate Hollywood directors

202
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:50,944
out of the porn industry.

203
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:53,504
I mean, for a while there, it
was kinda like the entry level job

204
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:54,820
that you would do.

205
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,091
<i>Uh, you would
work on... on porn. </i>

206
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,605
I'm... I... I certainly
worked on them.

207
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:03,101
I'm not gonna say which
ones, but I... I was around it.

208
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,062
<i>All of sudden, there was
a new word. </i>

209
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,037
<i>It was called "filmmaker. "</i>

210
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:10,085
<i>You became
an independent filmmaker. </i>

211
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,313
We were actually doing it

212
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,042
And we couldn't believe it.

213
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,414
We couldn't believe it,
and thank God there was,

214
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,171
there was such
a thing as sex.

215
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,432
<i>There was sex,
but at the time,</i>

216
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:25,318
<i>the only way to put hardcore
sex on the screen legally,</i>

217
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:27,139
<i>was in sex education films. </i>

218
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:32,580
My name is
Dr. Morris Rosengarden.

219
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,470
<i>They would show sexual scenes,</i>

220
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,292
but they couldn't be accused
of pornography

221
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,919
because it had
an educational value.

222
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,102
<i>Some men
find their wives' buttocks</i>

223
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,141
<i>very stimulating visually. </i>

224
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,790
We needed a father figure
for almost everything.

225
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,181
<i>This may be uncomfortable</i>

226
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,873
<i>for the obese
or older couples. </i>

227
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,793
<i>Why did you need a doctor
to tell you it was okay?</i>

228
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,236
<i>And I said,</i>

229
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,823
"Hey, instead of
discussing not doing it,

230
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,414
let's do it
and don't even discuss it. "

231
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,916
<i>There's nothing
to be ashamed of. </i>

232
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,716
<i>But there was plenty
to be afraid of. </i>

233
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:22,138
<i>In addition to running the risk
of arrest and incarceration,</i>

234
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,156
<i>the criminal underworld
virtually controlled</i>

235
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,052
<i>the production of pornography. </i>

236
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,050
<i>There was something exciting
about it. </i>

237
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:40,288
It... it lived in some,
uh, mid-world

238
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:41,731
between crime and art

239
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:44,353
<i>and it was adventurous. </i>

240
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,756
Young people today
would be in it for the money

241
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:56,796
whereas in the old days,
it was for the rebellion.

242
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,564
<i>Frankly, everybody
in one way or another</i>

243
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:02,978
<i>was connected to that business</i>

244
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:06,339
because psychologically,
socially, it was happening.

245
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,638
<i>You know, it was part
of a social movement</i>

246
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:09,635
<i>at the time. </i>

247
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,589
Anybody who took chances

248
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,922
in breaking the social mores
of the time,

249
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,876
was considered a hero.

250
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,624
<i>I believed in it. </i>

251
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,213
I believed that it was
about time to say

252
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:22,909
that sex
is a beautiful thing,

253
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,475
the human body is
a beautiful thing,

254
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:26,207
and you really
shouldn't be ashamed of it.

255
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,701
<i>Securing financial backing
from partners</i>

256
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,016
<i>with underworld connections,</i>

257
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:33,379
<i>Damiano raised enough money to
shoot a hardcore sex feature. </i>

258
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:36,378
<i>It was going to be called
The Doctor Makes a House Call.</i>

259
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,109
<i>Then Damiano met his muse,</i>

260
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,862
<i>Linda Lovelace,
and everything changed. </i>

261
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:51,578
To me, I always looked at her
as the girl next door.

262
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:01,598
<i>Before she became world-famous
as Linda Lovelace,</i>

263
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,798
<i>Linda Boreman dreamt of
opening a clothing boutique</i>

264
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,169
<i>until she met Chuck Traynor. </i>

265
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:12,252
<i>I guess he was an escape
for her. </i>

266
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:15,806
She was not comfortable
living in her parents' home.

267
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,589
And he took her away
from that.

268
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,706
<i>But things
started getting strange. </i>

269
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,709
<i>Linda told me
that she had quit smoking,</i>

270
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:31,482
and I said, "Well, how did
you do it, how did you quit?"

271
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:34,304
She said that
Chuck had hypnotized her.

272
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,848
<i>She said every time
she tried to have a cigarette,</i>

273
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:39,994
<i>that she would hiccup. </i>

274
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,007
I'm like, "Oh, well, okay. "

275
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:45,440
<i>Within a year,
they were married. </i>

276
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:49,623
I curse the day that
she ever met

277
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,255
Chuck Traynor.

278
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:55,580
Unfortunately, he died
before I could kill him,

279
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,795
so lucky for him.

280
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:05,504
Then I lost contact
and her mother told me that

281
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,351
uh, they're living in New York
and he's doing

282
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,879
documentary films,

283
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:13,527
and I thought,
"How nice, how exciting. "

284
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,678
<i>Chuck had come to my office</i>

285
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,662
<i>and I needed a scene
for another film. </i>

286
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,224
He says, "Well,
Linda can do something. "

287
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:33,401
You know, she...
There was no name for it.

288
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,025
He says,
"She gives head very well. "

289
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,981
I said,
"Well, that's wonderful. "

290
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:40,470
So we set up with her
and an actor

291
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,940
to do a... a bit
for another film.

292
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:48,027
And when I saw
what she could do,

293
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,998
I says, "Stop the cameras. "

294
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,617
All I could think about was
what she was doing

295
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:07,768
was so unique

296
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,523
that I could build
a whole film around it.

297
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,693
Making a motion picture
specifically about that sexual act,

298
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,955
I... I found very daring
and very courageous.

299
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:25,403
<i>The first thing that came
to my mind was... was the title</i>

300
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:27,326
<i>of Deep, Deep Throat. </i>

301
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:30,936
Because something happened
deep down in... in her throat.

302
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:36,920
What? The clitoris
is in her throat?

303
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,781
Gerry, you can't do this.

304
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,459
You can't do this.
It's absurd, it's silly.

305
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,381
Nobody will believe it.

306
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,428
I thought it was,

307
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,802
You know,

308
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,830
absurd. I did.

309
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:02,836
Believe it or not, some people said,
"What is this, a medical film?

310
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,398
What are you gonna do?
With doctors?"

311
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,644
I said, "No. No. "

312
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:10,009
<i>Somebody said it should be
The Sword Swallower. </i>

313
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:13,111
<i>I said, "No, no. Deep Throat, believe
me, it'll work. It'll work. "</i>

314
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,097
And, uh,

315
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:19,547
<i>I'm glad I didn't
change it to The Sword Swallower. </i>

316
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:25,047
<i>I, kind of,
had the whole thing</i>

317
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,899
<i>in... in my head driving over
the 59th Street Bridge. </i>

318
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>That weekend,
I wrote the script</i>

319
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,024
<i>and we... we were ready
to do it. </i>

320
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:38,422
<i>And I spoke to
my production manager,</i>

321
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,638
<i>Ronnie Wertheim. </i>

322
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,701
The phone rang.
It was Gerry. All excited.

323
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:51,034
And I told him to bring
all our cast and crew

324
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:54,002
down to Florida.
We're going to make the film.

325
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,972
<i>I just called, uh,
Harry Reems. </i>

326
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,182
He came as
a production assistant.

327
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,293
He wasn't even supposed
to be in the film.

328
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,107
<i>When we got to Florida,
we all checked into</i>

329
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,994
<i>this, uh, motel, I think
it was called The Voyager. </i>

330
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,704
<i>As we pulled in,
we saw Linda Lovelace</i>

331
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:19,251
lying on the lawn with her...

332
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,267
You know what her
pussycat's name was?

333
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,988
Adolf Hitler.
He had a mustache like that.

334
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,553
We came from New York

335
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:36,376
with the promise of
having locations.

336
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,786
<i>To me, it was nothing. </i>

337
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:45,430
I thought nothing of it. I thought
it was just a... a piece of shit film.

338
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,921
Probably one of the worst
porno movies ever made.

339
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,660
He's nuts.
Lenny Camp was nuts.

340
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,600
He was one of the guys that
were lining up everything for us.

341
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,562
<i>And, uh, we got nothing. </i>

342
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:01,137
If it wasn't for us,

343
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,098
this guy would look like
a piece of shit,

344
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,373
which he really is.

345
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:08,400
The only thing that saved us,
I said, "Wait a minute,

346
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,256
"we're at The Voyager Motel,
let's go back and shoot

347
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,591
<i>what we were supposed to do
here in the pool. "</i>

348
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,145
From that moment on,
everybody was location hunting.

349
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:19,000
One of the locations that
we shot at down in Florida,

350
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,295
was at this, uh,
home in Coconut Grove

351
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:26,005
that was owned by a guy
who called himself a count.

352
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:28,212
He's not a count.
He's a horseshit count.

353
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,802
He is no count,
he's fucking Sepy Dobronyi.

354
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,394
And God knows
if that's his real name.

355
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,966
When we came,
they had this elaborate,

356
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,889
elaborate, elaborate
wine cellar.

357
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,836
Should we go
to the wine cellar?

358
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,018
Yes.

359
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
If it was planned, it would
not have been as exciting,

360
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,895
'cause we were just rushing
from one place to another.

361
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:25,940
You all right?

362
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:27,666
Yeah, I'm fine,
what makes you say that?

363
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,492
You,
the way you're acting.

364
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,502
<i>In the very beginning,
there were no</i>

365
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,647
<i>porno actors and actresses. </i>

366
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,719
So everybody
had to be taught.

367
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,646
The actors are all shit.

368
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:40,817
Not... not taught
in the sense of taught.

369
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,644
Taught how to be natural.

370
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,016
Sex,

371
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,089
it makes me feel sort of
tingly all over.

372
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,142
And then...

373
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,230
And then what?

374
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:50,318
Nothing.

375
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:53,425
I mean, there should be more to
sex than a lot of little tingles.

376
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,218
There should be
bells ringing,

377
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:57,840
dams bursting,
bombs going off, something.

378
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,181
Do you want to get off or
do you want to wreck a city?

379
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:01,938
Helen, please, be serious.

380
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,796
Gerry knew nothing about it.

381
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:07,670
He knew nothing about acting,
he knew nothing about, um...

382
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,030
He knew nothing.
He knew nothing.

383
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,332
But as a swinger himself,

384
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,766
he had a feel
for how to get people

385
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:16,944
in a sexual mood.

386
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:28,048
The really important thing
was Harry Reems.

387
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,965
<i>I couldn't find
anybody in Florida</i>

388
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,486
<i>that could even come close
to doing the role. </i>

389
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,461
So at one point,
I fired him off the crew,

390
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:40,303
And hired him as the lead,
and thank God he was there,

391
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:42,773
because I... I don't know
of anybody

392
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,834
that could have even
come close to doing

393
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,568
the job that he did,

394
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,364
as... as the wacky doctor.

395
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,990
I want to hear bells.

396
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,175
Bells?

397
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,423
Bombs.
Bombs?

398
00:22:53,494 --> 00:22:54,923
And dams bursting.

399
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,208
The rockets' red glare.

400
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,344
No, he's not an actor,
he knows that.

401
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,018
Bombs bursting
in air.

402
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,235
He... he would get an erection

403
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:12,530
at the sound
of the camera motor.

404
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:16,212
That explains a lot.

405
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:21,012
You know, I... I, uh,
I never had a problem

406
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,725
um, getting an erection.

407
00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:31,594
<i>Linda had the hots
for Harry Reems. </i>

408
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:34,035
<i>And the morning
we were gonna do</i>

409
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,304
<i>the deep throat scene,</i>

410
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:39,054
<i>she came to me
and she was very upset,</i>

411
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,170
and she says,

412
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:43,179
"Chuck is... is... is so jealous
of Harry Reems

413
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,777
<i>that I don't think
I can do a good job. "</i>

414
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:48,178
<i>Chuck was a member
of our crew. </i>

415
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,481
Production manager
sent him to...

416
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:53,069
Uh, we said
we're running out of film.

417
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,340
<i>So he went to Miami
to buy film</i>

418
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,939
<i>when we shot the scene,</i>

419
00:23:57,012 --> 00:24:00,906
Linda was completely relaxed,
and she did a marvelous job.

420
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:24,523
Uh, when I saw her do that,
yes, it is kind of amazing.

421
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,405
Kind of amazing.
It really is.

422
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,731
Surprised?
I was flabbergasted.

423
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,047
I had no idea.

424
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:40,936
<i>This was the moment
that heterosexual film</i>

425
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,280
<i>became interested in blowjobs. </i>

426
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:45,713
<i>I mean, it's not that
fellatio didn't exist. </i>

427
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,648
Certainly, you see
fellatio in stag films.

428
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,974
Um, but you don't
get this fellatio

429
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,765
as figured as

430
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,104
the be-all and end-all,

431
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,080
as the absolute pleasure.

432
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:00,910
<i>The thing that
you have to remember</i>

433
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,832
<i>about fellatio is,</i>

434
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,679
<i>historically, it had
been considered illegal</i>

435
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,201
<i>and referred to
as the abominable,</i>

436
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,281
detestable crimes
against nature.

437
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:12,459
Deep throat was not a term

438
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,846
that my girlfriends and I
really knew anything about.

439
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:19,151
Most of us had never even heard
of oral sex or how to perform it.

440
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,679
And people
who wouldn't have dreamed

441
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,891
of going near
that sort of matter

442
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:25,165
in the '40s and '50s,
and certainly in the '30s,

443
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,689
because that was dirty, that
was low sex, that was dreadful,

444
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,998
began to see it
as an enrichment.

445
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,335
And I'll just mention
that ejaculate,

446
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,833
I've always known,
was good for the complexion.

447
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:38,062
It's full of babies,
its... it's full of protein,

448
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,463
it's full of, uh, plasma.

449
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,399
And to rub it all over your
face and neck and chest,

450
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:45,447
a lot of women know that
that's a good thing to do,

451
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:47,431
not for him but for you.

452
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,100
<i>Gerry returned to New York
to edit his film. </i>

453
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,024
<i>But there was still
one thing he needed. </i>

454
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:58,666
<i>A mind-blowing
cinematic female orgasm:</i>

455
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,294
<i>Proof of the success
of Linda's quest</i>

456
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,018
<i>for sexual satisfaction. </i>

457
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,410
People didn't
understand that women,

458
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,975
uh, could have as much...

459
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,622
feel as much pleasure
as men did.

460
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,151
Somehow, nobody ever
acknowledged

461
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,394
there was such a thing
as an orgasm for a woman.

462
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,351
That was all male stuff.

463
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:27,879
<i>It is harder to show
female pleasure. </i>

464
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,959
It's harder to show
female pleasure,

465
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:32,901
and to believe
that it's actually happening.

466
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,563
That's why I wanted
to show it.

467
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,341
<i>I went to the film archives</i>

468
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,552
<i>in... in Washington</i>

469
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:43,044
<i>and got footage of a rocket</i>

470
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,470
and then did subliminal
cutting with... with the rocket

471
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:48,365
and... and Linda,
back and forth.

472
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:54,159
<i>This is a male fantasy
that says:</i>

473
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,430
"I like to have
my cock sucked.

474
00:26:56,495 --> 00:27:00,292
I really get off on it,
therefore she must, too. "

475
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,501
I think that was
a hell of a shot.

476
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:14,187
Look, men want to believe

477
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:16,262
that the clitoris
is in a woman's throat.

478
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,051
Because if they believe that the
clitoris is in a woman's throat,

479
00:27:19,118 --> 00:27:21,093
then they can believe
that by thrusting

480
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,021
their penis
into a woman's mouth,

481
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:25,540
she gets as much pleasure
as they do.

482
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:28,013
Guess what? It's not true.

483
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,429
Uh, you know,
I... I guess, uh,

484
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:35,974
<i>Deep Throat opened up
a... a, uh, a can of worms.</i>

485
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,277
<i>When hardcore pornography
is permitted</i>

486
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:47,844
<i>to corrupt the minds
of children,</i>

487
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,700
<i>then the time has come
for new moral leadership</i>

488
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,424
<i>to make itself felt
in America. </i>

489
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,443
<i>Before
Deep Throat was even shot,</i>

490
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,804
<i>politics and pornography
were on a collision course. </i>

491
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:06,051
<i>In 1968, the government
launched a scientific commission</i>

492
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,769
<i>to determine if pornography
really was harmful. </i>

493
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,546
<i>Well, today, the final results
were published. </i>

494
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,652
<i>The presidential commission
recommended doing away</i>

495
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:25,830
<i>with most of the laws
that cover pornography,</i>

496
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,202
<i>because they don't
seem to be doing much good,</i>

497
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,813
<i>and because pornography doesn't seem
to do much harm to the adult mind. </i>

498
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:36,268
<i>For one brief shining moment,
it did look like</i>

499
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,309
society was going to become

500
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:41,447
a little more adult
about their sexuality.

501
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,900
<i>But committee member
Charles Keating,</i>

502
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:46,533
<i>appointed by President Nixon,</i>

503
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,230
<i>fought to dismiss
the findings. </i>

504
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,886
<i>Obscenity does indeed effect. </i>

505
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,923
<i>The effect it has
is detrimental to society. </i>

506
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:57,732
Charles Keating was
a notorious censorship bug.

507
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,454
Later on, of course, we
discovered he was a good deal more.

508
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:03,851
He was a swindler
and went to prison.

509
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:07,014
<i>The president said today, "So
long as I am in the White House,</i>

510
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,188
<i>"there will be no relaxation
of the national effort</i>

511
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,398
<i>to control
and eliminate smut. "</i>

512
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,418
<i>Then Nixon persuaded
the Senate</i>

513
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:16,549
<i>to reject the report,
suppressing its findings. </i>

514
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,433
Everybody forgot about

515
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,354
the President's commission
on pornography,

516
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,045
because they... they
didn't come out

517
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:25,254
with the answer
they were looking for.

518
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:28,552
Instead, Nixon got reelected,

519
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,139
after being declared
politically dead,

520
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:33,609
and the forces of repression
came in,

521
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:36,641
in a huge, huge way.

522
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,258
<i>He knew all the buttons
to press. </i>

523
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,257
Sodomy...

524
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:47,810
I mean, everybody starts
to vibrate like a gong.

525
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:55,844
We lie about human sexuality, because
we're taught to lie about everything.

526
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,078
<i>When you have a nation
that totally lies,</i>

527
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:00,898
then you have
no reality.

528
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:05,768
<i>The message was clear:</i>

529
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,557
<i>Cleaning up porn
was good politics. </i>

530
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,309
<i>And what better place to start
than Times Square,</i>

531
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:12,265
<i>the nation's capital of sleaze</i>

532
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,303
<i>and the site
of Deep Throat's premiere</i>

533
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:16,898
<i>in June 1972.</i>

534
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:27,201
<i>A good many
of the so-called perverts</i>

535
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,768
<i>are attracted to 42nd Street</i>

536
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,249
and we've had complaints.

537
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,278
<i>Suddenly, I see a movie
that knocks my socks off. </i>

538
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,694
And here's
the wonderful thing:

539
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:45,379
<i>This film, Deep Throat,
is funny.</i>

540
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:49,539
And Linda's a wonderful,
wonderful cocksucker.

541
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,518
God, I wish my wives
could suck dick like that.

542
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:55,749
<i>And I give it 100 points
on the Peter-Meter. </i>

543
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:58,401
<i>"Peter" means
how many hard-ons do I get. </i>

544
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,090
Now it would take
5,000 Viagra

545
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,208
to get me hard,

546
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,022
but then I'm virile and young
and I get many hard-ons.

547
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:09,725
<i>New Yorkers greet it with the
same enthusiasm as I did. </i>

548
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:11,685
It was a joy.

549
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,370
As we say in Israel,
it was a mitzvah.

550
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,943
<i>I have the privilege
of announcing</i>

551
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:22,015
<i>the formation of the Times
Square Development Council. </i>

552
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,925
<i>Deep Throat
was the perfect target</i>

553
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,421
<i>for New York's campaign
to clean up porn</i>

554
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,383
<i>and the police moved in. </i>

555
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,053
<i>I first became aware
of Deep Throat</i>

556
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,461
when it was, uh, it was
advertised in the papers.

557
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,550
It was the talk of the office,
you know, "Look at this. "

558
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,066
<i>Being in the industry,
so to speak,</i>

559
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,542
<i>we all ran out to see it. </i>

560
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,413
It was stunning.

561
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:57,212
<i>The cinematography, for a
porno movie, was very good. </i>

562
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,302
The movie was funny.

563
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,342
It had the kind of lines
in it, uh, that were amusing.

564
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:04,962
Mind if I smoke
while you're eating?

565
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,525
No, not at all.

566
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,517
It was definitely
a change of pace,

567
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,011
definitely
a change of pace.

568
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,078
We knew that this was, uh,
this was something different.

569
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:27,077
<i>I think they picked
on Deep Throat</i>

570
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:29,476
<i>because it was
the highest profile. </i>

571
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,705
<i>If they could, uh, successfully
prosecute Deep Throat,</i>

572
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:34,595
uh, then they felt that

573
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,418
the other prosecutions
would be easier.

574
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,468
<i>Not once, not twice,
but three times</i>

575
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:44,126
<i>the police raided Deep Throat,</i>

576
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,881
<i>staging their final raid
for the cameras. </i>

577
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:51,548
<i>This was political. </i>

578
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,620
<i>If nobody records the arrest,</i>

579
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,701
<i>then nobody will know</i>

580
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:59,806
that they are doing their job
in fighting sin.

581
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:03,329
Do you... you consider what
you're running pornographic, sir?

582
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:04,964
If it was pornographic,

583
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:07,549
they could prosecute
in a diligent, proper manner.

584
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:10,555
They wouldn't have to
come around in hoards of 50

585
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,794
and take signs
out of windows

586
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,513
and act like
the Gestapo of old.

587
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:21,091
This theater that had not done
$5,000 a week in 20 years,

588
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,755
was running
virtually 20 hours a day.

589
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:27,843
<i>It never stopped running. </i>

590
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,202
The owners really couldn't
afford to shut it down.

591
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,585
They didn't want
to shut it down.

592
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:34,718
And so, uh, there... there was
going to be a trial.

593
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,254
<i>Deep Throat's defense
produced expert witnesses</i>

594
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:48,120
<i>to argue that the film was more
enlightening than merely obscene. </i>

595
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,299
<i>But the prosecution countered</i>

596
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,405
<i>that this sexual satisfaction
was dangerous to women</i>

597
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,923
<i>because Deep Throat emphasized
the wrong kind of orgasm:</i>

598
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,134
<i>The clitoral orgasm. </i>

599
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,914
<i>I remember that the judge
hadn't heard the term. </i>

600
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,439
And, uh,
so he expressed surprise

601
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:19,197
and asked the question,
"What's that?"

602
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:25,690
<i>Here, just outside and above
the vaginal opening</i>

603
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,606
<i>Is the clitoris. </i>

604
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,143
<i>The clitoris. </i>

605
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,543
He should have been
sitting in my classes

606
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,643
because he would have
heard me say loud and clear

607
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:54,426
that let's get away
from that idea,

608
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,253
which still
some people have,

609
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:59,169
that, uh,
a vaginal orgasm

610
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,015
is, um, more satisfying
for a woman

611
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:04,186
than a clitoral orgasm.
No such thing.

612
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,219
<i>At that time, a real orgasm
could only happen</i>

613
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,598
<i>if you were with a man</i>

614
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:11,902
<i>and his penis
was inside of you</i>

615
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,712
and that was total,
utter nonsense, of course.

616
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:20,440
Sex is not only for penises.

617
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:23,383
Uh, sex is something
for women.

618
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,082
<i>The clitoris. </i>

619
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:26,778
<i>This tiny organ,</i>

620
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,368
<i>about the size and shape
of a garden pea,</i>

621
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,443
<i>is the seat
of sexuality in women. </i>

622
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:36,798
I think the judge
learned a lot during the trial

623
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:40,032
as I... Look,
I... I certainly did myself.

624
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,697
<i>As the judge retired
to consider his verdict,</i>

625
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,590
<i>ticket sales almost doubled,</i>

626
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:50,039
<i>prompting a young reporter from
the New York Times to write an article</i>

627
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:53,080
<i>that would give the film
mainstream legitimacy. </i>

628
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,543
<i>I remember
writing the article. </i>

629
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:57,655
<i>Uh, the... the headline
was "Porno chic. "</i>

630
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,669
I wrote it on a typewriter.

631
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,864
<i>People look
at the Times as a validator. </i>

632
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:06,685
<i>And they see, if... if the Times
can write about Deep Throat,</i>

633
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,409
well, then it must be safe
in some way.

634
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:12,981
<i>The week the article
hit the stands,</i>

635
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:14,965
<i>the film's box office soared</i>

636
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,334
<i>as people rushed to see the
film in record numbers. </i>

637
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,774
<i>Approximately how many people
have seen Deep Throat?</i>

638
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,806
Approximately 1,700 people a
day have been in to see the film.

639
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:30,686
Are you looking
forward to this movie?

640
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:31,798
Yes, I am.

641
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:34,869
People from Central Park West
and Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue

642
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,277
wanted to go down and see it
and go slumming.

643
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:41,498
<i>There was a private showing.
Before I knew what happened,</i>

644
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,414
there was, like, group sex
happening, left, right, and center.

645
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:52,600
<i>Since this is supposed to be
it of its genre,</i>

646
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,256
<i>and since it's had this piece
in the New York Times,</i>

647
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:57,367
I might as well see it
if it's going.

648
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:00,762
What are you expecting to see?

649
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:01,910
Well, uh,

650
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:05,113
you might close me down if I
said what I was going to say.

651
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:10,195
It took porn out of the realm
of the forbidden.

652
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,157
Why, there's nothing wrong
with a normal man

653
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,912
going to
a pornographic movie.

654
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,121
Normal, all right,
but why were you there?

655
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,751
You would see
movie stars there.

656
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,349
<i>You would see
society people there. </i>

657
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,985
<i>I went to see Deep Throat because
I'm fond of animal pictures.</i>

658
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:28,696
I thought it was
about giraffes.

659
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,617
90 percent of the people
there are asthmatics.

660
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,059
What do you mean,
asthmatics?

661
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,270
'Cause all I could hear
was...

662
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,828
People weren't jerking off

663
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:44,632
when, you know, I don't know
who's sitting next to Angela Lansbury.

664
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,643
Oh, I'm just picking her out,
but... but basically,

665
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:48,572
because she'd just
put a damper on things.

666
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:50,677
What did you say the name of
that movie was?

667
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:51,926
<i>Uh, Deep Threat. </i>

668
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:54,298
You'd better hurry up
before you miss the opening

669
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:56,023
'cause you don't
wanna miss the opening.

670
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,587
In the opening, Linda...

671
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,373
<i>Deep Throat was so successful</i>

672
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:06,483
<i>that it turned Linda Lovelace
from an unknown</i>

673
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:10,003
<i>into a celebrity and
poster-child for the new porn chic. </i>

674
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,217
<i>I made $1,200
for Deep Throat. </i>

675
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:17,780
And that's all?

676
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:19,194
Yeah.

677
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,275
What about...

678
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:23,697
I'm, you know, now I'm known,
so it's okay.

679
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:29,147
<i>It was about 11:00 at night</i>

680
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:31,482
<i>and we were
watching television. </i>

681
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:35,632
And we saw this
theater and it said,

682
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,447
<i>you know, Linda Lovelace, Deep
Throat or whatever it was.</i>

683
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:43,186
And, uh, I said,
"Oh, disgusting.

684
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:45,976
Absolutely disgusting. "

685
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:47,861
<i>A girlfriend of mine
called and said,</i>

686
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:49,873
<i>"Pick up Playboy Magazine.</i>

687
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:52,762
If that's not Linda,
I'll eat the magazine. "

688
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:55,579
So I stopped, I picked it up,

689
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:57,270
'cause it wasn't allowed
in my house.

690
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:03,475
<i>And I opened it up
and I read it</i>

691
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:05,369
and I said, "Oh, my God. "

692
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:12,821
And I knew then, it was...
it was our Linda.

693
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:21,593
That was difficult for me,
to see the movie.

694
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:28,630
When we got home, I threw myself
across the bed and started bawling.

695
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,520
I was crying like, I'd, um,

696
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:33,106
like I just found out
someone I loved had died.

697
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,159
<i>And, uh,</i>

698
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:41,012
and it wasn't, um...

699
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,048
It wasn't just, uh, you know,

700
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:48,757
a sleazy little film on a...
on a small screen

701
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:51,346
with a bunch of guys
in trench coats there.

702
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:55,312
I mean, there were,
society was there.

703
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,758
I didn't know how Linda was
going to be able to deal with that.

704
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:06,968
<i>The next time I spoke to her,
she said, "I'm sorry,</i>

705
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:09,522
"I didn't want you to know,

706
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,797
'cause I knew you'd be upset
or you'd be angry. "

707
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,345
I said, "I'm not angry 'cause
I don't know who Linda Lovelace is.

708
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,108
I only know who you are. "

709
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:26,992
The pornographic film
Deep Throat

710
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:28,690
has become
one of the most popular

711
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,030
and profitable blue movies
of all time.

712
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,260
Today, a Manhattan criminal court
judge ruled the film obscene,

713
00:40:34,328 --> 00:40:36,947
and ordered it removed from
theaters in New York City.

714
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:46,895
<i>A Sodom and Gomorrah
gone wild before the fire. </i>

715
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,350
<i>He believed he was writing
for posterity. </i>

716
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:54,230
<i>Now you and I know,
in retrospect,</i>

717
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,724
that he accomplished
absolutely nothing.

718
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,495
<i>I readily perform
the operation</i>

719
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:07,284
<i>by finding the defendant
guilty as charged. </i>

720
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,480
I still think what the World
Theatre did on its marquee

721
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:17,714
was better than what he wrote
in his opinion.

722
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:19,887
<i>"Throat cut, world mourns. "</i>

723
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:22,261
<i>It's a picture
that'll never die. </i>

724
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,184
<i>I mean, we'll all die,
but Deep Throat won't die.</i>

725
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,494
<i>Shutting Deep Throat
down in New York</i>

726
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,349
<i>only spurred audiences'
interest across the country. </i>

727
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:38,859
<i>Wherever it opened, authorities
scrambled to shut it down. </i>

728
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>This trash that's being shown
on our movie screens</i>

729
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,151
<i>across the country. </i>

730
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:46,005
There isn't any question
in my mind that it's obscene.

731
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:51,125
<i>By the mid '70s,
Deep Throat had been tried</i>

732
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:52,598
<i>in more than 32 cities... </i>

733
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:57,301
<i>... and was ultimately banned
in 23 states. </i>

734
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,668
Violation of the law.
It's a simple thing.

735
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:03,828
It's obscene as hell to me.

736
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:10,570
Hmm.

737
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:14,288
<i>Ordered to stop the spread
of Deep Throat,</i>

738
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,048
<i>the FBI stepped in. </i>

739
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,996
<i>They began with the arrest
of Gerry Damiano. </i>

740
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:23,058
The first question
the prosecutor asked me:

741
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,500
Did I know what...

742
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:27,119
what affiliation
m- my partners had?

743
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:31,955
<i>And I said as far as I know,
he's a Roman Catholic. </i>

744
00:42:36,437 --> 00:42:38,771
<i>All of a sudden,
I'm... I'm part of the mob. </i>

745
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:43,210
No. I was...
I was never a mob.

746
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:46,355
<i>There were originally
three partners</i>

747
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:48,079
<i>who made the movie. </i>

748
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:52,271
<i>His two partners came to him,
Damiano told me,</i>

749
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,160
and told him
they were buying him out.

750
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:58,024
And I said to him that didn't
sound like a very good, uh, deal,

751
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,139
uh, when you're a
one-third partner of a project

752
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,961
that is just, you know,
bringing in bucket-loads of money

753
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:04,718
and you're suddenly
cut out of the deal.

754
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,064
Uh, why didn't he object?

755
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:08,587
And he rolled his eyes
and he wouldn't say anymore.

756
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:11,823
And the... the only thing he told me was
he didn't want his legs broken.

757
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:15,466
No, it was easier for me
to... to say:

758
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:20,269
"I... I don't, I don't
want to have anything to do with it. "

759
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,675
It was easier.
It was a lot easier.

760
00:43:23,764 --> 00:43:26,448
It was, kind of a...
it was, kind of a...

761
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,403
a thing I could not
have won.

762
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,537
That's about as far as
I could go with it.

763
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,529
<i>Damiano wasn't alone. </i>

764
00:43:39,603 --> 00:43:42,058
<i>Across the country,
theater owners discovered</i>

765
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:43,724
<i>exhibiting Deep Throat
also meant</i>

766
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,453
<i>running with the mob. </i>

767
00:43:48,147 --> 00:43:50,700
<i>One day,
I pick up the New York Times,</i>

768
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:54,290
and in it,
it says it is very chic

769
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:56,711
<i>to see Deep Throat.</i>

770
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,859
So that gave me an idea

771
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:02,606
to see if I can get
the picture for Florida.

772
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:05,265
<i>Luckily,
I knew one of the men</i>

773
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,436
<i>that was connected
with the picture. </i>

774
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:09,777
<i>And I didn't think
it could run in Florida. </i>

775
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:13,454
And so, I was given the picture
for a very reasonable amount.

776
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:18,288
I never would have dreamt of
opening that picture anywheres

777
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:20,715
if it wasn't for that article.

778
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:23,152
If we don't
get sued, it will be a miracle.

779
00:44:23,218 --> 00:44:25,073
Terry, please, Terry.
It's almost over.

780
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:26,567
I think it's enough.
Cut. Finished.

781
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:27,852
It's almost over.
It's enough.

782
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:29,033
It's almost over.

783
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:30,632
I... I think
it's enough already.

784
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:33,224
You don't realize
how people pick up on things.

785
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:34,823
What are they
picking up on, Terry?

786
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,783
They're picking up on things
in Miami Beach.

787
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,921
You... you just said
they do bad things.

788
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:40,422
They could
call you up on this.

789
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:42,123
Come on, Artie,
don't be stupid.

790
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,503
You're a grown man.

791
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:44,649
Cut.

792
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:45,867
Terry.

793
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:02,700
<i>My name is Bill Kelly. </i>

794
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,726
The reason there were
so many more

795
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,209
obscenity cases

796
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,346
after 1972

797
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:13,199
<i>was because I went out
and looked for 'em. </i>

798
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:15,790
I knew it was a gamble

799
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:20,203
because of New York
having problems with the city,

800
00:45:20,273 --> 00:45:21,549
that it was on trial.

801
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,869
<i>I opened the picture
and the next thing I knew</i>

802
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:26,373
<i>we had lines
around the corner. </i>

803
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:27,756
There must have been,

804
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:31,304
I'm guessing 100 or 150 people
in line when they opened.

805
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:35,342
Every fucking FBI agent in the
country was sitting in the audience.

806
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:37,829
Kelly was there
and everything else.

807
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,428
<i>You walked into the theater. </i>

808
00:45:40,496 --> 00:45:42,252
There's just a,
sort of a bent-nosed,

809
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,906
middle-aged guy
with a very rough voice.

810
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,405
<i>He says, "$5."</i>

811
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:49,260
So I gave him $5 and said:
"Where is the ticket?"

812
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,018
He said,
"No tickets, just go on in. "

813
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,809
The movie started

814
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:56,420
and about 50 of them
got up and said:

815
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:58,764
"It's a sex picture,
get me out! Get me out!

816
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,686
It's a sex picture,
I can't stand it. "

817
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:02,853
<i>Not only was it a violation</i>

818
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:04,901
<i>of the obscenity law
of the United States,</i>

819
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,941
<i>it was also a highly
organized crime enterprise. </i>

820
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:11,755
<i>I didn't know</i>

821
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:14,343
<i>who the Peraino gang was
at that time. </i>

822
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,836
<i>But I soon found out
when I started investigating</i>

823
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,627
<i>that they were heavyweights
out of New York. </i>

824
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,150
<i>They were part of
the Colombo family operation</i>

825
00:46:22,223 --> 00:46:24,808
<i>who had moved
to Fort Lauderdale area. </i>

826
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:30,246
I haven't seen them
since I... I left.

827
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:38,123
And I want to make sure
I... I don't get a phone call

828
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:40,809
or get a knock on the door
that they want to talk to me.

829
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:43,749
Because I've been
away from them for 30 years.

830
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:46,893
And I... I... I'd like it
to be that way.

831
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:49,772
This is... this is shit
as far as I'm concerned.

832
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:52,456
Excuse my language
but I can't stand it.

833
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:55,308
He can tell you things, your
hair would stand up on your heads.

834
00:46:55,374 --> 00:46:57,545
I didn't mention
any of those things, Terry.

835
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,174
What?
I didn't mention any of them.

836
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:00,456
I don't... I don't
want you to.

837
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,671
I didn't.

838
00:47:01,742 --> 00:47:03,531
We haven't heard
in 32 years.

839
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:04,907
Thank God.

840
00:47:04,974 --> 00:47:05,989
So, how do you know?

841
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:08,296
I don't know
if they're living.

842
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:11,299
They could be dead,
Terry.

843
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:16,808
<i>In its second year of release,</i>

844
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,659
<i>Deep Throat was still
number 11 on the charts. </i>

845
00:47:19,725 --> 00:47:21,384
<i>It's a dirty movie. </i>

846
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,161
<i>Look, try to look at it as a
satire of contemporary sexual mores</i>

847
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:27,117
<i>with lots of
redeeming social values. </i>

848
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:30,954
<i>Porn chic was all the rage. </i>

849
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,508
<i>Films like Damiano's
The Devil in Miss Jones</i>

850
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,987
<i>and Behind the Green Door</i>

851
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,729
<i>followed on the heels of Deep
Throat's unprecedented success,</i>

852
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,988
<i>giving Hollywood films
a run for their money. </i>

853
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,386
<i>The studios were in shambles
in the early '70s. </i>

854
00:47:45,452 --> 00:47:47,688
There's this movie out there,
everyone's going to see it.

855
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:50,625
How does that affect you and the
pictures you should be making?

856
00:47:51,211 --> 00:47:53,633
<i>I've been the first one
to go down the path. </i>

857
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,944
<i>I'd like to see, uh,
legitimate films</i>

858
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:59,524
<i>and so-called pornographic
films merge together. </i>

859
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,116
<i>I think the two industries
have got to merge together. </i>

860
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:03,745
<i>Thank you for making me</i>

861
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,438
<i>the first woman president
to go down in history. </i>

862
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,599
<i>They were shooting porn films
on the lot at Paramount. </i>

863
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,944
This is a little known fact.

864
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:15,524
So Paramount became sort of
confiscated by the porn industry.

865
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:17,416
<i>Do you see yourself
as a pioneer?</i>

866
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:18,465
<i>No. </i>

867
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:20,459
<i>If it's left alone,
within a year,</i>

868
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,695
<i>sex will just blend itself
into film. </i>

869
00:48:22,764 --> 00:48:23,746
It's inevitable.

870
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,983
The only thing that's uncertain
is... is the time it will take.

871
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:30,473
<i>But the merger of hardcore
and movies never happened. </i>

872
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:34,085
<i>Instead, the Supreme Court,
packed with 4 Nixon appointees,</i>

873
00:48:34,156 --> 00:48:36,676
<i>made a radical change
to the obscenity law</i>

874
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,852
<i>in June 1973.</i>

875
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:43,850
Yesterday, the Supreme Court
authorized wider restrictions

876
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:45,954
on the exhibition
and sale of obscenity.

877
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:49,216
<i>The recent Supreme Court
decision</i>

878
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:52,737
<i>gave local officials the right to decide
for themselves what is pornographic</i>

879
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,974
<i>without having to be guided
by a national standard. </i>

880
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:00,800
<i>Here in New York City today,</i>

881
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,842
vice squad police began
cracking down on pornography.

882
00:49:09,258 --> 00:49:12,040
<i>Linda, as you may know,
the Supreme Court recently,</i>

883
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:15,105
uh, handed down a, uh,
decision on pornography.

884
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:18,470
I don't think anybody
should regulate anything.

885
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,585
I think it should be, uh,

886
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:22,985
I don't believe in censorship. I
don't believe in anything that they are doing.

887
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,937
But how far can you extend
individual rights

888
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:27,619
before you hit, uh,
the state of anarchy?

889
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:29,412
Uh, I really... I don't know.

890
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,909
Have you ever
thought about that?

891
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:33,506
No. I don't know what's
the state of ana-anarchy.

892
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:36,708
Well, it's... That's when
everyone does precisely what he pleases

893
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,948
and, uh,
society has no rules.

894
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,570
At that point,
you've reached anarchy.

895
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:43,776
Uh, I don't know about
that, to be honest with you.

896
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,256
I just don't believe
in censorship.

897
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:47,077
I don't... That's
taking away your freedom.

898
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:48,835
That's taking away
your individual right

899
00:49:48,937 --> 00:49:50,398
to make up your own mind
for things.

900
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:53,090
The last person that started
censorship was Adolf Hitler.

901
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:54,852
And look
what happened there.

902
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:00,223
<i>Meanwhile,
the FBI was closing in</i>

903
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,338
<i>on Deep Throat
and its distribution. </i>

904
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:06,118
<i>They pinpointed the Perainos'
headquarters in Fort Lauderdale</i>

905
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:08,191
<i>and placed them
under surveillance. </i>

906
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:15,199
<i>One day,
I get a telephone call</i>

907
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:17,028
<i>from a confidential source</i>

908
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,225
who will remain anonymous.

909
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:23,681
<i>And he says to me, uh:</i>

910
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:27,679
<i>"We've got so much cash
that we are having trouble</i>

911
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,428
<i>"physically moving about
the office</i>

912
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,349
<i>because the money

913
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:35,748
I said, "How much you got?"
He said, "I don't know.

914
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:37,955
We don't even
count it anymore. "

915
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,870
I said, "You don't count it?"
He said, "No. "

916
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:43,107
I said, "What do you do?"
He said, "We weigh it. "

917
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,246
<i>To get around the law</i>

918
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:48,416
<i>the mob set up
its own distribution system</i>

919
00:50:48,487 --> 00:50:49,916
<i>of checkers and sweepers</i>

920
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,162
<i>who traveled the country
delivering prints</i>

921
00:50:52,263 --> 00:50:54,238
<i>and collecting the money
from theaters. </i>

922
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,823
At a certain time every day,
the checker or the sweeper

923
00:50:57,895 --> 00:51:01,027
would go to the manager
of the particular theater,

924
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:04,930
<i>and he would say,
"Our take is 50 percent. </i>

925
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:07,518
<i>"And we want it now, in cash. </i>

926
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:10,244
Give us the money now,
or else. "

927
00:51:12,262 --> 00:51:14,269
<i>I was on my way
down to Nashville. </i>

928
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:15,749
And the reason
I went to Nashville

929
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:17,822
was I wanted to buy
these Goo Goo candy bars.

930
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:22,145
<i>I was gonna buy
a bunch of them</i>

931
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,457
<i>and just, you know,
market them</i>

932
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:24,803
<i>and see if
I could get it going. </i>

933
00:51:24,902 --> 00:51:26,844
<i>Well, on Saturday night,
I decided I'd just go out. </i>

934
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,838
<i>And I met a couple of guys
from New Jersey. </i>

935
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:30,331
They were a couple of
Italian guys.

936
00:51:30,438 --> 00:51:31,386
I happen to be a Greek,

937
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:33,186
so Italians and Greeks
are like cousins.

938
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,692
They wanted me
to go to work for 'em

939
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:41,574
<i>uh, baby-sitting
Deep Throat. </i>

940
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,018
<i>And they sent me over to
the Lamar Theater in Memphis. </i>

941
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:47,682
<i>And that's where it all began. </i>

942
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,997
<i>And as people walked in,
I would count 'em in. </i>

943
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:54,107
<i>Then I would go down
through the theater crowd</i>

944
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:57,313
<i>and I would count the number of people
in the theater with a little clicker. </i>

945
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,236
<i>You know,
those little things. </i>

946
00:52:01,477 --> 00:52:04,160
A checker. That's what I was.

947
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:07,707
<i>I... I was just a
simple checker. I had no power</i>

948
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:09,984
I had no rank, nothing.
I was just an employee.

949
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:13,502
Nobody was hurt.

950
00:52:13,573 --> 00:52:15,678
And, uh,
the only ones that got hurt

951
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:19,132
was, uh, one of our checkers
in New Orleans.

952
00:52:19,205 --> 00:52:21,692
Uh, he had $60,000
and he disappeared.

953
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,928
The money disappeared and they found
his body in the back of a pickup truck.

954
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:29,891
<i>A theater manager
refused to pay. </i>

955
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:34,909
<i>And the next thing I know, I
heard the theater burned down. </i>

956
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:37,694
<i>I'm not saying
they would do somethin'.</i>

957
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:40,481
But I did have a Colt. 45
with the hammer back

958
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:41,530
in my belt.

959
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:45,854
<i>They had people
that... that would do things. </i>

960
00:52:46,691 --> 00:52:49,658
Was it any kind of, uh,
an organized crime?

961
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:51,583
Well,
is every Italian

962
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,498
A criminal?

963
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:56,124
Is every Italian a gangster?
I don't think so.

964
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:58,945
You know, some Italians have
actually opened up Italian restaurants

965
00:52:59,044 --> 00:53:01,662
And done very well with them.

966
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:05,820
<i>I've met
some mafia men in my life. </i>

967
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,801
They won't threaten you
in any way.

968
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:10,209
But if you do
something dishonest,

969
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:11,997
most of the times,

970
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:14,489
they don't give you
a second chance.

971
00:53:17,284 --> 00:53:19,521
So why did you
walk away from it yourself?

972
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:21,659
Because I was told to.

973
00:53:23,043 --> 00:53:25,661
Rather, my wife was told
that I should

974
00:53:26,723 --> 00:53:27,803
leave.

975
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,410
And no money in the world
is worth

976
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:35,679
just worrying about something.

977
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:40,510
That's my wife.

978
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:41,691
Artie, again?

979
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:42,777
Now, Terry.

980
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,898
Are you enjoying this?

981
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:47,930
Damn it.
You're some kind of nut.

982
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:51,933
Okay. They're
finished, Terry, all right?

983
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:02,841
<i>Finally, after three years
of FBI investigation,</i>

984
00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:07,201
<i>the government launched one of the most
ambitious obscenity trials ever mounted. </i>

985
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:10,461
<i>Designed to nail Deep Throat
and all pornographic films</i>

986
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,937
<i>once and for all. </i>

987
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,534
<i>I think this case was
a case of prosecution</i>

988
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:20,510
<i>that was directed,
orchestrated,</i>

989
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,748
uh, from Washington, D.C.

990
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:29,016
<i>All told, 117 people
were charged with conspiracy:</i>

991
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:31,929
<i>From the distributor
to the projectionist. </i>

992
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,430
<i>And one man,</i>

993
00:54:33,505 --> 00:54:36,439
<i>the government intended to
make an example of. </i>

994
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:39,293
<i>The director had immunity. </i>

995
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,954
<i>The star had immunity,</i>

996
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,813
<i>but the actor did not. </i>

997
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:51,577
The theory was,
if you prosecuted the star

998
00:54:51,649 --> 00:54:54,235
then nobody would ever
wanna make a film like this.

999
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:56,575
And you could drive
the industry out of business.

1000
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,564
<i>Harry Reems was paid $250
to appear in Deep Throat. </i>

1001
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:03,675
He had no control,

1002
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,139
no say, no input

1003
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,950
with what the final version
of this film was gonna be

1004
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:12,472
or whether it was gonna be
distributed interstate,

1005
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,682
intrastate, intergalactic.

1006
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:16,094
<i>It's impressive,
for the first time</i>

1007
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,534
<i>in the history
of the United States</i>

1008
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,835
<i>an artist has ever been brought

1009
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:23,414
<i>All of the trials
have been prosecuted</i>

1010
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,041
<i>by a young assistant US
attorney named Larry Parrish,</i>

1011
00:55:26,112 --> 00:55:28,829
<i>a lay Protestant preacher
who has been quoted as saying</i>

1012
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:32,157
<i>he'd rather get smut off the
streets of Memphis than dope. </i>

1013
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:35,453
Larry Parrish is the...
About one of the finest people

1014
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,341
I've ever known
in my entire life.

1015
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:39,604
<i>Fine guy. </i>

1016
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,842
<i>And on top of that he's,
uh, he's movie star quality. </i>

1017
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,049
<i>First of all,
he was very tall. </i>

1018
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,006
And I hate tall people.

1019
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:48,891
Uh...

1020
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:50,901
But he was also
very arrogant.

1021
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,780
If you're gonna dance,
you need to pay the piper.

1022
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,644
And, uh, I'm the piper.

1023
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:58,170
You've got to be accountable
under the law.

1024
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:00,308
It was like
when some people know

1025
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:03,000
that they have
the answer to everything

1026
00:56:03,134 --> 00:56:06,679
and everybody else
is... is... is... is totally wrong.

1027
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,968
It was purely and simply
a matter of law enforcement.

1028
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:14,582
And I guess if there was
any passion in it for me,

1029
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,475
it was that, um,

1030
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,666
these are laws
that had not been enforced.

1031
00:56:21,055 --> 00:56:22,843
And I knew of no reason

1032
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,950
why they should
not be enforced.

1033
00:56:25,054 --> 00:56:26,363
<i>To make his case,</i>

1034
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,147
<i>Larry Parrish invoked
a highly unusual use</i>

1035
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:30,708
<i>of the conspiracy laws. </i>

1036
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,757
The government explained
their conspiracy theory

1037
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,709
in the terms of a train.

1038
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:40,539
<i>That if the train starts
in Los Angeles</i>

1039
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,777
<i>and you get on in Los Angeles,</i>

1040
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:45,076
<i>and you ride to Denver
and get off,</i>

1041
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:47,548
<i>but the train continues
on to Memphis,</i>

1042
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:50,907
<i>you are legally responsible
for the entire journey. </i>

1043
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:54,583
And if you're responsible
for everything that takes place,

1044
00:56:54,653 --> 00:56:56,409
you have unlimited liability.

1045
00:56:56,476 --> 00:57:00,088
This was a very creative use
of the law of conspiracy

1046
00:57:00,157 --> 00:57:03,256
and prosecutors
should never be creative.

1047
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:05,108
That's not their job.

1048
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:07,316
If my mother
had been involved,

1049
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:08,599
she would
have been indicted.

1050
00:57:08,669 --> 00:57:11,451
I will promise you that.
Uh, she wasn't.

1051
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:15,031
When you tell artists,
bad artists or good artists,

1052
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,466
that they cannot experiment
in certain avenues,

1053
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:19,987
you are taking away the basic
freedoms of every American.

1054
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:22,650
For some reason, though,

1055
00:57:22,716 --> 00:57:26,011
it was as if
he is involved in art.

1056
00:57:26,524 --> 00:57:29,143
And so art is protected.

1057
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:32,283
Well, not by the definition
of the Supreme Court.

1058
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,485
<i>Maybe I'm disgusting
in some peoples' eyes. </i>

1059
00:57:34,555 --> 00:57:36,344
Maybe others are bored by me.

1060
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,866
But there are no laws against
acting in these films.

1061
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:41,877
<i>And the actors
and the actresses,</i>

1062
00:57:42,203 --> 00:57:44,112
<i>I really hesitate
to call them that. </i>

1063
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,247
They are prostitutes
and whoremongers

1064
00:57:48,604 --> 00:57:50,426
On the screen.

1065
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:52,858
I'm sorry,
that's just all they are.

1066
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:54,714
And, uh...

1067
00:57:55,963 --> 00:57:57,556
Uh, they...

1068
00:57:59,547 --> 00:58:02,515
They don't even believe
that there is any law.

1069
00:58:02,588 --> 00:58:06,417
How do you communicate
to those persons

1070
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,791
that this is against the law?

1071
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:10,452
I face five years in jail.

1072
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:13,938
<i>Do I belong in jail for five years
for acting in Deep Throat,</i>

1073
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:15,702
which is not
in violation of the law?

1074
00:58:22,778 --> 00:58:24,339
<i>If seeing this motion picture</i>

1075
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:26,297
<i>as many times as
Larry Parrish has seen it</i>

1076
00:58:26,362 --> 00:58:29,112
<i>has not corrupted him,
or made him into a sex addict,</i>

1077
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:31,481
than I think
that's, uh, proof positive

1078
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:35,572
that these films do not have a
deleterious effect on the human being.

1079
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:37,363
I'm sitting here right now

1080
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,638
<i>trying to draw some images up
from Deep Throat. </i>

1081
00:58:39,706 --> 00:58:41,746
To be honest about it, uh,

1082
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:45,240
do I feel that I'm worse off
because of it?

1083
00:58:45,306 --> 00:58:46,713
Yes, I do.

1084
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,225
Uh, I can't get images
out of my mind

1085
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:51,988
that I have seen.

1086
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:58,069
I have told people
I'm not a eunuch.

1087
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:01,586
I- I'm a regular
red-blooded American male.

1088
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:04,951
And, uh,

1089
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:07,122
and those images
I wish were not there.

1090
00:59:08,986 --> 00:59:10,960
<i>We had a lot of eye contact
with the jury. </i>

1091
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:14,066
<i>I think the jury was very
sympathetic to Harry. </i>

1092
00:59:15,576 --> 00:59:17,878
And there was
a palpable change

1093
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:19,957
in the jury's reaction

1094
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:23,412
to Harry
after seeing him in the film.

1095
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,767
<i>That was one of the amusing
times in the trial. </i>

1096
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:28,367
He sat over in a, uh,

1097
00:59:28,473 --> 00:59:30,742
in a corner by himself,
sort of hoverin'

1098
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,948
and wouldn't look at
the jurors,

1099
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:34,707
and they were all
staring at him.

1100
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:42,360
I felt as though my life
was being taken away from me.

1101
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,272
And that I was
being depicted, characterized

1102
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:47,636
as something evil,
a demon.

1103
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,496
<i>After a two-month trial,</i>

1104
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,640
<i>the jury took just five hours</i>

1105
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:01,395
<i>to return
a unanimously guilty verdict. </i>

1106
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,285
The substance of what you say,

1107
01:00:03,352 --> 01:00:05,873
in effect, is you were the little
man who wasn't there.

1108
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:07,285
But the fact
of the matter is,

1109
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,360
you deliberately
and knowingly

1110
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:10,991
committed a long series

1111
01:00:11,063 --> 01:00:13,681
of immoral, revolting,
obscene acts.

1112
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:15,661
You might have found it
obscene, and immoral,

1113
01:00:15,736 --> 01:00:17,165
and distasteful,
and disgusting.

1114
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,188
Others don't.

1115
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:21,395
The acts you performed on film
are acts that would be crimes

1116
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:23,852
if they were performed on
the street or someplace else.

1117
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:26,197
No. They are wonderful
celebrations of life.

1118
01:00:26,263 --> 01:00:27,473
They're called sex,
Mr. Cohn.

1119
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:29,679
You just can't cloak yourself
with the American flag

1120
01:00:29,783 --> 01:00:31,125
because you don't fit
the image.

1121
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:34,486
<i>You talk as though the Bill of
Rights was created just for you.</i>

1122
01:00:42,582 --> 01:00:44,851
<i>For the first time
in US history,</i>

1123
01:00:44,919 --> 01:00:48,235
<i>an actor had been convicted
for merely playing a part. </i>

1124
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:51,249
<i>And Harry Reems
faced five years in jail. </i>

1125
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:54,126
<i>It did not bode well
for the future</i>

1126
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,564
of any kind of aesthetic
or artistic expression

1127
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,517
in this country,
in any of the arts,

1128
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:00,501
much less this poor guy

1129
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:04,273
<i>who, you know, suddenly finds
himself being made a scapegoat. </i>

1130
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,060
<i>All in the interest of</i>

1131
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,916
a basically moral crusade.

1132
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:14,830
<i>What was behind
the case in Memphis</i>

1133
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:17,008
<i>was the religious right. </i>

1134
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,861
<i>This is the first
real incarnation</i>

1135
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,854
<i>of trying to apply
their conception of morality</i>

1136
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,005
to all of America.

1137
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:30,700
<i>In response,</i>

1138
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:33,805
<i>Hollywood was quick to mobilize
and defend Harry Reems,</i>

1139
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:37,171
<i>positioning itself as
an opposing cultural force. </i>

1140
01:01:38,646 --> 01:01:40,107
<i>Professionals in the arts</i>

1141
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,385
<i>may not find Deep Throat,
as such,</i>

1142
01:01:42,453 --> 01:01:44,690
<i>a piece of art
worth defending. </i>

1143
01:01:44,885 --> 01:01:46,260
<i>But they are worried about</i>

1144
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:48,267
<i>the threat of
being arrested later on</i>

1145
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:50,894
<i>for what
they write or act in today. </i>

1146
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,525
<i>It's a censorship issue. </i>

1147
01:01:52,597 --> 01:01:56,372
<i>My overall concern
is the basic, uh, infringement</i>

1148
01:01:56,437 --> 01:01:58,063
<i>on the rights
of the First Amendment. </i>

1149
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:00,304
That's probably why
I came to his defense,

1150
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:02,893
knowing that
Beatty and Nicholson did.

1151
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:06,986
That's how
I make all my decisions.

1152
01:02:08,532 --> 01:02:11,215
I said, "Alan, am...
am... am I gonna be convicted?

1153
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:12,657
"Am I going to do
prison time?"

1154
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:14,546
And his response was:

1155
01:02:17,012 --> 01:02:18,572
"If the Republicans
are reelected,

1156
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:20,367
you're going to jail.

1157
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,300
If the Democrats are elected,
you're going to be set free. "

1158
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:29,646
<i>While Harry fought for
his freedom,</i>

1159
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:32,301
<i>the architect of the moral
crusade in the first place</i>

1160
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:35,240
<i>was no longer in office
to savor his triumph. </i>

1161
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:39,019
<i>I shall resign the Presidency
effective at noon tomorrow. </i>

1162
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:44,974
<i>And his undoing
had also been Deep Throat,</i>

1163
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,009
<i>the nickname for
the secret Watergate source. </i>

1164
01:02:48,243 --> 01:02:50,447
<i>There's an expression
in journalism</i>

1165
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:52,490
<i>called "deep background"
which means that</i>

1166
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:55,597
<i>the information cannot be used
in the newspaper</i>

1167
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,733
<i>with any kind of
hint of attribution. </i>

1168
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,540
<i>Deep Throat, deep background.
You know, it's sort of a...</i>

1169
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:08,236
<i>Its national nightmare over,
the nation got down. </i>

1170
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:17,582
The time was right for a
porno star to be a pop star.

1171
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:18,730
Who would have
ever thought?

1172
01:03:20,307 --> 01:03:21,900
<i>More, more, more. </i>

1173
01:03:22,003 --> 01:03:23,596
<i>How do you like it,
how do you like it?</i>

1174
01:03:25,043 --> 01:03:26,635
That's it. That's all of it.

1175
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:29,488
It gets repeated
and repeated and repeated.

1176
01:03:31,218 --> 01:03:32,331
It means nothing.

1177
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:00,042
<i>A year ago,</i>

1178
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:02,634
a Memphis federal court
convicted actor Harry Reems

1179
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,071
on obscenity charges
in connection with his role

1180
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:06,729
<i>in the film Deep Throat. </i>

1181
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,964
Today, a US District Judge in
Memphis overturned that conviction,

1182
01:04:10,032 --> 01:04:12,520
saying that the actor's
activities took place before

1183
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:15,407
the 1973 Supreme Court
obscenity ruling.

1184
01:04:16,785 --> 01:04:20,330
<i>Now that my name
was... was pretty recognizable,</i>

1185
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,802
<i>I moved to LA,</i>

1186
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:24,523
thinking that certainly somebody
would come along and say:

1187
01:04:24,592 --> 01:04:26,502
"Well,
there's a sellable name. "

1188
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:29,456
<i>Allan Carr had produced
and directed films,</i>

1189
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:31,048
<i>uh, for Paramount. </i>

1190
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,528
And he called me one day
and said,

1191
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:34,567
"I'd like you
to play the role

1192

<i>of the high school coach
in the movie Grease. "</i>

1193
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:40,358
<i>I was excited that
I was given an opportunity. </i>

1194
01:04:40,433 --> 01:04:41,742
<i>Then about two
or three weeks</i>

1195
01:04:41,841 --> 01:04:44,229
<i>before principal
photography began,</i>

1196
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:46,856
<i>Paramount Pictures
removed me from the cast. </i>

1197
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,743
<i>That they didn't feel
as though I belonged</i>

1198
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:52,936
<i>in a mainstream
motion picture. </i>

1199
01:04:53,232 --> 01:04:55,403
<i>And the lights went on
for me. </i>

1200
01:04:55,472 --> 01:04:57,261
I had branded myself

1201
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,945
and, uh, given myself
a certain stigma.

1202
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:03,048
<i>I just started
to drink every night,</i>

1203
01:05:03,343 --> 01:05:04,717
looking for an escape,

1204
01:05:04,783 --> 01:05:07,751
looking for a little bit
of lightheartedness.

1205
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:09,165
And, you know,

1206
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:13,061
it just led me into
a terrible, terrible disease

1207
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:15,175
of alcoholism
and drug addiction.

1208
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,387
What are you doin'?

1209
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:20,168
An antidote.
I'm mixing an antidote.

1210
01:05:20,335 --> 01:05:22,190
<i>I remember
the last movies I was on,</i>

1211
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,683
<i>I couldn't even walk. </i>

1212
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:26,060
<i>I mean, literally,
they had to carry me to a seat</i>

1213
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:29,028
and I'd shoot the whole
motion picture sitting in a seat,

1214
01:05:29,102 --> 01:05:31,044

1215
01:05:33,902 --> 01:05:36,357
<i>I was so drunk
and so drugged up at the time</i>

1216
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,147
<i>that I couldn't do
sex scenes. </i>

1217
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,192
Oh, my head.

1218
01:05:41,263 --> 01:05:43,236
<i>They'd carry me off the set</i>

1219
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:46,658
and somebody would get me home
and I'd drink some more

1220
01:05:46,766 --> 01:05:49,417
and they'd pick me up
and take me back the next day.

1221
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:51,459
It's all a blur.
It's all a blur.

1222
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:56,717
<i>I lost my home. </i>

1223
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:58,440
<i>I lost my career. </i>

1224
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:00,843
<i>I lost my friends,</i>

1225
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:03,975
<i>and ended up, literally,</i>

1226
01:06:04,046 --> 01:06:07,079
<i>panhandling in the streets
on Sunset Boulevard. </i>

1227
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:10,405
<i>Harry's personal defeat</i>

<i>in the face of
his First Amendment triumph</i>

1229
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:15,399

01:06:23,117 --> 01:06:25,004
<i>Culture took
a reactionary turn</i>

1233
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:27,141
<i>after what seemed like
we were on, uh, heading</i>

1234
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:29,864
toward a climax of
the sexual revolution

1235
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:32,421
that we never
actually, uh, attained.

1236
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,548
<i>In the 1970s,</i>

1237
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:39,687
the worst censors
in the country

1238
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:42,346
suddenly became the feminists.

1239
01:06:44,269 --> 01:06:45,992
<i>The so-called
sexual revolution</i>

1240
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:49,377
<i>in this country has not
been liberating for women. </i>

1241
01:06:49,452 --> 01:06:52,322
<i>It's the way that pornography
invades the popular culture... </i>

1242
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:55,114
<i>It's becoming increasingly
socially acceptable. </i>

1243
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:58,533
<i>The role that
you have selected for women</i>

1244
01:06:58,605 --> 01:06:59,619
is degrading to women

1245
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:01,633
because you choose to see
women as sex objects

1246
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:02,952
not as full human beings.

1247
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,678
Well, obviously...
Hold on. The day that...

1248
01:07:05,932 --> 01:07:07,720
Obviously...
I haven't finished.

1249
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:09,642
The day that you are willing
to come out here

1250
01:07:09,707 --> 01:07:11,977
with a cottontail
attached to your rear end...

1251
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,353
When the women's
movement began to attack sex in general

1252
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,435
and men in general,

1253
01:07:18,508 --> 01:07:19,522
I was...

1254
01:07:19,596 --> 01:07:20,904
I was at a loss for words

1255
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:23,491
because these were
our partners

1256
01:07:23,595 --> 01:07:25,864
in a revolution
to really change

1257
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:27,840
uh, sexual values.

1258
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:29,220
I'm more in sympathy

1259
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,201
than perhaps, uh, you know,
the girls realize...

1260
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:32,289
Women.

1261
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:33,378
I'm sorry.

1262
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,433
Yes. I'm 35.

1263
01:07:34,507 --> 01:07:35,848
Than the ladies realize.

1264
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,858
I use "girls" referring to
women of all ages.

1265
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:39,393
You should stop.

1266
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:41,409
If you want to
be called a boy.

1267
01:07:41,483 --> 01:07:43,425
I see. Okay. Um...

1268
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:49,161
The idea was
to convince people

1269
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:53,795
that there were good, sound,
feminist, humanitarian reasons

1270
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,842
to be against pornography.

1271
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,006
<i>Women Against Pornography
found a surprising ally</i>

1272
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:03,390
<i>in America's most famous
porn star: Linda Lovelace,</i>

1273
01:08:03,499 --> 01:08:04,960
<i>who had retired
from the spotlight</i>

1274
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:06,409
<i>and was now
a mother and housewife. </i>

1275
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,686
<i>Linda Lovelace is, uh, here. </i>

1276
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,577
<i>The book is titled,
uh, Ordeal. </i>

1277
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:15,715
And I'll tell you,
this book is a very, uh,

1278
01:08:15,786 --> 01:08:17,990
explicit recounting
of what happened to you.

1279
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:20,261
I felt it was important to let

1280
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,890
everything out
that happened to me.

1281
01:08:21,994 --> 01:08:24,361
I literally became a prisoner
of Mr. Traynor's.

1282
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:26,727
<i>I wasn't permitted to go to
the bathroom by myself. </i>

1283
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:28,735
<i>I was never allowed
out of his eyesight. </i>

1284
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:31,111
<i>If he took a shower, I had
to take a shower with him. </i>

1285
01:08:31,178 --> 01:08:34,440
If I did have any kind of communication
with my friends or my family,

1286
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:36,229
he was on the extension
with a. 45

1287
01:08:36,297 --> 01:08:38,915
or an M-16 semi-automatic
machine gun pointed at me.

1288
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:42,656
And there are those who say you can
see the bruises on her in the film.

1289
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:47,653
You tell me if the bruises
are visible in the film.

1290
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,503
How did Linda Lovelace
and Gloria Steinem join forces?

1291
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:52,063
How did the two of you
get together?

1292
01:08:52,137 --> 01:08:54,854
<i>I saw Linda on
the Phil Donahue Show. </i>

1293
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:58,565
And she was
being questioned by Phil,

1294
01:08:58,664 --> 01:09:01,250
who I think is usually
a more sensitive questioner

1295
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:02,946
than he was this time,

1296
01:09:03,048 --> 01:09:06,212
uh, and by the audience,
with enormous disbelief.

1297
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,164
And I still find it
very hard to believe

1298
01:09:08,232 --> 01:09:10,141
that you have become
a changed person.

1299
01:09:10,216 --> 01:09:12,671
I had always heard that to be
hypnotized, you had to be willing.

1300
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:15,166
Is there something about the way
you were raised, in your view,

1301
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:16,648
that made you
vulnerable to this?

1302
01:09:16,744 --> 01:09:19,079
And yet
she was still being asked,

1303
01:09:19,144 --> 01:09:20,900
uh, what in her background

1304
01:09:20,968 --> 01:09:23,489
had led her to become
essentially a hostage.

1305
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:25,694
What did lead
you to become a hostage,

1306
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:27,557
if we can... if we can now
ask the question?

1307
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,632
Does it go back beyond that
to your childhood,

1308
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,078
that you were
a susceptible person?

1309
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:32,158
No.

1310
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:35,200
See now what you're doing, you're
doing what... what made me so angry.

1311
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:38,239
You know, because we don't
say to the hostages in Iran:

1312
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:41,027
"What in your... what in
your background led you

1313
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:42,656
to... to be in that embassy?"
Yeah.

1314
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:44,638
The situations
are not nearly comparable.

1315
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,915
They are. It's force.

1316
01:09:47,624 --> 01:09:50,940
<i>Linda needed somebody
to tell her what to do. </i>

1317
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,822
And as long as she had
somebody telling her what to do,

1318
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:56,382
she... she was happy.

1319
01:09:56,455 --> 01:09:57,665
So when she
made the movie,

1320
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,142
she was happy
making the movie.

1321
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:00,581
After the movie,
somebody said,

1322
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:02,305
"Hey, you shouldn't have
made that movie. "

1323
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,414
So she became unhappy
about making the movie,

1324
01:10:04,519 --> 01:10:06,079
which wasn't true.

1325
01:10:06,311 --> 01:10:09,028
She was very happy
about making the movie.

1326
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:16,959
<i>Linda's new fame as
a crusader against pornography</i>

1327
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:20,893
<i>culminated with her testimony before
the Meese Commission in 1986.</i>

1328
01:10:21,286 --> 01:10:23,326
<i>My ordeal still goes on. </i>

1329
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:25,057
<i>The film Deep Throat
still shows</i>

1330
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:27,493
and virtually every time
someone watches that movie,

1331
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:29,827
they're watching me
being raped.

1332
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,933
<i>Once again,
the government had set out</i>

1333
01:10:32,006 --> 01:10:33,861
<i>to determine
the effect of pornography. </i>

1334
01:10:33,926 --> 01:10:36,773
<i>This time, instead of
relying on scientific data,</i>

1335
01:10:36,838 --> 01:10:38,594
<i>they relied on
personal testimony</i>

1336
01:10:38,662 --> 01:10:41,477
<i>to prove that pornography
was a social evil. </i>

1337
01:10:42,598 --> 01:10:45,315
Well, the other day
my 8-year-old son said to me:

1338
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:47,618
"Mommy,
if this country is so great,

1339
01:10:47,686 --> 01:10:49,540
how come people
are still hurting you?"

1340
01:10:49,606 --> 01:10:51,394
<i>It's sort of like
the Oprah Show.</i>

1341
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:54,276
It's, um, much more anecdotal.
Much less professional.

1342
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,470
<i>So what Nixon starts
in the '60s and '70s</i>

1344
01:10:59,014 --> 01:11:00,901
<i>Reagan finishes
with the Meese report. </i>

1345
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:02,820
<i>In its most controversial
finding,</i>

1346
01:11:02,886 --> 01:11:04,031
<i>the commission concludes</i>

1347
01:11:04,102 --> 01:11:06,622
<i>there is a relationship between
violence and pornography. </i>

1348
01:11:06,726 --> 01:11:09,279
<i>The commission conducted
no scientific studies. </i>

1349
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,171
<i>Finally,
after decades of struggle,</i>

1350
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,441
<i>politics triumphed over
pornography. </i>

1351
01:11:17,509 --> 01:11:19,200
<i>But the victory was hollow. </i>

1352
01:11:19,269 --> 01:11:20,643
<i>The success of Deep Throat</i>

1353
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,164
<i>created enormous demand
for hardcore,</i>

1354
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,211
<i>that new technology
could now satisfy</i>

1355
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,325
<i>and avoid all regulation. </i>

1356
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:30,815
The phenomenal sales of
home videocassette machines

1357
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,569
have opened up a new market
for erotic films.

1358
01:11:33,638 --> 01:11:36,571
<i>It's a market that barely
existed a couple of years ago. </i>

1359
01:11:36,644 --> 01:11:39,426
But today,
30 to 50 percent of the tapes

1360
01:11:39,524 --> 01:11:41,597
available for play
in these machines

1361
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,523
are hardcore pornography.

1362
01:11:52,773 --> 01:11:56,067
Gerry Damiano,
I think, really thought

1363
01:11:56,387 --> 01:11:59,966
that porn was going to merge
into, kind of, Hollywood films.

1364
01:12:04,196 --> 01:12:06,301
<i>That porn movies</i>

1365
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:08,674
<i>were gonna just get
bigger and bigger budgets</i>

1366
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,457
and become more like feature
films with hardcore sex.

1367
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:15,424
Looked like it was going to burst
itself into something, into an art form.

1368
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:16,570
That didn't happen.

1369
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,366
In fact,
just the opposite happened.

1370
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:21,531
Instead, it dwindled in-into
a mediocre commodity.

1371
01:12:24,995 --> 01:12:27,842
<i>With the advent of
the video camera,</i>

1372
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:31,680
<i>it got to be so easy
to... to shoot X-rated video</i>

1373
01:12:31,842 --> 01:12:33,817
that ev-everybody could do it.

1374
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:36,127
And then, the only ones
that did it

1375
01:12:36,195 --> 01:12:38,780
were the ones that could do it
cheaper and cheaper,

1376
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,673
for less and less
and less money.

1377
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:47,134
<i>They were...
they were nothing. </i>

1378
01:12:47,203 --> 01:12:49,886
<i>It was just
one sex scene after another. </i>

1379
01:12:49,987 --> 01:12:52,256
<i>And it... it sort of
killed itself. </i>

1380
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:58,497
<i>I couldn't make
that kind of film. </i>

1381
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:01,376
Because there was...
there was no reason to.

1382
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:04,504
<i>It became a...
it became a factory. </i>

1383
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:08,185
<i>It was over. </i>

1384
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,746
<i>You didn't need
filmmakers anymore. </i>

1385
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:17,658
<i>As the adult industry grew,</i>

1386
01:13:17,762 --> 01:13:19,704
<i>it neither needed
the rebel filmmaker</i>

1387
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:21,119
<i>who had pioneered it</i>

1388
01:13:21,186 --> 01:13:23,935
<i>nor heeded the feminist
protest against it. </i>

1389
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,107
<i>So finding herself redundant,</i>

1390
01:13:26,178 --> 01:13:29,080
<i>Linda Lovelace moved
with her family to Denver</i>

1391
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,292
<i>to try and start a new life. </i>

1392
01:13:31,968 --> 01:13:33,529
Um, that's Mom at her desk.

1393
01:13:33,601 --> 01:13:35,935
Uh, she was the manager
of the mailroom.

1394
01:13:37,889 --> 01:13:40,092
She was proud of her new desk.

1395
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:41,593
Um...

1396
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:44,255
They fired her
when they found out about LL.

1397
01:13:44,321 --> 01:13:45,914
<i>It happened a lot. </i>

1398
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:52,470
<i>You know, I've lost two jobs</i>

1399
01:13:52,576 --> 01:13:54,649
<i>because of the name
Linda Lovelace. </i>

1400
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,338
<i>And, uh,
that-that's kind of... </i>

1401
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:58,488
<i>That hurts. </i>

1402
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,829
<i>You know,
I was always defending myself</i>

1403
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:03,580
<i>after, what, 25 years. </i>

1404
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,455
<i>I don't have to do that
too much anymore. </i>

1405
01:14:06,528 --> 01:14:09,113
So I've decided it's
time for me to do what I can

1406
01:14:09,184 --> 01:14:11,007
to earn an income

1407
01:14:11,617 --> 01:14:14,966
from, uh, the abuse that
I went through from the name.

1408
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:17,496
<i>Broke and out of work,</i>

1409
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:20,798
<i>Linda returned to the world
she had once condemned. </i>

1410
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,232
<i>You know, I think it's kind of
nice looking sexy</i>

1411
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,954
and... and still
looking attractive at 51.

1412
01:14:29,024 --> 01:14:32,471
So, I didn't feel there
was anything wrong with doing it.

1413
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,490
<i>Many feminists
who have written,</i>

1414
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,804
<i>you know, books... </i>

1415
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:39,484
<i>And they're always using the name Linda
Lovelace, and what happened to me. </i>

1416
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:41,973
I don't get
any royalties from that.

1417
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:45,211
And it doesn't take much
to keep me happy.

1418
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:47,352
You know? I get to be
with my grandchildren,

1419
01:14:47,424 --> 01:14:49,878
around my children,
and that's my joy.

1420
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:05,018
She died penniless.
Didn't have a dime.

1421
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:06,551
Didn't have a dime.

1422
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:12,058
And they all got rich.

1423
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:13,719
They all got
their hands in the pocket.

1424
01:15:18,782 --> 01:15:21,782
<i>Fuck me harder,
harder, harder. </i>

1425
01:15:22,526 --> 01:15:24,893
<i>Sex is a force,
it's a force like lava. </i>

1426
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,925
And there haven't been too
many successful engineering projects

1427
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,752
about diverting
the flow of lava.

1428
01:15:32,221 --> 01:15:35,123
<i>Did I ever see the movie
Deep Throat? No.</i>

1429
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:36,341
Should I?

1430
01:15:36,446 --> 01:15:39,195
No. That's with, um,
that lady who died.

1431
01:15:39,261 --> 01:15:40,309
What's her name?

1432
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,557
No, I have not seen it.

1433
01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:51,411
<i>Deep Throat forged
the sexual revolution</i>

1434
01:15:52,733 --> 01:15:54,075
<i>for good or bad. </i>

1435
01:15:54,142 --> 01:15:55,702
<i>It led to the porno business. </i>

1436
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:59,930
<i>Linda Lovelace turned it, and Deep
Throat turned it, into an industry. </i>

1437
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:01,238
And like it or hate it,

1438
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:03,414
that's what she's gonna be
remembered for, forever.

1439
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:09,180
<i>Porn really does have
a yucky feel to it today. </i>

1440
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:13,617
<i>Part of it, I think, that was lost
is this, a certain innocence. </i>

1441
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:16,180
For that brief moment,
porn was part of

1442
01:16:16,253 --> 01:16:18,325
discovery, curiosity,

1443
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:20,438
change.

1444
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,033
Today it's different.

1445
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:25,045
<i>What happened</i>

1446
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:27,930
<i>was that a very cynical
pornography industry</i>

1447
01:16:27,996 --> 01:16:30,810
came in on the heels
of the First Amendment

1448
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:33,942
and began coining money
hand over fist.

1449
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:38,235
<i>So, it changed the nature
of... of pornographic sex,</i>

1450
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:39,959
<i>from art to money. </i>

1451
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,202
<i>Money is not interested in
the little alleys</i>

1452
01:16:45,532 --> 01:16:47,603
of endeavor...
of artistic endeavor.

1453
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,843
<i>It wants the main highway. </i>

1454
01:16:55,963 --> 01:16:57,971
<i>It's a really dramatic fact</i>

1455
01:16:58,044 --> 01:17:00,727
<i>that we have gone from people
staring up at a marquee</i>

1456
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:02,519
<i>and thinking
"What can deep throat mean?</i>

1457
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:04,408
<i>Surely not
what I'm thinking"</i>

1458
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:07,638
to kids who don't
consider it sex.

1459
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:19,447
<i>They perverted it
instead of improving it. </i>

1460
01:17:20,763 --> 01:17:22,999
<i>They took a beautiful thing
that God gave mankind,</i>

1461
01:17:23,067 --> 01:17:25,882
and they perverted it.
And the results are obvious.

1462
01:17:25,947 --> 01:17:27,376
All you have to do
is look around.

1463
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,600
<i>Deep Throat's
legacy goes beyond</i>

1464
01:17:35,707 --> 01:17:38,838
<i>the sexually saturated culture
that surrounds us today</i>

1465
01:17:38,907 --> 01:17:41,657
<i>and reaches back to the
beginnings of a culture war</i>

1466
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,024
<i>that divides us
as never before. </i>

1467
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,639
<i>Deep Throat was less about
the joys of oral sex</i>

1468
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:02,772
<i>than it was about the freedom
to speak out against shame</i>

1469
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,151
<i>and hypocrisy. </i>

1470
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,764
<i>The FCC has fined
169 stations to pay... </i>

1471
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,840
<i>Congress is also
cracking down... </i>

1472
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,702
<i>Three Supreme Court justices</i>

1473
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,519
<i>are expected to retire
over the next four years. </i>

1474
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:16,658
<i>Each of these 169... </i>

1475
01:18:20,794 --> 01:18:24,372
<i>Today, there are people
in the Department of Justice</i>

1476
01:18:24,442 --> 01:18:27,986
<i>in high places, sympathetic
with obscenity laws. </i>

1477
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,354
I think today

1478
01:18:31,193 --> 01:18:33,614
the climate is
even more ripe

1479
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:36,596
for vigorous enforcement
of obscenity laws.

1480
01:18:38,425 --> 01:18:40,661
<i>Now if we could get
these terrorists to go away</i>

1481
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,052
<i>And quit taking up
so much time of the,</i>

1482
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:46,509
<i>uh, of
the Department of Justice... </i>

1483
01:18:50,552 --> 01:18:51,599
All right?

1484
01:18:51,672 --> 01:18:52,752
Thank you.

1485
01:18:52,824 --> 01:18:54,068
You're welcome.

1486
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:46,126
<i>To this day,</i>

1487
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:48,269
<i>people ask me to see
Deep Throat.</i>

1488
01:20:48,373 --> 01:20:50,162
And they all, you know...

1489
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,985
When they refer to Artie,
you know,

1490
01:20:52,053 --> 01:20:53,908
he has a deep throat, so.

1491
01:20:54,294 --> 01:20:56,977
They say, "You know the
guy with the deep throat, you know?

1492
01:20:57,045 --> 01:20:59,282
<i>"He's the one that did
Deep Throat. "</i>

1493
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:03,186
We always have to emphasize that
we didn't do it, you know.

1494
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:06,188
We just distributed it.
Because, he wouldn't...

1495
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,465
I don't think he would...
Would you ever do that?

1496
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:10,256
I wouldn't know how.
I knew it!

1497
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:13,009
But if you did know how,
would you do it?

1498
01:21:13,972 --> 01:21:15,795
You have to think
about that?

1499
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:16,972
Hey.

1500
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,951
Okay.
Are we finished?
