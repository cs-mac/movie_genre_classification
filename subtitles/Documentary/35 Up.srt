1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,330
- Baba-chan, morning!
- Morning.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,820
- We're first ones here today.
- Yeah, really early.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,820
- Did you sleep well?
- Yep!

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,890
- Our phones...
- Why?

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,890
I thought they were stolen at camp.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,820
It's mine.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,340
Who did this?

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:38,870
What is this report?

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,620
Survival Camp Report
What is this report?

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,320
What is this report?

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,340
- Is there a problem with it?
- There's nothing but problems.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,330
Survival on their own without cell phones!

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,880
Banishing people from the group by majority vote!

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,920
An unbelievable camp after all.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,830
I followed the instructions in your manual!

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,340
I don't remember writing anything like this!

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,320
Huh?

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,330
Everyone! Big problem!

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,330
Excuse me.

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:11,830
Student Rankings

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,850
There's been a change in the student rankings?
Student Rankings

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,350
There's been a change in the student rankings?

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,420
Yeah. This site used to divide

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,340
students into

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,840
teams 1, 2, and 3.

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,840
Look at this!

27
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,850
Look look.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,940
Everyone's the same.

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,820
Why?

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,830
It has to be because of the survival camp.

31
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,850
A lot happened there.

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,330
Team 2 attacking team 1.

33
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,320
And team 1 fighting among themselves too.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,370
So it seems that taking

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,410
them outside of the classroom

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,330
makes school caste meaningless.

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,350
So, the school caste is gone then?

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,350
I think so.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey, how about we eat lunch together?

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Yeah.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,930
What should we call you guys?

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,850
Just Ren and Ozamu is fine.

43
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,830
- Right.
- Sure.

44
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,840
Yay!

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,340
Okura, Kashiwagi, Jinbo!

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
My phone?

47
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,340
The History of Baba Ayako

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,910
- It's thanks to Baba-chan.
- Yeah.
The History of Baba Ayako

49
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,850
- It's thanks to Baba-chan.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,850
The classroom changed ever since you got here.

51
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,330
It was tough for awhile but it

52
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,350
looks like the school caste is gone now!

53
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
That wasn't my plan.

54
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,410
Perhaps

55
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,340
you came from the stars, the amazing Baba-chan-man!

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,350
- Baba change!
- Not funny!

57
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,330
Come on! Let's all do the Baba Ranger pose!

58
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,350
You just want the girls to play with you!

59
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,850
No no!

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,350
What?

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,910
What's this message?

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,190
The truth is in locker 28.
What's this message?

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,320
What's this message?

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,830
28?

65
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,830
I don't think anyone's using that locker.

66
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,350
But who knows the emails for everyone in the class?

67
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,320
I bet whoever stole the

68
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,370
phones took our addresses too.

69
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,420
Really!?

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,340
Let's look at the locker.

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,330
- Yeah.
- Okay.

72
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,330
Open it up.

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,320
It's an indictment.

74
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,360
Baba Ayako of Kunikida High School Class 3-A

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Baba-chan?

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,340
was placed in there by orders of Superintendent Asada.

77
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,850
Her objective was to use current high school students for live experiments

78
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,420
and observe the results.

79
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,510
Indictment

80
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,440
...live experiments...

81
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,350
This...

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
That's her.

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,870
- Who's next to her?
- What is this?

84
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,820
High schools nowadays are like endless wastelands.

85
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,340
Bullying, truancy, depression.

86
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,360
Everything is controlled by monsters in the school caste.

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
No matter your role, you get tired of the part you play.

88
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,350
Kaiser...

89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,320
And not just for students.

90
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,840
Teachers and parents

91
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,830
find themselves having to apologize for their mistakes.

92
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,880
There are very few rays of hope now.

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,320
But, within this

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,340
never ending darkness.

95
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,820
Can the 35 year old

96
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,880
high school student find something?

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,340
Translation: Rollins   Timing: furransu
high school student find something?

Baba Ayako?

102
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,400
Live experiments?

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,330
So she was a spy for the Kaiser then?

104
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,320
Well, I don't know the details...

105
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,840
But the students are all worked up.

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,330
But if it's true

107
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,830
it does give a good reason for placing a 35 year old woman in high school.

108
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,850
So then our school

109
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,900
is just some testing lab?

110
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,340
Everyone, calm down.

111
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Let's just double check when

112
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,830
the principal gets back in.

113
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,010
Asada Yukinobu

114
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,070
Unknown Number

115
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,340
Hello.

116
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Just as I thought.

117
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,840
Superintendent Asada was using

118
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,320
our class for some experiment.

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,360
That's why you came here.

120
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,430
What are you saying? Of course not...

121
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,340
There's no point in lying.

122
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,840
I know everything about you.

123
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,840
I know where you live. I know everything about your past.

124
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,360
You don't need to sneak around anymore.

125
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,330
Just tell us everything and become our savior.

126
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,830
For me. And you too.

127
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,330
Baba-chan, this...

128
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,930
Sorry.

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,820
Baba-chan.

130
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,330
It's not here...

131
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,850
I can't believe it, Baba-chan was a spy.

132
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,850
We don't know that yet.

133
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,360
Again...

134
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,930
Turn on the TV

135
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,370
The TV...
Turn on the TV

136
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,930
The TV...

137
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,860
We have Superintendent Asada from the

138
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,340
Kawahama City Board of Education.

139
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,330
Is that the guy from the photo?

140
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,370
Let's get right to it Asada-san...

141
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,420
The Kaiser is on TV!

142
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,340
You're right!

143
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,860
Record it!

144
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,820
One of the reasons that

145
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,340
bullying has not left our schools is

146
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,850
to due a problem known as school caste.

147
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,890
The problem of bullying is a difficult one to solve

148
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,840
but I hear you have a new educational reform in place?

149
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,870
To eliminate bullying we will stop the class system.

150
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,850
Stop the Class System
To eliminate bullying we will stop the class system.

151
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,010
What!?
Stop the Class System

152
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,820
What!?

153
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,340
- Stop?
- In doing so,

154
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,860
students are not confined but rather

155
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,410
are free to take classes they like

156
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,830
similar to a university system.

157
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,830
You believe this will eliminate bullying?

158
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,320
Actually, we did an investigation with a high school

159
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,820
in this city and found that when they left the

160
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,930
classroom, the instances of bullying went away.

161
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,850
So you have actual evidence.

162
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,850
That's us, isn't it?

163
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,340
They used us for an experiment!

164
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,340
You tricked us.

165
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,330
Baba-chan, why didn't you tell us?

166
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,340
If it's not true, just say so!

167
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,320
Ah, you guys are hilarious.

168
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,840
You let that lady trick you all.

169
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
You let her use you as guinea pigs for some experiment!

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,350
You're wrong.

171
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,830
You think I'm making it up?

172
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,830
Well, let's see if this is fake too.

173
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,330
Nope, looks real to me.

174
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,830
Hey, Ren.

175
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,830
Isn't this in the way?

176
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,390
Yeah...

177
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,890
- Move.
- Ren.

178
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,340
Go go! Ren!

179
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,000
Asada Yukinobu

180
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,370
Who are you calling?

181
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,820
You called me yesterday, right?

182
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,320
You left that packet in the locker.

183
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,810
And sent messages to everyone, right?

184
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,340
You're right.

185
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,380
Why did you...

186
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,810
You've done some amazing work.

187
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,300
I thought they'd be happier about it.

188
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,820
You're mistaken.

189
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,320
- I didn't...
- I didn't do this

190
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,310
to be mean to you.

191
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
What?

192
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,900
Remember. Everything that's happened in 3-A up to now.

193
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,400
The paper put in the toilet that Hasegawa-san ate in.

194
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,890
How about you disappear? If you did everyone would be happy.

195
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,330
I put that up.

196
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,830
Why?

197
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,330
And I was the one who pushed Yamashita-san down the stairs.

198
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,860
Not just that. I used those high school girls

199
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,410
to set up the pervert accusation,

200
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,830
I told the board of education about the abuse on the track team,

201
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,810
I placed the hidden camera,

202
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,320
and I changed the camp manuals to make a survival game.

203
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
I did it all.

204
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,810
Why did you do it?

205
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,310
You of all people should know.

206
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,910
You're actually my ally, right?

207
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,300
School caste, this pointless ranking,

208
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,840
you want to destroy it, right?

209
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,820
- To get rid of the school caste?
- Yes.

210
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,810
And now the school caste is gone.

211
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,310
Why did you have to trick everyone?

212
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,340
Use poison to get rid of poison.

213
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,810
In order to show everyone how stupid

214
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,320
and terrible the school caste was

215
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,810
I needed to make some easy to understand situations.

216
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,810
And I managed the rankings

217
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,850
of everyone in the school caste

218
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,400
so they knew where they stood.

219
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,820
Just to make sure everyone was aware.

220
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,830
What's that?

221
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,320
The letter to myself ten years from now.

222
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,350
You didn't write anything.

223
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,350
There's no point.

224
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,830
I achieved my objectives.

225
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,830
All that I need to do now is disappear.

226
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,330
Akutsu-kun?

227
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,840
Tell everyone what I did.

228
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,810
- Let go!
- Are you running away from what you did?

229
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,890
What you've done is unforgivable.

230
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,890
But, you can make it right.

231
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,810
So...

232
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,820
"Disappear"?

233
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,320
Don't say it so easily.

234
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,810
Okay okay okay!

235
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,800
Let's use our heads and think!

236
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,320
We were all just manipulated by Baba Ayako.

237
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,310
That's Baba-chan's bag.

238
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,340
She put them on every time she got a new friend.

239
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,380
But really!

240
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,880
They're just proof of her tricking us.

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,840
Are your eyes open now?

242
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,390
It's just like Masamitsu says.

243
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,390
What are we going to do?

244
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,820
I believe Baba-chan.

245
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,810
There's no way that she would

246
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,830
trick us like that!

247
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,830
Yeah.

248
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,830
Thanks to her we got rid of the school caste!

249
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,810
I think so too.

250
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,830
You're still with her?

251
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,830
The school caste is never going away.

252
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,870
And she's back!

253
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,320
It seems like they want to believe you.

254
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,400
I guess it can't be helped. Let me give you a

255
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,310
time to tell us everything.

256
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,820
Let's find out if you're innocent or not

257
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,310
with a Kunikida Witch Trial!

258
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,810
I wonder if she can tell the truth though.

259
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,860
It'll be fine. They trust her so

260
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,360
I know that she can't lie.

261
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,800
Anyway it's up to her

262
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,810
if she wants to do it.

263
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,810
I wonder what the truth is.

264
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,830
You don't trust her?

265
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,820
Of course I believe her but...

266
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,320
But there are those photos of her

267
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,320
with Superintendent Asada.

268
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,810
It doesn't matter why she came to

269
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,310
this school.

270
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,320
We've got this far together because of her.

271
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
Yeah.

272
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
Baba Ayako is a spy for the Kaiser?

273
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,830
Have you heard anything from Superintendent Asada?

274
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,830
No, I haven't heard anything.

275
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,310
They chose our school to

276
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,890
try and implement some new educational reform?

277
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,890
I don't know that.

278
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,330
Although, the Kaiser did say before...

279
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,810
Who is she?

280
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,320
She's my student.

281
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,820
Student...

282
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,870
Let's have an emergency meeting.

283
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,910
- The data on Baba Ayako.
- Okay!

284
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,810
Let's check Kaiser's video from this morning one more time.

285
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,310
Okay.

286
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,810
Koizumi-sensei, a moment...

287
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,310
- Hey hey...
- What is it?

288
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,340
This.

289
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,820
What are they doing!?

290
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Stop! Calm down! Just watch.

291
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,320
Watch them?

292
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,810
Baba-chan!

293
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,810
The Kunikida Witch Trial? Masamitsu's just being stupid, don't worry.

294
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,330
We don't care who you are.

295
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,830
You're Baba-chan to us, no matter what.

296
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,920
Here.

297
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,320
Go ahead.

298
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,330
Everyone...

299
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,470
Baba Ayako

300
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,830
Asada-san!?

301
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,310
Are you okay? Asada-san!

302
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,820
Asada-san! Are you okay? Asada-san!

303
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,340
Guess she's not coming.

304
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,830
She's afraid of the truth, so she ran.

305
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,810
Baba-chan, why...

306
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,830
Oh, so you're ready?

307
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,330
Come on.

308
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,300
So then,

309
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,820
the Kunikida Witch Trial will begin.

310
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Make sure you answer all of the questions honestly.

311
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,810
- Huh, questions?
- Question!

312
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,360
18 years ago Baba-chan dropped out of high school.

313
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Why?

314
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
A, bullying.

315
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,320
B, her mother's hospitalization. C, distrust of others.

316
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,820
- D, everything! Answer!
- What is this question?

317
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,810
What does this have to do with the experiment?

318
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,810
Hurry up! Everyone is waiting for you.

319
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,880
What is he planning?

320
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,380
He wants to expose all of her secrets.

321
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,330
D.

322
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,830
D. So then...

323
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,810
Everything.

324
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,320
D, everything. Right!

325
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,800
So...bullying, your mom in the hospital, and distrusting people.

326
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,410
What does that have to do with you dropping out of school?

327
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,330
Explain it so

328
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,330
everyone can understand!

329
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,340
It all started

330
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,840
with something my mom said.

331
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,930
Your friend is being bullied?

332
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,330
Yes.

333
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,330
And you pretended not to see anything?

334
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,840
What will happen if you don't stick up for your friends?

335
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,340
Okay.

336
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,310
Stop it.

337
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,310
Baba-chan.

338
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,320
But then, the next day,

339
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,870
they just started bullying me.

340
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,620
Haha, so funny.

341
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,190
Die
Disappear\Why are you still alive?
Haha, so funny.

342
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,870
Haha, so funny.

343
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,810
Hey,

344
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,810
let's go home together.

345
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,860
The bullying got worse.

346
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,860
Then I was caught shoplifting.

347
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,340
Show me what's in your bag!

348
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,320
- Let go!
- Stop struggling.

349
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Let go of me!

350
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,320
You're fired.

351
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,340
Aya-chan.

352
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
Why?

353
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,340
You told me

354
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,910
to protect my friend and look

355
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,830
what happened.

356
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,830
Aya-chan...are you being bullied?

357
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,340
I blamed my mother for why I was bullied.

358
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,320
I don't

359
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,320
need any friends!

360
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,820
I couldn't trust any of my classmates.

361
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I'm home.

362
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,800
Aya-chan.

363
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,810
What are you doing? Stop it!

364
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,820
It's my fault, right?

365
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm sorry. It's all my fault!

366
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,910
Yeah.

367
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,410
It's all your fault.

368
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,320
You and your stupid words

369
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,820
ruined my life!

370
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,830
Only if you weren't around...

371
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,420
Please. Just disappear from my sight.

372
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,840
Aya-chan.

373
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,340
Aya-chan!

374
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Disappear from my sight!

375
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,330
Disappear.

376
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,850
So then you stopped going to school

377
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,350
and turned into a shut-in, right?

378
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,840
And then, soon after,

379
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
my mother checked into the hospital.

380
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,330
You had no other relatives

381
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,810
so you had to quit school just to get enough money to get by.

382
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,380
But there's one mysterious thing here.

383
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,320
You didn't trust people back then

384
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,330
so how did you turn into some

385
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,330
strong and trustworthy character here?

386
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,330
That's true.

387
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,350
Maybe the way you act now

388
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,410
is just an act to trick all of us!

389
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,330
- No!
- So let's bring up

390
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,830
question 2!

391
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,820
How are Baba-chan and Superintendent Asada connected?

392
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,840
A, the homeroom teacher who checked up on her when she dropped out.

393
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,860
B, the homeroom teacher who visited Baba-chan's home so many times.

394
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,330
C, the homeroom teacher who kept helping her all these years.

395
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,330
D, everything! Answer!

396
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,340
Huh? I guess everyone can guess

397
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,810
where the answer is but still!

398
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,310
What is it?

399
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,410
D.

400
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,810
D, everything. Correct!

401
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,840
So he's been taking care of you all this time?

402
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,290
I had no job prospects so he helped me find work.

403
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,840
Employment Request
I had no job prospects so he helped me find work.

404
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,830
Employment Request

405
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,140
They'll take even just junior high graduates.
Employment Request

406
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,880
They'll take even just junior high graduates.

407
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Why don't you at least interview?

408
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Why?

409
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,820
You're the only one who can

410
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,320
support your mother.

411
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,880
But,

412
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
I was never good enough at anything.

413
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Being a guard or a cook,

414
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I just kept moving around.

415
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,340
That makes sense.

416
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,840
You couldn't trust people.

417
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,880
When my mother died half a year ago...

418
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,330
Are you okay?

419
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,330
Asada-sensei was

420
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,830
always by my side.

421
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,320
So then that special teacher

422
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,370
made a special request of you?

423
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,340
- An important request you couldn't refuse.
- That's...

424
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Everyone! This is important so make sure you remember!

425
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,300
Baba was working with Kaiser then?

426
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,800
Huh?

427
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,370
Nagamine-sensei?

428
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,310
Next one should be easy!

429
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,320
Question!

430
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,840
Baba-chan said her mother was in the hospital,

431
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,800
so why was she there?

432
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,320
A, illness. B, accident. C, violence.

433
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,820
D, she jumped from a tall building!

434
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,330
Okay, we have four choices here.

435
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,330
What is she going to say now?

436
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,320
- D.
- D, jumping from a tall building, correct!

437
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,830
Baba-chan's mother...

438
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,830
Why?

439
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,820
What an amazing life.

440
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,300
We're getting to the heart now.

441
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,820
Make sure you listen to everything now!

442
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,310
I was a shut-in for a very long time.

443
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,310
And I stopped talking to my mother.

444
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,290
Aya-chan.

445
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,310
It's my fault.

446
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,810
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,290
I know it's tough for you.

448
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,290
So I'll disappear.

449
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,300
I hate this damn school.

450
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,800
Mom!

451
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Mom!

452
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,340
I couldn't forgive her then.

453
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,840
My mom was running away to leave me alone.

454
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,800
She regained consciousness but...

455
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
It's your daughter, Ayako.

456
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,800
Who?

457
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,820
My mother had serious head trauma

458
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,320
and suffered memory loss.

459
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,300
Over the next 18 years...

460
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,290
My mother never recovered.

461
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,820
My mother never remembered who I was.

462
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,790
I killed my mother.

463
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,790
I killed her.

464
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,290
- Baba-chan, that's enough!
- Stop this!

465
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
That's not it.

466
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,780
Something come to mind?

467
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,310
The people at fault were the

468
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,830
classmates who bullied you.

469
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,860
They're the ones who

470
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,900
messed up your life

471
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,400
and made you have this grudge against school.

472
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,310
Did you come to this school

473
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,810
to exact some measure of revenge?

474
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,290
- I didn't want revenge...
- Okay everyone!

475
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,300
After listening to all the stories

476
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,800
we know she hide her real self with an act

477
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,890
and was loyal to her old teacher Superintendent Asada.

478
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,790
And she hated school, which had ruined her life.

479
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,310
So, here's the last question.

480
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,320
- Are you still going on?
- How can you keep asking her questions!?

481
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,800
What? We haven't heard the full

482
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,810
truth yet.

483
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,810
That's enough! Baba-chan is who she is!

484
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,360
Say something!

485
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,360
- Sorry...
- I'm confused too now.

486
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,800
It's okay.

487
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,290
I always thought about it.

488
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,290
When I'd have to tell you everything.

489
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,280
Huh?

490
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,810
Go on.

491
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,810
Question!

492
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,320
Why did you come to our school?

493
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,300
A, revenge against school.

494
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,340
B, a mission for Superintendent Asada.

495
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,890
C, an experiment.

496
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,890
D, everything.

497
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
The answer?

498
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,790
It's not there.

499
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,380
No answer!?

500
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,300
How strange. You answered everything up to now

501
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,790
but why won't you answer this one?

502
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,310
- It's not there.
- Tell the truth!

503
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,790
You can't tell the truth, can you?

504
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm not lying.

505
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,820
Stop pushing her!

506
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,820
Besides, how would you know the answer?

507
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,890
How? Well...

508
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,790
This.

509
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,280
A notebook found in her apartment.

510
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,390
Everything is written inside.

511
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,800
Give it back.

512
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,800
Looking at this notebook,

513
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
how old do you think it is?

514
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,310
One month? Three months?

515
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,310
No, it must be older than t hat.

516
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,380
Otake, what do you think?

517
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,820
It looks two, three years old.

518
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,300
We have two to three years old!

519
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,320
So then, this notebook

520
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,810
it existed for years before

521
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,310
she ever came to our school, right?

522
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,830
So what?

523
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,880
How strange.

524
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,320
So then why does the notebook

525
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,790
have entries about everything that's happened over the last three months?

526
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,310
For example, the first page!

527
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,310
It says "made a 100 friends".

528
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,790
Oh? A little excited now, right?

529
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,800
Remember.

530
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,310
The first day she came to our school.

531
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,350
I'd like to make a hundred friends.

532
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,380
Nice to meet you.

533
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,880
So all her actions are written in this notebook.

534
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,810
Moving on.

535
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,310
Had a lunch together!

536
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,820
That's just a coincidence.

537
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,860
Next.

538
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,890
Became the class representative.

539
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,810
Solve the problems of the other students.

540
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,800
We're going to decide the class representative. Any volunteers?

541
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I'll do it.

542
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,340
The lady did volunteer to do it...

543
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,370
Next.

544
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,870
A fight between best friends!

545
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,290
You guys...

546
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
are best friends.

547
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,320
Let's keep going.

548
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,390
A popular teacher in trouble!

549
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,390
Let teachers teach their students.

550
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,800
The culture festival.

551
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,800
The class all together except for one!

552
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,810
The festival...

553
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,810
You think this is easy!?

554
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,310
Become the savior for

555
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,400
a club in trouble!

556
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,280
The track team?

557
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,280
I don't think it's disgusting at all.

558
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,810
The class meeting between former friends.

559
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,860
The teen court, right?

560
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,860
You can show a little more weakness.

561
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,790
A problem with suicide and the homeroom teacher.

562
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,290
Maybe it's okay to be tricked every now and then.

563
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,820
Went on a school trip.

564
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,410
Talking with friends, but can't see our futures.

565
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,290
The camp we just went on.

566
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,790
You'd call that a coward perhaps?

567
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,330
What is this?

568
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,830
Baba-chan.

569
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,790
Baba-chan?

570
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,290
- That's...
- When I read this,

571
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,300
I had a thought.

572
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,800
It's everything that's happened here in 3-A.

573
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,860
Hasegawa, you.

574
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,360
When you ate alone in the toilet, there was a paper there, right?

575
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:25,790
And the person who found her in the toilet

576
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,360
was the old lady.

577
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,860
No way...

578
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,810
That paper...

579
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:42,310
Maybe something comes to mind for you too?

580
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:49,320
When I was pushed down the stairs,

581
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Baba-chan just happened

582
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,290
to be there too.

583
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,300
That's not all!

584
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,800
Everything that's happened here

585
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,320
has had some strange connection!

586
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,340
It's like she knew about everything...

587
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,810
And even when Saruwatari-sensei was arrested...

588
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:18,310
Or the hidden camera for the teen court...

589
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:23,320
Those cards that told me what to do with Koizumi-sensei...

590
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Was that you?

591
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,340
So then,

592
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,810
she set up all these events just to

593
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:39,300
fulfill her mission for Superintendent Asada.

594
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,810
Then she pretended to solve them

595
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,810
- and make herself to be our savior!
- No!

596
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,360
What? Then who was it?

597
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,800
That's...

598
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,300
You can't answer and you have no proof.

599
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,790
This notebook.

600
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,810
It's the script for the

601
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,870
35 year old high school student, Baba Ayako!

602
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,320
Good work.

603
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,890
Our fake savior.
