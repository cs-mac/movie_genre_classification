what exactly are we doing here?

17
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,931
It's a very odd idea
to make a movie,

wonder why one is doing it.

Except that it's become

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,281
far more personal
as it's developed

24
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,789
into something which really is
about my work and about me.

25
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,541
And I think that
makes it more interesting

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,624

the good and the bad.

we're going to do,

194
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,665
And so we dragged him
to Kentucky

195
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,117
and they ended up
going through

this haze of alcohol
and drugs, madness,

197
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,257
and so they became part
of the story themselves.

202

no hope at all
of getting any.

203
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,187
Worse, I needed two sets.

204
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,566
One for myself
and another

205
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,738
for Ralph Steadman,

206
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,317
the English illustrator who was
coming all the way from London

207
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,198
to do some derby drawings.

208
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,793
All I knew about him was that this was
his first visit to the United States,

209
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,838
and the more I pondered that
fact, the more it gave me fear.

210
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,166
Would he bear up under
the heinous culture shock

211
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,842
of being lifted
out of London

212

and plunged into a drunken mob

213

each other, as it were.

Oh, God. Where is he?

215

00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,839
DEPP: So you're down on the
main floor playing blackjack

312
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,296
and the stakes
are getting high.

313
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,348
When suddenly
you chance to look up

314
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,301
and there,
right smack above your head,

315
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,227
is a half-naked
14-year-old girl

316
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,898
being chased through the air
by a snarling Wolverine,

317
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,941
which is suddenly
locked in a death battle

318
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,315
with two
silver-painted Polacks,

319
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,318
who come swinging down
from opposite balconies

320
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,697
and meet in mid-air
on the wolverine's neck.

321
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,919
STEADMAN: And no one had seen
anything like this before,

322
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,497
certainly not in
American illustration.

323
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,459
And the pictures really
weren't about the story,

324
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,546
but they were
a reflection of the story,

325
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,257
of what was
in Hunter's mind.

327

WENNER: The casino scene, with all
the lizards, the hitchhiker...

328
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:43,153
I mean, those things
just have a life of their own,

329
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,156
because they're accompanied
by all this literature with it

330
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,739
and whole stories that go
with each illustration,

331
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,998
or, uh, illustrations to
go with each story,

332
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,670
depending on which
point of view you take.

STEADMAN". I wanted to
get it out of my system.

334
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:08,133
It was something that was just
lying there waiting to erupt.

335
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,933
So it was a bit
like being sick.

STEADMAN: (LAUGHING)
I threw the pictures down

339
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,315
and they worked because they
were about something specific,

340
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,865
but they allowed me
a complete freedom to do...

341
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,237
It was as though
I was there.

Do you feel like your lack of
drug-taking ever affected,

345
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,258
had an effect on your
relationship with Hunter?

346
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,551
STEADMAN: No, no, in fact,
it was better that way.

347
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,300
It was better that we were
like chalk and cheese.

348
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,976
I mean, the whole idea of me being
like him would have been ridiculous.

349
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,974
Hunter, it's me!

350
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,399
STEADMAN: Because he was
someone entirely different.

351
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,353
We didn't necessarily
see eye to eye.

352
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:06,111
We had entirely different
experiences of life.

353
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,447
And to him I was weird,
and to me he was weird.

Nice to see you.

00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,184
Did you get that?

00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,355
Great.

363
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,480
(CHUCKLING) Oh, dear.
I like that one.

364
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,694
Well, this is
cartridge paper.

365
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,899
It's a good-quality,
very thick cartridge paper.

366
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,235
And, uh, this is Indian ink.
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,199
I like a brush...

368
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,576
For that kind of a stroke,

369
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,535
I couldn't have done it with
this one, for instance,

370
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,666
which is less weight.

371
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,340
But it might do something,
and it's lovely.

372
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,133
I love it,
what it does.

373
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,344
And I might do
another one down there.

374
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,012
And the way I flick, you just
simply have a flick of the wrist,

375
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:17,311
which is a sort of a proper
semicircle, in a way.

376
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,143
And then I've got
this here, you know,

377
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,943
and I could take
some of this and go...

378
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:31,154
Then I could, for instance...

379
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,989
An eye in there.

380
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:41,123
And I like the idea
of an eye in there

381
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:45,752
and a sense of some face
that's happening there.

382
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,549

DEPP: What are you
doing right now?

389
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,921
Well, I'm pulling away the gesso
from underneath the color.

390
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,965
I think perhaps, you know,
art is just tricks, really.

391
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,422
In a way, I don't know
what there is there.

392
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,598
I mean, it's only a...

393
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,596
it started out as a
blank sheet of paper

394
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,145
and it's become
more than that.

395
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,185
There's an event
going on in there.

396
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,766
DEPP'. Yeah.

397
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,769
STEADMAN:
That's rather nice.

398
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,938
Take Francis Bacon.

399
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:56,698
He always seemed to manage to make
his pictures look like an event,

400
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,826
even though they
were not necessarily

401
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,330
specifically of somebody.

402
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,161
But he brought
excitement into an area

403
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:10,250
that was apparently,
at first glance, nothing.

404
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,553
And I found that to be
pretty amazing, really.

405
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:20,305
Do you make any use of preliminary
studies or sketches of any sort?

406
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,806
Yes, I do.

407
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,063
But after that, chance and what
I call accident takes over,

408
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:33,740
when consciously I don't
know what I'm doing.

409
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,112
At that moment,
I'm thinking of nothing

410
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,913
but how hopeless and impossible
this thing is to achieve.

411
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:46,040
Suddenly there comes something
which your instinct seizes on

412
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,916
as being for
a moment the thing

413
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,123
by which it could
begin to develop.

414
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,303
What that is,
in fact, is stop-out.

415
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:05,263
If I blow more color
over that, then I rub it,

416
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,814
and it pulls this stuff
off with the color

417
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,312
and leaves the paper
still where it was.

418
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,024
So I'll just do this.

419
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,988
But also I'm worried about
going too far with that

420
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,448
and completely
losing it, you know.

421
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,578
DEPP: Sure.

422
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,534
I'd like to leave it
for a bit, I think.

423
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:40,465
The most, uh, enigmatic
and inquiring artist

424
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,517
that ever lived
would be Rembrandt,

425
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,810
who took it upon
himself to do

426
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,142
self-portrait
after self-portrait

427
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,019
in the process
of getting older.

428
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,487
It was the most
undecorative idea,

429
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,739
taking yourself

430
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,241
and watching
yourself grow old,

431
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:10,040
and give us an animation
of his aging

432
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:14,544
in beautiful paintings,
great self-portraits.

433
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:21,513
It was the most scintillating
intellectual exercise

434
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,431
that one could imagine.

435
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,855
(BLOWING)

436
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,862
(CONTINUES BLOWING)

437
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,872
Now what I'm gonna do is,

438
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,919
'cause on there, there's all
this lovely masking fluid,

439
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,371
and this is the only thing
that will take it off,

440
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,874
which is masking fluid gone solid.
DEPP: Mmm.

441
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,921
Ooh, what's
underneath there?

442
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,973
And this coming out now.
You're watching this?

443
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:13,516
Some sort of
substantial sort of...

444
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,983
DEPP: Wow.

445
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:20,357
...place exists
beyond the skyline.

446
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,532
I find this funny, because even
amongst all the great details,

447
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,283
there's precision
in your work,

448
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,410
but you're still very,
very playful.

449
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,207
Well, it's 'cause I'm
not very professional.

450
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,409
Ah.

451
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,496
STEADMAN: I don't go out of
my way to be professional.

452
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,832
I go out of my way to
try and make something

453
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:42,761
that, uh, is as unexpected to me
as it is to anyone else, you know?

454
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,463
That's perfect.

455
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,517
STEADMAN: I think,
most importantly,

456
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,941
Picasso has been the
biggest influence of all,

457
00:32:56,016 --> 00:33:02,444
because of his continuing
persistent creative daily life.

458
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,619
The way he made his life into the
reason for his living every day.

459
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,833
And it gave me a purpose, too,
in a strange kind of way,

460
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,661
and a sense of, "God, is there
anything on that piece of paper?"

461
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,621
"Anything can be there."

462
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:22,380
And Picasso proved it day after
day after day after day.

463
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,191
He convinced me that
the thing I can do is

464
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,190
simply start a drawing

465

going to come out completely,

a worthwhile pursuit.

If I knew what was going to
happen before I started,

the point of doing it?

was the blanket of heat.

was to go out

"We've failed.

in the harbor,

and Hunter's friendship

604
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,597
was that they saw kindred

difference was that

Hunter realized that Ralph
was crazier than him.

The reason I chose
Leonardo as a subject

720
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,548
was because of
something he said,

capacity for taking pains.

something of me in him,

of film diaries,

up with a drawing or some idea.

just fiddled with each one I did,

TERRY GILLIAM: The thing
about Ralph's work is

914
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,062
it was just the energy,
the anger,

915
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,398
the venom that
was just spewed out,

916
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,490
and that's what I loved.

917
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,880
I wish I'd had that kind of ability
to explode like Ralph does

918
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,252
and still control it
at the same time.

919
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,428
The problem with protest is
we were the protesters

920
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,808
and we got old
and we got tired.

921
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:18,438
We screamed and shouted and we did
change the world to some degree,

922
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:19,559
but not as much
as we'd like.

923
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,315
And that leads
to depression

924

of semi-impotence,

begins to just wear you down.

did make these changes

of people coming up

928

who are the beneficiaries of
a lot of the noise we made,

929
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,627
and they don't give a damn,
they don't give a toss.

930
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,957
They're into shopping.

to know what to do with this.

I don't think I can stop.

Thanksgiving Day,
November 28th, 1986.

Thanks for the wild turkey
and the passenger pigeons

938

939

through wholesome
American guts.

940
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,880
Thanks for a continent
to despoil and poison.

941
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:36,729
Thanks for Indians to provide a
modicum of challenge and danger.

942
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:43,902
Thanks for vast herds
of bison to kill and skin,

943
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,605
leaving
the carcasses to rot.

944
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,662
Thanks for bounties
on wolves and coyotes.

945
01:07:57,156 --> 01:08:01,252
Thanks for the American Dream
to vulgarize and falsify.

Like 1987, '88,
around then,

947
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:10,045
I was asked to do these records
with William Burroughs,

948
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:15,931
and that was so connected to
the world of Hunter and Ralph.

949
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:20,268
And, of course, Ralph adored
this when he heard it.

950
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,815
He liked the beginning
and the montage.

951
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,820
You know, it was all
these worlds meeting.

BURROUGHS: Thanks for "Kill
a Queer for Christ" stickers.

953
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,529
Thanks for laboratory AIDS.

954
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:42,411
Thanks for prohibition
and the war against drugs.

955
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,298
Thanks for
a country where nobody

956
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,343
is allowed to mind
his own business.

957

Thanks
for a nation of finks.

958
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,978
Yes, thanks for
all the memories.

and greatest betrayal

of the last and
greatest of human dreams.

STEADMAN:
One of the privileges

1007
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,762
working with Hunter
and William Burroughs was

1008
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,553
they were perverse
in many ways

1009
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,761
and yet incredibly honest.

1010
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,681
I think what
attracted me to them

1011
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:53,018
was the fact that
they were honest writers,

1012
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,023
writing about real things

1013

that they
actually experienced.

1014
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:02,153

they were journalist-writers.

01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,151
You know that, Hunter,
but it's been

1078
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:27,319
a fucking hard ride
for all sorts of reasons.

1079
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:28,741
Who do you wanna beat on?

1080
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,155
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1081
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,954
Hang on. I'm gonna
stop this thing now,

1082
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,994
'cause I can't
talk to you like this.

1083
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,375
Yeah, you get out of here.
What?

1084
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,828
I'm starting to feel queer.

1085
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,249
Oh, Christ.

1086
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,721
STEADMAN: He just realized
this was the death of fun.

1087
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,798
There was no more fun.

1088
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,355
And the idea of going into
an old people's home,

1089
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,313
Hunter S. Thompson in
an old people's home,

1090
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,813
can you imagine?

1091
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,733
(WHISTLING)

1092
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,492
And he said, "I can't bear
the idea, Ralph.

1093
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,741
"I've got this awful
image in my mind of

1094
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,495
"me sitting there
strapped into the wheelchair."

1095
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,617
(DEPP CHUCKLES) They'd
have to strap him in.

1096
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,747
Couldn't keep
him in it.

1097
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,828
They'd strap him
in the wheelchair.

1098
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,585
And he couldn't move.

1099
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,506
And he could see out of
the corner of his eye,

1100
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,676
there was an old crone

1101
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:32,096
and she was crawling
across the floor towards him,

1102
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,265
and he knew, instinctively,

1103
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:37,059
she was going to
fondle his balls.

1104
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,471
(SCREAMING)

1105
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,269
His wife, Anita, went
off to the health club

1106
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,480
and she rang and said,
"Hi, honey."

1107
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:52,533
And then there was
a certain faraway sound,

1108
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,987
as though she wasn't
necessarily up to the phone,

1109
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,199
when he put the gun in his
mouth and pulled the trigger.

1110
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,282
And that was it.

1111
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:03,620
Now, his son thought
he heard a book drop.

1112
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,796
'Cause it goes like that.

1113
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,131
Quite ironic, really,
when you think.

1114
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,925
Yeah.

1115
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,882
Yeah, well, it was kind
of that. He sort of...

1116
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,014
The way I... Same thing, the
way I came to terms with it

1117
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:22,142
was that this was
a man who dictated

1118
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,644
the way he was
gonna live his life.

1119
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,476
He was most certainly gonna
dictate the way he left.

1120
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,903
Yeah.
And he did, you know.

1121
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,025
He did exactly
that, yeah.

1122
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,105
So...

1123
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,445
It's sad, really.

1124
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:34,616
Very.

1125
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,919
STEADMAN". I did love Hunter

1126
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:49,124
and I miss him quite a lot.

1127
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,417
Uh...

1128
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,212
Rather a lot, actually.

1129
01:17:54,420 --> 01:18:00,393
Because he took away, when he
did what he did to himself,

1130
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,891
he took with him

1131
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:08,022
the raison d'étre for the
kind of work we did together.

1132
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,024
It wasn't gonna happen again.

1133
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:15,028
It was the finality of it

1134
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:20,159
that perhaps is the most
shocking part for me.

1135
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,576
Because that's what
happens to everything.

1136
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,707
It disappears eventually.

1137
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,636
JOE PETRO: A lot of people
want a piece of Ralph's art,

1138
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,722
and Ralph holds onto
most of his originals,

1139
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,932
because he just does
not want to let them go.

1140
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:53,981
And this way somebody can get a
piece of Ralph's original artwork.

1141
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:00,703
STEADMAN". Yeah, they are original.
Each one is an original.

1142
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:04,078
And each one's an original because
I sign each one separately

1143
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,169
and number it
out of an edition.

1144
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:09,829
So that becomes the edition,

1145
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:14,884
and the edition can be worth
quite a lot of money.

1146
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:41,619
PETRO: I'm a print maker
and we sell prints

1147
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:44,823
to, you know, Ralph's
collectors all over the world.

1148
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,220
STEADMAN: It gives me
a feeling of hope that,

1149
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,102
you know,
I can keep the original

1150
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,021
and I can still make money.

1151
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,904
But I don't think that
it's good for me, in a way.

1152
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:27,741
Because it
represses my spirit,

1153
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,748
my natural spirit,
to just do another drawing.

1154
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:35,627
And I think there's
something about that

1155
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:39,336
which perhaps I don't like,

1156
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:45,141
the idea that I'm not only
gonna sign this once

1157
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,933
and then maybe twice,

1158
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,728
or do the same drawing twice,

1159
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:53,649
I'm gonna sign 800 of them.

keeps Ralph alive.

(STEADMAN SIGHS)

1171
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:37,352
Uh, I don't know.
I'm feeling a bit down,

01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,404

It's partly to do with
getting older, you know.

You don't know how...
How long it goes on.

1177

And, I don't know, I woke up
in the middle of the night

1178
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,672
and needed
to go to the loo

1179
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:06,051
and felt...

1180
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:12,937
I don't know, I think I
felt slightly meaningless.

1181

(LAUGHS)

1182
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,850
That's the problem,
I find,

1183
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:21,608
that things are a little bit
on the meaningless side.

1184
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,574
And why was I ever bothered

1185
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,993
to do anything about it?
Sure.

1186

Why did I ever try
to change the world?

But it was, uh...

It was something to do, you
know, change the world.

DEPP: I left Ralph's
with my mind reeling from

1190
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:56,556
the sheer volume of
a lifetime's ideas and images,

1191
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:02,236
uplifted and inspired by an artist's
efforts to change the world.

1192
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,651
STEADMAN: Look, you
know, you've come here

1193
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:11,829
asking me this and asking me
that, asking me everything else.

1194
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,748
And as I go through things,
I suddenly realize

1195
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,042
I've done
too much in my life.

1196
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,916
Really, what was
the point of all that?

1197
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,872
There is no need
to do any more

1198
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,049
and yet I probably
may do some more,

1199

and I don't really
think it's a good idea

1200
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:31,424
because you become a polluter,
you know, a visual polluter.

1201
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,509
How about that?

1202
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,816
And I still haven't
proved that I'm an artist.

1203
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,279
Somehow I'm a cartoonist
to some, and that's...

commit to the impossible.
